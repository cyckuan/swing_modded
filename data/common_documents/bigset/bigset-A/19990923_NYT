YANKS WALK PAST WHITE SOX; STAY HALF-GAME AHEAD OF INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Chicago reliever Keith Foulke, pitching with a
two-run lead, began the eighth inning by striking out Derek Jeter
and Paul O'Neill, another disappointing loss to a sub-.500 team
seemed imminent for the New York Yankees. But they scored three
runs over the final two innings to defeat the White Sox, 5-4,
Wednesday night for the seventh time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which ended when Chicago's Jaime Navarro walked
Paul O'Neill with the bases loaded in the ninth, kept the Yankees
(92-59) one-half game ahead of the Cleveland Indians (92-60) in the
race for the best record in the American League and improved their
East Division lead over the Boston Red Sox to four games.
</P>
<P>
   The rally allowed Hideki Irabu to avoid his seventh loss. Irabu
showed up with poor stuff which enabled one of the American
League's softest lineups to put up power numbers. Chicago entered
ranked 10th in the league in home runs (150) but punched three out
of Yankee Stadium before Irabu made his exit in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With Foulke, who had not given up a run in his last 25 1-3
innings, throwing well, things looked grim late. But Bernie
Williams, who jump started the Yankees' current streak with his
grand slam in Toronto last week, came through again, singling to
keep the inning alive.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez followed with a line-drive double to the right
field corner, and then Chicago elected to intentionally walk Chili
Davis and take their chances against Jorge Posada, who had struck
out twice and hit into a double play in his previous three at bats.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy appeared to be a wise one when Posada swung and
missed badly on two pitches, but with the count full, he connected
for a single to center field that scored Williams and Martinez and
tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   With Navarro walking three batters in the ninth, the only
remaining heroism for the Yankees came from Chuck Knoblauch, who
beat out a bunt by diving head first into first base. Luis Sojo,
the first batter of the inning, had been walked and Jeter and
O'Neill also walked to end the game rather unceremoniously.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton, a rookie who used to play in the Yankees' farm
system, was Irabu's chief tormentor, blasting lead-off homers in
the second and fourth innings to record the first two-home run game
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing seven hits and three earned runs in 5 1-3 innings,
Irabu might have hurt his chances of landing on the Yankees'
postseason roster. Manager Joe Torre has said he will place 10
pitches on the roster, and the four starters _ Roger Clemens, David
Cone, Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez _ and first five
relievers are all but set.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Irabu is battling with relievers Jason Grimsley and
Ed Yarnell for the final spot.
</P>
<P>
   Torre talked before the game about the benefit of having a
regular starter in the bullpen to work in long relief if a starter
gets bombed early, which obviously works to Irabu's benefit. But
Yarnell has started in the past and, though Irabu's chances are
greater, could fulfill that role.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu surrendered his first two homers on curveballs that hung
like coats on a rack. Chicago's leadoff batter, Mike Caruso, a .258
hitter who entered the game with one home run, planted Irabu's
third pitch of the game into the right field bleachers. Within
seconds of the ball's clearing of the wall, boos rang out.
</P>
<P>
   After surviving a walk of Ray Durham to finish the rest of the
inning unscathed, Irabu offered up another fat curveball to the
first batter of the second. The jubilant recipient was the rookie
Chris Singleton, who sent the 2-2 pitch to almost the exact same
spot as Caruso had, for his 15th homer of the year. Singleton would
go on to torment Irabu again, creaming a high fastball in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were not as hard on the White Sox starter, Kip
Wells, a right-handed rookie with a 5.49 earned run average. They
went hitless over the first two innings, then allowed him to escape
danger relatively unharmed in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee began what could have been a big inning by opening
with a single, moving to third on a single by Derek Jeter and
scoring on a single by Paul O'Neill. The next batter, Bernie
Williams, walked to load the bases and set up an appetizing
situation for Tino Martinez. But Martinez grew antsy, swung at
Wells' first pitch and grounded out to second base.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry provided a bit of satisfaction for the fans by
opening the fourth with a solo homer, his second of the season, but
there was no follow-up for the Yankees.

HACKETT STILL HOLDING STRINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The supposed give-and-take relationship between USC coach Paul
Hackett and offensive coordinator Hue Jackson on play-calling
continues to be a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp, Hackett asserted that he would give more
freedom to Jackson, but Hackett called all the plays against San
Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reserve the right to call the plays,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Hackett let Jackson call the plays for
the final three quarters against Hawaii. The difference: The Hawaii
game was a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen against Oregon?
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said that although he envisions giving more
responsibility to Jackson, there probably would be no change in
plans for this week. He added that he and Jackson ``continue to
talk'' on the headsets and discuss plays, but he makes the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   There are not always benefits to being the person in charge.
Hackett was asked at the weekly Monday Morning quarterback meeting
why a pass was called in the fourth quarter when San Diego State's
Jermaine Watkins intercepted a Carson Palmer pass and returned the
ball for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next question,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he is looking forward to one day calling the plays,
something he has yearned to do for the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that's the case. I hope I've earned his respect,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Abdul-Shaheed punished: Defensive end Shamsud-Din
Abdul-Shaheed was scheduled to start against San Diego State but
was replaced by Matt Childers because he violated team rules.
Childers responded with six tackles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Welch returns: Offensive tackle Matt Welch returned to
practice Wednesday, but tests have not revealed the source of his
stomach pains. Welch, who thought he might have gallstones, said he
will play against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bring on the noise: Hackett has brought out loudspeakers in
practice for the second straight year to prepare for Oregon. He
said he wants to make sure the younger players are not shocked by
the atmosphere at Autzen Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I'm doing it is so when it starts to happen in
the game, it won't be something foreign,'' Hackett said. ``This
place is very loud. We jumped offsides too many times last year.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Man of Steele?: Linebacker Markus Steele tweaked his elbow
Wednesday, apparently aggravating an injury originally suffered in
training camp. Hackett said it will not affect him for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Kareem Kelly sat out practice to rest a stiff
back. Injured wide receiver Windrell Hayes (sprained ankle)
continues to improve, but Hackett said he doesn't think Hayes will
be ready by Saturday.

WORKPLACE BLUES: IF THE SHOE FITS... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IUNDATED: Ruminations from the work force:
</P>
<P>
   - Acknowledge my resume! Return my phone calls! Follow up and
tell me what's happened with the position!
</P>
<P>
   Popular demand requires continued harping on this. Human
resource departments _ or whoever is in charge of handling job
applications at organizations _ are frustrating, angering,
disillusioning and hurting job hunters.
</P>
<P>
   The individuals who work in HR may be compassionate and greatly
overworked. That's a defense but not an answer. Organizations MUST
do a better job of communicating with applicants. The collective
angst of job hunters who never hear back is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the applicant has no chance for the position, even if
15,000 applications are received, there MUST be mechanisms for
responding. The ripple effect in lousy public relations is
incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   There are many loud voices out in the job market saying such
things as: ``I will never work there or patronize there. How could
I when the place has such little regard for people?''
</P>
<P>
   No more excuses. Fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   - The National Institute of Mental Health says one worker in 20
is clinically depressed. Without diagnosis and treatment, depressed
people infect their workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of depression _ including burnout, negativity, lack
of motivation, disinterest and production decline _ do great damage
to workplace relationships, through no intentional fault of the
sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers often lack the ability to diagnose or deal with the
depressed person's illness. And most employee assistance programs _
if in existence at all _ aren't very good at stepping in with a
rescue, partly because employee rights of privacy and
confidentiality sometimes make it difficult to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds true with such personal problems as alcoholism,
anorexia or bulimia, drug abuse or severe obesity. There's a fine
line between personal privacy and the effects that mental or
physical illnesses have on the work group.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations need to have staff expertise, or contracted access
to experts, to properly identify and offer treatment to sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   - What's all this talk about pay for performance? Executives and
salespeople may be benefiting, but huge hunks of the work force are
mystified.
</P>
<P>
   The mass of workers who get straight wages or salaries and
modest annual raises _ just enough to stay ahead of inflation _
aren't in jobs where performance is adequately measured or
rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fortunate to work at organizations with gain- or
profit-sharing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Others are rewarded for top performance by being handed more to
do.
</P>
<P>
   - There doesn't appear to be a fashion trend of wearing only one
shoe to work. But have you noticed the footwear littering the
streets?
</P>
<P>
   My daily commute is punctuated by a sneaker in the gutter here,
a dainty black pump on the yellow line there. It's not a new thing;
there have been shoes in the streets for years. It's still curious.
</P>
<P>
   Are they falling out of cars? Carried off by possums from
people's patios? And where are their mates?

OPEN-BOARDING PLAN AT KANSAS CITY CASINOS IS PUSHED BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Snow may be falling in Kansas City before
casino gamblers here experience open boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph G. Biele Jr., director of enforcement for the Missouri
Gaming Commission, said Wednesday that the casinos' timetables for
rewriting computer software programs to accommodate the change have
pushed the target date to Nov. 1 ``at the earliest.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time there was optimism that open boarding could be in
place this month.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mullally, deputy director of the Missouri Gaming
Commission, said some Kansas City casinos were encountering more
delays than expected in ramping up for the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to do it right rather than too soon,'' Mullally
said. The stakes are high. If there are problems, Mullally said,
``We'll look at going back to boarding restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats in the St. Louis and Caruthersville markets made the
switch last month under a pilot program that is to be expanded to
Kansas City and St. Joseph. If there are no problems, the change
will be made permanent next year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect has been dramatic on the eastern side of the state
after 30 days of open boarding. According to Gaming Commission
figures that accounted for routine market growth, admissions jumped
45 percent from the same period last year while gross revenue was
up 10 percent to $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Open boarding also appears to have reversed declining attendance
and revenue trends at two long-struggling eastern Missouri boats,
the President in St. Louis and Casino Aztar in Caruthersville.
</P>
<P>
   Abolition of restrictive boarding times has long been an
industry goal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, Missouri casinos could let customers board
only during the first 45 minutes of each two-hour ``cruise''
session. That can leave customers waiting up to 75 minutes for the
next phantom departure.
</P>
<P>
   The change to open boarding has been vastly complicated by the
need to continue enforcement of the state's $500 loss limit. That
rule restricts patrons to the purchase of no more than $500 in
chips or gambling tokens during each two-hour cruise.
</P>
<P>
   At most casinos, monitoring is done by computers that track
individual players' buy-ins and betting through personalized
electronic swipe cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some computer issues with the tracking system,''
said John V. Finamore, Midwest president for Station Casinos Inc.
The current software snag affects Station, Argosy Riverside and St.
Jo Frontier casinos, which all use the same software firm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Biele said the change in Kansas City would not occur until all
casinos were ready.

HUNT FOR ESCAPED CHILD KILLER EXTENDS INTO ITS SECOND DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COUNCIL GROVE, Kan. _ A convicted child killer remained at large
Wednesday, as authorities checked out leads and nervous residents
stayed behind locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   As the manhunt for 24-year-old Scott Adam moved into its second
day, about 30 officers from the Morris County Sheriff's Department,
the Kansas Highway Patrol and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation
combed rural areas while helicopters and an airplane flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are checking into everything that comes into the office,''
said Morris County Sheriff R.J. Meierhoff.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Adam, of Council Grove, should be regarded as
armed and dangerous, and they warned residents not to approach him.
</P>
<P>
   Only four hours after he was sentenced to more than 41 years in
prison for the second-degree murder of 16-month-old Timothy Post,
his girlfriend's son, Adam scaled a 10-foot chain-link fence topped
with razor wire and escaped from the small recreation area behind
the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Meierhoff said prisoners usually are watched by a deputy while
they are in the recreation compound, but Tuesday there was no one
guarding Adam and another prisoner, a trusty, who also was in the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the process of dispatching units to an accident, so
it was a little lax then,'' Meierhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said Adam was out of the fenced area only two or
three minutes before his escape was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll follow policy a little closer,'' the sheriff said,
saying there would be an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they thought Adam escaped without any outside
help.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica McAuley Post, who is Adam's girlfriend and Timothy's
mother, visited Adam in the sheriff's visitation room shortly
before the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Meierhoff said Post had been eliminated as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   During his 14-year law-enforcement career in Council Grove, the
sheriff said, there had been only two other escapes.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, inmates bolted through open doors and were
captured later. Meierhoff predicted Adam would be captured too.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's escape still was the No. 1 topic of conversation in
Council Grove on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county is upset, excited and scared,'' said Don McNeal at
the Council Grove Republican, the town's daily newspaper. ``You're
hearing all kinds of stories this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the escape, residents said, they were making sure all
their doors were securely locked.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Baker at the town's Chamber of Commerce and visitor
headquarters noted that hundreds of visitors were beginning to pour
into Council Grove for a Santa Fe Trail Association symposium that
begins Thursday and runs through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And a historical pageant on Friday and Saturday is expected to
draw 1,200 people each night.
</P>
<P>
   The events' promoters ``thought of everything, but they didn't
think of this,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ritz Video store, owner Davy Picolet said his business
fell off by 50 percent when word of the escape began to circulate
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was out and about or sending the kids in for movies,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were quick to report suspicious situations, and
authorities moved quickly to check on them throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see something that doesn't look right, they call the
sheriff,'' said Special Agent Scott Teeselink of the Kansas Bureau
of Investigation. ``That's what we want them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said dozens of leads had been checked, but none had brought
the searchers closer to finding Adam.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, tracking dogs had picked up a trail believed to
be Adam's, but they lost it. Rested tracking dogs were brought to
Morris County on Wednesday to continue the search.
</P>
<P>
   Teeselink said the manhunt is being conducted in all parts of
the county.
</P>
<P>
   With nighttime temperatures dropping into the mid-40's Tuesday
night, authorities said, it would be difficult for Adam to go
without shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like on TV,'' Teeselink said. ``You're cold, you're
tired and you're hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more miserable it is out there for them and us, the
quicker it is they have a tendency to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   By noon Wednesday, Matt Oleen, the Morris County attorney, had
filed an aggravated-escape charge that could add up to 20 more
months to Adam's sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Oleen said Adam's decision to escape might have been prompted by
the longer-than-expected sentence he received on the second-degree
murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Platt of Junction City elected to double the
state-prescribed sentence to 500 months on Tuesday, a sentence that
would keep Adam in prison for at least 35 1/2 years before being
eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious he wasn't too pleased with the sentence
that was handed down,'' Oleen said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the harsher sentence was justified because of the
vulnerability of the young victim.
</P>
<P>
   Experts testified at Adam's preliminary hearing last year that
Timothy died Oct. 22, 1998, in his Council Grove home after
suffering brain swelling caused by violent shaking.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to police and in KBI interviews, Adam said he had
treated the boy roughly on several occasions, including Oct. 21
when he had been left alone with Timothy and the boy's two sisters,
ages 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Adam was charged with first-degree murder and felony
child abuse, but he later pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Adam had a previous second-degree murder conviction stemming
from the 1993 stabbing death of a 19-year-old Kansas State
University student from Junction City.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Supreme Court in 1995 said Adam didn't receive a fair
trial because of faulty instructions to the jury. At a second trial
he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter; he was paroled a
short time later.

SHANIA TWAIN IS TOP COUNTRY MUSIC ENTERTAINER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn _ With tears in her eyes, Shania Twain accepted
the honor for Entertainer of the Year Wednesday night at the 33rd
annual Country Music Associations Awards at the Grand Ole Opry. It
was her first award from the association, despite being nominated
seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shania, that ought to shut everybody up, you did it baby,''
said Vince Gill, the affable singer who spent his eighth year as
host of the program, which was broadcast on CBS. It was Ms. Twain's
first music association award.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks, with its second album currently at the top of
the pop charts, were Wednesday night's other success story, winning
three of the four awards for which the group was nominated: vocal
group of the year, single of the year and music video of the year.
Nominated in five of tonight's 12 award categories, Tim McGraw won
in just two: male vocalist of the year and album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The awards show came at a time when the country music industry
is at a difficult fork in the road, staring on one side at proud
isolation and on the other at compromising tradition in order to
open itself up to a larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   This dilemma played itself out during the program when a singer
and guitarist, Alan Jackson, stopped playing ``Pop a Top'' to
perform an excerpt from ``Choices'' by George Jones. Jones withdrew
from the show when he was asked to cut in half his performance of
``Choices,'' which was nominated for single of the year. Jackson
was promptly shooed off the stage when he started singing the
single.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read to the press by a spokeswoman after the
performance, Jackson talked of visiting George Jones in the
hospital while Jones was recuperating from a near-fatal car crash
earlier in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had George Jones died, there would have been a 10-minute
tribute, but he lived and they wouldn't give him 3 minutes on the
show,'' the spokeswoman read.
</P>
<P>
   In a further attempt to improve its ratings (the show suffered
one of its worst years on television last year) at the expense of
its reputation among traditionalists, organizers booked two
noncountry acts. Teeny-bopper boy band `N Sync joined Alabama to
sing ``God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You'' to delighted
squeals from audience members. And Jewel joined Merle Haggard to
sing ``That's the Way Love Goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding further controversy, before the show, Mike Curb, the
president of Curb Records, resigned from the committee in charge of
selecting the show's performers, saying members were acting in
their own self-interest and trying to promote acts affiliated with
record labels they are involved in.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, after winning an award for vocal event of the year for his
duet ``My Kind of Woman/My Kind of Man'' with Patty Loveless,
received a large round of applause after reminding the audience not
to lose sight of its roots. Inducted into the Country Music Hall of
Fame during the awards show were Johnny Bond, the singer and
songwriter who died in 1978; Conway Twitty, who died in 1993; and
Dolly Parton, who sang twice during the show, joking ``I'm no Patty
Loveless but you're no Porter Wagoner'' after performing ``My Kind
of Woman'' with Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Other significant awards went to Martina McBride, who bested
Faith Hill and Shania Twain for female vocalist of the year. Less
of a surprise was Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn winning, for their
eighth consecutive year, vocal duo of the year. Jo Dee Messina
walked away with the horizon award presented to newer artists.

BIOETHICS CENTER HELPING CLERGY MINISTER TO THE DYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Years ago, Rabbi Israel Kestenbaum of New
York made an extremely uncomfortable visit to a woman in his
congregation who was dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering woman asked him, ``Rabbi, where is God now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no response,'' Kestenbaum recalled. ``I felt helpless. I
felt empty...(as if I were) rendered a phony, a fake.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling of helplessness in the face of death is remarkably
common among clergy of every faith. And it's a mindset that the
Midwest Bioethics Center is working to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Kansas City-based center invited members of
the area's clergy to hear Kestenbaum and others discuss how better
to incorporate the needs of the dying into their ministries.
</P>
<P>
   The Bioethics Center had expected about 250 people for the
conference at Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral. More than 400 came.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was a first step toward Compassion Sabbath Weekend,
an event the Bioethics Center plans for Feb. 4 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that during those days, 80,000 people in more than
500 Kansas City area congregations of all faiths will hear sermons,
attend Sunday school classes and hold discussions on issues
involving death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same number of people who go to Arrowhead Stadium to pay
attention to the Chiefs will be paying attention to this absolutely
fundamental question of life and death,'' said the Rev. Robert Lee
Hill, pastor of Community Christian Church and co-chairman of the
Bioethics Center's Compassion Sabbath task force.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, Hill said, is to make Compassion Sabbath
Weekend an annual event in communities across the country. The
Bioethics Center already has heard from interested clergy in
Baltimore and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anticipating not just launching Compassion Sabbath
Weekend 2000 but a national Compassion Sabbath Weekend 2001,'' Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest Bioethics Center has been a national leader in
promoting good care for dying patients among hospitals, nursing
homes and medical professionals. Compassion Sabbath Weekend is part
of a three-year initiative by the center to broaden discussion
beyond the medical community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give (clergy) information, an opportunity to
reflect on their responsibilities and duties,'' said the Bioethics
Center's president, Myra Christopher. ``They honestly told us they
did not have the education or the training.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the more than 350 local faith leaders who
answered a recent Bioethics Center survey said they were not doing
an effective job ministering to the dying. And only 18 percent
thought their congregations effectively served the needs of
seriously ill or dying members.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Wednesday included workshops on how to hold caring
conversations with dying people and their families, work with
children facing death and use religious rituals effectively.
Additional sessions are planned this fall for congregational
program directors and parish nurses.
</P>
<P>
   The workshops have been designed to apply to members of all
religions, said Compassion Sabbath task force co-chairman, the Rev.
Kelvin T. Calloway of Trinity AME Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``No faith perspective is being imposed on anyone here,''
Calloway said. ``We're challenging them to address these issues
from their own perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith communities have much to offer dying people, particularly
those who spend their final days alone in hospitals, said Martin
Marty, a theologian at the University of Chicago, who delivered the
conference's keynote address.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything we're learning, it's about people's desire
to die in community,'' Marty said. ``It's a luxury. Most people
don't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   And clergy still can comfort dying people who feel abandoned by
God, said Kestenbaum, who trains chaplains at the Jewish Institute
for Pastoral Care.
</P>
<P>
   The job of the pastor is not to deliver words of wisdom to dying
people but simply to sit with them in reverence and allow them to
express themselves, Kestenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they know God is with them? When we mirror for them
the God that is in them,'' Kestenbaum said. ``That's a pretty
awesome task.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a task clergy must shoulder, said Valerie Yancey, a
critical-care nurse at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, who
spoke at the conference about her family's struggle as her first
husband died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the keeper of the culture's rituals with death,''
Yancey said. ``These rituals are extraordinarily important to me
now. I understand them at a visceral level. And I'm extremely
grateful to those who do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clergy should not be reluctant to enter hospitals, she said.
``Go in. Assert yourself. Be with the family.''

50 TOP-GROSSING MOVIES CONTAINED 2,300 ACTS OF VIOLENCE, STUDY
FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It may not be news that movies and television are
violent, but a new study details just how much of a punch _ or
shooting, rape or kidnapping _ the entertainment industry packs
into its products.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who watched all 50 of last year's top-grossing films,
which included ``Saving Private Ryan,'' saw more than 2,300 acts of
violence, with more than half of them ``serious,'' according to a
new study from the Center for Media and Public Affairs, based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   TV programming, both network and cable, averaged six scenes of
serious violence per episode of fiction series, noted the report,
which was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence was not only a staple of popular entertainment, it
was often portrayed as a laudable, necessary or relatively harmless
activity,'' said S. Robert Lichter, the center's president.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that most movies and TV series failed to show
the physical or emotional harm that would result from serious
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when violence, particularly acts both aimed at or
perpetrated by young people, has occurred with alarming frequency,
the study probably will become ammunition in the latest series of
culture wars.
</P>
<P>
   In July, several members of Congress and a roster of luminaries
made ``An Appeal to Hollywood,'' urging entertainment industry
leaders to voluntarily reduce the level of violence in movies,
music, television and videos.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the organizers, Sens. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican,
and Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, accompanied Lichter
at the news conference Wednesday. Both welcomed the report in hopes
that it would buttress their case, because they said their attempts
to ``appeal'' to industry executives have been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want a safer, saner culture,'' Lieberman said, ``we've
got to clearly and loudly ask the people who shape it, `How many
more kids must we slaughter before we wake up to our shared
responsibility to protect them from harmful influences on-screen
and off?'''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the study found music videos and feature films averaged a
scene of serious violence every four minutes, Brownback said: ``If
you're not getting enough of it, just wait four minutes. There'll
be another one.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America, the
movie industry's trade group, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lichter said the report was an attempt to do a ``broad
snapshot'' of the entertainment industry. He said they studied 500
products, including two episodes of every TV series, 50 TV movies,
50 feature films and nearly 200 music videos.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a critically acclaimed film
that depicted the horrors of war, topped the chart of most violent
movies, Lichter said it was an example of the exception that proved
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get rid of the `Private Ryan's. You don't
want to throw the baby out with the bath water,'' he said. ``But
that bath water is getting pretty toxic.''

SUNS, D-BACKS MERGER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NENA BAKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks into one huge corporation _ the
Sunsdiamondbacks, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Combining separate franchises into one mega-sports company is
the latest fad among sports moguls because it gives them the muscle
of a power hitter _ not to mention the finesse of a point guard _
in negotiating broadcast and naming rights deals, streamlining
overhead and even starting up their own sports broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it adds value in an era where the key to successful
sports franchises isn't in ticket sales but media revenues.
</P>
<P>
   And this option, called bundling, is one that Colangelo, whose
Diamondbacks face mountainous debt tied to the franchise start-up,
said he has started to explore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering a new world with a different landscape for
franchise ownership and financing,'' he said. &QL; 
OWNERSHIP MODEL OF FUTURE &QL; 
Analysts describe the concept of combining franchises into one
business as the ownership model of the future. And they point out
that Colangelo, the general managing partner of the Diamondbacks
and president of the Suns, likes to stay ahead of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about building sports conglomerates from the ground floor
up, rather than a conglomerate buying a sports franchise and
fitting it into the conglomerate,'' said Dean Bonham, president of
the Bonham Group, a Denver-based sports-business consulting firm.
``I don't purport to know (Colangelo's) private business, but I
would be shocked if that discussion has not been going on in
Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   If Colangelo did pursue the option of bundling the teams, his
partners in both ventures would have to agree, analysts pointed
out. Colangelo is the majority owner of the Suns, but he owns about
1 percent of the Diamondbacks. &QL; 
IT'S WORKED ELSEWHERE &QL; 
A few teams, however, have already worked out the fine print, with
interesting results.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Tom Hicks has brought the Rangers and the Stars under
one corporate roof as part of a larger business plan that includes
a new cable channel devoted, in large part, to the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, the merger of the Yankees and the Nets is
on track to close within a week, said Howard Rubenstein, a
spokesman for Yankeenets, the new entity.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein said the reason for the combination is simple:
Together, the teams have a powerful potential in a number of
revenue-producing areas, including TV deals, new arena and stadium
rights, the formation of an entertainment company and the creation
of new business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put together a baseball team and a basketball team
providing year-round premier entertainment, then you can offer a
viable threat to any local regional sports channel if you don't get
a good price for your programming,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a
professor of economics at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who
specializes in the business of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of bundling is that by combining two entities,
an owner might be able to negotiate better credit rates and expand
the business' borrowing capacity as opposed to two teams left to
their own devices, said Randy Vataha, president of Game Plan LLC, a
Boston investment banking firm that specializes in sports. &QL; 
`FUTURE SHOCK OF SPORTS' &QL; 
Bundling teams also creates a better opportunity for a public
offering, Vataha said. That appears to be the direction Yankeenets
is heading, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a business combination between the Diamondbacks
and the Suns would likely include affiliated concerns such as the
Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League, the WNBA's Phoenix
Mercury and perhaps even the company that runs America West Arena,
which would help enhance the value in the case of a public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the future shock of sports: Within the next five to 10
years, it's going to be hard to run a team without figuring out
some way to become your own Rupert Murdoch,'' said Andy Appleby,
president of GeneralSports and Entertainment, a Rochester,
Minn.-based company specializing in sports marketing and
management.
</P>
<P>
   How seriously Colangelo is considering the option of bundling he
wouldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to reports in the trade press, he insisted he is
not looking for an outside equity investor who can help his
baseball club stay ahead of bill collectors.
</P>
<P>
   His recent cash call to the team's limited partners does not
signal an emergency, he said. The cash call resulted in an infusion
of $24 million that Colangelo said would be used to meet
operational costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any urgency,'' he said. ``This call I had on the
partners could have been done over a period of time, but I chose to
do it all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Early expenses for the Diamondbacks have been daunting. Although
taxpayers paid $238 million of the cost of Bank One Ballpark, the
team was responsible for an additional $117 million. In addition,
the Diamondbacks had to pay a Major League expansion fee of $130
million, and other start-up costs added $100 million more to the
cost. &QL; 
DIFFERENT STORIES &QL; 
On the field, the star power that has driven the team to the top of
the National League West in just its second year came with a dear
price. This year's payroll amounts to $65.9 million, although $20
million of that is deferred until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, however, are a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo and a group of investors bought the team in 1987 for
$44.5 million. Players salaries for this year are estimated to be
in the $35 million to $40 million range, and the Suns continue to
pay down debts associated with the team's $54 million contribution
to the building costs of America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But where the Suns are concerned, Colangelo said, it's evident
from his discussions with financiers that the franchise has a
healthy market value: about $300 million to $350 million, by his
estimation.
</P>
<P>
   For Colangelo, the question then becomes, ``Do you do something
with one (team) rather than bundling?''. &QL; 
STUDYING HIS OPTIONS &QL; 
Colangelo said he doesn't expect to make any decisions until he
sees how the Diamondbacks' books look after another year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Colangelo insists he's content to study his options,
which, he says, include selling outright. After all, he said, he's
59, soon to be 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look to our landscape, I have to make some decisions
going forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to have any persuasions about when I'm
going to do something. It's a matter of education, and listening to
people whispering sweet lovelies in my ear.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR VENTURA, THE CHANCE IS THE THING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Mets came to Atlanta full of spit and vinegar,
convinced they had what it took to win two of three games from
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Tuesday's 2-1 loss in Game 1, the Mets' clubhouse was
relatively upbeat. They had played tough, pitched well, but Atlanta
had played better and won.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday night's 5-2 loss, the Mets' mood was a bit more
somber, as if certain reality had been confirmed. The Mets cannot
beat Atlanta in Atlanta. Even with Atlanta's injuries and the Mets'
$164 million improvement, the gap remains.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura mirrors the Mets' futility. For most of the season
Ventura has been the Mets' quiet heartbeat. But against Atlanta,
Ventura, like his team, has been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Low-key, unassuming, a kindred spirit with his infield soulmate
John Olerud, a contrast to Edgardo Alfonzo and Rey Ordonez at
short. The mild-mannered third baseman stays out of the limelight
and allows his performance to do his talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I know, and I'm fine with it,'' Ventura said,
before the Mets' 5-2 loss on Wednesday night. ``You can go and do
crazy things like Dennis Rodman does. But this is just the way I
am. John Olerud's the same way: you just go and play, go home and
come back the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has been a National League player of the week this
season, and he became the first player in major league history to
hit a grand slam in each game of a doubleheader, on May 20 against
Milwaukee. In his 59 games before Wednesday night's he was hitting
.355 with 14 home runs and 49 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Ventura has been part of what may be the best
infield defense in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Ventura was focused on the big picture of this
season, not whether the Mets would catch or pass Atlanta and win
the division. The big picture for a 32-year-old veteran is savoring
a moment that doesn't often come around.
</P>
<P>
   In nine seasons with the Chicago White Sox, Ventura played in
one American League Championship Series. After that 1993 season,
Chicago was in a perpetual rebuilding mode and Ventura spent much
of his time breaking in young players and new faces, and adjusting
to new management teams and styles that ended in the same dismal
result.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months, Ventura has enjoyed one of the most
exhilarating times of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still being in this position when you've not been in this
position for this long,'' Ventura said. ``It's still fun; you're
not making plans to go home. It's fun coming to the park not
knowing what's going to happen. That's what makes it a lot of fun
for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, along with Rickey Henderson, has given the Mets a
consistency that has been reflected in their performance since the
All-Star Game break. The Mets have played 20 series and have won
18. They have won them by three games to one, two games to one;
they have never swept a team and have never been swept.
</P>
<P>
   While everything else is splendid, Ventura's problem is also the
Mets' problem: they both have trouble with Atlanta. The team and
the player have had nightmares against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Ventura has managed just 3 singles in 24 at-bats
with 10 strikeouts against Braves pitching. Last July 4 at Shea
Stadium, he bunted with runners on first and second and no outs. On
Tuesday he was 0 for 3 against John Smoltz. On Wednesday night he
was 1 for 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this team over all is made up where two guys are
going to do it or one guy is going to do it,'' Ventura said.
``Everybody has to pitch in for us to win, and I don't see that
changing now. It's going to take a total team effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep playing, and hopefully it turns around.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teams hope. Other teams make it happen. The Mets are in
transition between hoping and making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about the urgency of this moment or the next
week, Ventura said he learned from playing with the White Sox to
have fun with a positive experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then you could tell,'' he said, ``by talking with the
people who had been there, that every year is different, and if you
win you don't treat it like it's going to happen forever, even
though you try to feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ventura silently savors the moments, good and bad. ``You
learn to appreciate what you're going through and just have fun
with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets caught up in the `I'm going to get my heart
broken' thing. But I'd rather have it broken than have it already
squashed.'' &QL;

THURSDAY BRINGS ALDA,
 BEVY OF BEAUTIFUL TEENS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service

 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  UNDATED - The fall television season
is upon us. Republic TV critic Bill Goodykoontz is taking a look at
the good, the bad and the soon to be canceled. Remember the
Seinfeld episode where Jerry's landlord installed low-flow shower
heads? And Jerry and Kramer spent much of the broadcast with flat
hair?
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's an apt way to talk about Thursday night television. We're
still musing about Seinfeld; otherwise, things have fallen flat.
</P>
<P>
   Must-see TV? Hardly. This is Amer ica. You can watch whatever
you want.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, NBC learned to live without Jerry and his pals. It
still dominated the night, with ER re maining the most popular show
on television. But NBC lost 14 percent of its viewers _ a
development calamitous enough to send Dr. Ben ton scurrying for his
scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ER is undergoing a little augmentation surgery in an
attempt to win back some viewers. Signing Alan Alda to play a
doctor again, even if it's just for a few episodes, smacks more of
desperation than inspiration. And last season's scripts were so
weak that it'll take a mighty effort to persuade straying viewers
to return.
</P>
<P>
   Pair that with a lousy season for Frasier and Thursday nights
are wide open.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the other networks do? Seize the moment by bringing
out the big guns, their best-and-brightest new shows? Catch a whiff
of fear in the air blowing from NBC's way and pounce?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. With the exception of Fox, which has already premiered the
excellent Action, the networks are pretty much shooting air balls.
They seem intent on simply trying to out-program NBC. Forget
quality, let's just give the people what they haven't got in the
hope that they'll tune in for something different. They'll watch
it. I mean, come on, the morons watched Jesse last sea son, didn't
they?
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, a look at what's new on Thursday nights:
</P>
<P>
   Popular: Other than the previously reviewed Action, the best of
the new Thursday lot. Yet another WB hour long drama about _
surprise, sur prise, surprise! as Gomer Pyle used to say _
beautiful teenagers and their high school misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   Carly Pope stars as the leader of the unpopular kids. This being
the WB, she is, naturally, drop-dead gorgeous. So is Leslie Bibb,
who plays the queen of the popular kids.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so stupid, and the pilot does get off to a slow,
predictable start. But there are nice twists _ the girls' single
parents get engaged, for in stance, spawning the possibility of a
bizarro-world Brady Bunch. But Popular's secret weapon is Sara Rue.
She plays an outsider and would-be cheerleader who is, to put it
bluntly, fat. She brings a heartwarming grace and dignity to the
role that will leave you cheering for her.
</P>

   World Wrestling Federation Smack down!: Finally, another network
makes an appeal to the erudite, Frasier-loving viewers who enjoy
tea, crumpets and . . . oops. Wrong show. We all know who this
appeals to: Young male viewers who enjoy watching overgrown
glandular cases jump up and down on each other, while occasionally
setting each oth er's hair on fire.
</P>
<P>
   No one even has to ask if it's real anymore _ head honcho (and
some time wrestler himself) Vince McMa hon actually sounded
offended this summer when asked if anyone be lieved it was real
wrestling. It's not. It's a soap opera for the tattooed Camaro set.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre thing is that the acting here is as good as anything
on Veronica's Closet. The stories are better, too. (Please note
fantastic restraint shown in not making a Kirstie Alley joke.)
</P>
<P>
   Wasteland: You know Kevin Wil liamson as the creator of Dawson's

remem ber him as the creator of this talky dud about young
beautiful people (what else?) in New York.

   ``I'm 26 today and profoundly lost as a human being,'' one of
the lead characters says. ``I've spent my entire life in school, my
parents still support me, human relationships baffle me and I am
acutely self-aware to the point where I'm clueless and slightly
suicidal.''
</P>
<P>
   Just screams, ``Watch me!'' doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The quick answer: No.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first anniversary of Cookie Jacobson's disappearance comes
and goes; the TV cameras come and go from the street where she
lived; her picture comes and goes from the front page of the
newspaper, and . . . what?
</P>
<P>
   Cookie's two teenagers, who admit stuffing their mother's body
in a trash bin, go merrily on with high school? And Cookie's
husband, who supports the kids, remains in the neighborhood of
make-believe? While poor Cookie _ hauled off to a compacting plant,
shredded, squeezed into a dump truck and deposited in a landfill _
crumbles?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   For you and me, this is no problem. The media dispenses
tragedies like chewing gum. Like candy bars. Like cookies. We pay
our 50 cents. Pull. Unwrap. Read. Dispose. Confident that our
favorite news machine's supply of catastrophe and misfortune will
be replenished overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like that for cops.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who've spent the last year going over the details
of Cook ie's life and her disappearance strug gle every day.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear the frustra tion in the words of Tempe
police Detective Al Reed, quoted in the Republic on Sept. 21st.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's human nature that we don't keep secrets,'' he said.
``It's human nature that we tell people what we've done, good or
bad. We want people who know what happened to Cookie Jacobson to
come forward. We're appealing to their sense of right and wrong and
justice.'' &QL; 
LESS THAN TRUTHFUL
</P>
<P>
   When Cookie disappeared from her home last September, her
16-year-old son, Aaron, and 13-year-old daugh ter, Laura, said
they'd last seen their mother working at the computer that morning.
</P>
<P>
   They said she'd been nagging them for being late to school.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Laura told a TV reporter, ``I think maybe she'll come
back. Maybe she'll be there tomorrow when I get home from school.''
Aaron, in turn, spoke of feeling helpless ``because we don't know
what's going on.``
</P>
<P>
   But they did.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie vanished wearing only a pajama top. No wallet. No keys.
No car.
</P>
<P>
   After a less than stellar performance on a polygraph test, Aaron
said he'd found his mother dead in her bed room and asked his
sister to dispose of the body because he was afraid they'd be
blamed for her death.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported a friend's claim that Aaron tried once to
poison his mother, and to cut the brake lines of her car. Another
friend reportedly told police that Aaron said he wasn't concerned
about his mom's disap pearance because ``I didn't like her very
much anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe police briefly arrested the kids, but had to release them.
The city sent 18 specially trained officers to a landfill south of
Phoenix to search for Cookie's remains. They came up empty.
OFFICERS OPTIMISTIC
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe they have a crime, but they have no body.
They can't prove how Cookie died, or even if she died.
</P>
<P>
   They're stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Though I don't understand why. To me, ditching your mother's
corpse in a dumpster should get you life. Our screwed-up justice
system apparently holds a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to solve it,'' Tempe Sgt. Dave Lind told
me Wednesday. ``We've been getting calls. We really believe there
are people out there who know some thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They suspect Aaron and Laura may have said something about the
case to other kids. But those kids aren't talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Lind said, ``when some of their parents are
saying, `Don't talk to the cops.' A lot of people are going to be
shocked once they can read the report. Unfortunately, we've got to
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   ``Time's on our side,'' Sgt. Lind said, ``not theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   And not Cookie's, whose bones and legacy turn to dust.
</P>
<P>
   And time's definitely not on the side of some local parent whose
boy or girl happens to meet one of Cookie's kids at school, at a
party, at the mall, and asks, since no charges have been filed, if
it's OK to date. E.J. Montini can be reached at (602) 444-8978 or

WALK-ON FRESHMAN WINS BRUINS KICKING JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's list of questions and concerns entering the
season was long enough to fill a chalkboard. The Bruins had no
proven quarterback. They had an inexperienced offensive line, a
young defensive line and a makeshift secondary. Their top receiver
was hurt. They had no punter and no kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Three games later, all the concerns remain _ all except the
kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Chris Griffith, who has no scholarship and no
experience, has replaced departed kicker Chris Sailer with
surprising ease. Although he hasn't kicked under pressure _ or
attempted a field goal longer than 37 yards _ Griffith has made 5
of 5 field goals and 10 of 10 extra points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was scared to death coming into his first game, but hitting
that first field goal really calmed him down,'' Bruins kicking
coach Bob Field said. ``We're not surprised he's doing well. He
kicked very well in practice last year. Even for a freshman, his
percentages were excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris doesn't have tremendous leg strength, although he has
plenty to be a good college kicker. But his strength is his
accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith never expected to be a college kicker. He played
quarterback and defensive back at Douglas High in Gardnerville,
Nev., and punted and kicked on the side. On UCLA's recruiting
questionnaire, he didn't even write kicker. Only when a scheduling
conflict prevented him from attending the Bruins' position camp in
June 1998 did he enroll in their kicking camp later that summer.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA didn't offer a scholarship, but it welcomed Griffith, whose
family is from Orange County, to walk on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had high expectations,'' he said. ``You don't come
to a school like this as a walk-on if you aren't confident. I could
have gone to a small school and played another position, but I
wanted to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith watched Sailer's every move last season and entered
spring practice as the No. 1 placekicker. Actually, he was the only
placekicker, but a challenger was on the way. The Bruins signed
Nate Fikse, a highly regarded prospect from Anaheim, to compete
with Griffith in training camp. Griffith won the placekicking
battle, while Fikse earned the kickoff and punting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were bringing him in and that there was a chance
he could take my spot because he was on scholarship,'' Griffith
said. ``That's why I stayed here over the summer. I lifted twice a
week and kicked twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for insurance. I knew I couldn't go home all summer
and walk in and get the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith couldn't have scripted a better start. His field goals
have come from 26, 28, 33, 35 and 37 yards, and all from the
coveted left hashmark. But eventually he'll be asked to win a game,
kick a 50-yarder, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not anxious, but I think about that a lot,'' he said.
``The thing is, I won't know how far it is. I never look at the
line of scrimmage. I kick the same way if it's 35 or 45 yards. When
I come off the field, (long snapper) Jeff Grau tells me how far the
kicks are.''
</P>
<P>
   Grau and Griffith are roommates, and last Friday, while sharing
a mountain bike, they crashed on a gravel street. Griffith tore up
his right (kicking) leg and had a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   He vomited at practice Friday afternoon and again at the hotel
that night. His leg stiffened and swelled and he didn't think he
could kick against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told Nate to get ready, but that was the last thing I
wanted to happen, since things have been going so well,'' Griffith
said. ``When I got to the Rose Bowl, it was still stiff and it
stung, but I thought I could kick.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrapped the leg tightly, leaving a gap at the knee for
flexibility, and made two field goals to help UCLA beat the
Bulldogs 35-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with Chris,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``When
he came here as a walk-on, he wasn't very strong. But through
lifting weights, he got a lot stronger and he's very accurate.''

WILL HULL ENDORSE MCCAIN? OR BUSH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER AND KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For months, presidential candidate George W. Bush has
been hoping for the endorsement of Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has remained coy, saying officially that she supports both
of Arizona's candidates, Sen. John McCain and former Vice President
Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has pointedly excluded Hull from an invitation list
to his Oct. 4 fund-raiser at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush is returning to Phoenix, where he will meet privately
with Hull on Sept. 28th on matters neither will disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have a conversation,'' said Francie Noyes,
Hull's spokeswoman. `It is part of an ongoing conversation she is
having with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, the subject of endorsement is
discussed frequently in both camps and has all but achieved the
status of a state secret.
</P>
<P>
   A Hull endorsement of Bush would be a major embarrassment for
McCain, who must win the state's Feb. 22 primary to remain in the
race. McCain has lagged Bush by double digits in recent polls in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCain said he had no comment on the possibility
that Hull would endorse Bush and that McCain would continue to
welcome Hull's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We announced our leadership team several months ago, and we
said at the time that we were moving forward with the campaign and
. . when and if the governor made a decision we would have a spot
for her in the camp,'' said Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Merrill, an ASU pollster and journalism professor, said
the biggest problem for McCain would be the national embarrassment
a Hull endorsement could cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The far greater damage would be in the national sense of
having the Republican governor from his own state endorsing someone
from out of state. That would be a media event in itself,'' Merrill
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a very serious blow in terms of public opinion. If
he can't win his home state, that would make California a very
difficult task,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strategy is dependent on strong showings in New
Hampshire and South Carolina before the March 7 California primary,
where he is aiming for a win.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and McCain have never been close politically, and McCain's
Oct. 4 fund-raiser at Bank One Ballpark has not shown up on the
governor's schedule. That apparently means she was not invited to
the event, despite the fact that most Republican presidential
candidates have typically invited Hull to their Phoenix events as a
courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Hull have been comparatively close politically. Last
September, 1998 Bush hosted a fund-raiser for Hull as she was
gearing up her re-election bid for governor. The event raised
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the pair are close ideologically. Hull's support for
increased education spending, subsidized health care for children
of the working poor and tax cuts is comparable to positions Bush
has spelled out. Bush also backed Hull on her efforts to expand the
region's guest-worker program, which seeks to legally import
Mexican workers to work primarily in agriculture and
service-industry jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of both Bush and Hull said an alliance between the Texas
governor and Hull would come naturally to both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Governor Bush, and I know Governor Hull, and I think
they are philosophically very compatible,'' said Jim Simmons,
organizer of the fund-raiser for Bush to be held Tuesday at the
Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix, which Hull likely will attend. ``They are
conservatives, but on the other hand, as Governor Bush says, they
are compassionate conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said he had not yet heard whether Hull would endorse
Bush, but added that such a pronouncement would be `very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Hull is popular, and I think she would certainly add
to Bush's Arizona presence,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   If Hull endorses Bush, it would put her at odds with most of the
GOP political establishment in Arizona, including House Speaker
Jeff Groscost, Senate President Brenda Burns and state Schools
Superintendent Lisa Graham Keegan. All three have endorsed McCain,
while Groscost is a paid campaign consultant for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 28th fund-raiser marks Bush's first foray into Arizona
as a candidate, but it is not his first effort to raise money here.
In April, former President Bush traveled to the state for a
fund-raiser, also at the Ritz Carlton, to raise money for his son's
exploratory presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the $500 a plate fund-raiser will likely draw up
to 400 people. &QL;

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The first practice session for the Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of
Houston will be Friday morning. It comes exactly two weeks after
CART rookie driver Gonzalo Rodriguez lost his life in an accident
at the Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, Calif.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sorrow of that moment is still fresh in the minds and hearts
of many drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very sad day,'' said CART driver Tony Kanaan. ``I
felt like it was the second time I had been through that because I
lost my friend (Formula One driver) Ayrton Senna a few years ago
(in a racing accident). We have to remember they were doing what
they loved, but it's still hard to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was killed when his car went off the racing surface
and hit a concrete barrier head-on at more than 140 mph.
</P>
<P>
   An accident that causes the death of a driver always is tragic,
but it has become so rare in major racing series that a fatality is
an enormous shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like that happens, you see things from a
different perspective,'' said Dario Franchitti, the defending
champion in Houston. ``You see how it affects the drivers _ these
tough guys who won't give an inch on the track. But when you see
them after something like that, you realize they are human beings
with feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all got together and sat down and discussed it. We just
talked amongst ourselves about our grief. Gonzalo was one of us,
and he had a great future. It was a horrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's death was the first driver fatality in the CART
series since July 1996, when Jeff Krosnoff was killed in an
accident at Toronto. That covered a span of 58 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motor racing is dangerous, and we all recognize that,''
Franchitti said. ``But we do everything we can to minimize those
dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics prove that a person wearing a seat belt in a
passenger car that has a collision at 50 mph has a much greater
chance of serious injury than an open-wheel race-car driver in a
collision at 150 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is really safe now compared to 25 years ago,'' said
Christian Fittipaldi, driver of the Kmart Ford/Swift car. ``There's
no doubt about that. I would say it's probably 100 times safer now
than it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fittipaldi also knows firsthand that dangers exist.
</P>
<P>
   He will be back in his race car this weekend after missing five
races because of a crash he had in a practice session at St. Louis.
Fittipaldi suffered a subdural hematoma and the second concussion
of his career. He also suffered a broken leg in a crash in
Australia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety obviously is a big concern for all drivers, because no
one is out there to get hurt,'' said Fittipaldi, a member of CART's
safety committee. ``The cars are safer than ever before, but we
never can get to the point where we feel the tracks and the cars
are safe enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to constantly work on making the tracks and the cars
safer in order to avoid what happened two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances have enabled drivers to walk away from
racing accidents that might have been fatal in the past. Today's
race cars are built to come apart on impact, which enables most of
the energy of the collision to be absorbed by the car instead of
the driver.
</P>
<P>
   There were times 30 years ago when a car received little damage
in a collision and the driver was killed _ because he took most of
the force of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers also were seriously injured or killed by the fire from
exploding fuel tanks; today, it is rare to see a major fire
associated with a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Rubber fuel tanks are covered in anti-intrusion ballistic cloth
and protected by carbon fiber. The tanks are self-sealing in the
event of an impact that causes a crack. Jim Melvin, general manager
of the Grand Prix of Houston, said the system was developed in
Vietnam to use on helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Safety advances involve the spectators, as well as the drivers,
but the last two seasons have proved spectators also can be at risk
while watching a race.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were killed in May at an Indy Racing League event
in Charlotte, N.C., less than 10 months after three fans were
killed in Michigan during the U.S. 500 CART event. Both tragedies
were caused by wheels coming off cars during a crash and flying
into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Those incidents brought about several changes, including a
device to tether the wheels to the suspension of the cars. Many
speedways, including Charlotte, Michigan and Fort Worth, increased
the height and the arc of the debris fencing.
</P>
<P>
   The spectator fatalities at superspeedway ovals never have
happened at a street course like Houston's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not the same animal,'' Melvin said. ``To the best of
my knowledge, in all the years of street racing in this country,
there never has been a serious spectator incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars on superspeedways are traveling at speeds approaching
230 mph, and centrifugal force is pushing them out toward the wall.
They can hit the wall with the force of 80 G's, and that's a lot of
energy to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastest part of this track (about 175 mph on the Austin
backstretch) is a long straightaway coming off and going into a
slow turn. Any brush with the wall likely would be a glancing
blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said Grand Prix of Houston officials have spared no
expense in making the 1.53-mile, 10-turn downtown layout the safest
street course in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety was our No. 1 priority from day one,'' Melvin said.
``Spectators who come to an event deserve the right to feel safe
and be taken care of properly. We were not going to do anything to
jeopardize the well-being of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``CART officials said last year that Houston was the finest
example of track safety for any temporary circuit on the schedule.
They raved about our safety system, as did the drivers. It came
through clearly that Houston was the safety standard all other
street circuits should be looking toward.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of the sport are something drivers accept because
they love what they do, but they also want each event to be as safe
as possible. And a tragedy like the one two weeks ago leaves
everyone shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is one driver out there who doesn't have a
little bit of fear,'' Fittipaldi said. ``Everyone has fear.
Sometimes you can forget about your fear and overdrive the car.
That's when you can find yourself in a complicated situation.''

LESS O'NEAL FOR LAKERS?

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Phil Jackson traded the crisp mountain air
of Montana for the particulate-enhanced skies of Los Angeles last
week, his two-month vacation over and his all-consuming new
vocation about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson didn't need to spend the summer here under the
burnt-sienna haze to determine how to upgrade the equally hazy
prospects of his Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   He needs a more svelte Shaquille O'Neal. A pass-happy Kobe
Bryant. A well-conditioned roster of players. He'd still like
Scottie Pippen but figures he won't get him and has all but ruled
out Dennis Rodman's return.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes management can sign former Chicago Bulls guard Ron
Harper. And he desperately wants to add a few big bodies to a
decidedly thin frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not totally satisfied with our roster,'' Jackson
acknowledged Wednesday, speaking to reporters for the first time
since returning to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to improve the ballclub over the summer. A lot of
things didn't go the way we hoped they would go, particularly in
the power-forward situation. And we were fortunate to be able to
scramble at the end and pick up A.C. (Green) as a legitimate
performer. But we still have some needs as far as the power
players, and we recognize this. . . . But we think that we've got
the talent to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   That talent needs some reshaping, however, almost literally in
the cases of O'Neal and Glen Rice, each of whom played over his
ideal weight last season. Jackson, who met with O'Neal in Montana
this summer, spared no feelings on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a number I wanted him to come in at in weight,''
Jackson said. ``It looks like he's gained 10 pounds for every year
he's played in the NBA. You can't continue to do that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of work and of ethics about being a
professional. I encouraged him to just give that professional
attitude about coming to camp in the best shape he's been in,
lighter than he was last year and getting more activity in his
game. He's having trouble getting himself up and down the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditioning requirements won't be limited to O'Neal, who played
at around 335 pounds last season. Jackson sent a five-page memo to
all his players this offseason, demanding that everyone report to
camp Oct. 5 in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Two-a-day practices at UC Santa Barbara promise to be rigorous
as Jackson indoctrinates a new class of triple-post-offense
students. And there will be precious little time to master a system
that Michael Jordan himself said took two years to fully grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the amount of learning we have to do, this is not
going to be a conditioning camp,'' Jackson said. ``So they have to
be in very good shape, or else they'll put themselves in jeopardy
right away, with physical injury or having to sit out of practice,
and if they do that they'll get behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's letter to players also outlined the seven basic
principles of his passing-heavy offensive system as a preview of
lessons to come.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like an on-court teacher and Harper could be it. Jackson
spoke with the 35-year-old veteran last week, and general manager
Mitch Kupchak acknowledged the Lakers are pursuing Harper, though
no deal is imminent. Kupchak also would like to trade for a power
player, but that won't happen for a while.
</P>
<P>
   As for former Bulls Pippen and Rodman? Not likely. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, now with Houston, ``is the kind of player I wanted'' to
initiate the offense, Jackson said, ``but that's just probably not
going to work out at this point. . . . We're kind of tabling that,
setting it over on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson, though he pines for a tough power forward, no
longer seems interested in coraling the wild beast inside Rodman,
calling him a player who ``can debilitate. . . a whole team with
his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman has publicly said more than once that he expects to
re-sign with the Lakers, who waived him last season after a series
of no-shows and half-hearted efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's made me stay away from Dennis has
been a variety of inconsistencies in his life,'' Jackson said.
``Obviously we have a need for a player like him, but I'm not
willing at this time to sacrifice what I see as maybe some
stability with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, even after a summer in which Rodman was involved in a
bar fight and publicly belittled the Lakers and executive
vice-legend Jerry West, Jackson would not close the door all the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best of all worlds, no, he's not an option,'' he said.
``But in compromising and finding a way to win, come February, who
knows what you have to do?''

   TAIWAN-SCENE (Tali, Taiwan) _ This little town in central
Taiwan, near the epicenter of Monday's enormous earthquake, seems
utterly shellshocked by the damage, which killed more than 2,000
people, injured countless others, and destroyed thousands of homes.
In towns throughout central Taiwan, rescue workers tried to save
hundreds of residents trapped in the earthquake's rubble, but there

   INDIA-CASTES-VOTE (Jamalpur, India) _ As hundreds of millions of
Indians stream to the polls this month for national elections, one

from the most despised, untouchable castes, are voting in greater
proportions than ever before and redefining the very meaning of the
centuries-old caste system. The rising political clout and
independence of the lowest castes, generally referred to as
``scheduled castes'' because of their enumeration in the
constitution for special benefits, is being felt, not just in north
India, but across the country. By Celia W. Dugger.

with such offerings in an exhibition of cutting-edge British art

last week was just the type of extravagant contract that President
John F. Kennedy had once warned the United Auto Workers against.
But the DaimlerChrysler agreement has not set off inflation alarm
bells the way it might have in the Kennedy era partly because a
contract reached with an automaker no longer sets a lockstep

MARINERS' NEW GM MUST BE ARCHITECT FOR THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Work is starting early for Mariners president Chuck
Armstrong these days. Rumor has it the man was at the office by 7
a.m. Wednesday making important phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad all the news is not rosy. Already, Oakland has refused
to let Armstrong talk to A's general manager Billy Beane. And in
Montreal, the Expos have said GM Jim Beattie is off limits.
</P>
<P>
   For all the seismic talk about a total Mariners shakedown, the
truth is any and all change appears concentrated on one particular
position.
</P>
<P>
   With Woody Woodward's retirement as vice president of baseball
operations, the Mariners have a chance to dramatically alter their
leadership mix _ something they need to do.
</P>
<P>
   And despite much public sentiment that the Mariners must sell
the team to a white knight such as Paul Allen in order to save it,
or that the entire Mariners front office be shoved into Elliott
Bay, the change at general manager might actually be enough.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it (BEGIN ITAL) could (END ITAL) be enough if the
Mariners make the right decision. And it could be enough if
Mariners owners allow their new man _ or woman, as Armstrong
quipped the other day _ to do the work that needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodward is waltzing out of Seattle singing the praises of an
unfettered tenure with owners who never compromised his work, it is
because diplomacy got the better of him.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once the Mariners decided in November 1996 that Randy
Johnson was too expensive, there were at least two instances in
which Woodward was refused clearance to pull the trigger on deals
that might have solved the Mariners' problems.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Johnson's trade to Houston for what is now the
heart of the Mariners rotation will go down as one of Woodward's
shining moments _ which goes to show how timing, luck and weirdness
are every bit as much a part of constructing a roster as is sheer
genius.
</P>
<P>
   Not to make too much of Armstrong's comment about a woman
possibly being the right candidate, but it is safe to assume that
the Mariners are going to hunt down all candidates, including a
thorough search of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners take a good deal of counsel from commissioner Bud
Selig, and baseball has addressed the need to open doors for all
qualified candidates. That is why Dave Stewart and Mets assistant
general manager Omar Minaya are being mentioned, as is Bob Watson,
the former Yankees GM who is now out of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain factors influencing this pivotal hire.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mariners owners aren't selling the team to any savior.
They think they are the saviors of baseball. Second, Piniella
remains in good standing with the organization. Also, Armstrong
will remain as president, even when club chairman John Ellis
reduces his role.
</P>
<P>
   And even as owners Howard Lincoln and Chris Larson increase
their involvement, there is reason to hope they understand that
running a baseball team is not exactly like running a computer
software or video game business.
</P>
<P>
   Absent a single owner who speaks for the Mariners and who gives
the team a consistent, charismatic face, the Mariners need a new GM
who comes fresh from the outside, bringing a new dynamic and a new
level of credibility _ one capable of dramatic, perhaps even
historic, decisions.
</P>
<P>
   What qualities do the Mariners say they are looking for?
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong refuses to give daily updates on the process, but
clearly, the organization is in desperate need of someone who will
exceed any standard the Mariners have ever set for that position.
</P>
<P>
   While teams such as Cleveland moved into a new,
revenue-producing ballpark with a long-term plan for signing and
developing players, the Mariners have done the opposite _
piecemealing rosters and trading away the farm ever since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for an architect who can handle whatever comes of the
early off-season negotiations with Ken Griffey and Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey reiterated Wednesday that his decision will be his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because Woody is gone doesn't mean I'm necessarily going
to stay or go. I've been here longer than everyone,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, whether the new GM is building around Griffey
and/or Rodriguez or whether he is charged with making the best
deals for one or both superstars, it is a job for a seasoned
executive.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why it appears the M's will go outside for a new GM,
despite two in-house candidates in Roger Jongewaard and Lee
Pelekoudas, both of whom have excellent reputations throughout
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after weighing all the factors, it is encouraging to hear
the name Pat Gillick getting a good ride. Armstrong has contacted
the former Baltimore and Toronto general manager, who knows a thing
or two about franchise-player blockbusters, having made the deal
for Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick or not, the M's have to think big _ for once. Citizens
of Marinerville should pray that by Oct. 31 Armstrong has found
someone capable taking charge of the mammoth construction site that
is the Mariners.

HELLING STRUGGLES IN RANGERS' LOSS TO ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Pitcher Rick Helling is formulating his own
law of gravity: What goes up rarely comes back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helling surrendered three identified flying objects as Baltimore
rallied for a 7-4 victory against the Texas Rangers on Wednesday
night at The Ballpark in Arlington, extending the Orioles' winning
streak to 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely frustrating,'' said Helling, who has allowed
38 home runs, the most by a major-league pitcher this season. ``I'd
like to be at my best this time of year, and I'm not. I'm not
throwing the ball well at all. The past three starts have not been
good, but I still have confidence. I'm not terrible. The numbers
say I'm terrible, but I'm not that far off.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing for the fourth time in five games, the Rangers
remained 5 1/2 games in front of second-place Oakland in the
American League West, and their magic number shrank to six with the
Athletics' loss to Minnesota on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Helling can dismiss his recent struggles despite falling to
13-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I'm concerned, but, of course, I'd like to be
pitching better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' Jesus Garcia hit his first major-league home run in
the second inning, and Charles Johnson and Brady Anderson followed
suit on consecutive fifth-inning pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's home run provided Orioles right-hander Scott Erickson
(15-11) a two-run lead that would not be relinquished and marked
the 12th home run allowed by Helling in his past five starts,
spanning 29 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I make a bad pitch, being a flyball pitcher, it's going
to get hit far,'' Helling said.
</P>
<P>
   Two more hit that far and Helling will match the Rangers'
single-season record for home runs allowed. Ferguson Jenkins
surrendered 40 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored four first-inning runs, yet Erickson
surrendered only four more hits before departing in the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get to him early,'' Rangers shortstop Royce
Clayton said. ``He stuck to his game plan, though, and pitched a
good game after we got to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers mounted their best threat in the seventh inning
after consecutive one-out singles by center fielder Tom Goodwin and
second baseman Mark McLemore, but catcher Ivan Rodriguez then gave
new meaning to the term 30-30.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who is six stolen bases shy of becoming the first
major-league catcher with at least 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases
in a season, hit his 30th double-play grounder of the season,
killing the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some base hits,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``We had some scoring opportunities, but we just didn't get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Rangers open their three-game series against the
Athletics at The Ballpark, and Oates has seen ``nothing'' to
suggest the Rangers will come of their recent tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've lost four out of five at home, but we will get it
turned around again,'' Oates said. ``It's a bump in the road, and
hopefully the day off (today) will clear their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no cause for alarm because we're not playing bad
baseball,'' Clayton said. ``We just need to get hot.'' nn

SLOPPY RED SOX SLIP UP 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This was more Looney Tunes than playoff tuneup. But
despite the error of their ways _ the Red Sox made a season-high
five errors, including three on successive plays in the second
inning _ they still moved a step closer to extending their season
deeper into October.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's 14-7 beating by the Toronto Blue
Jays, the Sox' magic number for a wild-card spot dropped to seven,
because the Oakland A's fell Wednesday afternoon to the Minnesota
Twins. Any combination of Sox wins and A's losses totaling seven,
and the Sox are wild-card entrants for the second successive year.
</P>
<P>
   But for the damp crowd of 25,345 that came to Yawkey Way hoping
to see the Sox make some magic of their own, no such luck, unless
you want to count center fielder Damon Buford reaching into his hat
and pulling out two errors, which was double his season total
entering the game. The five errors were the most by a Sox team
since a five-spot against Texas Sept. 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of us got beat up tonight,'' said pitcher Pat Rapp,
who was on the mound when Buford overran Shawn Green's single in
the first, resulting in the first of eight unearned runs scored by
the Blue Jays. ``We didn't look that good in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll come back tomorrow, (Kent) Mercker will throw some
strikes, and we'll pop back up in the win column.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp failed to retire a batter in the second, when the Blue Jays
strung together four straight singles to knock him out of the game,
then watched the Sox defense implode. Rookie third baseman Wilton
Veras, who got away with making a double error Tuesday night that
caused no collateral damage, kicked away a double-play grounder by
Carlos Delgado that could have ended the inning. Instead, Delgado
reached, David Segui's fly ball clanked off Buford's glove in
shallow center for his second error, and Trot Nixon overran Darrin
Fletcher's two-run single for yet another misplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six quick ones, a couple of walks, and I'm up here watching
TV,'' Rapp said. ``I didn't stay down there to watch. After Bufe
dropped that popup, I decided to take it up (to the clubhouse).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been so good for so long, this was bound to happen,
sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the left-field scoreboard totals looked like
this:
</P>
<P>
   R H E &QL; 
TOR 8 8 0 &QL; 
BOSTON 0 0 4 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six of those runs were charged to Rapp, though only three were
earned.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' six-game winning streak, which matched their longest of
the season, came to an end against the Blue Jays, who had lost nine
of 10 to the Sox this season but Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night led, 9-1, after
three innings and collected 22 hits against a season-high eight Red
Sox pitchers, including rare appearances by Mark Portugal, Brian
Rose, and Tomo Ohka.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 hits were the most allowed by the Sox in a game in more
than five years, since the Twins had 22 hits in a 21-2 Red Sox loss
in the Metrodome. It was the first time in more than 12 years that
the Sox had given up 22 hits at Fenway Park, since a 15-2 loss to
the Cleveland Indians Sept. 5, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last storm, that was the one we were looking for,'' said
manager Jimy Williams, alluding to the late downpour that made
everyone even more miserable than they already were.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sox just days away from their final regular-season
appearance in Fenway Park, Williams gave the Fenway faithful a
chance to see all of their favorites, clearing his bench in the
seventh inning, when the JV team took over. Brian Daubach, Butch
Huskey, Jeff Frye, Donnie Sadler, Lou Merloni, and Jon Nunnally
shook off their collective rust and generated seven runs, five in
the seventh and two in the ninth, before finally succumbing.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Sox used 24 players. Of the active position players,
only Darren Lewis, who has a sore left wrist, and Steve Lomasney,
the recent arrival from Double A, did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary hit his 28th home run off Toronto starter Kelvim
Escobar to put the Sox on the board in the bottom of the second,
but the Blue Jays _ who are one loss away from official extinction
in the playoff race _ kept piling on.
</P>
<P>
   Four singles in the third produced another run, Green's 40th
home run (off Portugal) made it 10-2 in the fifth, and the Blue
Jays scored four more in the seventh, when Daubach was charged with
the team's fifth error after he made a diving stop on Fletcher's
ground ball, then threw wide of pitcher Rheal Cormier covering
first.
</P>
<P>
   Cormier already had given up doubles to Delgado and Segui for
one run, and gave up another to Willis Otanez before Williams
lifted him for Ohka.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his fielding woes, Buford also struck out twice and
grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those games,'' Williams said. ``I was looking out there
for the moon, and it wasn't there. One tough inning, that's going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was most important is those kids who haven't played for
awhile came out swinging the bats, and the guys who came out of the
game were pulling for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important, too. The guys who came out of the game
stayed down there (in the dugout) or came back down.''

ERRORS PUT RED SOX IN ARREARS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BAD INNING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox manager Jimy Williams repeatedly tossed a
baseball in his office as he explained the not-so-pleasant
happenings that afflicted his ball club Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some of his players, Williams caught the ball every
time.
</P>
<P>
   The fog that lingered over Fenway Park may have temporarily
lifted about an hour before Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's first pitch, but you
couldn't prove it in the second inning of the 14-9 spanking of the
Red Sox at the hands of the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the hands of the Red Sox _ notably third baseman
Wilton Veras, center fielder Damon Buford and, to a lesser degree,
right fielder Trot Nixon _ that led to irreparable early damage.
</P>
<P>
   Well before Williams cleaned house with five substitutions to
start the seventh inning, the fog had returned to Fenway _
figuratively speaking _ five innings earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As in three consecutive second-inning errors that turned a 4-0
Blue Jays lead into a 8-0 laugher that wasn't so funny on a day in
which the Oakland Athletics had given the Red Sox an opportunity to
reduce that wild-card magic number by two, instead of just one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a nightmare,'' said designated hitter/catcher Scott
Hatteberg, ``one that I hope is out of our system.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that things were going well before the miscues that
resulted in a six-run inning: Pat Rapp had given up four straight
singles to start the second before being replaced by Bryce Florie,
who deserved a better fate _ and stat line.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and the score 3-0, Veras muffed what could have
been an inning-ending double-play ball. Then, Carlos Delgado lofted
a fly to shallow center. Buford, who had misplayed Shawn Green's
first-inning line single into a two-base error, simply dropped the
ball. Then Nixon overran Darrin Fletcher's clean single to end the
negative trifecta as the Blue Jays ran rings around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst gave the visitors an 8-0 lead going into the last
of the second _ one they extended to 14-2 _ and when the fog and
rain returned two hours later and lingered into the last of the
ninth, there were perhaps enough fans left in the stands for a
half-dozen trips along the Green Line to Newton.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams wasn't about to chastise any of his players,
especially Buford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made some big plays for us,'' said the manager. ``Look at
some of the game-savers he's made in games we've won by one run or
two runs. That's how I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck, who ended a seven-reliever bullpen parade with a
scoreless ninth, said he was impressed, nevertheless, with how the
Red Sox threatened to make a game of it in the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a second, I thought we might have an opportunity to win
this ballgame,'' said Beck. ``You never know in this game. Crazy
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of them happened to the Red Sox, prompting
Williams to remark, first, that he kept looking for the full moon
that wasn't there, then for a harder rainstorm that might have put
a bigger damper on Toronto's 22-hit attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's life,'' said Nixon. ``It's not like it happens every
night and we're going to be back tomorrow and ready to go. It's not
like we gave up. We scored nine runs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hatteberg sounded a note of caution: ``Things had been going
pretty good, but it all can go real bad real quick and this was a
perfect example tonight. But I don't think it'll get to anybody's
head. It's just a reminder not to take the good for granted.''

HELLING THINKING OF INJURED TEAMMATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN AND SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ He said it's not affecting the way he has
pitched. But Texas Rangers pitcher Rick Helling said Rusty Greer
has been on his mind a lot lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was an accident, and Rusty knows it was an
accident,'' Helling said. ``Rusty and I have talked about it, and
he doesn't blame me. But I'm still the guy who threw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling was playing catch with Aaron Sele in the outfield during
batting practice last week when one of his throws hit Greer in the
eye. Greer suffered a bruised retina, and the Rangers aren't sure
when he'll be able to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the guys on the team, I've known Rusty the longest,''
Helling said. ``I've seen how far he's come since we were playing
together in Tulsa (in 1993). No matter what happens, I'm not going
to feel better until he's back on the field and 100 percent. But I
don't think about it when I'm pitching. I'm totally focused out
there.'' PATTERSON MAKES PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson's chances of being on the postseason roster
seemed hopeless when he was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma on Aug.
24 and Danny Kolb stayed with the team. Patterson, though, is
showing he deserves consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson pitched 11/3 perfect innings against the Baltimore
Orioles on Wednesday night, striking out two. He has worked five
scoreless innings in his past five outings, and has a 2.45
earned-run average in seven appearances since being recalled from
Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson says he was able to make his pitch for being on the
postseason roster when he stopped worrying about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got sent down one of the things I did was look at my
attitude,'' he said. ``I was always trying to prove something every
time I went out there. I realized how destructive that was. I think
that's benefited me. I haven't put undue pressure on myself. I'm
not going to worry about if they put me on the postseason roster.''
KOLB UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have decided not to send rookie pitcher Danny Kolb
to the Arizona Fall League. Kolb has stiffness in his right elbow
and will likely need surgery to remove some loose bodies. He
remains unavailable but hopes to pitch for the Rangers again this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are considering Kolb for the playoff roster because
manager Johnny Oates likes the way he has pitched. But they want to
make sure he's healthy because if he gets injured in a playoff
series, the Rangers can't replace him until the next series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first year. To have a chance to go to the playoffs,
that means a lot to me,'' Kolb said. ``Obviously I want to be
healthy enough to go. I'll do whatever it takes to get there.''
WEDGWOOD DONATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Rangers players have collected approximately $55,000 for the
Wedgewood Victim Funds. The ballclub is expected to match that
amount, and Rangers owner Tom Hicks is expected to make a
contribution. FASSERO TRADE COMPLETED
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have sent minor-league outfielder Adrian Myers to
the Seattle Mariners as the player to be named later in the Jeff
Fassero trade. Myers, a 21st-round pick in 1996 who is considered a
fringe prospect, hit .235 for Double-A Tulsa with one home run and
28 runs batted in during 99 games. He was second in the Texas
League with 33 stolen bases. YANKEES OR MARTINEZ?
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers end up with the best record in the American
League, they could end up having to face the Boston in the first
round of the playoffs. That might not be desirable considering Red
Sox ace Pedro Martinez is 22-4 with a 2.11 earned-run average and
dominating just about everybody these days.
</P>
<P>
   But Oates said he's concerned more about the depth of the New
York Yankees' staff _ Roger Clemens, Orlando Hernandez, Andy
Pettitte, Hideki Irabu and David Cone _ than he is Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the quality of their depth, they would still have
to be the favorite,'' Oates said. ``That's why No. 2 and No. 3
starters are so important. The No. 1 guy can't pitch but twice, and
somebody else has got to win once before he pitches twice.'' nn

BOOM! Mark McGwire takes another swift, powerful swing, sends the
ball knifing through the darkness at Busch Stadium like a laser
beam, pumps a fist into the air and starts one more mad scramble
for a souvenir. The crowd roars with a standing ovation, and the
fireworks explode beyond the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bam! Sammy Sosa uncurls his sinewy body and connects again,
lifting the ball up into the breeze at Wrigley Field, touches off
another rugby scrum among the urchins out on Waveland Avenue, claps
his hands, thumps his heart, blows kisses to the fans and takes off
on a samba dance around the bases.

achievement into the cheap-trick equivalent of a birthday-party
clown making a quarter appear out of a little girl's ear.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, McGwire and Sosa gave us the baseball story of a
lifetime. This year, they are giving us, well, just another story
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy has already crashed the magical 60 barrier again, and it's
only a matter of time until Mark hiccups and sends another pitch
over the fence to join him. Then it's off to the races through the
last 11 days of the regular season to see if both of them can
surpass McGwire's year-old record of 70.
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody really want to see that happen?
</P>
<P>
   What about the goose bumps we all felt last season living
vicariously through the pair of sluggers as we kept track of every
step of their historic chase of the record? Will the hair on the
back of our necks stand up again this time if we find out this is
going to become as annual an occurrence as a back-to-school sale?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does take away from the overall feel of what
happened last year,'' says Astros manager Larry Dierker. ``What
makes something very special is the idea that it doesn't happen
very often. I mean, in the prior history of the game, only two guys
had ever hit 60, and it happened 30-some years apart. Now you have
McGwire and Sosa going over 60 in the same year and then coming
back and doing it again the next season. I think what it tells you
is that home runs are suddenly a lot easier to hit these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it because expansion in Major League Baseball and the
increased siphoning of talent by other sports has depleted the
ranks of pitchers? Or is it because in an effort to draw the
attention of the average sports fan back to the former national
pastime, the lords of the game switched over to using an oversized
golf ball with a balata cover that players can now drive as far as
a Tiger Woods tee shot? Sosa and McGwire are by far the leading
purveyors of the millennium homer, but the power numbers are up to
ridiculous levels throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to stop, stop, stop already, before inflation turns
the home run into the Italian lira and it takes thousands of them
to buy a cup of espresso.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody likes candy, but too much of it rots your teeth.
That's what we've got this season, with Sosa and McGwire turning
every morning into the day after Halloween when the
trick-or-treaters have consumed enough sweet stuff to make
themselves sick. And it surely doesn't help that both are piling up
the numbers this year for teams that could use a flea dip.
</P>
<P>
   Is the sports world really buzzing over this year's race? Are
people who you didn't even think knew the difference between third
base and a grand piano keeping count of every four-ply swat?
</P>
<P>
   There is no drama now in any of the numbers in the 60s. It's
like watching a weightlifter pick up the dumbbells. We already know
he can do it.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, not the fault of Sosa and McGwire or McGwire
and Sosa. They are only doing what they do best. Maybe this is the
naturally perverted outgrowth of our modern-day preoccupation with
individual achievement and sheer bombast.
</P>
<P>
   Ask an old-time baseball fan whether he would rather see a home
run by Sosa or McGwire or a win by his favorite team, and he might
not even dignify you with an answer. But look at the ballparks all
around the National League that fill up when either of the Big Two
comes to town, and check out how many fans actually leave early
once Sammy and Mark have taken their last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one reason to feel good about any of this. That's
the thought that the collectibles geeks who paid millions for those
historic baseballs might be left with just high-priced junk now
that the thrill of the home run is going, going, gone.

LAPD'S MORALE TAKES A HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT AND RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- On the toughest streets of Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, the Rampart Division police corruption scandal
weighs heavily on the minds of LAPD patrol officers.
</P>
<P>
   The sting of this blow to the LAPD badge was softened
occasionally by an outpouring of unsolicited support from the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all the time say you've got a tough job and we
appreciate it. Now they're going out of their way to stop us,''
said Officer Jim Zourek of the Valley's Foothill Division,
recounting how a motorist rolled down her car window while waiting
at a stop sign to offer words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Hector Guzman of the Foothill Division said he loves his
job and won't let the unfolding scandal affect his approach to
policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to roll with the punches. You could say this is
definitely a punch,'' he said Wednesday before driving out of the
division's garage for the night shift.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, boosters of the tarnished Rampart Division threw
their third annual fund-raising luncheon, with public TV
personality Huell Howser as the keynote speaker. Dozens of officers
attended, many of them upset and angry by the controversy swirling
around the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell people that 99 percent of us aren't thugs or crooks,''
said one officer as he passed by.
</P>
<P>
   Community support helps officers trying to do their jobs under
what typically are difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Officers in the Foothill Division, which spans the northeast San
Fernando Valley and is the department's largest, said support so
far has not wavered despite the reports of police misconduct in the
downtown division.
</P>
<P>
   At a local restaurant, workers who often wait on officers said
they hope the police continue working hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it makes their job tougher. But we need them,'' said
Carletta Snider, a restaurant manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a bad apple in every bunch,'' she said.
``Unfortunately, they're the ones who get all the press.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Community Police Advisory Board in the Foothill
Division said community trust will be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a cop is a hard job. This is going to make it harder,''
said Joe Lozano, a retired studio carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is going to want to make them more accountable,
even more and more. You either walk a straight line, or we will
call the chief,'' he said. ``Fortunately, all the policemen I have
dealt with have been straight shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officers said the scandal was still too new. They hope
there will be few repercussions when they respond to incidents and
contact people in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still fresh. We haven't really felt the effects of it
yet. Hopefully we won't,'' said one officer who declined to give
his name after helping on an arrest Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer involved in the same incident, who also declined
to give his name, said morale could eventually take a hit.
``Whenever we get something like this, it's always going to bring
you down. But we know it's a few bad cops.''
</P>
<P>
   While the scandal comes up among officers during briefings, many
said it's business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a black eye on the department, that's for sure,'' Zourek
said. ``But you can't change the way you do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   The police misconduct even is used by training officers as a
lesson for younger officers on probation, Officer Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes up, you talk to them. We have to make sure they
understand what's right and what's wrong,'' he said.

KARROS KNOWS HE MIGHT BE DEPARTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eric Karros isn't sure which way the Dodgers will
go in the offseason, but the first baseman knows the choices. And
he realizes if the organization decides to take one step back to
take a few forward during the winter, this could be his eighth and
final season in Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can go two ways,'' Karros said. ``Either they can tweak
it and try to win next year, or they're going to rebuild. And if
they (rebuild), I assume I will not be in their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone won't talk about
individuals on the trading block, he did say the Dodgers are
interested in lowering their payroll for next season.
</P>
<P>
   With it's current crop of players, the 2000 payroll projects to
approximately $92 million. The Dodgers want to trim it below $70
million to create more flexibility during the season.
</P>
<P>
   But without any of their high-priced (or medium-priced) players
available for free agency, the only way to accomplish that is to
trade high-priced veterans, which would give the perception of
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to rebuild, you can get younger and suck it up
for a few years,'' Karros said. ``Or you can do what they call
tweaks, and hope what you put together in 1998 and 1999 comes to
fruition. If you keep changing the plan, you're going to spin your
wheels. This offseason is going to show a lot about this
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros, the team's leader in home runs (33) and RBI (108), will
be in the last year of a contract that will pay him $5.5 million
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could secure Karros with an extension in the
offseason, but Malone said the club's lack of financial flexibility
must change before they give that consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in an extension because of flexibility,''
Malone said. ``There's value in payroll flexibility. That's our
position now. I don't know if it will change. . . . He fits right
now. I'm not looking to trade Eric Karros. He's consistent and
gives you everything he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Onan says no: The Dodgers wanted reliever Onan Masaoka to
pitch in winter ball in Venezuela, but the rookie left-hander
declined. Masaoka, 21, said he made his decision in part because he
needs to rest after the longest season of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers wanted Masaoka to pitch so he could start, and,
obviously, aren't tickled about his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that, but I think the thing they want is to make sure I
come back (to spring training) in shape,'' said Masaoka, who lives
in Hawaii. ``I'm not going home to sit on the beach. I'll work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka is 2-4 with a 4.33 ERA in 51 games. The Dodgers wanted
him to start in Venezuela so they could monitor his development,
and so he could get better command of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dempsey eyes post: Dodgers bullpen coach Rick Dempsey spent
the last two seasons as the manager of the Norfolk (Va.) Tides, the
Mets' Triple-A affiliate. And while he said he's happy in the
Dodgers organization, Dempsey has told people close to him that
he's interested in managing in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is that Baltimore will fire manager Ray Miller after
the season, and Dempsey has told those same people he would be
interested in returning to the organization with which he spent 12
of his 24 years as a player.
</P>
<P>
   In five years as a minor-league manager, Dempsey's teams went
345-358 and finished first once and second twice.

HARPER COULD RETIRE BY OCTOBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Derek Harper is a Detroit Piston for now but
could be a retiree or a Houston Rocket by the time training camps
open the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials said Harper's possible retirement would not negate
the trade that sent him to the Pistons from the Los Angeles Lakers
on Tuesday. Harper, 37, said he ``definitely'' would consider
retiring in the wake of the trade because the Pistons do not have
championship potential.
</P>
<P>
   But while Detroit officials try to convince him to play there,
they also might attempt to trade Harper to a team more favorable to
him. One reported possibility is a trade to Houston for guard Matt
Maloney. &QL;

VALLEY TOP COP TO LEAD LAPD INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV AND PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Pressing an unprecedented internal probe, Los
Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks named the top police officer
in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley to lead a 60-member Board of
Inquiry in its sweeping investigation of the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Michael J. Bostic, commander of Operations-Valley
Bureau, was given a six-week deadline to dissect department
policies that allowed a rogue officer to steal eight pounds of
cocaine from an evidence locker and frame a Honduran immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Bostic said he is stunned by former Officer Rafael Perez's
admissions that he stole the cocaine, covered up a shooting that
paralyzed Javier Ovando, a 22-year-old Honduran immigrant, and lied
under oath to send Ovando to prison for 23 years. Eleven officers
have been suspended from duty, and Parks has said he believes the
probe will uncover more wrongdoing by other officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I have a pretty sick feeling in my stomach, to be
perfectly honest with you,'' Bostic said.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders and police alike voiced support for Bostic,
although some questioned whether the inquiry is a means for Parks
to cinch his control of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will get to the bottom of this because that's what the
chief wants,'' said Detective Gary Fullerton, spokesman for the Los
Angeles Police Protective League who has known Bostic for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it really doesn't matter who heads it up, because our
position is the chief is going to do what he wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullerton said the inquiry will be good for the LAPD if
management's motives are pure. ``I just hope it doesn't turn into
the Salem Witch Trials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Munz, co-chairwoman of the North Hollywood-based Save Our
Senior Lead Officers group, said she believes Bostic and other
command staffers are simply mouthpieces for Parks.
</P>
<P>
   However, she has been impressed with Bostic's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him at several community events, and he actually
answered our letters when we complained about them removing the
senior lead officers,'' Munz said. ``But, really, I think he's a
deputy chief that speaks with the chief's mouth. The chief is in
control of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Association, said Bostic has demonstrated he values community
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he is at the highest level of management in the
LAPD, there's a feeling he is really independent,'' he said. ``He's
a problem solver, not a person who avoids them. If you need a
person to determine the depth of the problem in the LAPD, he is the
perfect candidate for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can help the LAPD regain respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostic became an LAPD officer in 1973, taking command of Valley
Bureau in September 1997, where he is in charge of 1,700 officers
serving a population of 1.5million people across 220 square miles.
His command assignments have included Rampart Patrol Division, DARE
Division, Operations-South Bureau, Juvenile Group, Personnel and
Training Bureau, and Operations-West Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Bostic, who helped write the department's use-of-force policy,
testified for the prosecution during the trial of officers accused
in the videotaped beating of Rodney King. He said the officers had
four separate occasions to handcuff King and that the beating was
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said Police Commission Inspector General Jeff Eglash will
be invited to monitor the proceedings and also will be able to
proceed with his own inquiry as allowed by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the department chose not to investigate itself, we wouldn't
be here,'' Parks said. ``Remember who brought this to your
attention. We could have stopped this at any point, but didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Assisting Bostic will be Deputy Chief Maurice Moore and William
Moran, who oversees the LAPD's fiscal and support bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the Internal Affairs and task force investigation
into criminal matters will continue as the Board of Inquiry
performs its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at everything we're doing,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven officers have been suspended with pay and one other has
been fired as a result of the 17-month investigation into Perez.
</P>
<P>
   None of the suspended officers has been interviewed and will not
be until investigators have finished talking with Perez and looking
into any other allegations he makes. The Perez interviews must be
finished by late October, when he is scheduled for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking into everything he says,'' Parks said. ``He
must tell the truth, or he won't get the plea bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: the plea bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostic said additional subcommittees could be formed as needed
but that a major thrust will be looking at all the special units
within the department beyond Perez's anti-gang unit, Community
Resources Against Street Hoodlums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of specialized units, and we want to look at
all of them,'' Bostic said.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Inquiry staff will be divided into subcommittees
looking into all aspects of the department, Bostic said.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittees created so far will analyze department operation
procedures, safeguards to ensure integrity,
officer-involved-shooting protocol, use-of-force policies, the
existence of corruption and the work histories of the involved
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he had given no consideration to creating a team
similar to the Christopher Commission that was formed after the
King beating, and he defended the idea of the department
investigating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Parks also said he has been a strict disciplinarian in his two
years in office, with some 70 officers having been fired.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, a second gang injunction against the
18th Street gang was lifted by a Superior Court judge. This
injunction was for the area around MacArthur Park and was based
partially on testimony provided by the suspended officers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they will examine the information provided to get
the injunctions to see whether they can be again put in place.

DODGERS, VALDES LOSE ANOTHER ONE-RUN GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fourteen of Ismael Valdes' 31 starts had ended in
a game decided by one run. Twelve times the Los Angeles Dodgers
lost, and Valdes was 2-6 in such games.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the rap on Valdes. His ability is unmistakable, but
his toughness was always the issue. After his last start, an
abysmal outing in which he recorded six outs, Dodgers pitching
coach Claude Osteen said Valdes needed to improve the mental aspect
of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Valdes did his job in pitching six innings against the
Giants. When he left, the Dodgers led by a run, but the bullpen
frittered it away as the Giants won 5-4 Wednesday at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills allowed two runs in a third of an inning in relief of
Valdes, and Pedro Borbon yielded the eventual game-winning run on
Brent Mayne's RBI single to right in the eighth. Though Raul
Mondesi's throw home beat J.T. Snow, catcher Todd Hundley couldn't
handle the one-hopper as the Giants took a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   While the bullpen remains a problem, Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said he has no complaints with Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocket (Valdes) doesn't need to show me anything,'' Johnson
said. ``Rocket pitched great all year. He gave me a lot of innings,
a lot of quality starts. He can pitch. He's not a concern of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   This type of outing was more of what the Dodgers expected from
Valdes, and it put an end to a horrendous three-game streak that
ranks as the worst of his career. He had allowed 20 runs on 24 hits
in 10 innings, which reached a crescendo with a two-inning,
eight-run debacle last Friday in Colorado. It left Valdes 9-14.
</P>
<P>
   A season that started so right _ 3-0 through April _ began
sputtering into oblivion when he allowed six runs in three innings
in Florida on Sept. 6. Five days later he allowed six runs in five
innings against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Johnson said Valdes' problem was mental but not what was
said the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, he was expecting to pitch at this time of year with
meaning on every game,'' Johnson said. ``Mentally, at this level
...this game is 90 percent mental; how you get yourself up for each
at-bat, get yourself up for every pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of the back spasms Valdes complained about
against the Giants. There was also no sign of the pitcher Valdes
was the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes allowed four hits and left with a one-run lead, much of
which had to do with his bat as well as his arm.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco took a 2-0 lead in the third on Rich Aurilia's
two-run double. The Dodgers cut it to 2-1 in the third on a Gary
Sheffield's bases loaded walk, but Todd Hollandsworth struck out to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who singled in the third, came up with the game-tying
single in the fourth when he poked a Joe Nathan pitch into right
field to score Todd Hundley. Right fielder Armando Rios' throw to
third than bounced off Adrian Beltre and caromed into the Dodgers'
dugout to allow Beltre to score and give the Dodgers a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Valdes was lifted for pinch-hitter Dave Hansen in the bottom
of the sixth, and that was a double-whammy. Not only did Hansen
line out to second with runners on the corners to end the inning,
but Mills got in immediate trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller led off with a double and Mayne walked. A sacrifice
moved the runners up, and after Marvin Bernard walked, Aurilia
drove in two runs with a single to right-center to give the Giants
a 4-3 lead. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

VAUGHN LEADS ANGELS OVER DEVIL RAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It might be a bit cruel to say the Anaheim
Angels register Mo Vaughn's time to first base with a sundial, but
it wouldn't be too far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was the Angels' designated hitter for the third game in a
row Wednesday night against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays because in the
past few days, he's had a flare-up of the staph infection in his
right shin that sent him to the hospital in early August.
</P>
<P>
   But while Vaughn might have trouble carrying his 260-pound frame
around the bases, he found a good way to do it without getting
thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn blasted a 432-foot homer with two on and two out in the
fifth inning to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead. In the first
inning, Vaughn hit a ball into the right-field corner but was
thrown out going for a double. The Angels won 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, with 29 homers and 99 RBI, will be back in his normal
spot at first base Friday when the Angels play in Seattle, but this
season has been anything but normal for Vaughn, who came to Anaheim
from Boston after signing a six-year, $80 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who took a .304 lifetime batting average into this
season, took a .271 average for 1999 into Wednesday's game. It has
been a disappointing year for Vaughn, a former American League MVP,
and for the Angels as a whole. But considering what Vaughn has been
dealing with all season, the fact that he is closing in on 30
homers and 100 RBI is relatively satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred RBIs is more important that 30 homers,'' Vaughn
said before the game. ``It's a benchmark, no doubt about it. You
miss 30 days of the season, that (100 RBI) is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's left ankle is feeling the best it has since he sprained
it on opening night, but it's still only 75 percent at best. He
doesn't like to talk about the ankle, but it's obvious it has
affected him.
</P>
<P>
   The ankle is so swollen that the bone that shows on the outside
of a normal ankle is invisible on Vaughn's. But he insists on
avoiding the topic _ even when he's booed by Edison Field fans.
</P>
<P>
   The boos aren't overwhelming, but they are noticeable _ nearly
every time he makes an out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into this situation to succeed,'' Vaughn said. ``Nobody
is more unhappy when I fail than me. I've played in a tough
environment before. I don't expect fans and people on the outside
to understand what I've gone through all season. People throughout
the organization and baseball understand what I've gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has played in 130 of the Angels' 153 games, but he says
now he probably would have been better off breaking the ankle
rather than spraining it when he fell into the dugout on opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I broke it, I would have been out six weeks and that would
have been it,'' he said. ``But I'm still glad I played. I still was
able to do some damage on one leg. That's how I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn says the ankle will be 100 percent by next spring. He's
going back to North Easton, Mass. for the winter, where he'll
receive therapy on the ankle once a week and do lots of leg work in
the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back home will get me tough again,'' he said. ``It helps
you appreciate the situation you're in here. Going home gets you
rejuvenated for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   As for 1999, Vaughn said, ``Everybody in the organization
shouldn't focus on the season, but we should remember it. Nobody
should forget what this season felt like.''
</P>
<P>
   __ NOTES: Angels starting pitcher Jarrod Washburn gave up four
runs and six hits in 62/3 innings. He was in line to get his third
victory in his past four starts. He's pitched into the sixth inning
in all four.
</P>
<P>
   Gary DiSarcina has hit home runs before, a few anyway, but none
like the one he hit off Jeff Sparks of the Devil Rays in the sixth
inning Tuesday night. That one went into the rock formation in
left-center field, 400-plus feet from homeplate.
</P>
<P>
   It had been more than a year since his previous homer, but this
one was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him hit home runs before, but they were line drives
down the left-field line,'' Angels interim manager Joe Maddon said.
'' I've never seen him hit a ball like that, not even in the minor
leagues. Not that high and the far. Maybe it's the metal plate he's
got in his forearm. The bionics are working for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival got his 31st save Tuesday night by striking out
Jose Canseco, Fred McGriff and Herbert Perry _ all three on called
third strikes.
</P>
<P>
   '' I think a couple pitches were three digits (100 mph),''
Maddon said. '' You could see the ball jumping out of his hand. We
saw the first pitch and I said, `Whoa!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Percival said Tuesday's game marked the first time he's hit 100
mph on the radar gun this season.
</P>
<P>
   With today's day off, Maddon said he will skip Mike Fyhrie's
spot in the starting rotation. The rotation for the three-game
series in Seattle will be Brian Cooper on Friday, Chuck Finley on
Saturday and Ramon Ortiz on Sunday.

ACCUSED MADAM APPEARS AT PRELIMINARY HEARING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles police detectives laid their trap for
accused madam Jody Babydol Gibson with a ruse _ a telephone call
from Taylor, a Redondo Beach blonde eager to work as a high-priced
prostitute, officers testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, however, that the bubbly voice of ``Taylor'' was
really that of undercover police Officer Cynthia Neff, who quickly
earned Gibson's trust last fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Neff testified on the first day of Gibson's
preliminary hearing, staring straight ahead as she outlined how the
prostitution empire catered to the rich and famous from Los Angeles
to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a tape recorder, Neff met Gibson in Du Par's Restaurant
in the Studio City community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley to
discuss details of the escort service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average on calls was about $500, but most clients were
$1,000 _ all calls were sex,'' Neff recounted Gibson saying on Oct.
1, 1998. ``She also gave me a list of rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The typed, two-page rules, introduced into evidence by
prosecutors, urged the call girls to supply their own condoms and
not negotiate prices with clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``And never solicit clients due to the fact that undercover
police officers commonly do that,'' Neff said.
</P>
<P>
   Neff said she surreptitiously recorded several conversations
with Gibson through March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Richard Walmark
built his case by playing those tapes for Van Nuys Municipal Court
Judge Gregg Marcus, who will decide whether there is enough
evidence for Gibson to stand trial on 13 felony counts of pimping
and pandering.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson could face up to 23 years in prison if convicted on all
counts. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, her attorney, Gerald Scotti, said he was
unimpressed by the undercover officer's testimony and was eager to
cross-examine her when the hearing resumes this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That testimony was very lacking in specifics, and specifics
are the very important part of this case,'' Scotti said outside
court.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, an aspiring pop singer, came to court Wednesday in a
low-cut black dress covered by a peach-colored jacket that matched
her lipstick, purse and high-heeled shoes. Her entourage included
two attorneys, a bodyguard, publicist and boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Scotti said he wants to force Gibson's accusers _ six women who
allegedly worked for her as prostitutes _ to testify at the
preliminary hearing. A hearing on whether the judge will allow
those women to testify is scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Gibson's clients included Hollywood actors,
Fortune 500 executives and even a professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Several documents, including a spiral notebook, calendar and
paper marked ``new list'' were introduced as evidence, but
prosecutors would not say if they included a client list or
so-called black book.
</P>
<P>
   Those documents were not immediately available to the public,
and both the defense and prosecutors said they would not release
the names of any of Gibson's alleged clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no desire to in any way ruin somebody else's life,''
Scotti said. ``I intend to protect that information.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting at Du Par's, Gibson said she would take
40 percent of the profits, while the prostitute got 60 percent,
Neff said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, who lives in Palo Verde near the California-Arizona
border, also explained that the cash should be sent to her by
courier in envelopes marked ``photos _ do not bend.''
</P>
<P>
   In later meetings, the two women discussed travel arrangements,
how clients selected girls by browsing their pictures on the
Internet, and what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   By May 31, in the last undercover tape recording, Gibson had
grown testy that Neff, posing as Taylor, had not followed through
yet with any clients including a job that would take her to Denver
and New York and net $4,000 over three days.

LONG NIGHT AT SAFECO DROPS M'S TWO GAMES UNDER .500 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The caution lights came out on the Mariner 500 once
again Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With no pennant to shoot for, the best the home club can hope
for is a break-even finish or better. But playing to a standoff has
been no guarantee either.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for the .500 level for the 24th time this season, the
Mariners settled for worse than mediocre Wednesday at Safeco Field.
They got lapped 12-6 by those Monsters of the Midwest, the Kansas
City Royals, before 38,016 unamused fans.
</P>
<P>
   Two-run home runs by Sal Fasano and Jermaine Dye helped send
Mariners rookie John Halama to an early shower and get the rout
started. Kansas City starter Jay Witasick (9-11) then did his best
Pedro Martinez imitation, striking out nine batters in 61/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the visitors, a fearsome 31 games under .500
themselves, to take the series, 2-1, and wrap up the season series,
7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the evening from being a total loss was Ken Griffey Jr.,
who cranked his 48th homer, a two-run shot to straightaway center
in the seventh _ leaving him two shy of the 400 level and tied with
Dale Murphy for 31st on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey homered in all three games in the series.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, the Mariners don't play Thursday and have
just 10 games remaining on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Through 152 games, the local guys have spent just 54 of them at
the .500 mark or better. The club has owned a winning record for
only 31 games, with a 35-31 mark on June 16th its high-water mark.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing the Mariners did Wednesday indicated they deserve a
better fate. Particularly on the mound, where they used six
different pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   While Halama wasn't sharp, two of his successors, Ken Cloude and
Denny Stark, were simply awful. Another reliever, Jose Paniagua,
walked off in mid-batter, aggravating a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners kept the Royals in a scoreless tie through two
innings before Halama let a few pitches get away and paid dearly.
The Royals' Mark Quinn led off the third with a single to center.
One out later, Fasano, Kansas City's No. 9 hitter, drove a Halama
pitch deep into the right-field seats for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Halama had a worse time in the fourth. The Royals' Carlos
Beltran reached on an infield hit and Dye followed with a homer to
left, Mike Sweeney tripled and Joe Randa brought in Kansas City's
fifth run with a sacrifice fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   During this time, the Mariners' only response was Raul Ibanez's
run-scoring single in the third, bringing in David Bell, who led
off the winning with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude, the M's once-brilliant mound prospect, continued his
downward spiral. Somehow, his five perfect innings and six no-hit
innings against Chicago in his '97 big-league debut seem a lifetime
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Royals, Cloude retired his first batter. In rapid
fire, he was touched for a pair of singles, a walk, another single
and a fifth single before leaving a beaten man, his head down as he
ran off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Stark, wasn't much better. Making his second
big-league appearance, Stark got four outs before going completely
sour in the seventh inning and giving up three runs. Paniagua tried
to clean up Stark's mess, but four batters into it, he walked
gingerly to the dugout with trainer Rick Griffin, leaving with a
3-2 count on Rey Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Only Steve Sinclair improved his standing with the club. He
ended the seventh inning mess, getting a fly ball with the bases
loaded, and struck out the side in the eighth. By that time, the
Mariners trailed a miserable 12-1.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey got Witasick removed from the mound in the bottom of the
seventh when he followed an Alex Rodriguez sacrifice fly with a
booming homer to center. Two more, and the slugger becomes only the
second player to reach 50 homers in at least three consecutive
seasons. Mark McGwire is the other, doing it four times, including
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The home club, using replacments throughout the lineup, pushed
across two more runs in the eighth. Charles Gipson drove in one,
Ozzie Timmons the other, both with singles.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners finish up their Safeco Field portion of the
schedule with a three-game series against Anaheim, beginning Friday
night.

U.S. RYDER WIN NOT A SURE THING
</HEADLINE>
 WITH CORRECTIONS (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most intriguing golf tournament of the year will be played
this week at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., where the United
States tries again to wrest the Ryder Cup from Team Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Yanks to have as much trouble this time as they did
in 1997 at Valderrama in Sotogrande, Spain, and in '95 at Oak Hill
in Rochester, N.Y. _ both events won by the Europeans, who have
captured or retained the Cup in five of the past seven of these
biennial meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans again are the favored team, some would say heavily
favored, led by the undisputed best player in the world _ Tiger
Woods _ while the Europeans are awash with first-time Ryder Cup
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds as daunting for the Europeans as the pretournament
sentiment at Valderrama, where they prevailed as much because of
the leadership and attention to detail of their cheerleading
captain, Seve Ballesteros, as for their shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder lore has it that Seve prepared so meticulously he even had
his players sand the bottom of their shoes before attending a
prematch poolside party _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, '97 American captain Tom Kite had a difficult time
getting his team to practice much at Valderrama before the Ryder
Cup. The current American team, coached by Ben Crenshaw, was
embroiled, as recently as last month, with the issue of whether
Ryder participants should be paid more than expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should be. Or the charities of their choice should
receive a contribution. Why should the PGA of America get richer
and the players who attract all that television money have no say
in the split?
</P>
<P>
   But why did the issue become an issue so shortly before the
competition? It was enough to tick off the gentlemanly Crenshaw _
and it did.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's history. For years the U.S. dominated, leading to
expectations of victory in a series the Yanks led 23-3-1 before the
Europeans launched their comeback in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are gone. And if the residue benefits either
side, it would seem to be the once-downtrodden Europeans, who have
claimed the Cup in '85, '87, '89, '95 and '97 _ the past two times
as underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the choice here is Team Europe. I'm picking
the favored Yanks _ just saying it will go down to the final
matches, despite those seven European Ryder rookies.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope it's Woods vs. Sergio Garcia in one of those final
matches. The drama and entertainment of that duel might rival the
team showdown.
</P>

VAUGHN LEADS ANGELS (writethrough) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It might be cruel to say the Anaheim Angels
register Mo Vaughn's time to first base with a sundial, but it
wouldn't be too far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was the Angels' designated hitter for the third game in a
row Wednesday night against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays because in the
past few days, he's had a flare-up of the staph infection in his
right shin that sent him to the hospital in early August.
</P>
<P>
   But while Vaughn might have trouble carrying his 260-pound frame
around the bases, he found a good way to do it without getting
thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn blasted a 432-foot homer with two on and two out in the
fifth inning to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead and propel the
Angels to an 8-5 victory before 16,801 at Edison Field. Vaughn had
three hits, including a two-run double in the eighth inning that
gave for the season. It is Vaughn's fifth 100-RBI season of his
career and he becomes the 13th Angels player to reach 100.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who also leads the team with 29 homers, will be back in
his normal spot at first base Friday when the Angels play in
Seattle, but this season has been anything but normal for Vaughn,
who came to Anaheim from Boston after signing a six-year, $80
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who took a .304 lifetime batting average into this
season, took a .271 average for 1999 into Wednesday's game. It has
been a disappointing year for the former American League MVP, and
for the Angels as a whole. But considering what Vaughn has been
dealing with all season, the fact that he reached 100 RBI and is
closing in on 30 homers is relatively satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred RBIs is more important that 30 homers,'' Vaughn
said before the game. ``It's a benchmark, no doubt about it. You
miss 30 days of the season, that (100 RBIs) is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's left ankle is feeling the best it has since he sprained
it on opening night, but it's only 75 percent at best. He doesn't
like to talk about the ankle, but it's obvious it has affected him.
</P>
<P>
   The ankle is so swollen that the bone that shows on the outside
of a normal ankle is invisible on Vaughn's. But he insists on
avoiding the topic _ even when he's booed by Edison Field fans. The
boos aren't overwhelming, but they are noticeable _ nearly every
time he makes an out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into this situation to succeed,'' Vaughn said. ``Nobody
is more unhappy when I fail than me. I've played in a tough
environment before. I don't expect fans and people on the outside
to understand what I've gone through all season. People throughout
the organization and baseball understand what I've gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has played in 130 of the Angels' 153 games, but he says
now he probably would have been better off breaking the ankle
rather than spraining it when he fell into the dugout on opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I broke it, I would have been out six weeks and that would
have been it,'' he said. ``But I'm still glad I played. I still was
able to do some damage on one leg. That's how I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn says the ankle will be 100 percent by next spring. He's
going back to North Easton, Mass., for the winter, and will receive
therapy on the ankle once a week and do lots of leg work in the
weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back home will get me tough again,'' he said. ``It helps
you appreciate the situation you're in here. Going home gets you
rejuvenated for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   As for 1999, Vaughn said, ``Everybody in the organization
shouldn't focus on the season, but we should remember it. Nobody
should forget what this season felt like.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Angels starting pitcher Jarrod Washburn gave up four
runs and six hits in 62/3 innings to get the victory, improving to
3-4. He's pitched into the sixth inning or longer in each of his
past four starts and has an ERA of 3.54 during that time. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Gary DiSarcina has hit home runs before, a few anyway, but none
like the one he hit off Jeff Sparks of the Devil Rays in the sixth
inning Tuesday night. That one went into the rock formation in
left-center field, 400-plus feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   It had been more than a year since his previous homer, but this
one was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him hit home runs before, but they were line drives
down the left-field line,'' Angels interim manager Joe Maddon said.
``I've never seen him hit a ball like that, not even in the minor
leagues. Not that high and that far. Maybe it's the metal plate
he's got in his forearm. The bionics are working for him.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival got his 31st save Tuesday night by striking out
Jose Canseco, Fred McGriff and Herbert Perry _ all three on called
third strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a couple pitches were three digits (100 mph),'' Maddon
said. ``You could see the ball jumping out of his hand. We saw the
first pitch and I said, `Whoa!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Percival said Tuesday's game marked the first time he's hit 100
mph on the radar gun this season. . . .
</P>
<P>
   With today's day off, Maddon said he will skip Mike Fyhrie's
spot in the starting rotation. The rotation for the three-game
series in Seattle will be Brian Cooper on Friday, Chuck Finley on
Saturday and Ramon Ortiz on Sunday.

VALDES LOSES ANOTHER ONE-RUN GAME (WRITETHROUGH)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The reason pitching coach Claude Osteen has been
so frustrated with Ismael Valdes was on display in the Los Angeles
Dodgers' 5-4 loss to San Francisco at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that Valdes pitched poorly. In fact, it was the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Valdes overwhelmed the Giants during his six innings.
He allowed two runs that could have been avoided had second baseman
Eric Young been able to handle a diving stop cleanly and throw to
first.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, the king of one-run losses this season, left with a
one-run lead only to have the bullpen blow it by allowing three
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' Osteen said. ``That's the kind of
pitcher I knew he can be, and he should be proud of himself because
he should have gotten a taste of how much fun it can be when you
have that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more of what Valdes did during his first 28 starts this
season, and in no way resembled the pitcher who was shelled in his
last three outings. During that span he allowed 20 runs on 24 hits
in 10 innings. Yet, this was a typical result on a night Valdes
pitches. He didn't figure in the decision, but the Dodgers fell to
9-23 in games he starts. Fifteen of Valdes' starts ended in one-run
decisions, and the Dodgers have won just two of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the pitcher I saw most of the year,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``If he hadn't had rough outings his last three
times out, I probably would have let him bat with two outs (in the
sixth) and pitch the seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Valdes' best effort in three weeks, the Giants put off
the inevitable clinching of the NL West by the Arizona Diamondbacks
by tagging reliever Alan Mills for two runs in the seventh and then
breaking a 4-4 tie on Brent Mayne's RBI single in the eighth off
Pedro Borbon (4-3).
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner (5-11) got the win in relief and Rob Nen recorded
the last three outs for his 37th save.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year Diamondbacks can clinch a tie for the NL West
today if the Dodgers beat the Giants in the finale of the four-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   While the Giants cling to any faint hope, the Dodgers' season
long ago was transformed from the team aspect to individual
accounts of possible positives in a season of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who is 9-14, felt the wrath of Osteen after the Dodgers
right-hander was bombarded for eight runs in two innings in an
18-10 loss to Colorado last Friday. A season that started so right
_ 3-0 through April _ began sputtering into oblivion when he
allowed six runs in three innings in Florida on Sept. 6. Five days
later he allowed six runs in five innings against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Osteen then said Valdes' problems were in his head, and he
needed to be tougher mentally to reach the potential his gifted
right arm dictates he should reach. Johnson, however, said Valdes
doesn't have anything to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocket (Valdes) doesn't need to show me anything,'' Johnson
said. ``Rocket pitched great all year. He gave me a lot of innings,
a lot of quality starts. He can pitch. He's not a concern of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes started off with a flurry against the Giants, retiring
the first six batters he faced. The last four were by strikeout. He
fanned seven, allowed four hits and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The control I had, the command I had with my pitchers, it
helped me,'' Valdes said. ``That was the key, getting ahead in the
count and hitting the corners.''

NATIONAL ANGLING EVENT MIGHT BE ON WAY OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fall for outdoorsmen is ushered in by deer season, waterfowl
hunting, rockfishing . . . and, most important, the state's
biannual Free Fishing Day.
</P>
<P>
   That day is Saturday, when the usual requirement of possessing a
fishing license is waived in an attempt to draw more people into
the wonderful world of angling. So, yes, Virginia, there is such a
thing as a free lunch _ if you actually catch something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows for the opportunity to learn and enjoy the
experience of fishing . . . because it's free. To see how you like
the sport before investing more time and money,'' said Elaine
Fischer, a fish and wildlife interpreter in the Department of Fish
and Game's Long Beach office.
</P>
<P>
   And if the only day of the year you decide to fish is Saturday,
it represents a savings of $27.55 on an annual resident
sport-fishing license (or $10 for a two-day license).
</P>
<P>
   It's the DFG's version of a get-out-of-jail-free card, except,
I'll have you know, that all other fishing rules regarding such
things as angling hours, bait restrictions and size and possession
limits still apply to any waters where fishing is permitted. So
brush up on the DFG's ``Sport Fishing Regulations'' handbook if
you're at all in doubt. (Anglers 15 and younger get a year-round
reprieve, never needing to have a fishing license.)
</P>
<P>
   Free fishing is the great news. The bad news is that the brakes
are being applied to fall's national equivalent of Free Fishing
Day. Unfortunately, National Hunting and Fishing Day is being
phased out by its organizers. But more on that later; I'm
definitely the type of guy who likes the good news before the bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is designed by the DFG as a way to ensure its future.
The notion is that by bringing in new blood, fishing will continue
to flourish. Sage wisdom. My applause.
</P>
<P>
   To court prospective anglers, a free catfishing derby is slated
Saturday from 8 to 11 a.m. at La Mirada Park Lake, 13701 S. Adelfa
Ave. in La Mirada.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can borrow a loaner rod and reel,'' Fischer said. ``Many
people get very interested that way in a sport they've never tried
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Trophies will be doled out to youngsters with the heaviest
catches. A complimentary pancake breakfast will kick the event off
at 7 a.m. Information: (626) 333-1369. (See Page 14 for a map and
listing of other fishing holes.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the second part of the annual equation for this
special fourth Saturday of September has traditionally been
National Hunting and Fishing Day. Designated in 1972 by
then-president Richard Nixon, it was set aside to encourage
participation, conservation and safety in outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   But the 28th annual festivity has lost its luster. Its sponsor,
the National Shooting Sports Foundation, is phasing out National
Hunting and Fishing Day in favor of another program called Step
Outside. Step Outside invites experienced recreationists to bring
uninitiated friends and family members on hunting, shooting and
fishing excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(National Hunting and Fishing Day) is one day of the year and
Step Outside is more encompassing,'' explained National Shooting
Sports Foundation spokeswoman Colleen Swain.
</P>
<P>
   That might be true, but methinks you can't underestimate that
unique day.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, details on such essential matters as what states
honor National Hunting and Fishing Day and where events are being
staged were provided. Apparently that's a thing of the past.
``We're cutting down, that's basically why,'' Swain said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a shame, for example, that NHFD's national director,
C.D. ``Chris'' Chaffin, chose this particular week to be away from
the National Shooting Sports Foundation's Newtown, Conn.,
headquarters and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Swain remains upbeat about NHFD. ``I don't think interest will
dwindle,'' she said. ``Those sportsmen's clubs and individuals who
promote these things will continue to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several states likely will carry the National Hunting
and Fishing Day flame, but when the coach loses interest in the
remainder of the season, it's hard to rally the team.
</P>
<P>
   Call the National Shooting Sports Foundation at (203) 426-1320
to get involved in next year's National Hunting and Fishing Day, if
it's still around then. &QL;

FINER FISHING PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY RYCHNOVSKY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; With the auto-everything cameras of today, anyone can take
excellent photos. The camera's auto-exposure assures your photos
won't be too light or too dark and the auto-focus makes them sharp.
An enlargement from even a budget, or point-and-shoot camera can
appear as if it is the product of an expert photographer.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't you get the great shot of your catch on your last
fishing trip?
</P>
<P>
   For most of us it is because we didn't take our camera, didn't
use it or didn't apply a few simple procedures that can turn our
snapshots into images we want to hang on our walls. The classic
photo is of an angler with his or her fish.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips that should enhance your chances of snapping
the best photo of that composition:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
+++ Focus carefully
</P>
<P>
   Even the best cameras can produce an out-of-focus photo. If you
want to focus on a fish but the focusing spot (usually in the
center of the view finder) is on mountains in the background when
you take the photo, the mountains will be in focus while the fish
and the person aren't.
</P>
<P>
   For most cameras, push the exposure button (also the shutter)
down lightly while pointing the focus spot on the fish to focus;
keep light pressure on the exposure button to hold the focus on the
subject, while you recompose your photo. Then push the button down
to expose the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Where should you focus when taking photos of an angler with a
fish?
</P>
<P>
   Usually the most important thing is the fish, so focus on it; if
the fish is at an angle where it won't all be in focus, focus on
its eye.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
+++ Plain backgrounds show off subject
</P>
<P>
   A photo should tell a story that is very simple. The first
glance at the photo should focus attention on what is important;
anything that distracts from the subject harms the photo.
</P>
<P>
   The most important part of the photo is the fish and the angler.
The rod, lures, and maybe a net add a story element. Everything
else should be out of sight. Move the angler to avoid other people
or beer or soda cans in the photo. Move fishing rods away from
behind the angler so they don't appear to be sticking out of his or
her head.
</P>
<P>
   And compose your photo against a simple, pleasing background.
Water, mountain scenery and blue sky all make good backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
+++ Lighting, lighting, lighting
</P>
<P>
   Good lighting is what makes a good picture, so pay attention to
the sun's positioning. Lighting is much better early morning until
9 and late in the day after 3; shadows aren't as harsh and don't
cover as much of the face.
</P>
<P>
   If you must shoot at midday, use a fill flash to get an
acceptable photograph. Actually, a fill flash will improve most
fish-and-person photos, especially close-ups. On most cameras,
change the flash setting to fill or ``ff'' to get fill flash.
</P>
<P>
   The flash on the face softens the shadows. It may also produce a
glint in the eye _ a reflection of the flash in the fish's eye and
the person's eye. That little glint gives the subjects life and
improves the picture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
+++ An outdoor setting is best
</P>
<P>
   For the best photos, shoot as soon as you catch a fish.
Fresh-caught fish look alive and colorful, unlike those of bland
subjects that have been in the cooler too long. If you must wait
until you get home to take a photo, use the above suggestions to
create a decent photo at trip's end. For example, snap the shot in
front of a plain wall, not the refrigerator or a window in your
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
+++ Proper perspective
</P>
<P>
   The fish is the primary subject and the angler is secondary, but
a fish can look small when compared with a person. To emphasize the
fish _ and make it appear larger _ have the angler hold the fish
out in front and use a wider-angle lens, such as a 28 mm or 35 mm
on a 35 mm camera. Position the angler as comfortable as possible;
don't have the person hold the fish at arm's length because that's
an unnatural pose.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
+++ Tell a story
</P>
<P>
   Try composing your photo so that the angler is lifting the fish
from the net or showing it to a friend. Leave the lure in the
fish's maw or re-hook it, so that the bait used shows in the photo.
Many successful photos also show the angler holding the fishing rod
in one hand and the fish in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Take some photos of the angler looking at the fish and some of
him or here looking at the camera. That way you'll have more
options to see which you like best. Have the angler smile but also
take photos with a more sober look. Bottom line: Take many photos.
(Of course, that technique may not be the best for
catch-and-release fishing, when the game's survival depends largely
on a delicate touch and being quickly thrown back.)
</P>
<P>
   __ Tip: If you do nothing more than pose your subject in front
of a clean, uncluttered background and use fill in flash, you will
take photos you will be proud to display. Make reprints and
enlargements of your best shots and toss the others in the round
file.
</P>
<P>
   No one need know that not all of your photos are great. &QL;

NEW BIKES OFFER MORE COMFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Way back in the early 1980s, a little something
called the mountain bike took the industry by storm, changing
forever the face of cycling. Sales like never before made bike
companies fat and happy; recreational cyclists hit the streets and
trails in droves.
</P>
<P>
   With refinements comes a new breed of bike, one that both
returns to the roots of mountain biking while embracing nearly
every facet of modern bicycle technology for a refined ride. It is
called, simply, the ``comfort bike'' _ a two-wheeled version of a
posh, trendy sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comfort bike is what most people are looking for in a
bicycle,'' said Michael Thomas of Michael's Bicycles in Newbury
Park. ``It's comfortable, easy to ride and can go just about
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The comfort bike is a classic marriage of history and
cutting-edge workmanship.
</P>
<P>
   While the inception of the mountain bike allowed more riders to
take to the hills, its real success was due to the comfortable
upright riding position, wide-range gearing and easy-to-use
controls for all-around riding _ a welcome alternative to the
hunched-over position of the traditional ``10-speed racer.''
</P>
<P>
   And pot holes? Forget about it! Wide, knobby tires rolled over
just about anything in their path. Is it a coincidence that just a
few years later the SUV would emerge as one of the most popular
cars of all time?
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after its introduction, the mountain bike still
holds a commanding lead in total bicycle sales. As is the wont of
bicycle enthusiasts, people have been tinkering with the mountain
bike ever since its inception, which seems natural, as the mountain
bike was born from tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   First there came the cross-bike, or hybrid _ a blend of the
mountain bike's ``control center'' and the road bike's frame and
wheels. Next on the hit parade was suspension. All the while,
component manufacturers have been improving materials and function
of brakes and drivetrains.
</P>
<P>
   For example,the riding position of most mountain bikes today is
much more upright than in years past. Except for cross country
racing mountain bikes, which require an aggressive rider position,
most recreational mountain bikers prefer a less leaned-over
attitude. Enter the comfort bike, which takes that concept a step
farther. A few steps, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bike mimics a mountain bike, specific frame
geometries have been incorporated to accommodate a variety of
comfort features.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a higher head tube _ the front of the bike where
the fork attaches to the frame _ creates a more upright ride and
stable handling. And a sloping top tube and shorter seat tube
provide better inseam clearance. The lower seat tube also
accommodates a shock-absorbing seat post _ standard equipment on
most of today's comfort bikes. Couple that with a padded saddle fit
with springs, and your rear end never had it so soft.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how much you want to spend _ around $400 for a
well-equipped comfort bike _ you can get front suspension, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another tricky little feature that has emerged lately is the
adjustable handlebar stem. A quick turn of a bolt easily raises or
lowers the handlebar height for a custom fit. There are now even
fully automatic multi-speed drivetrains for the
derailleur-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the real appeal of the comfort bike?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Sport Comfort line is oriented toward the rider who isn't
ready to accept that middle age has crept up and the waist band
needs to be a little bit more elasticized than before,'' said Matt
Vanenkevort, senior product manager for Raleigh Bicycles. ``They
want a bike that is a little more aggressive than a cruiser, yet
has the comfort features that will make riding fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamis Bicycles spokesman Greg Padley agreed. ``The best thing
about the comfort bike is that it is getting more people out riding
bicycles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't find on a comfort bike is knobby tires. Fat, yes;
rough rolling, no.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort bike tires are smooth on the street yet have a bit of
bite for when the going gets a little more uneven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comfort bike is in essence the bicycle version of the
luxury sport utility vehicle,'' said Steve Cuomo, GT Bicycles' vice
president of product development. ``But, moreover, it is a tribute
to the versatility the mountain bike.''

BUDGET SURPLUS MAY GO DOWN DRAIN AS CONGRESS SPENDS IT ALL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Even as congressional Republicans and President
Clinton fight over what to do with a projected $1 trillion, 10-year
budget surplus, they are all but ensuring that it won't be there.
<P>
   As Congress races to complete this year's spending bills, both
sides are on track to spend every penny of the first installment of
the surplus, $14 billion, next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What surplus?'' asked Rep. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican
vainly battling his own party to restrain spending. ``There isn't
going to be any surplus because it's all being spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans conceded last week that they will break the spending
caps they and Clinton agreed to just two years ago in the
ballyhooed 1997 Balanced Budget Act. To a large extent, those caps
provide the basis for projections of a steadily accumulating
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   For the surplus to build, each year the government must save
that year's accumulation. This year it's $14 billion, next year
it's $38 billion, rising to $178 billion by 2009. Any year that's
missed requires saving even more the next to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unlike losing weight,'' said Bob Bixby, policy
director of the Concord Coalition, a budget watchdog group. ``You
have to stick to the diet in early months to get the payoff. If
they don't do the tough things this year, it simply makes the
projected surplus all the more unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months after the Congressional Budget Office
released its projection of a possible $1 trillion surplus over the
next decade, both parties are spending the surplus as fast as it
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   The money is not going to the costly new prescription drug
benefit for Medicare that Clinton wants, or &LR; nor is it going to the
$792 billion tax cut that Republicans advocate. Instead, it is
funding regular government operations from national parks to the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, only various bookkeeping contortions _ from huge
``emergency'' spending bills to ``forward funding'' that robs next
year's budget _ will prevent Congress from dipping into the $2
trillion projected Social Security surplus that both sides have
declared sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, success in ending chronic deficits appears to be
fueling the drive to recreate them. The very existence of projected
budget surpluses _ a novelty in modern times _ has undermined
Republican resolve to shrink the size of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sincerely puzzled by the extent to which projections of
very large budget surpluses over a very long time seem to have
eroded fiscal discipline or created a downright feeding frenzy,''
said Carol Cox Wait, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pledges to eliminate government programs, not to
mention entire cabinet departments, have been replaced by urgent
pleas to boost spending on everything from defense to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has promised to veto at least six of this year's
appropriations bills largely because they spend too little, wants
to spend $30 billion more than the 1997 caps allow.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration manages to stay technically within the
budget caps by calling for a 55-cents-per-pack increase in
cigarette taxes and various user fees. Clinton defines these as
``spending offsets'' rather than tax increases and so claims to be
abiding by the 1997 pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hold the line on spending too if I could define taxes
as spending reductions,'' said Peter Sperry, a budget analyst at
the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``If you follow his logic,
all the IRS does when it grabs your paycheck is reduce federal
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Majorities of both parties contend there is nowhere left to cut
in the $1.7 trillion federal budget, which exceeds the entire
economic output of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the biggest bunch of cow (manure) I've ever heard,''
Coburn declared. ``There are 186,000 contract employees just in the
Department of Agriculture. Give me a chance to run that
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn noted that Congress just approved a 4.8 percent pay
increase for federal employees _ more than the 4.4 percent increase
Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal conservatives in both parties are outnumbered by those
who insist the budget is too tight. And given the slim GOP majority
and the defeats Republicans suffered in past budget fights with
Clinton, the GOP is terrified of another one that pits Clinton's
calls to boost spending on education, the environment and Medicare
against Republican calls to cut programs. As a result, the
overriding impulse in both parties now is to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing Republicans want is a confrontation with
Clinton,'' said Allen Schick, a budget expert at the University of
Maryland. ``They've lost all of them thus far.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Steve Moore, a budget analyst with the libertarian Cato
Institute: ``You have some fiscally conservative Republicans who
want to hold the line on these spending promises and you've got
another half who want to go on a big Republican spending spree.
When you've got such a narrrow majority, it makes it extremely
difficult to pass a lean budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Congress and Clinton are breaking their own
self-imposed spending limits is that this is the first year they
actually limit anything.
</P>
<P>
   As budget analysts warned at the time, the 1997 balanced budget
pact was heavily ``backloaded'' over its five-year life; it only
cut spending on paper and only did so in the future. The pact
allowed spending to rise sharply in 1998 and 1999, while promising
unspecified cuts in 2000 through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The future has arrived, and neither side wants to keep the caps.
</P>
<P>
   But lifting them wipes out roughly half the surplus. Congress
also has passed $15 billion in ``emergency spending'' for the war
in Kosovo, military pay increases and disaster relief, and is
planning to spend at least another $7 billion on aid to farmers
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as they eliminate the surplus, both parties continue
to advocate policies _ Clinton's Medicare benefit and Republicans'
tax cut _ that assume it exists. And so long as the economy keeps
growing at a swift 3.5 percent a year, Washington will remain awash
in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surpluses are really contingent mostly on one thing, and
only one thing,'' said Moore, ``and that is the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Budget Office officials also point out that if
Washington somehow manages to leave the enormous $2 trillion Social
Security surpluses relatively intact, big inroads will be made on
paying down the $5.6 trillion national debt. That alone would be a
major accomplishment, budget experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But as to the $1 trillion non-Social Security surplus, few
expect that to be anything more than a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence at all that these folks have the will to
use a trillion dollars over 10 years to buy down the debt,'' said
Wait. ``The administration wants to spend it, the Republicans want
to cut taxes, and if they can't do that, they'll join in the
spending. We just aren't going to have a trillion-dollar surplus
over 10 years, which is a good reason not to spend it.''

PAIN IS BACK, SO RIPKEN TO HAVE BACK SURGERY TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Baltimore Orioles third baseman Cal Ripken
will have to wait until next year to get his 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken is scheduled to undergo surgery at 10 a.m. Thursday to
relieve pressure on a nerve in his back, a problem that has been
with him all year. The surgery will be performed by Dr. Henry
Bohlman, a back specialist, at University Hospitals in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a number of different treatments hoping to
give him some temporary relief,'' Orioles general manager Frank
Wren said. ``We were hoping it wouldn't come to surgery ... But
hopefully this will alleviate the problem and give him some
permanent relief so we can go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Wren said the Orioles hope Ripken can come back at full strength
in 2000. He has been bothered by pain in his back since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout his career he'll have to deal with this to one
extent or another,'' Wren said.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken played against the Rangers on Tuesday, going 1-for-4 with
a second-inning double, but felt spasms in his back after the game
and decided to fly to Cleveland to be examined by Bohlman.
</P>
<P>
   Back injuries forced Ripken on the disabled list twice this
year. He went on the disabled list on April 20 for the first time
in his career and was sidelined until May 13. He came back and
played well, but the problem flared up again after the All-Star
break, and he was on the disabled list for the entire month of
August.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, he hit his 400th career home run on Sept. 2.
Tuesday's double left him nine hits short of being the 24th player
in major-league history to get 3,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken was limited to 86 games and 322 at-bats, but he finished
with a career-high .340 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken played in a record 2,632 consecutive games, a streak that
ended on Sept. 20, 1998.

FIST THINGS FIRST: STARS MUST FIGHT TO HOLD THE CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In local sports, there are many areas of immediate concern. Both
fandom and media are in a constant fret over such items as the
Theatre of the Toe, the Rangers' rotation, Leon's nose, TCU's
quarterback, Nellie's next basketball brainstorm, etc.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of the trivial and fraudulent stuff, which covers all
of the above, including Deion.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In eight days the Stars open their ``Keep the Cup'' campaign. We
are talking genuine world champions here, as opposed to pretenders,
wanna-bes and the Rangers in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coming right up for the Stars are 82 evenings of National Hockey
League high-sticking, slashing, boarding, elbowing, majors, double
minors and game misconducts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that nasty stuff _ actually, a lot of that nasty stuff _
will be aimed in the direction of Mr. Modano, Mr. Nieuwendyk, Mr.
Hull, Mr. Lehtinen, etc.
</P>
<P>
   These are marked men on a marked team. Retaliation from the
Stars will be necessary at times. Probably a lot of times. And
since the Stars aren't exactly peaceniks themselves, there are also
occassions when igniting a little rumble for no reason at all can
light team fires. Go get 'em, Grant Marshall. It's all part of the
NHL code.
</P>
<P>
   But with the regular season fast approaching, coach Ken
Hitchcock continues to make no promises about a goon/fighter/thug
gracing his 23-man squad. Until last weekend, the exhibition season
roster had very limited two-fisted options _ actually, there was
one. Mel Angelstad has fought his way through a lot of hockey
towns, including this one while a member of the Fort Worth Brahmas.
Angelstad was farmed out to Kalamazoo in the first wave of cuts,
although it didn't mean he won't figure in the Stars' plans for
this season.
</P>
<P>
   There are geeky Ghandis among us who tremble at the thought of
hockey fights, and they cite the lack of such activity in the NHL
postseason. This, of course, is true.
</P>
<P>
   But since it will be like next Easter before playoff concerns
need to be addressed, the Stars will skate the next six months with
a bull's-eye pinned to the front and back of their sweaters. They
will take the other club's best shot in every game, and many of
those shots will be from head to toe. Fights will happen. Fights
will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Phoenix Coyotes for one. ``A lot of hate,'' is the
way Hitchcock describes this rivalry. And Edmonton loves to hammer
on the Stars. So does St. Louis with goony Kelly Chase. The
Blackhawks have a collection of bad boys. The
watch-out-for-those-guys list is long for the Stars, and will
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Hitch will fume if you suggest he has an anti-goon bias when it
comes to the Stars. This is a theory that goes back to dumping
Shane Churla after Hitchcock took over as coach three seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed in toughness,'' he said this week.
``You have to have it to win. You get it through team toughness,
which is one of our strengths, and then I think you have to have it
with certain individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is also in total agreement that the Stars will be
seriously tested in the toughness department this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes with the Stanley Cup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's disagreement on the theory that it's not necessarily
good to have a Derian Hatcher as the team policeman. This is based
on Hatcher's value at the blue line _ the Stars don't want him off
the ice for five minutes a pop, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of skilled people who play a physical game,''
Hitchcock said. ``But if it's Derian or anyone else, there comes a
point when the objective amounts to only one thing _ if the job is
there, get it done. The consequences for getting that job done will
not outweight what was needed.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Hitch says anyone should be ready to drop the
gloves at any time. ``For us,'' added Hitchcock, ``it's best to
open every game playing it straight up. But if there's someone on
the other club who doesn't want to play that way, then it must be
dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   And Angelstad?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he figures in our plans,'' said Hitchcock. ``But not just
because he can fight _ we know he can do that. He was probably born
fighting. But when Angelstad is on the ice, he also plays a
reckless style that unnerves people. If he continues to work hard
on his overall game, he can help us with more than just his fists.
And that's what I'm looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be long, and once the season starts it won't take long
before the Stars will be using fists. Exactly where those fists
come from is still under review. nn

GREER TO SIT OUT AS RETINA BRUISE HEALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rusty Greer can live, as he put it, a
``normal life.'' He can drive a car, play video games, watch TV. He
can even take fly balls and batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   But when the sun goes down and the night deepens, he cannot see
well enough to hit a major-league slider or pick up a line drive
coming off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers' starting left fielder was on the bench
Wednesday night instead of playing against the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there's nothing that can be done until whatever's in
my eye goes away,'' Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   He saw ophthalmologist Dr. David Kleiman and retina specialist
Dr. David Callanan on Wednesday, and after a series of tests they
diagnosed his ailment as a bruised retina.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no abnormalities,'' said trainer Danny Wheat, who got
the news from the doctors. ``It's just a bruised retina.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The injury that occurred when he walked into the path of a ball
thrown by Rangers pitcher Rick Helling on Sept. 13 and caused him
to miss six games, and that caused him to leave Tuesday's game
before the fifth inning because he had trouble focusing on the ball
after the sun went down, isn't career threatening. When the bruise
is completely gone Greer's eyesight will be back to normal and
he'll be in the lineup. It could happen Friday, when the Rangers
open an important three-game series against the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is it could take two weeks. Or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to put a timetable on it,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis relieved Greer's fears that he might have suffered
permanent damage. It did nothing for the frustration quotient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustration level rises each time I close my right eye to
see what my left is doing,'' Greer said. ``It's almost like a
camera that's out of focus, and you have to turn it to focus it. It
might take half a second, or it might take two seconds. I have to
really concentrate on what I'm looking at to make it come clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer has had physical injuries before, a strained left oblique
muscle, a sprained left shoulder, a cracked rib, various bumps and
bruises and muscle pulls and twinges common to professional
athletes. The healing process for most of those could be hastened
with rehabilitation exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing that can be done to speed up the recovery
from an eye injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone out and played hurt, with a hurt ankle, a hurt
hamstring, a hurt back, and I know what pain feels like,'' Greer
said. ``But I've never had eye problems. I don't know what
percentage I'm at. But I would think anything less 100 percent with
your eyes is not good.'' \Ntagtop:Simon Gonzalez, (817) 390-7760

COWBOYS OWNER SAYS DEION WILL PLAY AGAINST CARDINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Wednesday
that cornerback Deion Sanders definitely will play when the Cowboys
return to action against the Arizona Cardinals on Oct 3, following
the bye week.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who missed the Cowboys' first two games, has been
sidelined since undergoing surgery to repair torn ligaments in his
great left toe in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion is definitely playing against Arizona,'' Jones said.
``He told me he was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' return couldn't come at a more opportune time,
considering the Cardinals feature one of the league's most potent
passing attacks, led by quarterback Jake Plummer and receiver Rob
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The game will also bring Sanders full circle, since he
originally injured his toe playing against the Cardinals on Nov. 15
last season. Sanders missed the last five games in 1998 before
returning for the wild-card playoff loss to the Cardinals on Jan.

CONFERENCE USA DELAYS EXPANSION DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conference USA presidents plan to discuss expansion during a
teleconference Thursday morning, but they won't decide whether to
expand _ and add TCU and SMU _ until an Oct. 11 meeting in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Mike Slive, who was given the go-ahead Aug. 31 to
research the expansion issue, has just finished gathering
information. As of Wednesday, his report had not been distributed
to the presidents. ``We expect a decision on expansion will be made
at that (Oct. 11) meeting,'' said Dr. Arthur Smith, Houston
president. ``This is a very complicated and far-ranging issue. We
need a great many answers to a great many questions. ``From my
point of view, the primary considerations are financial.'' Among
the expansion-related issues are the financial impact of expanding;
the plusses-minuses of a 12-school, two-division league in football
and a 14-school, two-division league in basketball; how expansion
changes C-USA's revenue sharing; and the amount of the entrance fee
for new schools. ``We feel that it's important for the presidents
to discuss this important issue face to face,'' Alabama-Birmingham
president Dr. Ann Reynolds said. ``From our point of view, we're
still open to the expansion issue and we're supportive of (TCU and
SMU) if it comes down to discussing specific schools.'' Western
Athletic Conference commissioner Karl Benson, who faces another
rebuilding challenge if TCU and SMU leave for C-USA, isn't
surprised that the decision has been delayed. ``We just have to be
patient and operate on their time frame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slive, who is pushing the expansion issue, is expected to add
his arguments during Thursday's call. According to several media
reports, seven C-USA schools are against expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open to expansion, but I would like to have all the
information necessary to make a decision. Some of the non-football
playing schools are very concerned,'' Smith said, referring to
DePaul, Marquette, Saint Louis and North Carolina-Charlotte. ``We
really need to sit down around a table and look each other in the
eye and get all of the concerns on the table.'' nn

WISCONSIN'S DAYNE PILES UP YARDS, NOT WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Dayne doesn't talk the talk. He walks the walk. Or rather,
runs the run.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's senior running back has the best words-to-yards
ration of any running back since Duane Thomas. A man of few words
and many yards, the bulldozer-size Dayne, 5-foot-10 and 260 pounds,
needs 1,193 yards to break the NCAA career rushing record of 6,279
set last season by Texas' Ricky Williams. Four of the past five
players who have set the career rushing record have won the Heisman
Trophy. That, too, is on Dayne's radar screen. A cherished record,
a legendary award. Enough to cause a player to wax poetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that if my team isn't winning, then the record ain't
nothin,''' Dayne said. ``I know if we keep winning, the awards will
come. If we're winning and I get the record, I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne and his fellow Badgers weren't too happy after Saturday's
shocking 17-12 upset loss at Cincinnati. Dayne gained 231 yards,
and needs to average 149.1 yards in the final eight games to
surpass Williams. Wisconsin, which fell from No. 9 to No. 20, will
try to right itself Saturday against No. 4 Michigan, whose defense
will provide Dayne with his first major challenge this season.
</P>
<P>
   In eight regular-season games against ranked teams, Dayne is
averaging 84 yards rushing, compared with an average of 174 yards
in 19 regular-season games against teams that finished with a
losing record. Connect the dots; Dayne has yet to prove he can
dominate a game against a quality opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I like to prove people wrong, go out and show 'em what
I've got,'' Dayne said. ``I hope they don't think I can do things
because then I can get out there and show 'em. This year, I want to
go out and show people I'm a complete back.''
</P>
<P>
   That constitutes a filibuster for Dayne. He speaks like he runs,
in short bursts. He averages about 20 words per question. He would
be a court reporter's favorite witness. One is reminded of the
story of taciturn president Calvin Coolidge (check the encylopedia,
GenXers). At a party, a woman came up to Coolidge and told him she
had a bet that she could make him say more than three words.
Coolidge's reply: ``You lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Around us, he's a regular guy,'' Wisconsin offensive tackle
senior Chris McIntosh said of Dayne. ``I wouldn't describe him as
private. He's humble; he's got a lot of class. He doesn't talk
himself up or anything. He's out there for the good of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an offensive lineman, it's fun to watch him run because he
really takes a physical, blue-collar work ethic. He's got sort of
an offensive linemen's mentality.'' TAILBACK AT LARGE
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin running backs coach Brian White remembers when he got
a tip on a high school prospect. The word was that this kid from
Berlin, N.J., was a 270-pound tailback. Nope, uh uh, White thought,
270 pounds, this kid's a fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate response was, `You are nuts, crazy,''' White
recalls. ``And then I watched the film and I knew the guy was
right. This kid was a tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez won Dayne over when he told the
high schooler that he would get a shot at tailback. A former
Nebraska player and Notre Dame assistant, Alvarez loves to have a
powerful running game. His offensive line routinely averages a
Nebraska-like 300 pounds plus. Add Dayne and the Badgers have a
bruise-inducing ground game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played fullback in high school and lined up about a yard
behind the line of scrimmage,'' Alvarez said. ``He never got up a
head of steam, but he'd go into the pile and the pile would move.
And when he did get out in the open, he'd outrun secondary guys.
You could see his vision and cutting ability. We knew he could run.
He was what we were looking for in a tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne is a nightmare for defenders, particularly the defensive
backs who give up 50 to 60 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to tackle a couch that's going down some
stairs,'' Iowa senior defensive back Matt Bowen said. ``It's not
something you wish to happen. You don't want to be the only guy
between him and the end zone. You try to get low and tackle his
legs; they're like tree trunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's reticence with the media carries over to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knocks you down and just walks away,'' Bowen said. ``You'd
rather a guy say something to you so you could say something back.
And if you do say something, he just looks at you and walks away.
That kinda puts you in your place.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen and other Big Ten Conference defensive backs no doubt
perked up in December when they heard reports about Dayne leaving
early for the NFL draft. Instead of passing up his senior season
for the NFL, though, Dayne decided to return to Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else said I wasn't coming back. I knew what I was
doing,'' Dayne said. ``I wanted to come back and have some fun.`I
don't think I was ready to leave the college atmosphere yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I came back mainly for my daughter. She's too young for
me to be away from her for a year playing in the NFL. That was the
main reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Jada will be 23 months old next month. Her mother, Alia, is a
journalism major at Wisconsin. (Dayne's opening line? ``My name is
Ron.'') Dayne's family is providing financial support. Ask Dayne
why he passed on applying for the NFL draft and the resulting pro
contract and he shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think about the money,'' he said. ``I know it's
not going to go away, disappear.'' QUIET HYPE
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dayne has been this way before. In 1996 he broke the NCAA
freshman rushing record held by Herschel Walker by gaining 1,863
yards. Wisconsin launched a Heisman campaign that lasted about as
long as Lamar Alexander's presidential runs. This season, the
school and Dayne are letting the hype come to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be all hyped up,'' Dayne said. ``I just want
to go out and play. I'd rather have my numbers speak for
themselves. I know if we're not winning, I won't win the Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   As October nears, there is no clear-cut Heisman favorite. Dayne
is near the top of the lists, but not because of cheap yards
against inferior opponents. In the Badgers' victories over Murray
State and Ball State, Dayne didn't pad his stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to build this whole season on him winning the
Heisman or getting the record,'' Alvarez said. ``In our offense,
he'll get enough touches. You can't put your head in the sand.
You're aware of the record and the awards. The record should be
broken in the context of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Texas rallied around Williams' record and Heisman
quest to finish with a surprising 9-3 record. The Badgers hope the
same formula works for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get him those things, but our goal is winning
games,'' teammate Chris McIntosh said. ``If he's playing well
enough to get those yards, I think we'll be doing pretty good as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   While the loss to Cincinnati probably cost the Badgers a shot at
the national championship, Wisconsin can still make a repeat trip
to the Rose Bowl, where Dayne rushed for 246 yards in a 38-31
victory over UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go out and win,'' Dayne said. An eight-word
mission statement. nn

PRESSURE IS PAR FOR RYDER CUP COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Feherty, CBS golf analyst and former Ryder Cup competitor,
has a simple theory about the biennial competition that begins
Friday at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ryder Cup makes great men small and small men great,''
Feherty said. ``It's 72 hours out of your life, and you may not
shut your eyes during that time. If you don't, you still won't be
tired until the matches are finished because adrenalin will carry
you.''
</P>
<P>
   But where will it take you? For unheralded Constantino Rocca,
the extra emotion carried him to a 3-1 record in the 1997 Ryder
Cup, including a singles victory over Tiger Woods. For two major
champions on the U.S. team, Davis Love III and Justin Leonard, the
adrenalin rush backfired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Love (0-4) nor Leonard (0-2-2) won a match at Valderrama
Golf Club in Sotogrande, Spain. The United States fell, 14 1/2 to
13 1/2, with Rocca scoring more points than any member of the U.S.
team.
</P>
<P>
   Feherty said similar surprises will be in store at The Country
Club. But there's no way to predict who destiny will kiss ... or
kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``In golf, your game can totally turn around, for the good or
the bad, over three days. Especially when you add emotion to the
mix,'' Feherty said. ``That's why the Ryder Cup is like Forrest
Gump and his box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Feherty, a Dallas resident who grew up in Ireland and played on
Europe's 1991 Ryder Cup team, going 1-1-1, is one of four Fort
Worth-Dallas residents with Ryder Cup experience who reflected
recently on what makes the event special.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Ryder Cup has exploded in popularity,
going from an event none of the major networks would televise in
1989 to a competition that is expected to draw some of the highest
golf-related ratings in history during the next three days. NBC
paid $13 million for the rights to the 1999 Ryder Cup, and
executives anticipate generating enough advertising revenues to
turn a handsome profit on their investment.
</P>
<P>
   So, what makes the Ryder Cup tick? Close competition, for
starters. Starting with the 1983 Ryder Cup, Europe holds a 4-3-1
edge in the past eight matches. Only one of those matches has been
decided by a margin greater than 15-13. Before 1983, however, the
United States built a 19-3-1 lead in the series and often won by
lopsided margins.
</P>
<P>
   A more-even playing field, Leonard said, produces more-partisan
crowds. To the Ryder Cup rookie, that can be unnerving. That could
hurt a European team that features seven rookies this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play in your first Ryder Cup, especially on foreign soil,
can be a little bit intimidating,'' said Leonard, a Dallas resident
who was winless as a Ryder Cup rookie in 1997. ``Especially when
you hit a poor shot and people applaud. That's something you
usually don't see on the golf course. It's certainly something to
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Trevino, a Dallas resident who played in six Ryder Cups and
served as the U.S. captain in 1985, said the tenor of the matches
has changed considerably since the last time he competed, in 1981.
The 1991 competition, held in Kiawah Island, S.C., was the first to
be carried on network television and was billed as ``The War By the
Shore.''
</P>
<P>
   It ended in dramatic fashion, with Europe's Bernhard Langer
missing a par putt on the final hole to give the Americans a 14 1/2
to 13 1/2 victory. U.S. players celebrated wildly in front of the
NBC cameras after recapturing the cup for the first time since
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, if we didn't get the trophy, we'd all go out
and have a beer. It wasn't that big a deal,'' Trevino said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after the U.S. team lost in 1997, captain Tom Kite was
severely criticized for not getting the most out of his players.
Trevino shakes his head at such criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the strategy talk is overhyped. It's not like a
football coach, where his strategy won the game,'' said Trevino,
noting that golfers control their own games and should be
impervious to outside influence.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, said golf legend Byron Nelson. The Roanoke
resident, 87, competed in two Ryder Cups (1937, 1947) and led the
United States to victory as a captain in 1965. Nelson recalled one
strategic move he made during the event that triggered a major
turnaround in results.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson watched his team of Arnold Palmer-Dave Marr get swamped,
6 and 5, in an alternate-shot match against Dave Thomas and George
Will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his first Ryder Cup, and Dave (Marr) never got the ball
off the ground for the first six holes,'' Nelson said. ``But Arnold
started kidding him, and he loosened up late in the round. So, when
we turned in our afternoon pairings, I figured they would move
Thomas and Will up to their No. 1 team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson opted to do likewise with Palmer and Marr, despite their
dismal morning showing. When his hunch proved correct, a rematch
was set in the afternoon matches. He informed Palmer and Marr of
his decision, playing up the payback opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went straight to the practice tee. They shot a 30 on the
front nine and won, 6 and 5, in the afternoon,'' Nelson said. ``As
a captain, sometimes you get lucky if you guess right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the best-laid plans backfire. But the results will be
remembered forever. Feherty, who fashioned a 1-1-1 Ryder Cup record
in 1991, chuckled when asked if a parallel could be drawn between
circumstances surrounding Jeff Maggert's victory at the 1999 World
Match Play Championship and the pressure he will face at The
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was only for $1 million,'' Feherty said. ``This is going
to feel like he's playing for a whole lot more than that. If you
lose in the Ryder Cup, it's much worse than losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a sobering thought for competitors to harbor during
crunch time at The Country Club. nn

COWBOYS SIGN MYSLINSKI FOR DEPTH ON OFFENSIVE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys signed veteran center-guard
Tom Myslinski Wednesday to improve the depth on their offensive
line, an area of growing concern following injuries Monday night to
starters Erik Williams and Everett McIver.
</P>
<P>
   Both Williams (strained quadriceps) and McIver (strained
hamstring) would be unable to play this weekend if the Cowboys had
a game scheduled instead of a bye, coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Myslinski, 30, who played the 1996-97 seasons in Gailey's
offense as a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers, was a 1992
fourth-round pick of the Cowboys. Rotator cuff surgery limited his
1998 season to four games with the Indianapolis Colts, who elected
not to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Myslinski, the Cowboys waived center-guard Ben
Fricke, a first-year player who unexpectedly made the final 53-man
roster three weeks ago. Fricke was signed early in training camp
when a rash of injuries already had begun on the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best depth and the best talent on the offensive
line in my 11 years here,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said after
Wednesday's signing of Myslinski. ``Tony Hutson can concentrate on
playing guard; (rookie) Solomon Page can go to playing tackle (his
college position), and now we have Myslinski to be the backup
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Myslinski is a well-traveled player. He has had 22 NFL starts
during a seven-year, 41-game career with eight different NFL teams
_ Dallas, Cleveland, Washington, Buffalo, Chicago, Jacksonville,
Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Dallas again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he wouldn't be ready until Oct. 1 because of a
rotator-cuff repair in the off-season,'' Jones of the 6-foot-3,
293-pound Myslinski. ``We've been ready to sign him since the start
of training camp, especially after the injury to (veteran backup
Mike) Kiselak,'' who underwent season-ending reconstructive knee
surgery Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being able to play center or guard, Myslinski will
also serve as Dale Hellestrae's backup on deep snaps. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   A report from The Associated Press that the Cowboys will be
moving their training camp from Wichita Falls to the lower Rio
Grande Valley is, at the very least, premature. ``We're not ready
to make an announcement about our training-camp plans until
mid-October,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Wednesday. ``That
(report) is coming from there,'' he added. ``The people down in the
Rio Grande Valley are very enthusiastic about the Dallas Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie TE Mike Lucky (foot) is expected to play Oct. 3 against
the Arizona Cardinals. The Cowboys went the first two games without
a backup to David LaFleur at blocking tight end. nn

PERSONAL PRIDE DRIVES RUDD'S CUP STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR's normally predictable Winston Cup Series has served up
back-to-back ``feel good'' first-time victories involving rookie
sensation Tony Stewart and veteran journeyman Joe Nemechek.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh faces invading Victory Lane landscapes always are welcomed
this late in the season. But here's a vote for a familiar face to
win at least one race during the season's final two months.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a vote for Ricky Rudd to extend The Streak.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd has won at least one Cup race for 16 consecutive years. It
is the longest active streak in NASCAR's premier series and the
longest of the sport's ``modern era,'' which dates to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's streak began in 1983 with a victory for car owner Richard
Childress, who found fame and fortune with seven-time Cup champion
Dale Earnhardt. Rudd since has added victories while driving for
NASCAR pioneer Bud Moore, NHRA drag racing champion Kenny
Bernstein, high-profile Rick Hendrick _ and most recently _ for
Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   An owner/driver since 1994, Rudd has recorded six of his 20
career Cup victories while racing for Rudd Performance Motorsports.
Rudd never has lit up the scoreboard with wins, like Darrell
Waltrip during his prime, Earnhardt at his intimidating finest or
Jeff Gordon as recently as last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd never has won more than two races in a single season, a
feat he accomplished in 1983, 1986, 1987 and in 1997 in his
signature No. 10 Tide Ford. That is a remarkable run of
consistency, considering that during his tenure as an owner, both
single-car teams ``and'' single-car teams operated by owner/drivers
have become endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd reluctantly joined that list last week, when he abandoned
the idea of finding a replacement for primary sponsor Tide and
signed a multiyear contract with Robert Yates Racing as teammate to
Cup points leader Dale Jarrett. That is a ``feel-good'' story of
its own, because the move will relieve Rudd of the hassles of
running a Cup team day-to-day. And Yates' famed horsepower figures
to make Rudd a bonafide championship contender.
</P>
<P>
   But that will run its course in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's MBNA Gold 400 at Dover Downs International
Speedway in Delaware is the first of eight chances Rudd has to keep
The Streak on the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to go out of here with a win record as an owner _
something that not many owners can say they came in and ran six
years and left with a win record intact,'' Rudd said. ``One thing
is it would show that the people we've got assembled are not
rolling over and giving up. I've never given up on anything I've
ever tried yet. The ownership role didn't take the course I
anticipated, but I'm still fighting it right down to the end to
produce results.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd is mired in 34th in points through 26 events. But Dover's
``Monster Mile'' has been decent to Rudd, who is tied with Mark
Martin among active drivers with four pole positions there. Rudd
also is tied with Bill Elliott for victories among active drivers
at Dover, also with four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ruling out Martinsville,'' said Rudd, who scored his
last Cup victory on the flat half-mile bull ring in his native
Virginia on Sept. 27, 1998. ``But I look at a track like Dover,
that's a strong racetrack. Rockingham (N.C.), Phoenix, Homestead _
I've tested at Homestead (Fla.) and I like that racetrack. I think
the key is being able to have a Robert Yates motor under the hood,
and I don't see that coming for three or four weeks now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Yates will find a way to slip his driver-to-be a
qualifying and/or race engine quicker than all of that. Because it
would look really good for Rudd to bring a 17-year winning streak
over to RYR, and Texaco, next season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   ``And you never know what I might want to do down the road,''
said Rudd, 43. ``Five to 10 years down the road, I might want to be
a 100 percent owner again. And I think that win record _ I wouldn't
say would be money in the bank _ but an asset to you one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just the personal pride, to be honest with you. Forget all
that. It's just personal pride.''
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON...BRUCE ALLEN
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen soon enough to save his sponsorship deal, but
Arlington's Bruce Allen is the latest member of one of drag
racing's exclusive clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's quarter-mile qualifying lap of a career-best 6.905
seconds at 200.17 mph at Maple Grove Raceway on Saturday earned him
a spot in the Speed Pro 200 Mile-Per-Hour Pro Stock Club. Allen is
the 12th member on a list reserved for the first 16 drivers who
surpass that magic barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Allen earned $1,000 and will receive a commemorative ring for
the achievement, which was recorded during the National Hot Rod
Association's True Value Keystone Nationals at Mohnton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not doing it for the money,'' said Allen, who rode the
lap to a season-best fourth qualifying spot. ``You're just trying
to run as fast as you can. Getting in is a prestigious thing, but
it's not the same as being the first person to do it _ like Warren
Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the four-time and reigning Winston Pro Stock champion,
notched the first 200-mph pass in a factory hot rod (200.13 mph) on
April 26, 1997 at Dinwiddie, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows we're making progress with our engine program,''
Allen said, ``and the people at the shop are as responsible as much
as (crew chief) Dave Reher and myself. It's a reward for them to
see some progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Reher, a founding partner of Reher-Morrison Racing Engines, said
he thought the 200 mph mark would have fallen earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been running as good or better than a lot of the cars
already in the club,'' Reher said. ``I'm just glad to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Allen and The Outlaw Fuel Additives Pontiac
Firebird were eliminated in Round 1 by Richie ``The Kid'' Stevens.
Allen said he and Stevens both had completed their burnouts and
were backing up to the starting line when a disabled car at the top
end of the track caused a delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shut us off, and after two or three minutes, we had no
choice but do another burnout,'' said Allen, 49. ``That changed the
clutch dramatically. It went through low gear and then started
wadding the rear tires up. Our setup is a little suspect. And when
we miss it, we shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Allen confirmed that Pennzoil's Outlaw brand will not
renew its two-year sponsorship at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pennzoil wasn't happy with the NHRA TV package,'' Allen said.
``So Eddie Hill, Mike Thomas and us are all looking for sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   MONTOYA NEAR CART TITLE
</P>
<P>
   Prolific rookie Juan Montoya has won three of his Championship
Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series-leading seven races on temporary
street circuits this year. So it is probable that Montoya could
clinch the title at the second annual Texaco Grand Prix of Houston
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya has a 28-point lead (199-171) over second-place Dario
Franchitti heading into the 100-lap/152.7-mile race over 1.527
miles of city streets on Sunday. If Montoya exits Texas with a lead
of 44 or more points, he would clinch and make Target/Chip Ganassi
Racing the first team in series history to win four consecutive
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried not to think about the points,'' said Montoya, who
has six poles and led 929 laps this season. ``But I kind of like
going to races where I've never driven on the course before.''
</P>
<P>
   Race updates are available at www.texacogp.com. RAY EYES IRL
CROWN
</P>
<P>
   Plano's Greg Ray needs to tack 12 points onto his Pep Boys Indy
Racing League lead to clinch his first championship at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of three of the last four IRL events, Ray has forged a
44-point lead (246-202) over runner-up Scott Goodyear heading into
the Vegas.com 500. Ray can clinch the Pep Boys Million if he has a
lead of 56 points after the event on the 1.5-mile LVMS layout. If
not, the championship will be decided at Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   While Ray and Goodyear will occupy most of the attention, only
30 points separate Goodyear from 12th-place Sam Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he plans to attack the race lap-by-lap during the
312-mile/208-lapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a really good job about not thinking about it,''
said Ray, alluding to the championship math. ``Basically, I'm
trying to forget about that stuff as much as I can _ and avoid
questions like this.'' IRL ADDS KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   The under-construction Kentucky Speedway has been added to the
2000 IRL schedule. Florence, Ky., will play host to the inaugural
Belterra Resort 300 at the 1.5-mile trioval on Aug. 27, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The resort, a property of Los Angeles-based Hollywood Park,
Inc., is being built 35 miles south of Cincinnati. The $152 million
motorsports complex will feature the racetrack, seating for 65,000,
50 luxury suites and a glass-enclosed restaurant. The operation can
be expanded to 150,000 seats with 120 luxury suites on a 1,000-acre
site, said businessman/owner Jerry Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky venue joins the Indianapolis 500 on May 28 and
events at Texas Motor Speedway on June 10 and Oct. 15 as the only
officially announced IRL races on the 2000 schedule. CARR CLINCHES
AMA TITLE
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carr secured his second American Motorcyclist Association
Grand National Dirt Track Series title with a victory at the
Sacramento (Calif.) Mile on Saturday night. Carr, of Fleetwood,
Pa., led all 20 laps of the main event around the one-mile Cal-Expo
State Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Carr spent most of last week at Parkland Memorial Hospital in
Dallas with the critically injured Toby Jorgensen and his family.
Jorgensen, 17, was hurt in a wreck at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who rides Harley-Davidsons prepared by Decatur resident
Kenny Tolbert, has been keeping fans and the motorcycle community
updated on Jorgensen's condition through a Web site. Updates can be
found in the forum section of www.flattrack.com. PETREE REGROUPING
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Winston Cup team owner Andy Petree says he was blindsided
by Ken Schrader's decision to leave his team for the No. 36 M&AMP;Ms
Pontiac Grand Prix in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt me personally and took a few days to get over it,''
Petree said. ``But we plan on finishing the season together.''
</P>
<P>
   Petree's No. 33 Chevrolet Monte Carlo is losing its Skoal
sponsorship at season's end and will be replaced by Oakwood Homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Oakwood) signed on with the expectation of Ken Schrader,
or a driver equal to him,'' said Petree, who is rumored to be
considering NASCAR's newest winner, Joe Nemechek, for the ride.
``I've got to put somebody real good in front of Oakwood.'' LAST
WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny has an urgency to make all the right moves to get into
Victory Lane. I don't feel betrayed by any means.''
</P>

SPAHN'S SPAN SPECIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE RICHARDS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ That the winningest lefthanded pitcher in major league
history, Warren Spahn, merely ranks as No. 100 in the Globe's list
of the top New England sports figures of the century speaks volumes
of the region's deep and storied athletic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, 241 of Spahn's 363 career victories came after he and
the Boston Braves left for Milwaukee in 1952, but the crafty
lefthander's legacy in eight seasons here is significant.
</P>
<P>
   No Boston pitcher has won 20 or more games in three consecutive
seasons since Spahn did it from 1949-1951. Spahn led the National
League in strikeouts each of his final four seasons in Boston, his
cumulative ERA over 1,884 innings with Boston was 3.04, and he was
the NL's starting pitcher in the 1949 All-Star Game at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Spahn's impact in Boston would have been greater if his budding
career hadn't been delayed by his service during World War II.
After a late-season call-up in 1942, Spahn didn't post his first
major league win until 1946, at age 25, but he quickly established
himself, going 21-10 with a league-leading 2.33 ERA in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his impressive mound work, Spahn also was
immortalized by, of all things, a six-word poem. Spahn and Johnny
Sain so dominated the Braves' staff in the late 1940s, the
despairing cry of ``Spahn, Sain, and pray for rain'' was coined as
a plea for an extra day's rest for the two workhorses. It seemed to
work in 1948, when the Braves won the NL pennant, the city's last
for 19 years. Cleveland beat Boston in the World Series, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves struggled on the field and at the turnstiles after
that, and the team, Spahn included, headed to Milwaukee after the
1952 season.
</P>
<P>
   Now living in Oklahoma, the 78-year-old Spahn, who was elected
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in
1973, is a regular on the card show circuit. ``He says he's made
more signing autographs than he did during his whole career,'' said
George Altison of the Boston Braves Historical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Spahn was at Fenway this summer for the All-Star Game, where he
was honored as one of the greatest living players. But Altison _
along with other old Spahn fans, no doubt _ had one complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody stuck an `M' on his cap instead of a `B','' Altison
said. ``I couldn't believe it. And in Boston, no less.''

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A catalog of our dreams
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Faye Brown
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   MOUNDVILLE, Ala. _ When I was a child, we used the Sears and
Roebuck catalog for a million things.
</P>
<P>
   It was our guide for the worth of goods when Daddy traded in
town, a reader for learning new words and a dictionary for checking
spelling.
</P>
<P>
   At our house the catalog seldom rested from its rounds. We kids
lolled under the oak in the noonday heat, laughing and sharing the
big book's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woooo, look at this bicycle! Yeah, if the crop brings enough,
Daddy said he's gonna get us one.''
</P>
<P>
   The thoughts of it sent us again and again, vigor renewed, to
fight the weeds on the back forty.
</P>
<P>
   Late on a freezing night our family drew warmth from each other
and the catalog, as we huddled by the dying fire, choosing a new
pair of brogans that Daddy could no longer do without.
</P>
<P>
   My sister and I were among the millions of girls inspired by
cake rouge and silk stockings to graduate high school and leave for
the city.
</P>
<P>
   My brother and his friends took their pocket knives and cut out
the book's pretty girls and their fancy underthings and hid them
under the feather beds.
</P>
<P>
   On the very day when a new wish book came in the mail, the old
one assumed greater worth.
</P>
<P>
   We took cold potatoes to the field and sausage biscuits to
school wrapped in the outdated pages.
</P>
<P>
   We made wads to poke into the broken window panes and choke out
winter's killing breath, and fashioned fans to cool hell's steam
through the hot, dry summer.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog sheets were used to cut dress patterns and to line
the pantry so the canned beans wouldn't freeze in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   We made toys with them: airplanes, kites, little boats and paper
dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves became a hundred things that symbolized the
resourcefulness of my folks. The catalog's uses were as long as our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   When crops failed or cotton prices hit rock bottom, our yearlong
dreams turned dead-gray with the collards in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of the new catalog, in the spring, always
sparked the flames of our indomitable spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Again we asked the banker to ``advance us'' another year, and we
planted our crops, and looked at the wish book, and dreamed of new
dresses.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Americans' problem is behind them
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 26, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you were beginning to think you've read about
everything there is to report, along comes one about derrieres and
the seats people try to squeeze them into. While this has never
been a problem for me _ puny buns _ it seems to have touched
America's nerve, and more.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not certain you need to cite timeworn statistics that show
Americans are getting bigger and fatter. Just look around. In the
park where I walk every morning, it is quite evident. Oh, the
jiggling!
</P>
<P>
   But the statistics are quite amazing. Without citing its source,
a New York Times article the other day reported that the weight of
an average American has increased 10 pounds since 1985. Also, the
number of obese Americans has increased by 50 percent in the last
two decades of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Budweiser commercials are doing better than the
Bud Lite commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Precipitating a discussion of this issue is a reference to the
construction of a new baseball stadium in Boston, to replace the
venerated (and beloved) Fenway Park, which has been in use since
1912. Because of the expansion of the American rear end, the seats
in the new stadium will be 18 or 19 inches wide. At old Fenway,
they are 14 and 15 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has flown coach class, particularly on a long trip,
knows the feeling of being in a cocoon. The Times reported that
seats on Boeing 747s were but 17 inches wide, while seats on the
Airbus A3XX were 18.5 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to my scrawny backside, I've been able to fit into those
narrower seats. Where I have my problem is in leg room.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things I do not understand, however. It is said
that European furniture manufacturers design their U.S.-market
office chairs to be wider than those for the European market. I
have been to Europe. The people are just as fat as we are; maybe
fatter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also puzzled by the American size. Photos of
Victorian-period America, made around the turn of the century, show
a bloated population _ at least those who were photographed.
William Howard Taft, who was president from 1909 to 1913, was so
big that not only could he not come close to fitting into a Fenway
Park seat, but he likely could fill most of the space between first
and second bases.
</P>
<P>
   So many of the surviving photos of that era show bloated males
either in formal poses, or giving political speeches from a stump.
And the ladies: paintings show them to be huge _ everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know when America thinned down. Perhaps it was during
the Depression when there was little to eat. But, according to
statistics, we are fat again _ likely as fat as those of the
beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
   If we've gained an average of 10 pounds since 1985, what's to be
said about Americans' supposed infatuation with diets and exercise?
Everyone seems to be on a diet, drinking diet sodas, eating those
awful diet meals. We are working out in greater numbers, breaking a
sweat like never before.
</P>
<P>
   All those late-night exercise advertorials that promote this way
to tighten your abdominal muscles, that way to slim down your
thighs, to shrink your buns _ someone's got to be watching, and
buying.
</P>
<P>
   So how did we get such wide butts? Maybe it's just from sitting
on them too often; they sort of mash down.
</P>
<P>
   To widen seats in ball parks, on planes and in movie theaters
simply is to facilitate the problem. If it was up to me, I'd scale
the seats down to the 14-inch Fenway Park size and make the people
squeeze in; that would give them cause to think of doing something
about their fat butts.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, we'd better be careful about that. A couple
of years ago, a 300-plus-pound woman sued one of the airlines
because the seat was too small for her massive tush; some sort of
discrimination, she claimed. I don't recall how the case came out
but knowing juries these days, she's likely now living in a condo
in Hawaii _ after first having been flown there in a first class
wide-bodied seat.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lights out for Reform Party
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Complete the following sentence. I would be interested in a
presidential candidate who: 1) would give us a First Model instead
of a First Lady, 2) would be dogged by old photos of himself in a
Speedo and feather boa or 3) thinks _ or at any rate once thought _
the United States should annex western Canada to get more white
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party started out as a cracked egg laid by the
cackling Ross Perot. This time around, it shows signs of frying
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The pity in this theater of political absurdity is that the
party never really honored the many desperately earnest folks to
whom it seemed to promise an alternative to the influence-peddling,
money-grubbing and slick insincerities of workaday politics. How
could it when, at bottom, it was always just the ego trip of a
dingbat billionaire?
</P>
<P>
   Now, what remains of the Reform Party is betraying even the
residual hopes of its best-intentioned folks by going completely
nuts in public.
</P>
<P>
   Defecting Republican perennial Pat Buchanan _ like the boll
weevil, just lookin' fer a home _ hints strongly he will offer
himself for the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With his old plan to nick off western Canada going nowhere _ and
probably moot since so many Asians have immigrated there _ the man
for whom the GOP is too left wing tenders a sour stew of nativism,
isolation, economic nationalism and wistfulness over the nifty
might-have-beens if only the misguided democracies hadn't kept
Hitler from Nazifying Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The natural Reform nominee would be Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura, the party's highest _ and damn near only _ elected
official. But the ex-wrestler isn't throwing his boa in, at least
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, and sensibly aghast at the prospect of Pat the Hun,
Ventura is pushing Donald Trump, New York real estate hustler and
super-model escort. Why? Who knows? Maybe because Trump is
untainted by electoral politics, having limited himself instead to
tainting electoral politics by contributing to the city and state
candidates of both parties who have shown the most promise of being
able to service him.
</P>
<P>
   The Donald's take on The Issues is unknown, but so is George W.
Bush's so what the hey. At least we know Trump's economic policy:
Borrow so much nobody dares foreclose. The nation's cheering
credit-card debtors could carry him to the White House on their
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, still floating around out there somewhere is Perot
himself, presumably able to buy the nomination again if he wishes
but said by some to be awaiting a draft. Even most of his onetime
fans are nailing the windows shut. And if not Trump, maybe actor
Warren Beatty, for whom the Democratic Party is too right wing and
who offers the nation, after eight embarrassing years of an amateur
stud, at least four of a pro.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as though, for real reform, we'll just have to go back
to the democratic grunt work of voting the greater rascals out in
favor of the lesser rascals.

 &HT;    THE BENIGN SIDE OF THE Y2K BUG
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans won't know for another three months
whether the Y2K software problem will cause serious computer
disruptions on New Year's Day, but optimists already are looking
beyond 1-1-00 to see the bright side of the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Given the many headaches that might be caused by Y2K, the rest
of us could be excused for not appreciating its up side just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The programming problem will cause many older computers to
misunderstand dates starting with Jan. 1, 2000. The defect has the
potential to trigger malfunctions in the equipment used to generate
power, control air traffic, deliver water, track billing and much
more.
</P>
<P>
   But the sunny-side-uppers cite three reasons to be grateful for
the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   _ Businesses and governmental agencies have spent tens of
billions of dollars fixing millions of lines of software code to
ensure computers won't malfunction in January. Many older computers
literally have been thrown in the trash and replaced by the latest
models. In many cases, Y2K testing has spurred a top-to-bottom
overhaul of information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department says that business investments in
computer equipment nearly tripled from $38.9 billion in 1990 to $95
billion in 1998. These purchases of new equipment and large
software packages have left many companies with modernized
operations likely to boost productivity early in the next century.
In addition, the Y2K bug is expected to weed out businesses that
have lagged technologically and create more growing room for
advanced companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Optimists say the Y2K threat also is making people more aware
of emergency planning. Each year, millions of Americans find
themselves in potentially dangerous situations caused by
hurricanes, blizzards, earthquakes, fires and other disasters. And
more often than not, families are poorly prepared to cope with
these unexpected events.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the power failed recently for hundreds of
thousands of people along the East Coast during Hurricane Floyd,
many households were caught without flashlights, fresh batteries
and emergency radios.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, head of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, said this year's extensive news coverage of the Y2K
threat is stirring many families to take stock of their emergency
supplies and purchase what they may need, such as battery-operated
smoke detectors, bottled water, kerosene heaters and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use Y2K in an important way,'' he reminded reporters at
a recent Y2K briefing. ``People should be better prepared'' to face
all sorts of emergencies once Jan. 1 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides boosting productivity for businesses and emergency
preparedness for individuals, Y2K also is helping Congress prepare
for the next century, according to Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah,
chairman of the Senate special committee studying Y2K issues.
Bennett said that because of their work on Y2K, committee members
have learned ``how vulnerable we are to computer failure'' caused
by terrorists or criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Y2K bug has been stamped out, he hopes to shift his
committee's focus to increasing the security, privacy and
reliability of the new wired world. In light of all that has been
learned through dealing with Y2K, ``we have to recognize that the
world has changed,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Y2K bug can get fun-loving Americans to plan for bad
events and Congress to recognize the world as it exists, Jan. 1 may

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE EVILS OF A SMOKING GOVERNMENT
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you click your way through cable TV land, you're
bound to run across a World War II movie in which a soldier, dying
for a smoke, smokes while he's dying.
</P>
<P>
   In such scenes, somebody nice, like William Bendix in ``Wake
Island,'' has been mauled by enemy fire and isn't going to make it.
His last words to his squad are punctuated by puffs on a cigarette
being held for him by a buddy.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder what Bill Clinton might be thinking when he
watches such episodes, perhaps late some night at Camp David.
Clinton loves to watch Hollywood movies even more than Ronald
Reagan did back in his prime. (Reagan acted in such wartime
dramas.)
</P>
<P>
   Can Clinton possibly see a link between smoking in wartime in
years gone by and his rejuvenated war on the tobacco companies?
</P>
<P>
   Standing behind a podium in the smoke-free Rose Garden, the
president proclaimed: ``The tobacco companies should answer to the
taxpayers for their actions.'' He was voicing his support for a
federal lawsuit that accuses the tobacco industry of engaging in
more than four decades of ``fraud and deceit'' over the perils of
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I was a taxpayer, although not much of one, when
my government superiors strongly urged me to start smoking. ``Smoke
'em if you got 'em,'' the drill sergeants would tell us back in the
1950s at Fort Dix, N.J. Standing around without a glowing butt in
hand during that hard winter could lead to orders to do something
useful, like scrubbing pots.
</P>
<P>
   Having initially learned from the government that smoking could
be good for you, we had to wait for nearly a decade until
government, in the person of the U.S. surgeon general, told us that
smoking could kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance government's suit will take note that from Civil War
times until 1956, federal law required the military to provide
nearly free supplies of tobacco to enlisted personnel?
</P>
<P>
   More years passed until the military removed cigarettes from the
food rations that soldiers receive in the field. As you might
expect, current government tobacco subsidies also go unmentioned in
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you see anything in the papers filed in the courthouse
about Clinton's move last year to strip $15 billion in medical care
and disability pay to veterans harmed by smoking. Congress went
along because it was deemed the best way to enact a $203 billion
highway bill and still stay within fixed spending ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed rationale for this move: Military personnel were
never required to smoke but did so by choice, as if they had chosen
to consume alcohol. But that's not how some veterans recall it.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to pacify the dying veterans whose care was cut off, a
provision was put in that huge highway bill that directed the
Department of Veterans Affairs and Justice Department to sue the
tobacco industry to pay for veterans' smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the federal government has acted, perhaps they can make
a movie. Doug McClure, a onetime sidekick of Bendix and the star of
such dramas as ``The Virginian,'' would have been good in the
Clinton role. But he died of lung cancer, at age 59, in 1995.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: MOUNDVILLE, Ala.
_ When I was a child, we used the Sears and Roebuck catalog for a
million things. It was our guide for the worth of goods when Daddy
traded in town, a reader for learning new words and a dictionary

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Legislative and congressional
redistricting at the start of every decade always produces high
stress in the Texas Legislature. Adjusting districts for population
shifts can produce battles not only with enemies, but also with
friends. In 2001, legislative and congressional redistricting will
have some new twists. Even if Republicans do break up Democratic
districts, they risk turning some solidly Republican districts into
swing districts. That could punish a Republican with too
conservative a voting record, or at least make the district
susceptible to Democratic takeover when the GOP incumbent leaves.
(McNeely, Austin American-Statesman). MOVED.

pray to? (Ana Pecina Walker is managing editor of the Longview

celebrity attends a fashion show that typically attracts several?
She has to absorb the brunt of the paparazzi's flash alone

time and almost half an hour before the first model emerges from
backstage). Julianne Moore did so with patience and good cheer
Tuesday afternoon at John Bartlett's theatrical showing (a jet
black runway, huge white sheets hung like sails as the backdrop, a
percussive soundtrack so loud it made the seats vibrate). The
flame-haired actress, sitting next to a friend holding a dog,
gamely fielded questions about Y2K put to her by a 'Glamour'
magazine staffer and fulfilled the pushy photogs' repeated, shouted
requests to ``Pet the dog, Julianne!'' (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post).

<P>
   WITH: RIDLEY REVIEW -- John Ridley's ``Everybody Smokes in
Hell'' is the best B-movie you'll read this season. It's a headlong

the Kirkman family story cycle _ which has unfolded in the luminous
novels ``I Am One of You Forever,'' ``Brighten the Corner Where You
Are'' and ``Farewell I'm Bound to Leave You'' _ is the weakest

   BOOK-MILNER _ It's my theory that the way to become a living
legend is to work at the same job in the same place for many years.
The way to become a dead legend, of course, is to die young,
preferbly violently, as in a car or airplane crash. It helps,
naturally, if you're very good at what you did when you were alive
and if you were one of the best, you're a shoo-in as a legend.
Buddy Holly and Hank Williams come immediately to mind. (Milner,
Cox News Service). 20. BOOKS-GOLDSTONE _ The first edition of The
Sun Also Rises was $300. It was a very fair price, but that wasn't
the problem. I was on my honeymoon, and that $300 was what was
going to get me through the second week of said honeymoon as we
rambled through New England. I held the book, looked through it,
read several pages. I wandered around the store, and returned to
page through the book again. This went on for a half-hour. My new
wife suggested I put it on plastic, but, true Calvinist that I am,
I didn't want to do that _ I was sailing too close to the credit
limit as it was. I ended up walking away from the book. I've never
quite forgiven myself. (Eyman, Palm Beach Post). 30.

<P>
   EYMAN-COLUMN (18 inches) _ The recent hoopla over the
anniversary of the Apollo moon landing failed to mention Michael
Light's Full Moon, a stunning coffee-table book from Knopf ($50)
made up of previously unpublished NASA photographs. There is
documentation of the cramped quarters, the extra-vehicular walks,
and plentiful coverage of Earth and the moon, including some
glorious panoramic fold-out shots that picture the red and blue of
the American flag on the side of the lunar module and the gold foil
on the landing arms in the foreground, with the middle distance and
background eerily capturing the moon's surface as denatured gray.

   BOOKS-MARTYR _ She dabbled in drugs and Satanism before becoming
a Christian. Her murder at Columbine High School may have affected
countless teens who were wavering in their faith. But is Cassie

released Sept. 13. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post). 42.

 &HT;    The GOP at the drawing board
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Legislative and congressional redistricting at
the start of every decade always produces high stress in the Texas
Legislature. Adjusting districts for population shifts can produce
battles not only with enemies, but also with friends.
</P>
<P>
   But in 2001, legislative and congressional redistricting will
have some new twists. Most of all, the Democrats will try to keep
the Republicans from doing to them what they've done to the
Republicans for the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the biggest change is that Republicans seem to
have the upper hand _ something that never happened during the
1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have the governor's veto power _ wielded either by
George W. Bush or Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, if Bush becomes president _
and they'll also control the Legislative Redistricting Board for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The LRB, as it's known around the Capitol, is an odd
governmental duck, set up by a constitutional amendment in the
early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   If the Legislature fails to redistrict the Texas House and
Senate in the first regular legislative session after census data
becomes available _ due to a legislative stalemate, gubernatorial
veto or other reason _ the job shifts to the LRB.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' congressional districts, by contrast, are the province of
the Legislature and, occasionally, the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The previous two times the LRB has been called into action _ in
1971 and 1981 _ all five members were Democrats. But four of the
five are now Republicans _ Lt. Gov. Perry, Attorney General John
Cornyn, Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander and Land Commissioner
David Dewhurst.
</P>
<P>
   The lone Democrat is House Speaker Pete Laney _ and it's
unlikely, but he could be replaced by a Republican in 2001. The
Democrats have reason for fear. When they dominated legislative and
congressional redistricting in 1991, they crammed as many
Republicans as possible into districts represented by Republicans,
to try to protect Democratic incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   In what became almost an art form, they created space for three
new congressional seats afforded through national redistricting to
be won by Democrats, while allowing every incumbent Democrat and
Republican to keep a district to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, that made for a 22-8 Democrat edge over Republicans
in the Texas congressional delegation. But the process diluted
Democratic strength in some districts enough that five have since
been taken over by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That reduced the Democrats' edge to 17-13. In 2001, the
Republicans hope to get not just the two (or three) new seats Texas
will get in national redistricting, but several others _ which
could affect the tight race for partisan control of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, the Senate has gone from 22-9 Democratic in
1991 to 16-15 Republican. The House, 92-58 Democratic in 1991, is
now just 78-72. A four-seat gain would give Republicans a majority
_ and they hope the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the House has redistricted the House, and the
Senate has rubber-stamped it, and vice versa. But with the parties
so close in each branch, a Republican Senate, for instance, could
balk at a House redistricting plan drawn by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for Republicans to practice affirmative action _ to pack
traditionally Democratic-voting minorities into districts in the
name of minority representation _ and make some districts
represented by white Democrats easy for Republican takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are already projecting Democratic losses. They say
projections put out by the Texas Legislative Council show
population gains in heavily Republican areas, while traditionally
Democratic areas _ particularly city-center minority areas _ may
even be declining.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic U.S. Rep. Ken Bentsen of Houston, who chairs the
congressional Democrats' Impact 2000, thinks the population
projections are flawed. He and other Democrats believe the
Republicans are crowing about expected Republican gains to hurt
Democratic fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Republicans do break up Democratic districts, they risk
turning some solidly Republican districts into swing districts.
That could punish a Republican with too conservative a voting
record, or at least make the district susceptible to Democratic
takeover when the GOP incumbent leaves.

 &HT;    Are we praying for the right thing?
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Prayer often brings a sense of peace and calm.
It's supposed to place you in closer touch with your spiritual
self, your maker, your guide, the object of your reverence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's prayer that is causing much heartache in Texas schools
lately. That is, since a federal court ruled that a football game
is not a solemn enough event to allow school-sponsored prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, adults and young people have begged, cajoled
and threatened school boards for the right to pray before football
games. Vigils have been held outside closed-door meetings while
trustees tried to figure out how to appease their patrons and at
the same time keep the threat of lawsuits at bay. Some boards even
resorted to disguising the prayer issue on their agendas, required
to be posted publicly, ostensibly to avoid some of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Young people are in tears because they say they want organized
prayer before athletic and other events. What's wrong with this
picture?
</P>
<P>
   _ Our children go to school with other children who are
themselves parents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Our children go to school with other children who are addicted
to drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   _ Our children go to school with other children who cannot pass
the state's minimum skills test.
</P>
<P>
   _ Our children go to school with other children who are abused,
in every way a human being can be abused.
</P>
<P>
   _ Our children go to school with other children who will end up
in prison, or dead, soon after they leave school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Our children go to school with other children who will never,
ever get a diploma or a decent paying job.
</P>
<P>
   All this suffering, all this wrong has been going on for a very
long time, but it has sparked no prayer vigils at school board
meetings, no public demonstrations for the right to pray for the
easing of such pain, no public tears. This human tragedy appears to
not hold the place of prominence in the hearts of our young people
and our communities as does an athletic contest on a football
field.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, this appearance is deceiving and perhaps
stadium prayer is not the only thing that has school patrons up in
arms, but it is the ruling about football that began this fire.
</P>
<P>
   You know, Texans never minded when people called football a
religion in our state. It was taken good-naturedly, with a wink, a
snicker or a jab in the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not funny anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Just exactly which god is it that we want to pray to?

backstage). Julianne Moore did so with patience and good cheer
Tuesday afternoon at John Bartlett's theatrical showing (a jet
black runway, huge white sheets hung like sails as the backdrop, a
percussive soundtrack so loud it made the seats vibrate). The
flame-haired actress, sitting next to a friend holding a dog,
gamely fielded questions about Y2K put to her by a 'Glamour'
magazine staffer and fulfilled the pushy photogs' repeated, shouted
requests to ``Pet the dog, Julianne!'' (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post).

   BOOK-MILNER _ It's my theory that the way to become a living
legend is to work at the same job in the same place for many years.
The way to become a dead legend, of course, is to die young,
preferbly violently, as in a car or airplane crash. It helps,
naturally, if you're very good at what you did when you were alive
and if you were one of the best, you're a shoo-in as a legend.
Buddy Holly and Hank Williams come immediately to mind. (Milner,
Cox News Service). 20. BOOKS-GOLDSTONE _ The first edition of The
Sun Also Rises was $300. It was a very fair price, but that wasn't
the problem. I was on my honeymoon, and that $300 was what was
going to get me through the second week of said honeymoon as we
rambled through New England. I held the book, looked through it,
read several pages. I wandered around the store, and returned to
page through the book again. This went on for a half-hour. My new
wife suggested I put it on plastic, but, true Calvinist that I am,
I didn't want to do that _ I was sailing too close to the credit
limit as it was. I ended up walking away from the book. I've never
quite forgiven myself. (Eyman, Palm Beach Post). 30.

   EYMAN-COLUMN (18 inches) _ The recent hoopla over the

Light's Full Moon, a stunning coffee-table book from Knopf ($50)

documentation of the cramped quarters, the extra-vehicular walks,
and plentiful coverage of Earth and the moon, including some
glorious panoramic fold-out shots that picture the red and blue of
the American flag on the side of the lunar module and the gold foil
on the landing arms in the foreground, with the middle distance and

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Soaring unemployment, political unrest,
restive labor unions, stifled consumer spending: the portrait of
Venezuela's economy isn't one to invite a stampede of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American companies are already here in a big way, their
names gracing Caracas' soaring skyscrapers or plastered over
billboards lining the country's modern interstate-like highway
system: Ford, IBM, Coca-Cola and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn here by the oil boom of the 1970s that vaulted Venezuela
to a broad-based prosperity that became the envy of Latin America,
the companies have weathered previous downturns, although none
perhaps as serious as the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is hurting,'' said Jorge Redmond, owner of a
chocolate-making firm and president of the Venezuelan-American
Chamber of Commerce. ``Our sales are down 15 percent, and that
applies to most consumer items. Even beer sales are down, and
that's unheard of. Unemployment is rising and people don't have
money, so they aren't spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over the nation's political turmoil has sparked a
reported 40 percent drop in foreign investment this year, so far.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that uncertainty is Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, an outspoken populist who swept to power in a campaign last
fall based on a promise to toss out the country's corrupt political
system, rewrite the constitution and redistribute the nation's oil
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has worried business leaders by lashing out at the
``savage'' impact of market reforms in which state-run companies
have been turned over to the private sector. When the president of
Venezuela's state-owned oil company resigned, he quickly appointed
a close ally and vowed to wipe out the company's lavish habits of
paying executives huge salaries and squiring them around the world
in private jets.
</P>
<P>
   His actions have sent a wave of concern through financial
markets. Earlier this month, Moody's Investor Service placed
several affiliates of the Venezuelan oil company under review for a
possible downgrade, citing concerns that the Chavez administration
might try to exert undue control over the company.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech to the United Nations and in a meeting with
President Clinton last week, Chavez went out of his way to reassure
the international community about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pledge to the whole world from this podium that
Venezuela has respected, is respecting and will respect the essence
of a democratic process that arose from the will of the people,''
he told the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials called their meeting with Chavez
``positive,'' although Clinton did express concerns over
Venezuela's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more confident about him,'' said Kenneth ``Buddy''
McKay, Clinton's special envoy for Latin America, who attended the
meeting with the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Venezuela, most business leaders remain guarded in their
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say most of the business community did
not accompany Mr. Chavez to the ballot box,'' Redmond said. ``But
far from being belligerent, we're in the mode of being helpful
where we can. We're trying very hard to get our ideas into the new
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Atlanta-base Coca-Cola Co., which became
Venezuela's dominant soft drink three years ago after luring away
rival PepsiCo Inc.'s longtime bottling partner, said they never
comment on politics in any of the countries where they do business.
They acknowledged, however, that the severe economic downturn and a
renewed effort by Pepsi have made for a challenging situation in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   One American company that has managed to skate above the turmoil
is BellSouth Corp., which moved into Venezuela's fledgling cellular
telephone market in the early 1990s. The Atlanta-based
telecommunications giant now owns 78 percent of TelCel, which
controls nearly two-thirds of the Venezuelan cellular market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been growing by 50 to 60 percent a year from the day we
started,'' said Mario Lizaso, BellSouth's point man at TelCel.
``Many industries here are hurting, but people are making a choice
about what they want to spend their money on, and fortunately for
us, they feel a hunger for telecommunications . . . we offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan companies, meanwhile, appear to be lobbying hard to
get Chavez to address the economic situation. They realize the
nation has taken something of a public-relations beating, with news
reports raising the specter of a dictatorship and a possible round
of nationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community around the world has gotten the view
that it is a very difficult situation here,'' said Vicente Britos,
president of Fedecamaras, the national association of Venezuelan
Chambers of Commerce. ``But they should realize that our political
confrontation and change have come about as a public debate. There
have been no actions or decisions taken against the business
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who has met with Chavez personally and finds him
cordial and attentive, agrees. But he worries that Chavez has spent
his first months in office focusing on politics and rewriting the
constitution, allowing the stumbling economy to worsen
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't stuck a finger in business's eye, but we're also
very much waiting for a signal that the economy will be what he
will attend to next,'' he said. ``It's very difficult to say where
he's going next.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond says the biggest worry of most business leaders is the
caliber of Chavez's economic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly doesn't have any economic training, and he's
surrounded with people who are from the leftist parties,'' he said.
``On the other hand, he clearly has a huge mandate from the people,
and we all agree there is a real need for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond and other business leaders were expected to accompany
Chavez on a trip to New York and Washington last week(CQ),
hopefully using the visit to reassure financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want this president to be a success,'' he said.
``People are giving him the benefit of the doubt. But as with
everything else, he is going to have to be the one giving the
message. We're still anxiously awaiting that message.''

especially when telegenic political campaigns are all the rage in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The man under the microscope is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, one of
Mexico's most enigmatic opposition politicians. Two years ago, the
notoriously dour Cardenas led a revolution at the polls here,
becoming the first mayor of Mexico City to be democratically
elected by the people rather than appointed by Mexico's president.
</P>
<P>
   He was swept into office in July 1997 by jubilant voters who
wanted to wound Mexico's ruling Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and
elect one of the party's most persistent critics. Now Cardenas is
about to step out of office to run for Mexico's presidency as
either the candidate of the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, or an opposition alliance. But 20 months after he
was sworn in as mayor with high hopes for leaving his mark on this
troubled city, Cardenas' popularity has dropped and he is sinking
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters are criticizing their hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He inherited a city with deep-seated corruption and chaos. And
he, in good faith, thought things could be changed faster than they
could. Little by little, he found out that wasn't so,'' said
Reforma newspaper columnist Guadalupe Loaeza, who still would like
to see Cardenas win the presidency in Mexico's July 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, Loaeza said, is that 65-year-old Cardenas has been
crippled by infamously bad public relations skills _ his own _ and
those of his aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't been able to promote the good things they've
done,'' said Loaeza, who recently wrote a ``Dear Cuauhtemoc''
column that pleaded with him to improve his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political culture has changed dramatically in the last
year, Loaeza and other analysts note, and Cardenas has been
eclipsed by other presidential hopefuls who are already selling
themselves _ in clever ads, on billboards and in frequent
interviews and cheerful appearances on television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   In August Cardenas began radio and television ads describing
improved social programs in the city and advances against crime.
But Cardenas is the only candidate for the presidency who has
refused to appear on a late-night talk show where he would have to
submit to a free-wheeling interview with a popular comic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Cardenas just hasn't been able to intuitively adapt to
these changes,'' Loaeza said. ``But it doesn't really suit him. It
would be as if he were to suddenly put on jeans and a lumberjack
shirt after wearing suits for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   In an August 1998 poll taken by Mexico's Indemerc-Lou Harris
polling service, Cardenas was the top candidate among all
presidential frontrunners. A year later the same polling operation
found he was trailing those same candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cardenas was preferred by only 11.7 percent of poll
respondents compared to 25.2 percent who preferred another
opposition candidate, Vicente Fox of the conservative National
Action Party, or PAN. Roberto Madrazo and Francisco Labastida, who
are competing against each other in a November primary for the
PRI's nomination, were preferred by 25.2 percent and 23.7 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' decline is attributed in great part to his poor
communications skills and his failure to make a dramatic dent in
Mexico City's notorious crime problem. He says his administration
has arrested hundreds of criminal rings and begun the painstaking
task of revamping the police and rooting out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But that appears lost on the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although in recent weeks we've seen his television spots,
where he says things have changed, we the citizens don't feel these
changes,'' said Hector Ramirez, a 40-year-old federal government
employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's archaic,'' said 22-year-old student Veronica Jimenez.
``He never seems to give concrete answers. He evades the press by
saying that everything needs to be analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic Fox, who has been campaigning actively for more
than two years, has also stolen Cardenas' thunder by waging a
campaign that's friendly to the press and other media. ``Middle
class Mexico City voters who turned out for Cardenas may now swing
over to Fox,'' says political writer Raymundo Riva Palacio.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for Cardenas to remain a contender, analysts say,
is for Mexico's opposition parties to unite in an alliance that
backs one candidate in 2000. The purpose would be to beat the PRI,
which has controlled Mexico's presidency for more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Daily negotiations are underway to shape an alliance, even
though many political insiders believe such a front is hopeless
given the profound differences between Cardenas' PRD and Fox's PAN.
A citizens' council on Tuesday submitted a plan to Mexico's
opposition parties that calls for holding a nationwide primary to
select an alliance candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Polls often put Fox in the lead in such a primary. But Cardenas
has a chance if the PRD can muster its loyalists, who are better
organized and more likely to turn out at polls than PAN
sympathizers, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People admire Cardenas' perseverance,'' said Joel Estudillo of
the Mexican Institute of Political Studies. ``Cardenas is a very
traditional figure. His speeches may be boring. But in spite of
that he's managed to remain a leader of the movement for
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a type of halo,'' Loaeza agrees.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas inherited his noble image, in part, from his father,
Lazaro Cardenas, a beloved figure here akin to Franklin D.
Roosevelt. As president of Mexico in the 1930s, Lazaro Cardenas
distributed land, built public works and nationalized Mexico's oil
industry, which is celebrated as a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc (pronounced, ``Kwow-TAY-mok'') is named after the
Aztecs' martyred last emperor, who was tortured by Spanish
conquistadors seeking gold.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was a member of the PRI who served in
various jobs, including governor of Michoacan state. In the
mid-1980s he formed a dissident ``democratic current'' within the
party and then broke away to become the 1988 presidential candidate
of a united leftist front.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans believe Cardenas won that 1988 election but that
the PRI's Carlos Salinas de Gortari stole it from him. Cardenas
went on to co-found the PRD, which objected to many of Salinas'
free-market economic reforms. Cardenas then ran a lackluster
campaign for president again in 1994 and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas rebounded, however, when the PRI's credibility plunged
along with the Mexican peso in 1995. He vaulted into the mayor's
job, which was meant as a springboard to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Cardenas took office, he was met with resistance,
however.
</P>
<P>
   In response to demands for more order, Cardenas tried to have
street venders removed from downtown streets where they clog roads
and often sell stolen or black-market goods.
</P>
<P>
   But the venders, many of whom are organized into PRI-controlled
unions, put up a stiff fight, creating even more chaos by clashing
with police and portraying themselves as oppressed urban poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas also inherited a city with a huge debt the federal
government has refused to absorb. And as mayor, he has been
subjected to television coverage biased in favor of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very clear there's been no truce with Cardenas,''
Estudillo said. When television comic Paco Stanley was shot to
death on a Mexico City street, television anchors _ even the
president of one company _ instantly took to the airwaves to blame
Cardenas for allowing crime to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Stanley is believed to have been killed by
drug traffickers with whom he was consorting rather than common
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Cardenas has done quite so bad a job as people
make it seem,'' said Peter Ward, a University of Texas at Austin,
Mexico specialist who authored a book on Mexico City and has been
studying Cardenas' administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas bungled some appointments, which made him vulnerable to
charges of ineptitude. Squabbling among the PRD ranks serving in
city government hasn't helped, nor have attacks on Cardenas by a
PRD co-founder, Porfirio Munoz Ledo, another presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas' government has managed to fix roads and make some
``honest'' attempts to correct Mexico's massive environmental,
traffic and law-enforcement problems, according to Ward. Cardenas
has also tried to ``crack the whip'' with city employees to
inculcate a more responsive attitude, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rather soft, touchy-feely kinds of things,'' Ward
said. ``But I get the sense that there's much closer contact with
people. And in Mexico I think that's a real achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state-of-the-city speech on Sept. 17, Cardenas portrayed
his administration as the beginning of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can go back to governing the way they did before,'' he
said. ``This democratic change is irreversible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is saying, 'I laid down the foundation for a new
relationship between government and the people,''' said Estudillo.
``That's what Cardenas is going to exploit in his campaign. The
trouble is he should have started doing that a long time ago.''

KEVIN SPACEY'S ROLE A REAL `BEAUTY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Kevin Spacey has been known to resist interviews. But
he is certainly not resisting when it comes to ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey is eager to talk about this film, which is getting praise
as a shoo-in Academy Award challenger _ praise that has grown by
leaps since its Toronto International Film Festival success last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Today Spacey looks like an actor who knows he has a pretty fair
chance to win a best-actor Oscar to go along with his
best-supporting-actor trophy for 1995's ``The Usual Suspects.'' But
it's a long road to the Shrine Auditorium March 26. While it's
still early to predict winners, at the moment, it's hard to imagine
Spacey not being among the five nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a middle-class American suburbanite
who is sick of his job; who argues constantly with his
real-estate-agent wife (Annette Bening); who lusts after his
daughter's promiscuous high school friend; and who generally hates
his life.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Lester quits his executive position, takes a job
flipping hamburgers, begins working his flabby body into shape, and
starts saying and doing whatever he pleases. Naturally this worries
his daughter and drives his wife to _ among other things _ the arms
of another man. The film is a sharp-tongued indictment of the
American ideal of the good life.
</P>
<P>
   With an intelligent, cutting screenplay by playwright and sitcom
writer Alan Ball and strong direction from theatrical director Sam
Mendes (both doing their first feature film), ``American Beauty''
is an uncommonly entertaining and smart film about a family in
everyday crises. For a movie this edgy, literate and dark, there
are no guarantees of box-office success. However, in selected early
openings last weekend, ``American Beauty'' earned an average of
$53,846 per screen _ very good indeed.
</P>
<P>
   However it does at the box office, it's one of the best films of
the year. Spacey felt that even while shooting the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were doing our job, hitting all the points we hoped
to hit,'' he says. ``I couldn't be prouder of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this was a private interview, we were seated at one end
of a large table in a big conference room at Toronto's Four Seasons
Hotel. Maybe DreamWorks Pictures knew Spacey was feeling so
expansive, he needed a bigger room than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Spacey, dressed in black, was acting big or loud.
Anyone who has seen his finely tuned work knows that while he is
quite capable of being larger than life, he's a master of subtlety,
conveying more in a twitch of the mouth than most actors can with a
shout.
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Beauty,'' Spacey has a lot to shout about.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question in my mind that it was a special script,
unique,'' he says. ``It was one of the first scripts I did that
didn't go through a major rewrite. The studio believed in the
material and didn't want to change a word, didn't attempt to water
it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey's role is not pretty, but with humor and humanity he
makes Lester a sympathetic character and, ultimately, a tarnished
hero for those seeking freedom from the daily rat race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read him, and I understood him,'' Spacey says. ``The concept
of being at a place in your life where you no longer wish to remain
... You wish for nothing so much as to change and move in a new
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   That fit perfectly with Spacey's own desires to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've been trying to do as an actor, to go in
a new direction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, who is 40, is ready to move away from the villain roles
that brought him fame.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey came to Hollywood in the late 1980s, already established
as a stage actor. (He continues to do theater work, both on
Broadway and in London, when he likes the role. He won a Tony Award
for his part in Neil Simon's ``Lost in Yonkers,'' among other
prizes.)
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, he landed the role of drug-addicted,
sister-loving criminal Mel Profitt on the TV series ``Wiseguy.'' He
made Profitt unforgettable, and his talent was instantly
recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   That performance led to small film roles that quickly grew into
major supporting parts. Then Spacey began a remarkable series of
performances, mostly as bad guys (``Swimming With Sharks,'' ``The
Usual Suspects,'' ``Seven,'' ``A Time to Kill''), which turned him
into one of Hollywood's most sought-after actors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Spacey took home the best-supporting-actor Oscar for
playing the stoolie, Verbal Kint, who turns out to be _ if only in
his wonderfully woven lies _ a shadowy crime lord in ``The Usual
Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Spacey said he was tired of playing such dark roles.
It has taken several years, but he is finally getting away from the
vile characters that brought him so much success. In the recent
film ``The Negotiator,'' he was cast in a more heroic vein as a
tough police hostage negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``People discovered me in film playing very dark, very brooding,
very villainous characters,'' he says. ``It was a kind of
examination I was having in the nature of evil. It was fantastic,
but about as far removed from me and my experience as I could
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey didn't try to change immediately. Even in ``American
Beauty,'' the role he plays is far from a total hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do it fast,'' Spacey says. ``In the industry, and
with certain critics and even the audience, people like you the way
they discovered you. They don't want you to do something new.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor also has taken steps to change an off-screen
impression. A couple of years ago, Esquire ran a cover story on
Spacey that was written to imply, without actually stating so, that
he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, always reticent about his personal life, went ballistic.
Then he began avoiding interviews. When asked, he says he prefers
not to talk about that or other personal matters. But in the
current issue of Playboy magazine, he denies he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lie,'' he tells the magazine. ``It was a setup.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though his ``American Beauty's'' character has huge flaws,
Spacey says he believes Lester is someone other people will relate
to: ``Who doesn't want to break out of their world and the way
people perceive them and their job, and tell their boss what they
really think of them?''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers are in for several surprises and twists at the end of
``American Beauty.'' One changes greatly how we perceive Lester.
Spacey considers it Lester's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes the right choice,'' Spacey says. ``It's about two
people who ultimately help each other and teach each other a quite
beautiful lesson and learn something about themselves in an
instant.''
</P>
<P>
   There are not a lot of films being written or made in Hollywood
that take on such big themes _ or deal with them with such humor
and pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are people who will write honestly, and
producers and studios that will allow filmmakers to make the movies
they want to make, we're in fine shape,'' Spacey says. ``It's when
things get watered down and toned down because they are politically
incorrect ...
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this movie don't always say the right thing; they're
not always a good parent; they are not always a good child. That's
real.''

INJUSTICE DONE TO CHAPTER IN U.S.-MEXICO WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
BY BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A fascinating chapter of American history is
bunglingly re-created in ``One Man's Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   With dialogue so trite that it ranges all the way from ``You're
more woman than any other woman I've ever met'' to ``You're a
disgrace to that flag and the freedom it stands for,'' cheap action
film producer-turned-director Lance Hool tries to tell the
complicated story of the San Patricios, or St. Patrick's Battalion.
</P>
<P>
   They were a group of Irish-American soldiers, many of them
recent immigrants, who switched sides during the U.S.-Mexico War of
the 1840s. As the title indicates, they were and remain heroes to
the Mexican people, but were understandably considered traitors by
Washington's victorious troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hool and writer Milton S. Gelman touch on the variety of issues
that led to the defections: America's near-institutionalized
anti-Irish and Catholic prejudices of the time, the severe
disciplinary standards of the U.S. Army, the famine-era conscripts'
general resentment of English-derived Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   But it all gets muddled in a stupid melodrama about the
Patricios' leader, John Riley (Tom Berenger), falling in love with
a bandito chieftain's (Joaquim de Almeida) ``more than any other
woman'' woman (Daniela Romo).
</P>
<P>
   The film recounts Mexico's series of losing battles with
adequate but hardly inspired combat footage, and the fates of
captured Patricios are graphically depicted. But this very
one-sided and simple-minded depiction of a potentially rich and
troubling story is its own kind of injustice. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;

`BEAUTY' ROLE FITTS TALENTS OF CHRIS COOPER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time Chris Cooper saw the script for ``American
Beauty,'' he liked it but saw problems with the presentation of his
character, Col. Fitts, a recently retired military man who makes
life miserable for his wife and his son.
</P>
<P>
   The film offers a few surprises regarding Fitts, who is a
neighbor of Kevin Spacey's character. But Cooper was afraid
audiences wouldn't be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems in the writing foretold the end of the story, so I
didn't pursue it,'' Cooper says. ``The opening had given away the
guts, as far as my character was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But he got a chance to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Months later, it came back to me, having gone through some
rewrites, and then it really sparked my interest. When it came
back, I was very hot for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But now a different reservation came in, one that actors don't
usually talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting skeptical. I think my skepticism was more
fear,'' he says frankly. ``It's a risky character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked it over with my wife, Marianne, and she gave me a
little nugget of gold. The fear was that it was going to be a
little bit of a stretch (she said), and it's something you should
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Texas sheriff in John Sayles' ``Lone Star,'' his
most famous role, Cooper was a laid-back, friendly guy you'd like
to know.
</P>
<P>
   (Cooper's first film was Sayles' ``Matewan.'' Other roles have
been in ``Lonesome Dove,'' ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``October Sky''
and ``Breast Men.'')
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Beauty,'' Cooper creates an intensely driven man
quite willing to punch out his son's lights in an effort to teach
him discipline.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Cooper is quite intense, although without the threat
of violence. There is a distinct impression of reserve. He takes
each question seriously and gives thoughtful answers that are
anything but glib.
</P>
<P>
   A tall man in a denim shirt over a T-shirt, with jeans and
cowboy boots, he looks a lot like the Southwesterner of ``Lone
Star,'' especially now that his American Beauty flat-top has grown
out.
</P>
<P>
   He talks at length about how he developed his ``American
Beauty'' character, working out an extensive background for Col.
Fitts. Even though none of it would be seen on screen, it was
necessary to him to know what made this man tick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking this role was all in the homework,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But then, after going into detail on Fitts' Vietnam experiences,
Cooper asks that all of it be kept secret, so as not to reveal
anything about the end of the film _ something he kept in mind
throughout shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every scene, I was very satisfied we had given away none of
what was to come,'' he says.

`MATRIX' DELIVERS THRILLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX'
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, Warner, CC, VHS priced for rentals, DVD $24.98
</P>
<P>
   Whoa _ $170 million at the box office is serious money. But
``The Matrix'' shouldn't be taken too seriously, at least not its
comic-book plot.
</P>
<P>
   No, the kudos should go strictly to its astonishing action
scenes, which meld the fevered, over-the-top mayhem of Hong Kong
directors with imaginative computer effects.
</P>
<P>
   Keanu Reeves plays our hero, a hacker who just may be ``the
one,'' a messiah sought by a small band of rebels (led by Laurence
Fishburne). They bravely resist the Matrix, a computerized illusion
that we believe to be the real world.
</P>
<P>
   This cloak was created by artificially intelligent beings to tap
humans' energies without our knowledge _ or something.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's green-tinted, gothic urban world, this conflict
erupts in savage, bizarre battles in which Reeves and ally
Carrie-Anne Moss defy laws of physics while discharging hundreds of
rounds of ammo.
</P>
<P>
   There's a distinction between action and violence, and too often
this film glorifies the latter. It's also not as novel and
compelling as it pretends to be.
</P>
<P>
   But as a wild thrill-ride of a movie, ``The Matrix'' delivers
with gusto to its target audience: teens who aren't necessarily old
enough for this R-rated film, which really pushes the limits toward
an NC-17.

`THE OUT OF TOWNERS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999, PG, Paramount, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $29.99
</P>
<P>
   Far more enjoyable than the 1970 original _ a miserable comedy
of misery _ this film is buoyed by charming chemistry between Steve
Martin and Goldie Hawn as an Ohio couple hit by midlife crises.
</P>
<P>
   Their son has left the nest, Martin has lost his adman job, and
they go to Manhattan so he can interview with a big-time agency.
</P>
<P>
   The glamour _ the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Much goes wrong, but the couple's frantic experiences galvanize
them to shed their complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Hawn are a fine comic team, and John Cleese is
reliably funny as a haughty hotel manager.

`MY FAVORITE MARTIAN' &QL;

   1999, PG, Disney, CC, VHS $22.99, DVD $29.99
</P>
<P>
   This is like a sugar-based cereal: It's sweet, briefly
energizing and meant for kids.
</P>
<P>
   But even adults who recall the film's source material _ the TV
series of the '60s _ may be amused by the high-spirited high jinks
as a hapless TV news producer (played by Jeff Daniels) stumbles on
a shipwrecked Martian (Christopher Lloyd) and takes him home as his
``Uncle Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin just wants to fix his ship and return home, but a
government weasel (Wallace Shawn) is obsessed with finding him.
Getting caught in the middle doesn't help Daniels' love life, which
teeters between a vain reporter (Elizabeth Hurley) and a sweet
camera-woman (Daryl Hannah).
</P>
<P>
   From the hammy, mugging performances to the whirlwind of special
effects, ``Martian'' plays like a live-action cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd can be a hoot as he drinks from lava lamps and transforms
in weird ways, and his talking space suit, Zoot, steals scenes with
a life of its own. Rating: 2 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ The TV version: if you want to explore more of ``My Favorite
Martian,'' the original TV show is on video for the first time _
costing $19.95 from Rhino for four color episodes on a single tape.
Starring are the late Bill Bixby as a reporter and Ray Walston (who
has a cameo in the new film) as his alien pal, ``Uncle Martin.''

   Clearly, this horror-western about cannibalism isn't for all
tastes. But for adventurous viewers, it has a superb musical score,
some strong performances, an artful style and some successful stabs
at twisted humor.

<P>
   ``Foolish'' plays almost like two movies: a domestic drama about
a brashly ambitious young comedian (Eddie Griffin), and a concert
film of his profane and stingingly funny stand-up routines.
</P>
<P>
   These are scattered generously through the film, and they're its
chief attraction, as Griffin skewers a wide range of topics, often
in the style of Richard Pryor.

ROMANTIC COMEDY COULD LEARN A NEW TRICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By  BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Dog Park's'' central motif is, well, taking the
dog for a walk, and the movie is about as exciting and eventful as
that errand usually is. It's another gimmicky romantic comedy
without much insight, originality or energy to it.
</P>
<P>
   Andy (Luke Wilson, who currently can be seen working the same
sweet schlub quality in ``Blue Streak''), is a recently dumped
young bachelor who misses his ditsy girlfriend, Cheryl (Kathleen
Robertson), perhaps a little less than he does their pooch Mogley,
who is now a child of joint custody.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's funniest bits involve Mogley's therapy sessions,
where Andy and Cheryl are forced to learn unwanted information
about each other's new love lives by a doggie psychiatrist (``Kids
in the Hall's'' Mark McKinney) whose own wretched family makes his
preference for pets' feelings over people's evident.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Andy has a pickup encounter with TV kiddie show host
Lorna (``Species'' progenitor Natasha Henstridge) that, despite
culminating in an upset stomach, he finds pretty encouraging. But
she's reluctant to pursue their relationship for movie reasons that
never really convince, so they both wind up going out with wrong
people before their canine co-interests bring them back together.
</P>
<P>
   The happily mated friends who give Andy lots of useless dating
advice are played by Janeane Garofalo and Bruce McCulloch, another
``Kids in the Hall'' graduate who also wrote and directed ``Dog
Park.'' McCulloch's made some chucklesome short films, but his lack
of experience with feature-length comedy is best exemplified by the
fact that, for the first time I'm aware of in her movie career,
Garofalo just isn't funny here.
</P>
<P>
   In his low-key way, though, Wilson sometimes is. The brother
(and deft straight man) of ``Bottle Rocket'' fireball Owen Wilson,
Luke gets a good bead on Andy as an unembarrassed loser who's not
only comfortable with his passive personality, but knows how to
work it to his advantage. It's not exactly a vivid style of comedy,
but it's enjoyably sneaky enough to give ``Dog Park'' the
occasional and much-needed bite. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Dog Park'' (R; sex, nudity, language). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Luke Wilson, Natasha Henstridge, Kathleen Robertson,
Janeane Garofalo, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Written and directed by Bruce McCulloch.

SHELL GAMES: CLAMS ARE GROUNDS FOR DISAGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Let's be upfront about this: About half the
information in this article is going to be considered incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is with clams. What they are called, how big
they are, and how you should open, clean and cook them differs by
region, or expert, or whim. It seems that no one agrees when it
comes to clams.
</P>
<P>
   Take the names, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Some people call small ones in brown-colored shells Maine clams
because they are harvested in the cold waters off the coast of
Maine. Others call them mahogany clams, a nod to the hue of their
shells. Then there's the littleneck/cherrystone debacle. Although
seafood marketers in some areas of upstate New York say
cherrystones are larger, nearly the size of chowder clams, people
from some regions call smaller littleneck clams cherrystones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask for one thing, then when they receive what they think
is something different, they get all mad,'' says Michael Kennally,
vice president of seafood merchandising for the Price Chopper
grocery stores. The best bet is to order clams by count and weight,
or the number of clams found in a certain-size bag, Kennally says.
</P>
<P>
   The gray, hardshell clams, also known as quahogs (pronounced
KO-hogs), are sold in wholesale markets by the number of clams in a
60-pound bag.
</P>
<P>
   Littlenecks are the smaller ones, with 450-600 per bag.
</P>
<P>
   Cherrystones have 300-450 per bag.
</P>
<P>
   Topnecks have 200-300 per bag.
</P>
<P>
   Chowder clams have less than 200 per bag.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the people who call the largest clams (fewer
than 80 per bag), quahogs. Luckily, the different kinds of clams
are interchangable in recipes. Just cut up the larger ones if you
think they're too big.
</P>
<P>
   The more elongated clams with slightly softer shells and a
siphon that protrudes from the shell are known in New England as
``steamers.'' These clams are becoming increasingly popular because
of their sweet flavor and tender meat, Kennally says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be a little gritty, but there are things you can do
to get rid of the sand,'' Kennally says.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Kennally advises washing clams quickly and then, when they are
cooked, the grit will sink to the bottom of the pan. Lift the clams
out of the pan with tongs and strain the broth to discard the grit.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author Patricia Wells writes to purge clams of grit,
combine a tablespoon of salt for each quart of cold water. Scrub
the clams under cold running water and then place in salt water for
three hours at room temperature. Scoop the clams out of the water
with your fingers, leaving the grit behind. Other seafood sellers
say adding yeast or cornmeal to the water will encourage the clams
to get rid of their sand.
</P>
<P>
   Won't work, says Kennally. ``When you put them in fresh water,
they die.'' And dead clams are not what you want, the one fact on
which most everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   When buying hardshell clams, look for those that are tightly
closed or that close slowly when you tap the shells.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're discussing any other aspect of the clam kingdom,
take Kennally's advice: ``I've learned to just smile a little bit
and nod my head.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SERVING CLAMS
</P>
<P>
   Small, tender clams such as littlenecks are frequently served
on-the-half-shell (simply opened and eaten raw). If serving raw
clams, buy them the same day and shuck just prior to serving. For a
clean presentation, fill a shallow bowl with crushed ice and serve
the opened clams on the bed of ice with a lemon wedge and cocktail
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the gray clams, which are harvested from warmer
waters, are more tender than the Maine clams and better for serving
raw, Kennally says.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Due to health risks associated with raw seafood, clams
on-the-half-shell are not recommended for children, the elderly or
those with cancer or compromised immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   For steamed clams, follow this recipe from ``Fish and
Shellfish,'' by James Peterson (William Morrow, 1996):
</P>
<P>
   Place 1 cup wine, 2 tablespoons chopped parsley and 1 chopped
clove of garlic to a simmer in a 6-quart pot with a tight-fitting
lid. Add 2 dozen clams, cover and simmer 10 minutes or until the
clams have opened. Remove clams with tongs. If the liquid in the
pot is sandy, strain through a coffee filter. Serve the clams in
large bowls with the cooking broth poured over them and melted
butter for dipping on the side.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLAMS WITH GARLIC AND PARSLEY
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 6 servings)
</P>
<P>
   36 cherrystone clams, scrubbed and rinsed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Steam the clams in white wine in a covered pot about 10 minutes
or until they open. Scoop the clams out of the pot and remove and
discard the top shells. Pour the steaming liquid into another
saucepan, straining out any sand.
</P>
<P>
   Crush the chopped garlic to a paste and add it, along with the
parsley, to the clam liquid. Boil the liquid until it is half of
its original volume and add the cream. Continue boiling until it
thickens slightly, being careful not to let the cream boil over.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 400 degrees. Arrange the clams on a sheet of
crumpled foil on a baking sheet. Spoon enough sauce into each clam
to fill the shells. Bake 5 minutes, until sauce bubbles.
</P>

HARD-LUCK BOXERS LOWER THEIR GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Rocky'' fantasies fuel the hopeful contenders in
the stirring, engrossing documentary ``On the Ropes.'' But the
movie also exposes the dishonest oversimplifications of such sports
features. The odds of becoming a winner are much worse than
Hollywood likes to let on, and in this true-life story even the
most dedicated fighters are often tripped up by circumstances that
have no relationship to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen spent a year at the
Bed-Stuy Boxing Center, the grungy New York gym where champions
Riddick Bowe and Mark Breland, among others, got their start. Their
cameras follow three young athletes and their coach through lots of
hard training, a handful of triumphs, more disappointments and some
outright calamities.
</P>
<P>
   These observant portraits are not going to change any
preconceived notions about boxers' relative intelligence. But
you'll never just think of them as fighting machines again after
viewing their vividly illuminated, aching humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Keitt is the dedicated trainer who not only inspires his
poverty-stricken charges to give the requisite 110 percent, but
goes the extra mile to provide moral support and good living
advice. As the film unfolds, we learn about his criminal past and
the selfishness that also motivates him, but he remains the kind of
ever-dependable personality you can't help but admire.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's hardest case seems to be Noel Santiago, a troubled teen
whose lack of education and self-confidence, obviously fallout from
having crackhead parents (though his loving mom has cleaned up her
act), have a devastating effect on his fighting style.
</P>
<P>
   But Noel's problems seem paltry compared to what befalls Tyrene
Manson. A churchgoing divorcee whose gritty spunk gets her to the
women's Golden Gloves finals, she's sabotaged by her AIDS-infected
Uncle Randy, whose two daughters she's also trying to raise right.
Wrongly accused of possessing Randy's cocaine, Tyrene discovers
that the courthouse can be a much tougher arena than Madison Square
Garden _ and not nearly as fairly judged.
</P>
<P>
   Talented George Walton presents Harry with his greatest personal
dilemma. Winner of many major amateur bouts, George is going pro.
The question is, will he take Harry along with him?
</P>
<P>
   With sure eyes for poignant but never maudlin details, Burstein
and Morgen take us deep into their subjects' inner and objective
realities. Mean street lives are neither overdramatized nor
prettified, and family conflicts are met head-on. Yet there's an
exhilarating, optimistic charge to the movie as well, one that
doesn't come from trumped-up triumphalism but from the ringing
inspiration of true perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Ropes'' is a great sports movie, an incisive look at a
troubled community and a collection of insightful character
studies. Unlike most fictional sports films, this one really goes
the distance. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: ``On the Ropes'' (not rated; drug use). &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed and produced by Nanette Burstein and
Brett Morgen. Released by WinStar Cinema.  &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 34 minutes. &QL;

TIME FOR THE HOUSE TO TAKE ACTION ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA BOXER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the past year, our country has been battered by
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's shootings at a Los Angeles day-care center are
still etched in our minds, along with the haunting image of police
officers gently leading little children to safety. ``Where can we
be safe?'' we wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, nowhere,'' came the answer this month.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a man walked into the West Anaheim Medical Center
and killed three hospital workers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a gunman walked into a Baptist church in Fort
Worth, Texas, killed seven people including teen-agers, wounded
seven more, and then killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   These deadly rampages bring the specter of gun violence into
places we had thought safe and sacred. And they raise two urgent
questions: Where can we go to escape gun violence, or at least feel
safe? And, What will it take to get Congress to try to strengthen
our laws so that criminals, mentally unstable people and children
are kept away from guns?
</P>
<P>
   We can no longer feel safe at home, at work or on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   We can no longer send our children to school or day care without
fearing for their safety. We aren't safe in the hospital. We aren't
even safe in church.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sanctuary from gun violence. Beyond the clear and
present danger of gun violence lies the danger that we will come to
accept all this as an inevitable fact of life. The gun lobby and
its allies in Congress would have us believe that there is nothing
government can do to control the epidemic of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   This is not true. Here's proof: In the first seven months of the
instant background check now required by law, an estimated 100,000
criminals and mentally disturbed individuals were prevented from
buying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of sensible law works, and further steps to regulate
the flow of guns and ammunition can work too. In May, forced to act
by the public's outrage over the Columbine massacre, the Senate
finally enacted some modest gun-control provisions as amendments to
the 1999 juvenile justice bill. The Senate bill included provisions
that would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Close the loophole that allowed criminals to buy guns at gun
shows without a background check.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips, which
are used in semi-automatic assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require that child safety devices be sold with every handgun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require the Federal Trade Commission and the attorney general
to study the extent to which the gun industry markets its products
to juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make it illegal to sell or give a semi-automatic assault
weapon to anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   This was a small but important step forward. But even so, it was
too much for the National Rifle Association and its friends in the
House of Representatives, who pushed through a juvenile justice
bill with no gun-control provisions. By law, the House and Senate
must meet to reconcile the two bills. But the Republican
congressional leadership has dragged its heels, seeking to avoid
offending either the NRA or everyone else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Well, everyone else is waiting. As one outrageous, terrifying
gun attack follows another, we have to wonder what it takes to move
Congress to action. I plead with my colleagues in Congress to send
to the president the modest gun-control measures passed by the
Senate so that he may sign them into law.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make sure that the next front-page article on guns will be
about the passage of gun control, not about another rampage.

NOW PLAYING AT A THEATER NEAR YOU: `GOVERNOR WHO?' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hollywoodization of politics has hit a new
low. Technicolor has faded to a new Gray.
</P>
<P>
   The latest high-concept synergy isn't about Warren Beatty being
confused with Bulworth, or Ronald Reagan and the Gump-like
imaginary narrator of his biography. This is about making
California's low-concept governor a household name.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in terms of a movie pitch, think of the scenario as
``The Invisible Man'' meets Meathead meets modern product
placement.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the treatment, as they say at Spago: A recent poll found
that 36 percent of Californians can't name their governor. More
Californians know who the governor of Minnesota is.
</P>
<P>
   So how does what's his name (Gov. Gray Davis) raise his
name-recognition factor?
</P>
<P>
   Rob Reiner, the movie director and anti-tobacco activist, was
appointed by the governor as head of the state commission
overseeing spending of tobacco tax money on preschoolers. Reiner
has directed a new romantic comedy called ``The Story of Us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preview being shown in theaters, Bruce Willis and
Michelle Pfeiffer are a troubled couple undergoing therapy. The
shrink, who has a big birthmark in the shape of the state of
California on his forehead, asks them what they're thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Willis says, ``Sacramento, California.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer says, ``Governor Gray Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   That is so pathetic. That is so 1999 America. That is so Gray
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   At that point in the movie, the portion of the audience that
isn't asleep probably goes out for popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   In future polls, 86 percent of the public probably will identify
Michelle Pfeiffer as governor of California. It would serve Reiner
and Davis right.
</P>
<P>
   Why not have the Gov. Gray Davis blimp go by the window? Why not
have Willis and Pfeiffer sip Gov. Gray Davis Light Beer? Why not
have a walk-on by Davis himself?
</P>
<P>
   Here's why not: He might be mistaken for the ghost of the late
Chauncey Gardiner, the character played by Peter Sellers in ``Being
There'' who went from non-entity to White House adviser by virtue
of his facility with TV-addled cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The governor says he's happy where he is _ Sacramento,
California, as the scriptwriter for Bruce Willis so eloquently put
it.
</P>
<P>
   Davis claims he doesn't have ambitions to be president. But who
knows? His adept stewardship of issues and aggressive reading of
polls is similar to that of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Davis could go to the very top, now that his name is on the lips
of Michelle Pfeiffer, which is desirable placement to say the
least.
</P>
<P>
   Better he imitate Andy Kaufman and become a professional
wrestler, though. He could challenge Jesse Ventura for the title of
best-known governor in the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Ventura a chicken and getting body-slammed would give
you real name recognition in the land where the World Wrestling
Federation is more powerful than either the Democratic or
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   There's a great California tradition of political/cinematic
synergy, as we all know. I love that word ``synergy,'' which used
to refer to combined actions, but now means you're trying to
impress someone.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan proved he was more than the sum of his bad parts
in B-movies when he starred in the A-role of president. San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown had a few lines in ``The Godfather
Part III,'' and now guess what? Everyone in the world knows Willie
Brown, but no one even knows there was a Part III to ``The
Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians fit their offices and movie roles perfectly,
like Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and the bad guy who fought Clint
Eastwood in ``In the Line of Fire.'' Thompson is one performer who
has received good reviews in both of his chosen fields, which
increasingly are the same.
</P>
<P>
   George and Talk magazines are America's political journals. Jay
Leno, David Letterman and Bill Maher set the nation's political
tone. Real political commentators have to become really loud
shouters on Sunday talk shows to make it professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day I promised never to write about politics
again, but I'm not. I'm writing about a great democracy that has
become a celebocracy.
</P>
<P>
   To be a national leader, it helps to be a national household
name like Hillary Clinton, Warren Beatty, Donald Trump and Jesse
Ventura. If you're not a household name, maybe it will help if your
name comes from the household mouth of Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Gray Davis.'' Sorry, but it's not a line that will be
remembered like ``Show me the money.''
</P>

TRUE TALE OF FRENCH RESISTANCE LABORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOS ANGEELS _ ``Lucie Aubrac,'' the latest stately historical piece
from French filmmaker Claude Berri, doesn't quite make the World
War II occupation seem tedious. But it comes uncomfortably close to
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Like the director's somewhat livelier ``Jean de Florette'' and
``Manon of the Spring,'' ``Lucie'' is finely acted and presented
with the utmost, attentive care. But perhaps because it's based on
a true story, the film drags, all but shackled by its accumulation
of incidents, implications and details. Although the tale certainly
has its suspenseful and thrilling elements, the overdeliberate
telling of it slackens and finally dissipates its narrative
tension.
</P>
<P>
   That and the fact that the particular family of Resistance
fighters we're supposed to be feeling for lead a pretty swell life,
at least until household head Raymond Samuel (Daniel Auteuil) falls
into the clutches of Klaus Barbie, the infamous Butcher of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, it's a rewarding existence for Raymond, blowing up
Nazi supply trains between rich meals and seaside vacations with
his lovely and loving wife Lucie (Carole Bouquet) and their
adorable little son. The Samuels, who operate under numerous
underground code names besides Aubrac, have a spacious home, fine
clothes and even a maid. Privation is hardly a component of their
wartime experience.
</P>
<P>
   Which, perhaps, makes it extra trying when Raymond is caught up
in a Gestapo sweep of Resistance leaders and imprisoned in a dark,
cockroach-ridden cell. Beatings at the hands of Barbie (Heino
Ferch) are accompanied by a death sentence _ although the Germans
mistake another nom de guerre for Raymond's true identity.
</P>
<P>
   This gives Lucie a chance to possibly scam him out of custody,
which of course she's brave, resourceful and plucky enough to
pursue with all her heart (the real-life Lucie gave her blessing to
the film project).
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting notions about the link between domestic loyalty
and patriotism are lightly batted about, and some incomplete hints
are dropped as to how difficult it was to maintain political unity
among independent-minded Resistance units. But mostly, ``Lucie
Aubrac'' is a slowly unwinding caper film with an admirable but
undemanding love story attached.

CAPTAINS ARE OF DIFFERENT STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ben Crenshaw is taking this Ryder Cup captain
thing very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   He is wearing the crown of thorns, and the hair shirt, and the
coat of mail. The responsibility weighs on him, morning, noon, and
night. As one inquisitor put it Wednesday, ``Ben, you've used words
like `wrestle,' `struggle,' `difficult,' and a phrase like
`terribly hard and complex thing' _ just referring to the
pairings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben cares. Deeply. He feels proprietary toward American golf. If
his team does not reverse the results of the last two affairs and
bring the Ryder Cup home to America, he may offer himself up as a
human sacrifice, right there on The Golf Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Mark James also cares. The European captain wouldn't have been
selected if he weren't both highly knowledgeable and highly
competitive. He would much rather win than lose. But not for one
second does he project the image of a driven man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both out here to win the matches, and it's serious
golf,'' he says. ``But at the end of the week, I'll be able to
shake Ben warmly by the throat and we'll sit down and have a
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben is on a Crusade. He is marching off to war. The infidels
have occupied his Holy Land, and he wants it back. Mark James is a
tour guide. He's here to see that his mates have a good time. The
job is no burden. It's rather a lark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fairly easy thing to captain this year for
me,'' he maintains. ``They're a good bunch of lads. No egos to deal
with at all, really. They're willing to do anything for the team.
And I think as much as it can be, the job is plain sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   This all underscores a very obvious fact: The pressure is
clearly on the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   James is no bloody fool. He knows exactly where the pressure is,
but he won't acknowledge it in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a particular pressure on either side,
to be honest,'' he coos.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, and James knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last Ryder Cup's finished and gone and we're starting a
clean slate,'' he continues. ``We're going out to play golf, and
the best golf will win the match for whatever team it is. And I
think that's all there is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark James is playing a game here, friends. We will discover
what that game is in due time.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Ryder Cup is finished and gone, and so is the 1995
Ryder Cup, and what they had in common was an embarrassing defeat
sustained by a heavily favored US team. By every objective ranking
system known to man, the United States of America possesses more
top-of-the-line golfers than any other country or, yes, continent
on the planet. The PGA Tour is the Rolls Royce of golf caravans.
It's where the money is. It's where a preponderance of the prestige
is. That tour's money list is dominated by Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ryder Cup currently rests in the hands of an engaging
collection of Englishmen, Scots, Irishmen, Welshmen, Spaniards,
Swedes, Danes, Italians, and Germans. In defense of it this year
there will even be a Frenchman, of all things. None of their ilk
can win a US Open. So why can't the mighty Americans win this
little three-day outing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer might lie in the vast cultural difference between the
haughty, spoiled Americans and the less-pampered Europeans. Simply
put, life on the PGA Tour is cushy and life on the European tour
is, well, challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably in the culture and all that,'' suggests
Jean Van de Velde, the charming Frenchman whose star-crossed 72d
hole at the British Open made him an international sports household
name. ``In Europe you jump on the plane, you travel two hours, and
you're on the other side of Europe. So you get to meet different
people, and you've got to be . . . (itals)it's a different way of
life.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to learn from the others, or be more open, then
you have to be more open,'' Van de Velde continues. ``You have to
communicate a lot more. You have to do things differently. You've
got to expect that people will not be speaking the same language
you are. And it's not going to be an easy life . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``So I guess, in one way, it helps you realize you're not the
only people on this earth. And I'm not saying this in a mean way.
Here it's a fantastic country and it's a great tour, whatever you
want. But . . . it appears to me that it's like you are within
yourself a lot more . . . so if I want to communicate with an
Irishman, I just have to drink a Guinness first (he licks his
lips). That's the way it starts. That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the thought process of a typical Mark James player. A
comparable Ben Crenshaw player complains because the courtesy car
is three minutes late. None of this mattered a generation ago when
the talent difference between the Americans and the chaps across
the pond was simply too vast to allow for viable competition. That
gap has now been closed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the Europeans can play. They are also more flexible.
They forge a we're-all-in-this-together bond during their annual
trek across the continent and they can handle any adverse
circumstances that come their way. They arrive at the Ryder Cup
unheralded but supremely confident and relaxed. Mark James
perfectly reflects this reality. Back home, there is interest in
what they're doing, but no real pressure. If they win, great, break
out the bubbly. We best those laughable Americans. If they lose,
hey, (itals)c'est la guerre.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Mark James is not above a little contradiction. He insists he
has made no predictions (``I've never said that we will retain the
Cup,'' he declared Wednesday), even as the The Mirror of London
quotes him upon alighting from the Concorde as saying, ``Don't
worry; I'll bring (the Cup) back home again.'' As we say in the
colonies, ``What's up with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, as we also say. The fact is that he is neither
wrestling nor struggling with anything. He's got a good golf team,
and it is, after all, just golf. Win, lose, or halve, he'll enjoy
that beer Sunday evening.

THE CAST OF EXTRAS PLAYING A VITAL ROLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ben Crenshaw may have missed a detail in
preparing for the 33d Ryder Cup Matches. Good luck trying to find
it, however. Phil Mickelson certainly can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that we have had, every detail has been first
class,'' he said after his practice round Wednesday. ``Little
things. We've got very nice clothes to wear. They've been on top of
things from traveling, picking us up at the airport. Everything's
been exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Little things. Like caddies for the caddies. Or something like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjutant caddies,'' said Andrew Martinez with a laugh. He was
referring to Bruce Edwards and Linn Strickler, longtime caddies who
are part of captain Ben Crenshaw's official team here at The
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has had a long and distinguished career in this most
under-appreciated business. He used to caddie for Johnny Miller; he
and Tom Lehman have been a team for a few years now, the British
Open of 1996 their highlight. Few know their way around a golf
course as well as he does.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crenshaw is taking no chances. He asked his longtime
caddie, Strickler, and Edwards, who works for Tom Watson, to be
part of the team. They can be seen everywhere in the bright red
Team USA golf carts, driving players to the range, relaying
messages, following the play as another set of eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly important for us,'' said Crenshaw. ``I think
everyone knows that for our side, not having success in the last
few occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Edwards, it's a return engagement in this capacity. When
Watson was Ryder Cup captain in 1993, he also brought along Edwards
as sort of an extra set of hands and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically here to support and organize things,'' said
Edwards. ``We get pins in the morning, and if guys get behind like
they do sometimes in these matches and there's no time for lunch,
we'll get them sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw also reached out to Jim Connolly, whose caddie
experience at The Country Club dates back to 1967. For years,
Connolly caddied on the PGA Tour for Denis Watson, and he has
worked on the LPGA Tour, too. He grew up in Rhode Island and was at
TCC Monday walking along with Justin Leonard and Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving them subtle information, if they ask,'' said
Connolly. ``Like which way the fairway rolls and where not to hit
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rough is only half as long as US Open rough, but it's
heavily fertilized. For instance, if you put it in the rough to the
right of No. 5, only three of 10 players will put it on the
green.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like an overload, but according to Steve Pate,
there's more of everything at the Ryder Cup matches than when he
last played in one of these, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be part of it, and it's a lot of fun,'' said
Pate, ``if you consider being scrutinized and being raided by a lot
of people a lot of fun, if you don't happen to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's no place to hide the next few days at
The Country Club. People are watching.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Walking through a crowd at the Bay Hill
Invitational this spring, Davis Love III heard a spectator trying
to get his attention. That was nothing unusual, given his stature
as one of the game's finest _ and most popular _ golfers; like most
of his colleagues, Love has grown accustomed to signing autographs
on the run.
</P>
<P>
   But this spectator was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had watched my dad play in the 1963 US Open,''
said Love. ``Saw him play nearly a whole round.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he had to be on his way, Love had to stop and talk to the
man. The spectator had, after all, touched upon a subject that is
close to his heart. Davis Love Jr. remains, to this day, his son's
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he has today, Davis Love III will tell you, he owes
to Davis Love Jr. His father was an accomplished player, though he
made his name as one of the country's best instructors. One of his
prized pupils was his son, who provided a huge thrill at Hilton
Head in 1987 when he won for the first time on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Davis Love Jr. was killed in a plane
crash.
</P>
<P>
   His father, said Love, was a humble man who rarely talked of his
accomplishments. ``So we never heard him talk about the 1963 Open,
but it's nice to hear he played well,'' he said. ``Mark (his
brother/caddie) and I always wondered how he got into the 1964
Masters, but I guess that was how.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was. At the time, a top-16 finish at the US Open got
a player into the next year's Masters. And though it surprised a
lot of people (``Another newcomer to fame'' is how the Boston Globe
report described Davis Love Jr. after the first round that year),
Love Jr. finished in a tie for 14th at the 1963 US Open.
</P>
<P>
   Right here at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The reminder still brings a smile to Love's face. As if he needs
another reason to be excited about this Ryder Cup _ his passion is
palpable, perhaps because he has been losing teams the last two
matches _ this is it. To know that his father 36 years ago
persevered on this same course in one of the most grueling US Opens
ever (raw, windy weather and high rough battered the field; the
winning score was 9 over) to finish tied for 14th _ better than
Jack Nicklaus, better than Gene Littler, better than Sam Snead _ is
a thought Love cherishes.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love Jr., then a club pro in Charlotte, N.C., opened with
a 71 that year and backed it up with a 74, leaving him just three
shots off the lead. He played the 36-hole finale with Julius Boros,
who would tie for the lead and win the next day's playoff. Love
closed 78-79 on a day when breaking 80 was an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe account had downgraded him from Friday's ``newcomer to
fame'' to Sunday's ``unknown,'' but to Davis Love III, who was born
a year after that 1963 Open, Davis Love Jr. was always a known
commodity. The very best, said Love.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back when the game was a childhood passion, not their
profession, they met during the Junior World Championship in San
Diego. The tall, gangly kid was introduced: ``From Sea Island, Ga.,
with rounds of 69-82-71, Davis Love III . . .'' and the small,
gangly kid from Rhode Island took note of those scores. As they
walked down the fairway, Billy Andrade couldn't contain himself, so
he wisecracked: ``You're pretty damn consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a friendship that is still strong. ``We
kind of hit it off right away,'' said Andrade, who, as a Wake
Forest player later crossed paths many times with Love, a North
Carolina standout.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the PGA Tour, there's another common denominator for
Love and Andrade: their sentiments for Davis Love Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my first teacher. I never had a lesson until I met
him,'' said Andrade. ``He came down to an ACC tournament at
Pinehurst. He saw me struggling and he came up to me and said, `If
you ever need any help, let me know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Andrade long to take him up on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go down to Sea Island (Georgia) a couple times a
year and hang out with Davis and take lessons with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Love Jr.'s tutelage, said Andrade, is a big reason he made the
Tour. It is also why Love III is such a great talent. Though what
people overlook, what they just don't pay attention to sometimes,
said Andrade, is how far Love III has come with his golf career. He
may have been a golf professional's son _ a widely respected golf
professional at that _ but Davis Love III is not here via an
inheritance, said Andrade, he earned it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always really long. He would overpower golf courses,
but his short game was not that good,'' said Andrade. ``Growing up
in Rhode Island (as Andrade did), you learn how to chip and putt
because the greens are funny, with humps and everything else. But
in Sea Island, Ga., you don't have good putting greens. You play on
lousy Bermuda grass all the time, and that's all you've got and you
don't learn how to putt.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the case for most people, said Andrade. His
friend is an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned the short game. He improved his game,'' said
Andrade. ``He's probably shorter now than he ever was, but he's
straighter and is totally in control of his game. I don't think he
gets as much credit as I think he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, some feel, is Love's personality. It is
even keel; rarely does he appear flustered, hardly ever does he
show great emotion. ``But sometimes people want him to be more like
Freddy (Couples),'' said Mark Love, who has caddied for his brother
for several years. ``They're good friends, but they are different
and Davis can't change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should he, said Andrade, adding, ``He's role model. He's
just a quality person, a wonderful guy and friend.''
</P>
<P>
   That Love will often take his off his hat before shaking hands
is no surprise, said Andrade. ``He's a throwback,'' he said. ``He
gets that from his dad. His dad was a gem, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Like father, like son?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' said Andrade.

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Sergio Garcia hopped up and down. Not once
but twice. He wasn't regaling the gallery with kangaroo
impersonations, nor was he reenacting that indelible moment from
last month's PGA Championship, when he skipped exuberantly up a
hill trying to follow the path of his shot from an impossible
location.
</P>
<P>
   This time he was exasperatedly trying to find the path for his
shot to an impossible location. He might as well have been standing
in a canyon trying to spot a thumbprint on a mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the pin?'' Garcia asked his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the left,'' Jerry Higginbotham called from his vantage
point at a higher elevation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, left-center,'' Higginbotham decided.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, Sergio and the rest of you Ryder Cuppers, to the 12th
hole at The Country Club, where even seeing isn't believing.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one reason the Europeans and Americans who will
compete for the Cup this weekend overwhelmingly agree that the 12th
is the most malicious creation on the course, a hybrid of fiendish
nature and the demonic touch of US captain Ben Crenshaw, whose
contributions to the hole's redesign mock his nickname, Gentle Ben.
</P>
<P>
   So discombobulating is this snakepit at the far reaches of TCC
that even the world's finest golfers are flummoxed by its
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his vote on the toughest hole, Europe's Darren Clarke
said, ``Probably _ is it 12? Which is the par 5 up the around the
corner? Is that 12?''
</P>
<P>
   Said teammate Lee Westwood, ``Twelve, yeah. That one.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, fellows, that's not what it is at the moment, unless
you want to sign up for TCC's eternal waiting list. It's a par 5
only for the members. And for them, it spans only 455 yards. But
for this weekend, it's a par 4 measuring 486 yards because
Crenshaw, to whose tastes the US home course was tailored, lopped a
stroke off par and added more than 30 yards in length by merging
the regular tee with that of the second hole on the Primrose Nine,
the third of the 27-hole layout that isn't being used for the Ryder
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a par 4 1/2,'' said Crenshaw without the slightest trace
of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the 12th needed any help to destroy rounds. The
elongated tee box is innocent enough, but up ahead after 125 yards
of rough is a landing area shaped as if it had been exhaled from a
bubble pipe. It measures 165 yards and seems to lead to nowhere.
Actually, it is merely the runway to golf hell _ a 20-foot cliff
coated with rough and fescue, with a stairway of sand traps on the
left side and overhanging oaks bordering this mountain goat's
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either I've gotten smaller,'' said US Cupper Steve Pate,
recalling the last time he saw the hole in competition, during the
1988 US Open, ``or the trees have gotten bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Big enough to swallow well-intentioned second shots. But that's
really incidental. Because of the landscape, the golfer can't even
see his second shot, and the green somewhere up there is merely a
rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they're doing,'' said hole marshal Wade Anders, a former
TCC caddie, ``is picking a tree and aiming at it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just as well that they can't see the green,
because it offers no respite. The trek over hill and dale itself
requires an oxygen tank; Anders recalls that during the '88 Open,
Lee Trevino's deluxe-sized caddie, Herman Mitchell, had to be
hauled by cart to the crest. And the view from there is equally
unpleasant _ 97 yards of bottleneck fairway, which funnels into a
green that is shaped like a capital ``L,'' about the size of a
small ``l,'' and bookended by two more traps.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's Jean Van de Velde described this garden of delights
thusly: ``It invites you to hit it down the left, and in fact, if
you hit it down the left or you miss the fairway left, you've got
no hope, really. So for myself, for my length, I've got to keep it
right and then to open up the angle. And the green is like a
handkerchief, really. I think you need to be first to play, because
if you hit your ball in the green, there's no room for an extra
ball on it.''
</P>
<P>
   As if in self-fulfilling prophecy during Wednesday's practice
round, Van de Velde chose the right route. Wrong. He found disaster
when he drove through the gallery onto the mud road by a lake that
goes virtually unnoticed amid the other treasures of treachery.
With characteristic French abandon, he played the lie, clipped some
leaves that knocked down his second shot at the peak of the hill,
then flew his third shot over the green on his way to a tidy
double-bogey 6.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shame in that on a day when steady rain abetted
geography by impeding the ball's carry by land or air.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's fate was fairly typical. In his foursome, Jarmo
Sandelin visited both groups of traps on the left side, Paul Lawrie
needed two shots to carry the first landing area, and Colin
Montgomerie won the hole with a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Among the six foursomes, the 12th yielded four pars and two
birdies _ and one of the birds came when Davis Love lofted a chip
over the trap to the right of the green and into the hole. ``I got
lucky,'' said Love, who concurred that despite his aberrational
success, the 12th is the most demanding hole.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 18 players who had the misfortune of hitting second shots
(the three US groups played alternate shots on the back nine), only
two reached the green.
</P>
<P>
   One was Garcia, whose instrument flying got him to the front
edge. After history's youngest Ryder Cupper, age 19, hitched a ride
up the cliff on the back of a cart, he two-putted for par from 30
feet. Playing partner Jesper Parnevik outdid him, fading a 5-wood
15 feet right of the flag and draining his birdie putt. But,
cautioned Parnevik, ``It definitely is the most difficult hole.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what enchants Crenshaw about it. ``This is a modern game
we're playing,'' he said, ``but it's the most old-fashioned hole
you've ever seen. I think it's one hole that fits beautifully in
the mix of all the rest. So it's a nice little barricade.''
</P>
<P>
   So was the Berlin Wall.

WRITER/DIRECTOR KEEPS COMIC TALENTS ON A LEASH IN `DOG PARK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The things that I used to do,'' laments hip-hop crooner G.
Love in writer-director-co-star Bruce McCulloch's ``Dog Park,'' ``I
don't do no more.'' Fans of McCulloch's work on the ``Kids in the
Hall'' series may end up thinking one of the things he don't do no
more is show his comic talents, after seeing this fitfully
diverting picture.
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch's setting for his romantic comedy is a dog park, a
place where pooch owners can take their animals and allow them to
run free without their chains and frolic with other doggies. These
parks have become the gyms of the '90s, a meet market where moneyed
yuppies can mingle and find a love connection. ``Dog Park'' follows
Andy (Luke Wilson) and Lorna (Natasha Henstridge), a pair who
always seem on the verge of coupling, but never quite get around to
it.
</P>
<P>
   They've glimpsed each other at the Dog Park, where Andy takes
the dog he's forced to share custody of with his ex-girlfriend
(Kathleen Robertson), even though she doesn't much care for the
dog. (The poor animal moans in the corner when Robertson and her
new punky boyfriend go at it, on a more regular basis than most
dogs.) Lorna and Andy have even had a promising first date, on a
random meeting at a bar. But Andy is warned not to pursue Lorna by
Jeri (Janeane Garofalo), citing his need to compulsively bounce
into relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog Park'' is about Lorna and Andy flitting around each other
and ending up in totally inappropriate relationships _ Andy with a
man-eater who immediately insinuates herself into his life like a
barnacle, and he's too nice a guy to push her away. Lorna throws
herself into caring for her dog. It's a great setting for a comedy,
though the dogs don't have a whole lot to do with the story. Except
for Garofalo's _ she spoils the pair of boxers she owns with her
live-in boyfriend, played by McCulloch. They have a doting
relationship that turns out to be less satisfying than she thinks.
Maybe not all men are dogs, but McCulloch is. There's a climax
featuring a misfit dog psychologist (Mark McKinney) and a
graduation ceremony from a dog obedience program that falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch doesn't build any comic tension, and is saddled with a
performance by Wilson, his leading man, that's too much like his
character, Andy _ a nondescript nice guy. The revelation in ``Dog
Park'' is Henstridge, who shows a sexy command of character. Lorna
reveals herself to only her best friend (and her dog); otherwise
she shows a hurt wariness. When she lets her guard down with Andy,
and he flakes on her, she's bewildered. Her bionic alien in the
``Species'' films gave no indication of her ability to give a
performance _ she was just a striking physical presence chewing
through a B-movie plot. And she's added a bit of weight to her
face, which adds to her earthy warmth. ``Dog Park'' should at the
very least get her work.

TO EUROPEANS, RYDER CUP IS ABOUT MORE THAN GOLF 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ As the inventors and guardians of golf, the Scots took
it upon themselves to start heaving the first salvos, even months
before most people started thinking about the Ryder Cup that takes
place this week at The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish people spewed venom at David Duval, Tiger Woods, and
Mark O'Meara when the American golfers suggested that they should
be paid to take part in the event pitting the United States against
Europe every two years. When Duval went on to say the Ryder Cup was
nothing more than an ``exhibition match,'' many Europeans, not just
Scots, were apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   As Alex MacPherson, an insurance salesman and 12 handicap, put
it recently, standing in a pub in St. Andrews, the birthplace of
golf, ``That's the difference between you Yanks and the rest of us.
We look at golf as a great game, with great traditions. You look at
golf as a way to become a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a friendly trans-Atlantic match of skills, the Ryder Cup
has become a battlefield in the cultural wars between Europe and
the United States. Not only is the Ryder Cup taken far more
passionately here than in the United States, it has come to be seen
by many Europeans as providing evidence of not only the differences
separating the two continents, but of the superiority of European
values and way of life.
</P>
<P>
   In European eyes, the American Ryder Cup team symbolizes
everything that is wrong with the United States. The American team
is seen as coarse, pampered, spoiled, ridiculously overpaid, and
wildly self-centered.
</P>
<P>
   Worst, in European estimation, is that the Americans are
uncouth. Two years ago, when the Ryder Cup was played in
Valderrama, Spain, the Americans publicly complained about the
local food and sent out for pizza. Many Europeans thought it an
unforgivable insult.
</P>
<P>
   As Paolo Micheli, a pizza maker in southern Italy, put it, ``The
worst food in Europe has got to be better than most of the best
food in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans find it unfathomable, and slightly obscene, that
Woods is being paid more money by Nike to promote its products than
he could possibly win on the golf course throughout his entire
career.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between European and American golfers are traced
to history and geography. Many Europeans, especially older ones,
believe Americans don't respond to adversity as well as they do
because the United States has not suffered as deeply the ravages of
two world wars. European golf courses, meanwhile, are not as lush
and meticulously groomed as American ones and are often more
susceptible to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Europeans gloat when American golfers falter
under difficult conditions, be it the whipping winds on a Scottish
course, or the expectation to win the Ryder Cup. The United States
has lost just seven times in 32 matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is made easy for the American tour players, from
the courtesy-car arrangements, to the hotels, to the pristine
condition of the courses,'' observed Lewine Mair, the golf writer
for The Daily Telegraph of London, in an article headlined,
``Europe spirit enriches challenge to the spoilt millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, she said, European tour players compete on more
difficult courses, sometimes in hostile environments in the Middle
East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angry elements can help to whip them into old friends,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister,
has been complaining that with the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the United States has gone from superpower to ``hyperpower,'' a
country so advanced economically and technologically that it
arrogantly dictates to even its closest allies.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Europeans share that assessment and point to the
last two American Ryder Cup teams as embodying that arrogance. In
1997, the Americans were heavily favored to win, talked and acted
like they would, but lost. Similarly, the American side at The
Country Club is seen, some say even by themselves, as unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, the words of Payne Stewart, a member of
the US team, have appeared daily in newspapers across Europe as he
offered an assessment of the European team.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, they shouldn't be caddying for us,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Few European newspapers have bothered to add what Stewart went
on to say: ``But that is not what the Ryder Cup is about. It is
about bringing your game to the event, and they bring it.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent war in Kosovo showed the depth and strength of the
trans-Atlantic alliance, and despite the carping over golf, there
is a mutual dependency between the Americans and their European
allies. But as the European Union attempts to rival the United
States as an economic bloc, trans-Atlantic spats in areas other
than golf are becoming more common. Besides creating a single
European currency this year, the European Union is trying to
fashion a common foreign policy that would make Europe less
subordinate to Washington in the realm of world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In much of Europe, and especially in Britain, there is
widespread opposition to the use of genetically-modified food, most
of it produced by American companies. The European Union refuses to
allow the importation of hormone-treated US beef. French farmers
have been retaliating against US trade sanctions by trashing
McDonald's outlets recently.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the European-American disputes get played out in
the ornate rooms of foreign ministries or the World Trade
Organization in Geneva, for many Europeans it is easier to look to
the Ryder Cup as offering a playing field where the differences
between Americans and Europeans can be seen, analyzed, and
commented on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even this is falling victim to the American-inspired
free-trade principles that the French deride as Yankee
globalization. In Britain, where interest in the Ryder Cup is the
most intense, the event is no longer on free TV. To watch it, you
must subscribe to Rupert Murdoch's satellite network, Sky.
</P>
<P>
   While it is conventional wisdom in Europe that the Ryder Cup
offers a metaphor for modern America, it is less common for
Europeans to admit that it says much about them, too, whether it is
their passion for sports, or their propensity to dismiss Americans
as too fat, too rich and, well, just too many.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott, a sportswriter for The Observer in London,
believes the Europeans have been able to dominate the Ryder Cup for
the last decade because they have exploited not only the
differences between the two continents, but also human psychology
common to all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans bond closer than the Americans, partly because
the European golf circuit is a friendlier, more sociable place than
the US Tour,'' he said, ``but also because the smart money almost
always suggested they were about to be taken outside and given a
good hiding.''

OIMET WAS THE HERO OF THE 17TH HOLE IN 1913 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ As a young lad growing up on Clyde Street in
Brookline, Francis Ouimet would frequently cut through swatches of
The Country Club as he walked to and from the Putterham School.
``Not that I was granted any such privileges,'' wrote Ouimet in his
autobiography. ``But in the role of a trespasser I discovered that
this route saved many footsteps, got me to school on time and, more
important, enabled me to get home with the least possible delay.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no specific mention of the 17th hole at TCC he would
help immortalize in the game's history books, the Vardon trap that
still cuts menacingly out into the fairway, or how a shot by Harry
Vardon and a dramatic putt by Ouimet 86 years ago transformed the
game as we knew it in America. When Vardon's attempt to cut the
corner ended up against an embankment in the trap and Ouimet
decisively holed his putt for a birdie, he led one of the giants of
golf by three strokes with one hole left in a playoff for the 1913
US Open championship.
</P>
<P>
   Ouimet was the neighborhood kid who picked up golf balls in his
traipses over the hallowed turf of The Country Club and took to the
game with a makeshift set of clubs. He was just 20, an amateur who
had won the Massachusetts state championship earlier in the summer
at Wollaston GC. He entered the US Open almost as an afterthought,
qualified, and found himself tied with fellow Briton Ted Ray
entering the fourth round. The kid against the legends.
</P>
<P>
   As the round evolved, Ouimet would falter against his formidable
adversaries, who were on an extended exhibition tour of the United
States. It was the year before Vardon would win his record-sixth
British Open, and World War II would lead to the suspension of
championship golf in Europe. Ouimet needed to play the final two
holes in 1 under to reach the historic playoff. So he walked to the
17th tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the last two holes had to be made in three,'' wrote
Ouimet, ``the other in four.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I splashed along in the mud and rain, I had no further
hunches. I just wanted an opportunity to putt for one of those
threes. I got it on the 17th. A drive and a second shot placed my
ball on the green 15 feet from the cup. It was now or never. As I
looked the line of the putt over, I thought of one thing, giving
the ball a chance, that is getting it to the hole. I struck that
putt as firmly as any putt I ever hit, saw it take the roll, bang
smack against the back of the hole and fall in for the three.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ouimet managed to save par from the front cut of the
rough, the playoff was on for Saturday ``for the championship I had
been reluctant to enter,'' Ouimet noted.
</P>
<P>
   Ray would fade out of serious contention on the 15th, when he
took a six, and finished with a 78. Vardon trailed by one
approaching the 17th tee, and decided to gamble. ``If a player
chooses to risk a trap on the left and gets away with it, he has a
short pitch to the green.'' He didn't make it, and Ouimet was
safely in the fairway to the right of the trap. Vardon would take a
bogey 5, and when Ouimet holed his putt from 15 feet he was three
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 18th hole was a hard two-shotter,'' wrote Ouimet. ``The
rains had turned the race track in front of the green into a bog,
and my one thought was to get over mud. All hit fine tee shots. I
placed my second on the green. It did not enter my head that I was
about to become the open champion until I stroked my first putt to
within eight or nine inches of the hole. Then, as I stepped up to
make that short putt, I became very nervous. I dropped the putt.
Nothing but the most intense concentration brought me victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Vardon (77) would finish 5-6, so Ouimet, with his 3-4 finish,
shot 72 to win by five strokes. This was acclaimed in headlines on
both sides of the pond and, as as the fabled English journalist
Bernard Darwin once noted, Ouimet ``laid, if I may respectuflly say
so, the foundation of the great American golfing empire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 17th,'' as the London Times noted in its editions of Sept.
22, 1913, ``practically settled matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was by far the most enthralling game of golf that I have
ever seen, nor is it, I think, any exaggeration to say that Mr.
Ouimet gave an exhibition of skill, nerve and courage that,
considering the circumstances, has never been equalled. ``Mr.
Ouimet's golf yesterday was astonishing. I should have said that
nothing could be finer than the way in which, on the day before, he
finished in better than perfect figures. I think today's
achievement was finer still.'' There was no escaping the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 17th settled the match,'' the newspaper noted. ``Vardon,
running things too fine, was bunkered while Mr. Ouimet played a
perfect tee shot to exactly the right place. Vardon got out and got
his 5, but Mr. Ouimet played a lovely shot to within six yards of
the hole. He trickled the ball gently downhill: it went on and on
and then fell in. He had gained two strokes and was three ahead
with one hole to go. Nothing but a wet, muddy bunker in front of
the green or a proverbial stroke of apoplexy could save England
now. Vardon would find his way into a fronting bunker on the 18th,
but the Vardon Bunker had already been selected.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 17th entered into play when the US Open returned to The
Country Club in 1963 to recognize the 50th anniversary of Ouimet's
monumental achievement. The match was decided in another playoff,
won by Julius Boros (293-70) over relatively obscure Texas pro Jack
Cupit (293-73) and an ailing Arnold Palmer (296-76). But the
playoff may never have been necessary bit for Cupit's mishap on 17
in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   When Palmer took three putts on the 17th in that fourth round,
Cupit was in the lead and Boros was already in at 293. If Cupit
finished 4-4, he would win by two. He walked the 17th, a little in
the dark as to precisely where he stood. ``Communications weren't
as good then as they are now,'' he said on the eve of the 75th
anniversary US Open at The Country Club in 1988. ``I got very angry
with my wife because she didn't know how I stood.'' Cupit had hit a
3-wood wood left into an upslope in deep grass. ``If she had told
me what Arnold had done and what Julius had done, I would have
taken out a 2-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could do was pitch out. I hit a sand wedge 30 feet past
the pin, just over the green.'' From there he took a six, and when
Cupit just missed a birdie putt on the 18th, it was playoff time.

11TH HOLE STUMPED PALMER IN 1963 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The June chill was still in the air, the wet
grass was locking onto any club, and with every swing, this monster
of a golf course kept getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Time was running out and the deficit, a manageable two shots
just a few holes ago, was now four.
</P>
<P>
   Damn, thought Arnold Palmer, best do something fast. He could
swing hard and try to make something happen, but he always did
that. No, now was the time to swing really hard and really make
something happen.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th hole is where he could jump back into this US Open
playoff at The Country Club. Palmer deemed it ``ridiculous''
earlier in the week, and he was sure he wasn't off base. The hole
ran some 300 yards straight out from the tee and then sharply rose
up hill for another 160 yards of fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palmer had birdied that hole twice and if he could do it
again, this playoff could swing in his favor. The thought
kick-started his engine, at least for a moment, and he forgot his
stomach was twisting. What was it that he ate last night?
</P>
<P>
   The intestinal problem had plagued him all day, but Palmer tried
to ignore it. He also attempted to forget about the big move he was
going to make at the 12th and take care of a more pressing matter _
the 11th hole.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as hard as 12, thought Palmer. ``So why am I playing
it so poorly?'' A pair of routine pars in rounds 1 and 2. Then a
triple. Then a bogey. Palmer hitched at his belt, pulled up his
pants, and thought to himself, ``Time for a birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, thwaaaacccckkk . . . the swing was over in the blink of an
eye, his rapid takeaway matched only by the ferocious
followthrough. His driver shot skyward, and as usual, Palmer was
twisted in a knot to follow the flight of his tee ball. But the
forehead was wrinkled. The scowl was on. So was the hook.
</P>
<P>
   It was headed left. In a hurry. Palmer watched anxiously, but
quickly realized the ball had not reached the corner and he would
be blocked out.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't know was how blocked out.
</P>
<P>
   So he started on one of the longest and loneliest walks a golfer
can make _ to a ball in trouble. He fixed his eyes on where he
thought it would be and he waited to see it.
</P>
<P>
   If he had a full swing, he vowed, he would draw a long shot
around the corner and reach the green.
</P>
<P>
   If he had half a swing, he vowed, he would punch something out
in front of the water and make par the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Then he realized the first two options were no longer part of
the equation. Palmer saw that his ball rested in a tree stump. A
rotted tree stump, no less. He cursed the greenskeeper who had
chosen not to remove it. He cursed himself for that wild hook. He
cursed himself for not making birdie at the par-5 ninth and for
bogeying the par-4 10th, holes on which he had lost two shots.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer stared at his ball, sitting there in the stump, and
considered taking a drop. This was no time for that. ``How can I?
I'm already down five shots,'' he said to himself. A quick glance
up brought Julius Boros into view. The man with the lead, the man
with one US Open title under his belt, the man who already made
three birdies on the day . . . ``he's sitting dead middle of the
fairway, I'm over here in a tree stump and I'm going to take a
drop? No chance.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Boros was Jack Cupit. The young, unheralded
Texan could have won this tournament in regulation, but a double
bogey at the 17th proved costly. Now, he, too, was trying to mount
a charge from a difficult situation. He was buried in thick rough,
probably unable to get it safely home in two, and he waited for
Palmer to punch out.
</P>
<P>
   Only Palmer was not going to punch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be kidding,'' Cupit whispered to himself. ``What
is he doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer wasn't quite sure himself. He was only sure he wasn't
going to surrender any more shots without a fight. And the sleeves
were certainly rolled up now as he took a full swing with a long
iron. He had to come down at a steep angle, catch the ball cleanly,
and rip through it because the wood was certainly tougher than
turf.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators formed a semicircle behind him and tried to lean
closer to see exactly what type of magical shot their hero would
attempt. The club shot straight up, then Palmer dropped the hammer
quickly, only the club face caught too much of the trunk and even
he, with all his forearm strength, couldn't get to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The club bounced and Palmer had completely missed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The blood started boiling. With little set-up he swung the club
again, this time taking it back faster, following through even
quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Thump.
</P>
<P>
   Again he hit the tree stump.
</P>
<P>
   Again the club bounced.
</P>
<P>
   Again he missed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The 1963 US Open was now over _ at least for him. He had lost in
a playoff the year before, to Jack Nicklaus at Oakmont, and that
hurt. This one? Bad weather, brutal course, and some awful shots.
He felt lucky to be in a playoff, though at this moment people were
probably wondering if he'd ever finish this hole.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with another swing at it, Palmer was able to move the
ball back onto the fairway. He looked toward Boros, who had drilled
a 3-iron to 12 feet, and silently acknowledged that the chase was
over. There would be no charge on his day. Boros shot 70, Cupit 73,
Palmer 76.
</P>
<P>
   But because the rules said he had to, Palmer played on. His
fifth shot at the 11th landed on the green and Palmer two-putted
for a triple-bogey 7 to now trail by seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   He had played that par-4 11th in 7 over par.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Tree Stump,'' said Palmer. ``I remember.''

9THE HOLE LEFT NORMAN ON THE ROCKS IN 1988 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ There is a cliff on the ninth hole of The
Country Club, a cliff that is pure, stark New England, rock that
just as well could be on the hard coast of Maine or jutting out
from New Hampshire's White Mountains. Except that it is here, on
the right side of the ninth fairway, needing a drive of some 300
yards to clear it.
</P>
<P>
   It is The Country Club's Rock of Ages. Who knows what glacier
left it there? Or how many eons ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Russell was standing there 11 years ago when Greg Norman
drove his ball atop the cliff in the second round of the United
States Open, carrying a standard with names and scores on it. And
Larry Bird, a friend of Norman's, was not far away, following the
Aussie and playing partners Larry Mize and Craig Stadler, in awe at
the golf he was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've been to one of these things,''
Bird had said. ``I like it. I play some golf but from where these
guys hit the ball on the tee, it's a whole different game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was reminded that if the Celtics had won two more games
against the Pistons in the recently completed Eastern Conference
finals, the Celtics would be playing the Lakers that night in the
NBA Finals. ``If, if, if . . . '' said Bird. ``If Greg were 2
under, he'd be the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norman was 3 over par at the time. Russell knew that because
he was keeping score. Norman then hit a second shot on the par-5
515-yard hole that came up just short of the creek, some 150 yards
from the green. Norman's ball seemed to be on grass but as any
native knows _ and many a lawnmower blade has been damaged because
of the unknowing _ grass is not always grass in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Rocks lurk. Rocks loom. They're hidden an inch or 2 or 3 below
the loam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing right over there,'' said Russell, a member of
The Country Club from Wellesley, pointing to the spot the other
day. ``He hit an iron and he obviously couldn't tell what was
beneath the ball . . . right about there. Greg swung and you heard
the noise. His club had hit rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Mize was not far away when the Aussie swung. ``It sounded like
he had hit a boulder,'' said the Georgian. And Stadler, too, had
heard one of the more uncommon sounds made when a professional
swings a golf club on a fairway manicured to an agronomist's
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew he had hit something,'' said Stadler. ``You could
hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   All were shocked. ``There was something under the grass,''
recalled Russell. ``He hit his shot and there was a rock underneath
the grass and it was a big rock and it just caught his club and
then he grabbed his muscles . . . his left hand I think it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Norman moved to the 10th tee, where he drove
his ball into the rough _ true US Open rough _ and then took out
his 6-iron. After hitting that iron, Norman felt more pain and told
Mize and Stadler, ``Fellas, I can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Never had Greg Norman walked off a course and withdrawn. He
would talk only briefly when he reached the clubhouse, saying the
moment ``was the low point of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was thought Norman had broken his left wrist,
which was swollen. With his arm in a sling, Norman tried to explain
what had happened, saying, ``Unbeknownst to me, when I hit my
7-iron shot, I hit straight down on top of a rock and I hit the
rock and the ball at the same time and something had to give.''
</P>
<P>
   By that night, Norman was in Birmingham, Ala., where noted
orthopedist James Andrews diagnosed the injury as a sprained, not
broken, wrist. The next day, Norman gave an interview during the
Open telecast from poolside at his Florida home, his arm in a
sling.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics muttered that Norman had withdrawn because he was
fading out of contention. Others said the mere sight of Mize, who
had chipped in on the second playoff hole to shock Norman and win
the Masters a year earlier, was unnerving. But those who were on
that ninth hole heard the clang and saw the pain on Norman's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit that rock hard,'' said Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth is nicknamed ``Himalayas'' because of the cliff down
the right side of the fairway, near the landing area, and because
of the rocks left by those long-ago glaciers. In stroke play, the
ninth often is the second-easiest hole at The Country Club, but in
the Ryder Cup, as TCC pro Don Callahan put it, ``this is a
wonderful match-play hole.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because each golfer first must decide whether to try to
fly the cliff _ some 300 or so yards away _ and leave himself with
a comfortable attempt at reaching the green in two. Normally, an
attempt to drive the cliff is dangerous because heavy rough and
brush used to be on the downslope of the cliff, catching balls not
hit quite far enough and making for a most difficult second shot.
</P>
<P>
   But, as US captain Ben Crenshaw has suggested, in several areas
of the course some of the risk has been eliminated because the
brush and bushes have been cleared from the downside of the cliff.
Even so, as Callahan pointed out, the decision to try to reach the
green ``might depend on which way the wind is blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ninth at The Country Club (it is actually the 11th hole for
members but the course has been reconfigured for championship play)
may be unforgettableto Norman, and may call for some serious
decision-making by the Ryder Cuppers.
</P>
<P>
   But to Callahan, the ninth ``is a hole that is spectacular in
its beauty.'' No blind shots here, for the full and entire beauty
of the hole can be seen from the tee to its green 515 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is even a more spectacular view from behind the green
looking back to the tee,'' said Callahan, ``especially in a few
weeks when the leaves have turned and the colors are brilliant. It
is such a beautiful hole.''
</P>
<P>
   To all, except maybe Greg Norman.

SETTING THE COURSE: HOME CAPTAIN'S PREROGATIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It is the home captain's luxury. The captain
of the host Ryder Cup team can look at his golfers, assess their
strengths and weaknesses, and then tailor the golf course to what
he considers their best advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In blunt terms, it might be like a baseball manager having the
outfield fences moved back 25 feet in the World Series if he feels
the opposing team has more power. Or perhaps over-watering the
infield dirt near the bases to slow down an opponent known for
speedy base-running. In golf, though, the captain's changes usually
are subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In thinking of suggestions of what to do about this golf
course to make it more geared toward our team, there's really not
much you can do,'' said US captain Ben Crenshaw about his suggested
changes to The Country Club course. ``I just thought maybe a little
lighter rough off the fairways would be a little more conducive, a
little more exciting in match play, especially playing into those
little greens.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crenshaw did recommend a number of changes, and the TCC
staff has followed through. ``Ben's overall theme,'' said Don
Callahan, TCC's director of golf, ``was to make the course more
playable.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But a more overriding theme of the changes fits in
with Crenshaw's philosophy of what wins in match play. ``The one
great thing about match play,'' said the captain, ``is that I think
it lends itself more to a little more aggressive play. That's the
way you win holes. You can't tiptoe through this thing . . . you've
got to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw clearly had a choice when he considered what to do
here. He could have returned The Country Club to a true US Open
look, with very deep rough and narrow fairways, a combination that
has caused European golfers to struggle year after year at the US
Open. Or he could play to what he considers his strengths:
long-hitters who should take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw chose the latter. The fairways are relatively wide and
the rough has been lowered, not only outside the fairways but also
in certain key areas where aggressive shots might end up.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for aggressive shots that miss the mark is far less
than what it was at the 1988 US Open. The theme seems to be:
Players will not be fatally injured for taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth hole _ a 513-yard par 5 _ is a prime example. One of
the most noticeable changes from 1988 is that bushes and brush have
been removed from the downslope of the cliff that looms some
290-300 yards from the tee. Long hitters now can try to drive over
the cliff without worrying that their ball might get caught in a
thicket _ a thicket with a downhill lie, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw carried the aggressive theme further by having the
rough on the hill fronting the ninth green lowered dramatically.
The change will tempt golfers to try to reach the green in two
without risking their ball being deeply embedded in heavy rough
just short of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Ben had this rough cut to short rough from the top
almost to the very bottom of the hill,'' said Callahan. ``If the
wind is agreeable, a long-hitting US golfer such as Tiger Woods can
be thinking eagle on the hole, perhaps, without fretting about a
bogey with a shot just a bit short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben also widened the entrance into No. 12 by about 10 feet,''
said Callahan of the toughest hole on the course, a 486-yard par-4,
which is 36 yards longer than it played during the 1988 Open. ``Ben
also made the rough (fronting the green) a little lighter,'' said
Callahan, ``so if your ball comes up there bouncing, it can bounce
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw also widened the entrance to the 15th green ``so that
if you're bouncing in, you can bounce on,'' said Callahan.
``Another thing that Ben did was he shortened the rough that
connects the fairway to the green on the sixth hole. The rough is
now about 1 1/2 inches there.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw was thinking about Woods and other long-hitters on the
US team. Long-hitters always have been torn on this 310-yard par-4
about whether to try to drive the green (Woods has done it in
practice); but heavy rough in front of the green made those who
failed pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's theory here is that it encourages long hitters to try to
drive it on the green,'' said Callahan. ``Because if Tiger, for
instance, hits it straight, his ball might bounce and bounce onto
the green, whereas the way it was before, the ball would bounce and
stop in the rough. Ben's thinking there was, `Let's encourage them
to hit a driver there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What has been most disappointing to Crenshaw about playing
conditions during the practice rounds has been the relative
stillness of the air. On a calm day, The Country Club plays far
differently than it does on a windy day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have a little more breeze out there,'' said the US
captain, ``because that's when the course really starts to play
interesting. Because, then, you've got to know just how far you can
go off a certain tee and (a breeze) unlocks so many different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw has said time and again that his team ``must break
down'' the course, learn its subtleties, and absolutely must pick
up ``a feel for the course.'' The players can do some of this on
their own, he said, and he can impart his deeper knowledge of the
course to fill in voids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players can go out in their practice rounds and search around
for their best way,'' said Crenshaw; ``there's no substitute for
doing that. And that's why the practice round (in late August when
eight of the US players made their first tour of the course) was so
important. The fact is, there are some holes on this course that
keep you off balance, and the more you see it, the better off you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players, Crenshaw went on, can step onto a new course ``and
grasp it very quickly. But this isn't one of them. This definitely
isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The US captain has another advantage over his European
counterpart: He will have a strong say in how the pins are placed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PGA is still setting up the pins, but we discuss it,''
said Crenshaw. ``The bottom line is that these greens are fast and
full of little undulations, and if you move the pin over 10 feet on
these greens, it makes a lot of difference. And there're a lot of
greens out here like that.''

BIG YEAR TAKING SHAPE FOR THE PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Finally healthy, Terry Glenn is showing the
form that led Bobby Grier to choose the Ohio State receiver with
the seventh pick of the 1996 draft, over the fervent objections of
then-coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the spin moves and fakes that allowed him to gain
critical extra yards in the second half of New England's comeback
win over the Colts last Sunday, Glenn did many little things, such
as making a peel-back block to spring fullback Tony Carter for a
15-yard gain on a swing pass from Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an excellent blocker in college,'' said Glenn. ``When I
first got here I was considered undersized and I couldn't really
block as well as I did in college, but now I've put on a couple of
pounds. A couple of injuries have prevented me from blocking like
that the last couple of years. When I'm out there, I give 110
percent and I do everything I can. Blocks, catching, running decoy
routes is all a part of being a wide receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now he may be the best receiver in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   After two games, he's caught 14 passes for 235 yards (16.8 yards
per catch) with a long gain of 45 yards. Over the last four
seasons, the Patriots are 25-11 when he plays, 7-7 when he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures certainly indicate his importance, but Glenn
probably would like to see the statistic put to rest permanently
with injuries no longer being a factor when discussing his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can say this is the best start I've had,'' Glenn
said. ``As long as our team is winning, I feel I'm off to a good
start. It was important (to start off well), but I wasn't concerned
about the start I had. My whole outlook now is to just play. We're
2-0 and I can't ask for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast starts haven't been a Glenn staple. In 1996 Glenn missed
the season opener with a hamstring injury but caught six balls
against Buffalo in his NFL debut the following week. In 1997, he
caught three balls in the Patriots' first game, a 41-7 win over San
Diego, but he missed the next three games. Last year, he had eight
catches in his first two games.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, 14 catches while facing double coverage most
every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams have stayed with the same scheme they come into the
game with because they've practiced that all week,'' said Glenn.
``They come in and double, they change it up as to how they're
doubling, but they double a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he is working with offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese to find ways to bypass the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie is a great coordinator. He's been around a long time,''
Glenn said. ``I'm not telling him anything he doesn't already know,
but I may enlighten him sometimes about things that the defense is
doing to me on the field. I know that he's up there and he can see
things up in the box, but it's kind of hard unless you're down
there on the field. I just like to give my two cents worth.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of confidence and maturity, that Glenn is willing to
assume the role of leader and star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I would do more as time goes on,'' he said. ``I
have a little more experience. I'm getting older. Anything I can do
to help the team win, I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has grown tired of the attention so many place on his
string of injuries. He has admitted that he didn't work as hard as
he should have until this past offseason, when he came to
Foxborough four times a week to go through a program overseen by
strength and conditioning coach Johnny Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how brutal this game is,'' Glenn said. ``All kinds
of guys have gone down already, guys who stay in the weight room
all year. You can kind of figure out what this game is about when
you're out on the field. I've come to the conclusion that it
(staying healthy) is luck. You have to put your fate in God's hands
and go from there because you can't control what's on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said that belief has helped him dismiss the critics who
call him fragile and question his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know me,'' Glenn said. ``If they don't take the
time to get to know me then I don't care what they say because I
have to live my life and they have to live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and quarterback Drew Bledsoe have reached the point where
they are so confident they figure they can bring the Patriots back
from any deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some days you come out and the ball just isn't going your
way,'' Glenn said. ``The first half last week, we couldn't get
anything going . . . five three-and-outs. But in the second half,
we started to put things together, make a couple of drives. Drew
got hot and we just stuck with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn has matured, he also sees growth in Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I notice is his decision-making and his poise on the
field,'' said Glenn. ``The guy knows what he can do. In my first
year, you would say that maybe he (Drew) can do it. Now you know he
can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn can't rest on two good games. This week when the
Giants come to town, Glenn will have a whole new set of problems.
He may be seeing a lot of Jason Sehorn, the All-Pro cornerback who
returns after missing last season because of knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NFL you can be beaten badly by any team anytime if you
don't bring your A game,'' Glenn said of the Giants' 50-21 loss to
the Redskins. ``They have a good defense, good linebackers, good in
the secondary. They have a lot of confidence in Sehorn. He had a
nice interception against us in the one game I faced him a couple
of years ago. They're definitely going to use his strength.''

THIS JUDD DOESN'T SING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a study in contrasts, you can't do much better
than Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Well-read intellectual and rabid sports fan. Down-home country
gal and French-speaking sophisticate. Articulate chatterbox but
tight-lipped, visceral performer. Part-Appalachian, part-Hollywood
hillbilly. Rags-to-riches poster girl. Born-again Christian with a
pronounced naughty streak.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, a Judd who can't sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's not entirely true,'' the apple-cheeked Ashley says
with a laugh, although she's often noted in the past that mom Naomi
and sis Wynonna got the pipes in the family. ``I think these things
just sorted themselves out when we were little. My sister expressed
an interest in music from the time she was in Brownies. When we got
a piano, she sat down and picked out the `Pink Panther' theme. I
was in third grade and walked across a field like a character in
the book I was reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one of those contradictions, that venerable one about
the steel magnolia, marked the Southland-born Southerner's pursuit
of an acting career. The day she moved back to L.A. after growing
up in Kentucky, she nailed an agent. Then she got a role in the
first film she auditioned for, ``Kuffs'' _ after refusing to take
the part initially offered her, which required nudity.
</P>
<P>
   That same, strong-willed confidence is more than evident in
Judd's latest movie, ``Double Jeopardy,'' in which she plays a
pampered young wife whose life takes a decidedly Charles Bronson
turn. Wrongly convicted of killing her crooked financier husband
(Bruce Greenwood), Libby Parsons learns in prison that he faked his
death, took up a new identity and disappeared with their young son.
</P>
<P>
   Upon her release, a toned-and-trained Libby relentlessly tracks
her no-good ex to New Orleans, where she intends to kill him (the
film is premised, inaccurately, on the supposition that you can't
be charged twice with murdering the same person). But she's being
pursued just as single-mindedly by her parole officer. He's played,
intimidatingly enough, by Tommy Lee Jones, the old ``Fugitive''
chaser himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't apprehensive about working with Tommy,'' Judd says of
the formidable actor, who has a reputation for not suffering fools.
``I just made sure I'd remembered a lot of the dialogue from `Coal
Miner's Daughter,' so I could say `Doo, you sound like an ol' bear
growlin',' tease him and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Cute. But Judd's main effort went toward ensuring that her
protagonist remained tough-minded and not succumb to the weepier
possibilities of the woman-in-jeopardy genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you become a little bit wiser about material, you can
understand subtlety,'' Judd, 31, reckons. ``When Libby gets the bad
news, I think people respond more to her tapping into grit and
resilience. There were a few more dramatic scenes that were shot
but not included in the final cut, I think rightly so. They didn't
contribute to the momentum and the adrenaline of the ride we wanted
to take the audience on, which was this righteous and _ though I
sort of hesitate to say it _ revenge quest.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Leonard Goldberg, whose creative interest in strong
women ranges from the ``Charlie's Angels'' TV series to the Julia
Roberts hit ``Sleeping With the Enemy,'' had originally developed
``Double Jeopardy'' for Jodie Foster. But when that actress'
pregnancy clashed with the shooting schedule, he went straight to
someone he knew could deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you have to love and root for this woman because
she's going to carry you through the whole movie,'' Goldberg says.
``But then you have to have someone who can play this beautiful
woman who looks very comfortable wearing expensive Armani outfits,
is a sexy wife, and tender and loving with her child, but who then
encounters a nightmare and finds the physical and inner strength
that even she probably didn't know she possessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she is not going to be defeated. It required someone who
could do all of those things, and I thought Ashley had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd cautions against notions of superhuman self-assurance.
She's happy to recount moments of lost control, such as the
grueling scene where Libby's locked in a coffin that had her in
tears all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that gets me mad, or disappoints me about
Hollywood, is people assuming that vulnerability is not there,''
she says. ``Just because a person is confident or well-spoken,
well-rounded and interested in the world beyond their tiny little
sphere, doesn't mean that I don't have that. It comes and goes, but
we're all actually very fragile people; it's amazing how tenuous
the art of living is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I just have the ability to overcome that when it
counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd's sphere of interests, not surprisingly, don't match the
typical star's portfolio. Anyone who's watched a University of
Kentucky basketball game knows that she's been a rabid fan since
graduating a Phi Beta Kappa nominee from the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subjectively and objectively, the argument can be made that
it's the program of the century,'' she says, fanatically. ``I've
been known to get in the car and drive five hours to see their
basketball games, then drive back that night. But I wouldn't have
it any other way; I motivate myself by saying, `How will I feel at
tipoff if I'm not there and have to watch this on television?'''
</P>
<P>
   That drive is from a big spread southwest of Nashville, where
Ashley lives in a restored 1819 farmhouse amid acres of forest and
farmland, not far from her mother and her sister's places. Staying
so close to the family is important to her, as is staying far from
L.A.'s intrusive media swirl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have Spago,'' she says appreciatively. ``I think that
my peace of mind and my solitude are greatly enhanced by being at
home. And being close to family satisfies and nourishes something
that you don't even know exists in you until it's at home getting
stroked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judd women have always been close; for a long time, though,
it was in far less comfortable circumstances. After divorcing
marketer Michael Ciminella when Ashley was very little, Naomi moved
her girls to Kentucky, where Ashley attended a dozen different
schools and sometimes lived in places without electricity or
running water.
</P>
<P>
   The Judds' act took off as Ashley was coming into puberty; she
could usually be found buried in a book while her mother and sister
were singing. If she felt left out at all, that might explain some
of her more attention-getting gambits later in life, such as
wearing that daringly revealing slit gown at the Academy Awards
ceremonies a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   Judd has also been involved in some pretty high-profile
romances, with singer Michael Bolton and co-stars Robert De Niro
(``Heat'') and Matthew McConaughey (``A Time to Kill''). She's
currently dating Scottish race car driver Dario Franchitti.
</P>
<P>
   If his dangerous profession concerns her at all, she's typically
good at overcoming it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been driving since he was 3 and racing since he was 13,
so he's really good at what he does,'' she says. ``Though there was
this one Scotsman we had dinner with recently who asked to see his
hands and said, `They're so small, and they're all that stands
between death and you.' But I don't worry. It's easy to trust him,
even when he drives fast with me in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd co-stars with a different Scot, ``Star Wars''' superhot
Ewan McGregor, in her next feature release, ``Eye of the
Beholder.'' In that film she plays a serial killer obsessed over,
and protected by, a troubled detective.
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly the kind of thing Naomi Judd, who has recently
added her voice to the chorus of complaint against violent and
sexually themed entertainment, probably wouldn't approve of. But
Ashley sees little conflict between her work and her own strong, if
not rigid, beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps me to define a movie,'' she says of her
faith. ``Because, as in literature, you can basically reduce a
character and a story to some kind of a search. Like the classic
story elements that we're taught in high school _ humanity vs.
nature, vs. itself, vs. animal _ a person either has the love of
God or they don't. And that's a great point of departure in
figuring out how to feel when you're playing something.''
</P>
<P>
   And Judd has to admit that there's nothing contradictory about
her love for the journeys that grow from that starting point.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they do require some hard traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it, I love acting, I can't imagine not doing it,'' she
says. ``And I'm at a point where I've done enough movies that the
way I approach the work has become second nature. So I want to make
sure that I've got a little, internal barometer that doesn't let me
get lazy or take something for granted or assume I know how to play
something. I need a chance to inject it with a a new kind of
creativity or an atypical approach.'' &QL;

 &HT;    IS RECYCLING BECOMING A FEEL-GOOD EXERCISE THAT WASTES MONEY?

   WASHINGTON _ When the Coca-Cola Co. declared nine years ago that
it would use recycled plastic in its soft drink bottles, Thomas
Duff dismissed the announcement as a ``public relations exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost track of the economics,'' said Duff, president of
Wellman Inc., the largest plastics recycler in the country. He
predicted the recycling initiative, which was announced with
fanfare and promises of ``closed loop'' recycling of plastic
bottles, would not last long.
</P>
<P>
   He was right.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, Coke had quietly dropped the recycling
program. Now a national campaign headed by the GrassRoots Recycling
Network of Athens, Ga., is trying to pressure the huge soft drink
company into resuming it.
</P>
<P>
   Same bottle, opposite end, says Duff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bottle that comes in through recycling gets used right
now,'' Duff said. ``It displaces a certain amount of plastic from
the market. If Coke or anyone else starts buying recycled plastic,
other users will just be forced to go to virgin resin market.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Duff says, very little if any more polyethylene
terephthalate, or ``PET,'' the material used in the bottles, will
be recycled.
</P>
<P>
   His argument, which is hotly disputed by recycling advocates,
goes to the heart of a swelling debate over America's commitment to
recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Despite mandates by some states, notably California and New
York, that at least 50 percent of all municipal solid waste be
recycled by the end of next year, some experts say the country has
just about reached a practical recycling limit of between 25 and 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it semi-realistically, I don't see how you can
get much more than this,'' says Winston Porter, former assistant
administrator for solid waste of the Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cities and counties in states with the 50 percent
mandates may face a ``trash 2K'' problem next year, required by
state law to operate recycling programs that will result in
products that are worth significantly less than the cost of
reclaiming them, Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, now head of a Leesburg, Va., consulting firm, the Waste
Policy Center, set EPA's national goal of recycling 25 percent of
the nation's solid waste when he was at EPA in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It's neither economical nor wise, he contends, to push the
process much further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Composting doesn't make much sense when you spend $10 to make
a $2 product,'' he says. With a glut of landfill capacity now
operating under EPA safety standards, it makes more sense
economically and environmentally to take Coke's PET bottles _ and a
lot of other material _ to a landfill and just cover it up, he
thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who disagree with Porter is Bill Sheehan,
coordinator of the GrassRoots Recycling Network.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan and others believe deeply ingrained habits and policies
have distorted the way America handles solid waste, which he
prefers to call ``discarded resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Big garbage hauling companies make much more profit from
compacting municipal solid waste and disposing of it in a landfill
than they could make through reycling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These packer trucks manufacture garbage,'' he said. ``If
you're in the business of collecting and doing something with used
resources, you have to compete with the people who want to take it
to a landfill or an incinerator.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the resource stream, Sheehan says, are all
kinds of tax breaks and government policies that subsidize the use
of virgin materials. These range from the underwriting of timber
operations in national forests by the U.S. Forest Service to
special tax breaks for the petrochemicals industry.
</P>
<P>
   When Coke puts soda into a PET bottle, it does not have to
factor in the cost of mounting a war to protect the Persian Gulf
oil supply from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, as Sheehan sees it.
</P>
<P>
   And when that bottle goes into a landfill _ which Sheehan is
convinced will fail one day, even if it meets EPA standards today _
Coke doesn't have to pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're laughing all the way to the bank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Bill Hensel says the company has not
``reneged'' on a promise to recycle PET, as Sheehan's group
charges. Instead, he said, it agreed to try the idea, and ``it just
wasn't economically feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a Dec. 4, 1990, company news release said bottles
containing recycled PET resins would be ``test marketed,'' but said
nothing about trying out the idea for its economic feasibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producing new plastic beverage bottles with a blend of
recycled plastic is a significant step ahead in plastics
recycling,'' M. Douglas Ivester, then a senior Coke vice president,
was quoted in the news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology will allow the 'closed loop' recycling of our
plastic bottles, just as our other suppliers use recycled aluminum
and steel for cans and recycled glass for glass bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Coca-Cola uses about 10 billion plastic bottles a year
in the United States, Hensel said he enjoys informing print
journalists that newsprint is the largest segment of solid waste
going into America's landfills. He said soft drink containers of
all kind represent less than 1 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent EPA report, the country's municipal solid
waste stream in 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are
available, included 41.4 million tons of paper and paperboard, 29
percent of which was reclaimed and recycled. The stream included
5.3 million tons of plastic, of which a ``negligible'' quantity was
recycled, EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs so much for us to reclaim, clean and recycle PET that
we would have driven the price up for ourselves and everyone
else,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   To Sheehan and others, such as William Worrell, manager of the
San Luis Obispo County Integrated Waste Management Authority in
California, that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   The increased value, they say, would stimulate more vigorous
recycling efforts. Recyclable PET was selling for around $6 a ton
last week, according to Waste News, an industry publication.
Aluminum cans were bringing $33 a ton, and newsprint from $5 to $95
a ton, depending on the grade.
</P>
<P>
   Currently about 30 percent of the material in all PET containers
is recycled. At one time, the figure was closer to 50 percent. It
goes into a variety of products, ranging from fabrics to auto
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell's agency, made up of municipal and county officials,
took out newspaper ads in 1997, urging consumers to mail empty PET
bottles to Ivester, who had advanced to chairman of Coca-Cola,
urging him to ``please recycle this into your next plastic
bottle.'' Sheehan's GrassRoots Recycling Network later picked up
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come aluminum cans are recycled at the 80 to 90 percent
rate and PET bottles at around 30 percent?'' Worrell asked. ``If
Coca-Cola and the others would use recycled material, the price of
PET would go up and there would be greater recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wellman Inc.'s Duff noted that most of the people who place
PET bottles in the recycling stream are not being paid to do so.
They recycle because it makes them feel good or because laws
require it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is the 20-ounce bottle,'' he said. ``You
don't drink much Coke in 20-ounce bottles at home. You buy it from
a vending machine or a convenience store and drink it at work or in
your car.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these bottles end up in office trash cans or on the
side of a road somewhere, and never enter the established recycling
processes. And only in states with container deposit laws, which
Coca-Cola and other beverage companies oppose, do these bottles
return.
</P>
<P>
   Wellman, once a wool company that got into the recycling
business shortly after DuPont scientists invented nylon, will
announce this year that it is no longer processing wool.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers it produces from recycled PET bottles go primarily
into clothing and carpet. A subsidiary in Atlanta recycles fabric
removed from used carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``PET raw materials are fairly expensive,'' Duff said. ``They
got cheap when the price of oil dropped, and now that oil is going
back up, the price of PET is moving up also. But that won't effect
the supply of recycled PET bottles, and increasing the demand won't
affect the supply either.''

 &HT;    RECYCLED GROCERY BAGS ON THE BOARDWALK
 &HT;    With RECYCLE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINCHESTER, Va. _ Plastic grocery bags, which consumers
voluntarily drop into supermarket recycling bins throughout the
country, are a major feedstock for a $50-million-a-year product
that did not exist a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By recycling the polyethylene plastic the bags are made of and
mixing it with sawdust waste from furniture factories and ground-up
shipping pallets, the Trex Co. produces high-priced,
weather-resistant boards for decks and boardwalks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the process, once owned by Mobil Corp., is a company
secret, it appears to be relatively simple. The bags are melted and
blended with the sawdust to form a hot doughlike substance that is
extruded to make the boards. They sell at lumber stores for about
50 percent more than treated wood decking.
</P>
<P>
   Trex had sales of $46.8 million in last year, up 40 percent from
1997. This year, officials say, sales likely will rise another 49
percent. In addition to residential decks, Trex boards cover a
beachfront boardwalk several miles long at Spring Lake, N.J., and
the Presidential Trail at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Although thousands of the boards are stacked around the Trex
plant, awaiting shipment, the company says it has trouble meeting
the demand. Trex stock was first offered to the public in May and
took only about three months to triple in price, from $10 a share
to $30. A new plant is moving into full production this month in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to the former Mobil officials who bought the operation in
1996 and set it up in a converted Capitol Records plant in this
Shenandoah Valley town, the company's success has been confined by
one of the emerging realities of the recycling era _ getting the
bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we use roughly one-half of all reclaimed bags in
the country,'' said Mike Vatuna, the company official responsible
for keeping feedstock flowing into the Trex plant, ``but only
somewhere between 2 and 4 percent of the bags are brought back. We
believe many homeowners don't participate because they suspect the
bags are being landfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all supermarkets now keep containers out front to collect
returned bags. The chains make no money for their participation in
the transfer of a household trash item to the receiving dock of a
new industry. The $60 to $100 a ton Trex pays for bags in 800-pound
bales barely covers the store's handling costs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the stores provide the collection bins as a public
relations exercise and out of concern that without them, customers
will go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It takes nearly 200,000 bags to make a ton, and although Trex
has brokers scouring chain store warehouses all around the eastern
United States, the company's feedstock _ about 500,000 pounds of
plastic and an equal quantity of sawdust a day _ has gradually
changed during a decade of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of our polyethylene used to come from grocery
bags,'' said production supervisor Jeff Edwards. Now the bulk of
the feedstock comes from stretch film pallet wrap, billions of
pounds of which are produced annually to tie large stacks of lumber
and other products for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been forced to turn at times to virgin resin to
keep its production lines moving, but reclaimed material is much
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough plastic out there and our company is hungry for
it,'' said Vatuna. ``We believe if people knew they were throwing
away something somebody could use to make a good product, they
would be more inclined to participate.''

GARCIA EMBODIES THE JOYS OF YOUTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ His drives powerful and long, his putts
feathery and accurate, Sergio Garcia rarely had to wriggle out of
trouble Wednesday during his five-hour practice round at The
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the young Spaniard's only escape came at the end of 18
holes, when he vanished without comment to the media. A Ryder Cup
spokesperson explained that the 19-year-old Garcia, who turned pro
only in April, chose not to comment for fear of stealing the
spotlight from veteran European players.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight tournaments into his pro career, the 160-pound
(itals)Castellon(unitals) wunderkind already has proven an
accomplished thief, taking just less than $800,000 in winnings out
of the PGA Tour. If he really wanted to show reverential concern
for his elders, perhaps he'd act his age, buy a ticket on Sundays
and keep his birdie-loving, money-making hands off their purses.
</P>
<P>
   But in a world that pays homage to the young, Garcia is golf's
fountain of youth, success gushing from his woods and irons. Just
as Tiger Woods blossomed into an instant icon upon turning pro out
of Stanford in 1996, Garcia has found similar stardom even before
finishing high school _ his handlers promise he'll have a piece of
sheepskin to go with all those millions next year.
</P>
<P>
   Galleries stretching from The Country Club to the Himalayas
refer to him exclusively by his first name. Wherever he walked on
the course Wednesday, he was greeted with a constant echo of
``Sergio,'' a fact that virtually rendered his partners _ Jesper
Parnevik, Padraig Harrington, and Lee Westwood _ unwitting members
of the witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators asked for Sergio's autograph. They asked Sergio to
turn this way, that way, and every way for pictures. They wished
Sergio good luck in the coming days. And they all but said, ``And
you other three guys, move along now, before the course ranger
calls the cops.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Garcia maintained a serious and focused demeanor
during the round. He acknowledged many of the ``Sergio'' chants
with quick flashes of a smile and often turned momentarily toward
the ropes when fans asked for a photo. They clicked. He walked.
Prior to leaving the 16th green, he scooted to the ropes to sign an
autograph for a man in a wheelchair. Earlier, he high-fived a young
boy who waited patiently at a crossing just to catch a glimpse of
Sergio.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, he came off composed, polished, and seemingly
appreciative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said before, he's very mature for being 19 years old,''
said Parnevik. ``He handles himself very well, and he has that
personality. He loves all this. And you'll see that this week,
he'll have fun with the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik was literally at the wheel of some of that fun
Wednesday. Moments after their tee shots on No. 14, Garcia and
Parnevik jumped into a cart and made straight off the fairway to
the surprise of everyone around them. With Garcia in the passenger
seat laughing out loud, Parnevik pointed the cart directly for a
cluster of portable toilets some 25 yards off the fairway. The
brake fixed, they jumped out and disappeared behind doors.
</P>
<P>
   The entire episode lasted about one minute and the much-relieved
twosome made it back to the course without incident, amid rolling
laughs along the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now just make sure,'' said one spectator, ``that you wash your
hands before you use our course.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Garcia went, his name was heard. The most boisterous of
the bunch stood just off the tee on No. 12, a small group of young
adults who vigorously cheered, ``Sergio, Sergio, Sergio'' the
second he smacked his long drive. As his follow-through dissolved,
he first lit up with a smile, before lifting both arms to hide his
head and face. Their adulation embarrassed him.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in olive slacks and the yellow-trimmed golf shirt of the
European squad, Garcia looked like the college freshman he should
be. Youth faded immediately from his aura every time he smacked the
ball. He has been golfing since age 3. He was a club champion at
12. Six years ago, Team Sergio was formed, when it already was
clear to his parents that their son's bountiful talent should be
groomed for the greater days to come.
</P>
<P>
   As he strolled the fairways here, Garcia was joined nearly in
lockstep by his father, Victor, a one-time pro caddie and the pro
at Mediterraneo, the club where Sergio first played. Junior's well
on his way to fame and fortune, but for now, on practice rounds,
big daddy is watching.
</P>
<P>
   Nine holes into the not-so-dry-run (a light drizzle lasted the
first three-plus hours), Sergio clucked and strutted like a chicken
when Westwood fell short with a putt. The crowd around the green
laughed, bringing more clucks and struts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on 18, Garcia was at his vaudevillian best. When
Parnevik barely missed a putt and the crowd groaned in sympathy,
Garcia collapsed into Westwood's arms, mockingly struck down by the
daggers of disappointment. Seconds later, when Harrington drained a
long putt, triggering the gallery's applause, Garcia tugged off his
cap and flung it wildly in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just like that,'' Garcia said during a news conference on
Tuesday, explaining the sense of joy he demonstrates on the course.
``I think most (Spaniards) are just like that. They are very open.
They are very funny. They're always trying to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play golf. I try to have fun and it gives me a living.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a public life that he sometimes prefers to make private.

journalists that newsprint is the largest segment of solid waste
going into America's landfills. He said soft drink containers of
all kind represent less than 1 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent EPA report, the country's municipal solid
waste stream in 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are
available, included 41.4 million tons of paper and paperboard, 29
percent of which was reclaimed and recycled. The stream included
5.3 million tons of plastic, of which a ``negligible'' quantity was
recycled, EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs so much for us to reclaim, clean and recycle PET that
we would have driven the price up for ourselves and everyone
else,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   To Sheehan and others, such as William Worrell, manager of the
San Luis Obispo County Integrated Waste Management Authority in
California, that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   The increased value, they say, would stimulate more vigorous
recycling efforts. Recyclable PET was selling for around $6 a ton
last week, according to Waste News, an industry publication.
Aluminum cans were bringing $33 a ton, and newsprint from $5 to $95
a ton, depending on the grade.
</P>
<P>
   Currently about 30 percent of the material in all PET containers
is recycled. At one time, the figure was closer to 50 percent. It
goes into a variety of products, ranging from fabrics to auto
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell's agency, made up of municipal and county officials,
took out newspaper ads in 1997, urging consumers to mail empty PET
bottles to Ivester, who had advanced to chairman of Coca-Cola,
urging him to ``please recycle this into your next plastic
bottle.'' Sheehan's GrassRoots Recycling Network later picked up
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come aluminum cans are recycled at the 80 to 90 percent
rate and PET bottles at around 30 percent?'' Worrell asked. ``If
Coca-Cola and the others would use recycled material, the price of
PET would go up and there would be greater recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wellman Inc.'s Duff noted that most of the people who place
PET bottles in the recycling stream are not being paid to do so.
They recycle because it makes them feel good or because laws
require it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is the 20-ounce bottle,'' he said. ``You
don't drink much Coke in 20-ounce bottles at home. You buy it from
a vending machine or a convenience store and drink it at work or in
your car.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these bottles end up in office trash cans or on the
side of a road somewhere, and never enter the established recycling
processes. And only in states with container deposit laws, which
Coca-Cola and other beverage companies oppose, do these bottles
return.
</P>
<P>
   Wellman, once a wool company that got into the recycling
business shortly after DuPont scientists invented nylon, will
announce this year that it is no longer processing wool.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers it produces from recycled PET bottles go primarily
into clothing and carpet. A subsidiary in Atlanta recycles fabric
removed from used carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``PET raw materials are fairly expensive,'' Duff said. ``They
got cheap when the price of oil dropped, and now that oil is going
back up, the price of PET is moving up also. But that won't effect
the supply of recycled PET bottles, and increasing the demand won't
affect the supply either.''

 &HT;    RECYCLED GROCERY BAGS ON THE BOARDWALK
 &HT;    With RECYCLE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINCHESTER, Va. _ Plastic grocery bags, which consumers
voluntarily drop into supermarket recycling bins throughout the
country, are a major feedstock for a $50-million-a-year product
that did not exist a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By recycling the polyethylene plastic the bags are made of and
mixing it with sawdust waste from furniture factories and ground-up
shipping pallets, the Trex Co. produces high-priced,
weather-resistant boards for decks and boardwalks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the process, once owned by Mobil Corp., is a company
secret, it appears to be relatively simple. The bags are melted and
blended with the sawdust to form a hot doughlike substance that is
extruded to make the boards. They sell at lumber stores for about
50 percent more than treated wood decking.
</P>
<P>
   Trex had sales of $46.8 million in last year, up 40 percent from
1997. This year, officials say, sales likely will rise another 49
percent. In addition to residential decks, Trex boards cover a
beachfront boardwalk several miles long at Spring Lake, N.J., and
the Presidential Trail at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Although thousands of the boards are stacked around the Trex
plant, awaiting shipment, the company says it has trouble meeting
the demand. Trex stock was first offered to the public in May and
took only about three months to triple in price, from $10 a share
to $30. A new plant is moving into full production this month in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to the former Mobil officials who bought the operation in
1996 and set it up in a converted Capitol Records plant in this
Shenandoah Valley town, the company's success has been confined by
one of the emerging realities of the recycling era _ getting the
bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we use roughly one-half of all reclaimed bags in
the country,'' said Mike Vatuna, the company official responsible
for keeping feedstock flowing into the Trex plant, ``but only
somewhere between 2 and 4 percent of the bags are brought back. We
believe many homeowners don't participate because they suspect the
bags are being landfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all supermarkets now keep containers out front to collect
returned bags. The chains make no money for their participation in
the transfer of a household trash item to the receiving dock of a
new industry. The $60 to $100 a ton Trex pays for bags in 800-pound
bales barely covers the store's handling costs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the stores provide the collection bins as a public
relations exercise and out of concern that without them, customers
will go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It takes nearly 200,000 bags to make a ton, and although Trex
has brokers scouring chain store warehouses all around the eastern
United States, the company's feedstock _ about 500,000 pounds of
plastic and an equal quantity of sawdust a day _ has gradually
changed during a decade of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of our polyethylene used to come from grocery
bags,'' said production supervisor Jeff Edwards. Now the bulk of
the feedstock comes from stretch film pallet wrap, billions of
pounds of which are produced annually to tie large stacks of lumber
and other products for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been forced to turn at times to virgin resin to
keep its production lines moving, but reclaimed material is much
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough plastic out there and our company is hungry for
it,'' said Vatuna. ``We believe if people knew they were throwing
away something somebody could use to make a good product, they
would be more inclined to participate.''

GREENSKEEPERS IN GOOD SHAPE WITH HIGH-TECH HELP

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It is as if The Country Club has gone from
desert to rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Within eight days this month, the stage for the Ryder Cup
changed from survivor of one of the driest summers on record to
being drenched with about nine inches of rain, capping what
meteorologists now consider a somewhat-wetter-than-average summer.
Nonetheless, the course has emerged in good shape, eminently
playable.
</P>
<P>
   The exigencies of New England weather could easily have played
havoc with the 33d Ryder Cup Matches, which begin Friday. But the
greenskeepers have a lot more to rely on than just their reputation
as a world-class crew.
</P>
<P>
   Golf course maintenance has entered cyberspace, taking a lot of
guess work out of the care and feeding of championship courses such
as The Country Club. ``It's amazing how sophisticated golf course
management has become,'' says Bill Spence, the veteran
superintendent at The Country Club. ``We now have the ability to
mow greens to the thousandth of an inch and to monitor the flow of
water to the nth degree.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toro Company is the official supplier of irrigation and turf
equipment to The Country Club, as it is for the Old Course of St.
Andrews, home of the British Open next year, among other courses.
And Toro brings a lot more to The Country Club than just lawn
mowers. A sophisticated mapping system, which will eventually be
hooked up to a satellite, has helped assure that exactly the proper
level of irrigation and the best turf have been provided for the
Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Spence can sit in his office and, on his personal computer, view
charts and graphs that measure precisely the degree of dryness in
individual sections all over the course. He also can use the
computer to control the exact amount of irrigation necessary to
ensure championship-level conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, he still trusts his instincts more than a
computer. But he acknowledges that it is nice to have high-tech
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hurdles Mother Nature throws at you are the true test of
your equipment and ability,'' Spence said. ``Having the tools and
the know-how to deal with the situation is extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club is literally wired for water. Sensors, buried
all over the course, allow the greenskeepers to control moisture
levels. Workers also can activate specific sprinklers from a
control panel near Spence's desk.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, the system will be connected to a satellite,
allowing the kind of moisture monitoring that enables NASA to
review water-table levels around the world. It is called the Global
Positioning Systems.
</P>
<P>
   All this technology takes a lot of the guesswork out of caring
for the course. It also saves a lot of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, it would take 10 to 12 hours to water a golf
course,'' said Palmer Whitney, of Toro's New England distributor,
TPC Corp. ``When you go to this system, it takes six to eight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may not sound like a lot, but your pumps are running a
lot less, you're saving electricity, and you are able to much more
closely control the water out on the field. Most importantly,
you're not wasting it.''

NEW COMPUTER MOUSE ISN'T WORTH THE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The computer mouse has remained one of the few
high-tech constants _ ubiquitous plastic pods housing a small hard
rubber syndrome ball that occasionally have to be disassembled to
clean out the crud they accumulate during their short trips across
desktops.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., will begin
selling what it says is the first significant advance in the
history of these tried-and-true designs.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind these devices is simple. When the mouse is
moved, the ball inside rolls, rubbing against small rollers that
translate the ball's rotation to the cursor on the computer screen.
It's a theme played with little variation since inventor Douglas
Englebart fashioned the first computer mouse out of wood in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says its new desktop rodent _ dubbed the Intellimouse
_ is ``revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   The Intellimouse does not use the usual ball-tracking system
most people are used to. Instead, it reads the surface of a table
or desk using an optical scanner, moving the mouse cursor on your
screen in concert. While that's pretty cool, it's not
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as Mousesystems Corp. of Fremont
(www.mousesystems.com) and Goodsystems Inc. of Sunnyvale
(www.goodsystems.com) offer optical mice. In those devices, the
mouse bounces an infrared beam off a special mouse pad mapped out
with a grid. It works, but if you lose the mouse pad, you can't use
the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft puts an extra high-tech spin on the optical mouse idea
by equipping its device with a small camera that takes digital
snapshots of the user's work surface. A small processor built into
the mouse translates the movement over that digitized terrain into
cursor movements on the screen. Whether that's revolutionary is
debatable.
</P>
<P>
   By doing away with the rubber ball, Microsoft says, users will
never again have to stop, dismantle their mice and clean out
desktop gunk. Microsoft says this speed-of-light digital path of
data from the Intellimouse's electronic eye to the on-board
processor creates smoother, more precise pointer movement on
screen, a would-be plus for those doing precision computer graphic
work.
</P>
<P>
   I recently gave the Intellimouse a road test, and found another
expensive computer accessory that only incrementally improves on
existing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's line of seeing-eye mice comes in two models: The
Intellimouse, a plain vanilla mouse with a small top-mounted wheel
that acts as a scroll button.
</P>
<P>
   The second is labeled the Intellimouse Explorer. It's a larger,
silver mouse with a scroll wheel and four buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath both models is a small lens, what Microsoft calls the
IntelliEye.
</P>
<P>
   In the Explorer, the entire bottom of the device is a
translucent red plastic that glows when plugged into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Software included with the mice allow a user to fully customize
the functions of the mouse buttons. On the Explorer, that means you
can set some buttons to run, say, the back and forward commands of
a Web browser _ a real plus for the terminally lazy who can't find
the energy to hit a few keys or move a regular mouse an inch or
two.
</P>
<P>
   The Intellimouse connects to a computer through the newer,
faster USB ports, though adapters to plug them into the older, more
common PS/2 ports is included.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's no rubber ball cruising around a dusty, dirty
desk, the bothersome mouse cleaning routine is avoided. And because
the Intellimouse reads the desktop surface, you don't need any
special mouse pad to give it better grip. Which could spell the
ruin of all those companies making logo-festooned mouse pads.
</P>
<P>
   But the Intellimouse, in the final tally, is sophisticated
technology that doesn't translate into any more benefits for the
user, beyond the cleaning/no mouse pad argument. Hardly a
compelling buy, considering that desktop computers already come
with a mouse that is probably as functional as the $55 to $75
Intellimouse.

SHOULD BUSH, GORE KEEP UP SPANISH? MANY SAY `SI' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Al Gore speaks his scripted Spanish haltingly, with an
accent so heavy that hearing him speak the language just might be
funnier than listening to Pepe Le Pew speak English.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how humorous and tortured the vice president's
attempts at Spanish may sound, few Hispanics are snickering.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush greets Latino crowds with a firm handshake and an
imperfect Spanish sprinkled with words in English. If the Texas
governor's Spanish sometimes leaves onlookers more confused than
enlightened, none complain.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of neglect and discrimination, most Hispanics say
they are delighted to see the two leading presidential candidates
try to speak their language _ no matter how rehearsed, contorted,
ungrammatical or downright unintelligible the result may sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's funny'' to hear Gore and Bush speak Spanish,
said Maria del Pilar Marrero, a reporter with La Opinion, a
Spanish-language daily newspaper in Los Angeles. ``But on the other
hand, people say it's good that they are trying to communicate with
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she added, ``let's see if they try to understand us.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bush first drummed up the confidence to roll his R's
in public as Texas governor, and he has continued the practice as
he campaigns for president. Not to be outdone, Democrat Gore has
memorized a few short Spanish phrases, which he repeats _ over and
over _ on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could be described as fluent.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Latinos are pleased. Some see the token use of cue-card
Spanish as a disingenuous effort to charm voters through symbols
rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys get an `A' for effort and an `F' in sincerity,''
said Rolando Becerra, a local Cuban-American who hosts a
Spanish-language radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an entirely unscientific survey of the first 10 people
entering a grocery store in Houston's predominantly East Side
suggests that the idea of Anglo presidential candidates speaking
Spanish is quite popular among local Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 of those stopped spoke Spanish. Two were opposed, one had
no opinion, and the other seven said they considered it
``marvelous'' that Gore and Bush are speaking Spanish, no matter
how badly. Recent immigrants, who have themselves struggled with
the terror of daring to speak a second language in public, were
particularly willing to forgive the candidates' imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the two who opposed the idea of politicos speaking
Spanish were the only two interviewed who were bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're messing up our language,'' protested Elizabeth Garcia.
``We don't mess up their language, so why should they mess up
ours?''
</P>
<P>
   This country's stubbornly monolingual politicians have a long
history of messing up other people's languages, but their
linguistic transgressions have usually been forgiven. At the height
of the Cold War in 1963, President Kennedy stood before the Berlin
Wall and tried to capture the historic solemnity of the moment with
a few words of German. He said: ``Ich bin ein berliner`` (``I am a
jelly doughnut'').
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. The Germans understood that he meant to say
that West Berlin had become a symbol of freedom and that in the
broadest sense he considered himself one of the people of Berlin.
They cheered politely.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using a foreign language in a presidential campaign
caught on more recently. Democrat Michael Dukakis spoke competent
Spanish in his 1988 campaign, but it didn't win him the election.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush (with the ``W'' pronounced in Spanish, that's:
``George dub-LAY-oo Bush'') appears to have first shown off some
Spanish in public during his first term as governor, when he
recorded public service announcements. Discovering a good thing, he
went on to use the language in his gubernatorial re-election
campaign last year and has not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Bush captured about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 1998
re-election. National Republicans are hoping he can set a similar
record for a GOP candidate's share of the Latino presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Texas governor's reputation for being fluent baffles
most native Spanish speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the impression he spoke Spanish, but it isn't
true,'' said del Pilar Marrero. She said some observers may be
confusing Bush with his younger brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who
really is bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Turning more charitable, the journalist gives George W. credit
for understanding almost everything said to him in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gore's Spanish is much worse. His campaign has
spread the word that he is relearning the language he first picked
up during a high school summer spent in Mexico. But the vice
president clearly does not remember much. With a few unscripted
exceptions, his use of Spanish &UR;  &LR; is limited to a couple of
oft-repeated phrases, and even those he mispronounces badly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be too simple to condemn the candidates as insincere.
Even if their words in Spanish are sometimes practiced or
contrived, watching Gore and Bush attempt to speak the language can
reveal great insights into their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who finds Gore wooden in English ought to hear him try
Spanish, where the memorized words come slowly and with an odd
affectation, like a bookish high school valedictorian practicing
his commencement speech in front of a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his native language, Bush occasionally stands accused of
relying on charm to take him where preparedness lets him down. It's
doubly true in Spanish. The Texan will sometimes boldly move
forward to meet Spanish-speaking crowds, relying on language skills
a less courageous man might consider inadequate for the task at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   As the Spanish wire service EFE has noted, Bush speaks the
language poorly, ``but with great confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the influence all those immigrants and
their children will have on the presidential elections,
particularly the 30 million Americans of Hispanic descent. And a
chunk of those 30 million watch Spanish-language television.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, Univision, draws more than 4 million U.S. viewers to
at least one of its national news shows, and its credibility was
recently proven with an Emmy for reporting. Univision's chief
competitor, Telemundo, is also undergoing phenomenal growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles and Houston, Univision's local Spanish-language
newscasts now receive higher ratings than any single English
language news broadcast at the same times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish-language television has become a dominant force,''
said Rafael Buitrago, the editorial-page editor of La Opinion. He
notes that statewide California candidates, for the first time, put
together sophisticated Spanish-language television ad campaigns
last year. Other candidates are catching on.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing a translation of Al Gore saying, ``Our families deserve
the best,'' is not nearly as convincing as hearing the candidate
say the Spanish words in his own voice: ``Nuestras familias merecen
lo mejor.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore has shown a particular willingness to reach out to the
Spanish networks. While in Los Angeles to unveil his new
health-insurance proposal recently, Gore made a point of stopping
by Univision for an interview on the topic. He even offered a
couple of sentences in Spanish, before conducting the rest of the
interview in English.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians' willingness to discard all shame and speak
their butchered Spanish on television puts them in venerated
company. Other Anglos seen testing their limited language skills on
Spanish television are used-car dealers and ambulance-chasing
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the concern. If the candidates are learning
Spanish in the hope of better understanding culture, they will be
supported. But if it turns out that they have learned Spanish only
to win votes _ the way the most unscrupulous car dealers learn the
language to sell cars _ there could be a backlash.

   ``I've been plagued with headaches all summer,'' I reply.
</P>
<P>
   Subtext: I'm ignoring your compliment, acting as if you said,
``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   This is how I handle praise _ by downgrading or deflecting it _
and I never even thought about it until I read ``Find Something
Nice to Say: The Power of Compliments,'' by Debby Hoffman and Kathy
Chamberlin. To accept compliments graciously, it turns out, all I
need to do is say, ``Thank you,'' and refrain from saying anything
negative.
</P>
<P>
   I can do that.
</P>
<P>
   Giving compliments, however, is a bit tougher. Their scarcity in
the world is a sign that few of us are lavish in handing them out.
So many families, so many relationships, and so many workplaces are
governed by the rule: You'll hear from me if something goes wrong.
Otherwise, assume you're doing fine. And all the while, most of us
hunger for affirmation, for approval, for a sign that all our hard
work and effort is appreciated by those whose opinions matter most
to us.
</P>
<P>
   I'm as guilty of withholding compliments as anyone, a legacy
from my childhood. My mother seemed afraid I'd get ``too big for my
britches,'' as she put it, if she heaped praise upon me. My dad, I
think, felt that withholding praise had the same effect as waving a
carrot at a donkey: It kept his kids striving for something that
would always be beyond their reach. Having grown up on the helpless
side of that equation, I liked the power I gained over the people I
loved by making my praise a scarce commodity. When I decided to
break with my past and become more approving, the habit of silence
was hard to break.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I like this book's approach.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Finding Something Nice to Say,'' the authors focus first on
what giving a compliment does for the giver. Few of us are aware
that saying kind words to others creates a wave of positive energy,
not only in the person who hears them, but in the person who says
them. ``Each time you give a compliment, you are forced to focus on
the other person. You look for positive attributes and specific
examples. . . . This positive focus changes the way you look at the
world and, more importantly, your thought processes. You see the
possibilities, not the obstacles. Compliment giving is a jump start
for looking at the world in a positive, refreshing, stimulating,
creative way.''
</P>
<P>
   You begin by creating positive energy in yourself. Next thing
you know, having made someone aware that you truly see and value
something about them, you find yourself the recipient of their
positive energy. Even if they brush the compliment aside, you know
you've given them something they can recall later and examine at
leisure. In almost every case, the next time you meet, the person
you complimented will feel a greater connection to you and smile a
bit more readily.
</P>
<P>
   How many really terrific interactions do we have in a day? Too
few, right? It's amazing to think we can create as many as we like
by simply giving voice to a sincere compliment or two.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of compliment you give, however, makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The harder you search for qualities worthy of recognition _ such
as kindness, generosity, humor, honesty, idealism, integrity, you
name it _ the more insight you gain into the people you know. As
you seek to identify what's important, your priorities become more
conscious. You begin to see positive facets of even those who
initially fail to excite your admiration. And eventually, the
authors predict, you will begin to recognize and appreciate some of
these valued qualities in yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The Buddhists speak of four divine abodes, each of which leads
to greater happiness. The third, Mudita, is the home of sympathetic
joy, a place where one is able to acknowledge and take altruistic
delight in the talents and accomplishments of others without being
disturbed by envy and jealousy. Taking pleasure in the good
qualities of others is one step on the path to equanimity, loving
kindness, and compassion, the other three divine abodes.
</P>
<P>
   That blessed path, I suspect, is paved with genuine compliments,
generously given and graciously received.

SPACEY GETS HIS `BEAUTY' PART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I rule,'' says Kevin Spacey in the elegantly acrid comedy
``American Beauty,'' and he's right. There couldn't be a more apt
venue for his hostile suavity, even though watching ``American
Beauty'' is like experiencing something you've gone through before;
it's like seeing an alternate version of Todd Solondz's
``Happiness,'' but starring Jack Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling comes partially because Spacey, as Lester Burnham,
a depressed schlub who liberates himself from the prison of
suburbia, seems to be doing Jack Lemmon for the first half of the
picture. Specifically, the Lemmon of ``How to Murder Your Wife,''
in which his character was also hobbled by the chains of the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   Lester is bent into a question mark, slumped into a posture of
defeat. He's a grind at a media magazine where his bosses loot the
company and he sits in his cubicle, a damp pile of, well,
unhappiness. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a chirping and
hollow real estate agent who, as Lester notes, color-coordinates
her garden clogs to match the hose. Their daughter, Jane (Thora
Birch), has grown into a teen-aged paragon of suffering, too. Her
pale baby face is slack with misery.
</P>
<P>
   It's only when Lester is dragged to a basketball game to witness
a cheerleader, Jane, perform that he sees the miracle that will
change his life. It's her friend Angela (Mena Suvari), a
dirty-blond vision with an equally dirty mind. She's so obsessed
with sex that she could be a character on one of NBC's Must-See TV
sitcoms. Lester's dead eyes take on a new luster; in his fantasies,
she swims in ripe, red rose petals. And as he's narrating the
story, it's impossible not to notice his new, winning personality.
For one thing, he stops masturbating in his sexless marriage bed as
his wife dozes next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey's malicious superficiality is a dazzling turn, and though
``American Beauty'' lacks the honest contempt of Solondz's film,
which lays on the condescension like salt on a Slim Jim, it has an
entertaining brio. When Spacey gets to display the mercurial
I-want-it-now grasping of the American Male, his eyes glitter like
onyx. Director Sam Mendes may be Spacey's spiritual twin. They're
both born entertainers with a gift for stylishness, but not such
that it hides their attitudes toward their material. Mendes' cool
handling of the material permits him to bury his condescension
under dark and autumnal color schemes. He has an affinity for the
surfaces that hide the painful emptiness of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' is genuinely well made for what is.
Unfortunately, it's largely a series of easy shots at the middle
class; ``Ordinary People'' as mordant comedy. Not that this notion
is a bad idea, but the movie walks right up on its targets and
blasts them at close range. Then it asks us to congratulate it for
its marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bening's Carolyn drives herself mercilessly to succeed; before
she shows a house to prospective buyers, she cleans the house
stripped down to her underwear so she won't sweat up her clothes.
Her prospective buyers drift through the house in an indifferent
haze; in a none-too-subtle point, ``American Beauty'' sends up the
mom who puts her best into her home and children, only to be
ignored. The irony is that she wouldn't stand for this kind of
treatment in her own home; she scolds her daughter, Jane, after the
girl complains about the kitschy music Carolyn plays during dinner
(''You can pick the music as soon as you make a savory,
well-balanced meal,'' Carolyn pipes up).
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn's failure _ at one point, she slaps herself into a tizzy
and bursts into tears on the side of the road _ makes her easy
pickings for the real-estate magnate (Peter Gallagher) who seduces
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' doesn't make fun of any of its performers,
who pour themselves into their work. Spacey's pride mirrors the
enthusiasm that Lester feels when he takes to exercising and
strutting around the neighborhood to show off his newly fit
slenderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' falls into that series of movies that
satirize the embarrassment of the baby-boomer male and his
discomfort over the vital sexuality of contemporary young women.
Spacey toys with his role as if he were Noel Coward exultantly
fingering silks for his dressing gown. And Spacey's enjoyment is a
canny shift. ``American Beauty'' is smart enough to not make us
suffer with its protagonist. Spacey's wit allows him to radiate his
pleasure when he takes a job at a fast-food joint; ``I'm looking
for the least amount of responsibility,'' he intones dryly to the
manager, who's barely older than his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The cheap shots include a snarling, sadistic retired Marine
(Chris Cooper) who can't hide his anger over the neighborhood's
openly gay couple and whose psychic abuse has left his wife
(Allison Janney) a virtually mute mess. Even Angela, who is
flattered by Lester's attention _ and maybe even a little turned on
by it _ becomes a part of ``Beauty's'' schematic inevitability.
There's a much different girl under her surface as well; she turns
out to be as much a fantasy as the perfect suburban life Lester
committed himself to pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty'' could be a movie made by Carolyn; focusing on the
surface and not letting us see it break a sweat. It does so with
such aplomb that it delivers a thoroughly professional piece of
entertainment, a big studio spraying subversion from an aerosol
can. But let's not pretend there's anything unique about it,
especially when it ogles the naked flesh of its young actresses.
It's here that ``American Beauty'' shows that it's profound _ it's
profoundly discomforting in its need to ingratiate.

CARS ARE FASTER, LIGHTER _ AND MORE DANGEROUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The evidence is right there in the headlines on any magazine
rack: ``Screaming! S2000 Honda's Amazing 150-mph Roadster.''
``Toyota Celica _ 180-hp Integra Fighter.'' ``Mitsubishi Eclipse GT
_ The Pocket Rocket Grows Up.''
</P>
<P>
   While the dangers that behemoth SUVs may pose to occupants of
smaller autos have been reported extensively, a subtler yet
potentially more ominous trend has gone unnoticed: Passenger cars
are far more powerful and significantly lighter than they were 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the addition of better suspensions, radial tires, antilock
brakes, and computer-enhanced stability systems helps drivers use
that added power to reach ever higher speeds safely _ until
something goes wrong. Experts say it is a growing danger that has
gone largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are, moaning and groaning about SUVs, and we think
nothing of handing somebody a 225-horsepower vehicle,'' says Tony
Scotti, founder of the Scotti School of Defensive Driving in
Medford and a driving instructor for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   But speed sells, and manufacturers are selling it.
</P>
<P>
   And that means, accident analysts say, that even as cars are
getting safer, accidents are getting more violent.
</P>
<P>
   Double the speed of a car and you quadruple the kinetic energy.
It takes four times longer to bring it to a stop; an unbelted body
getting flung around inside stops against the dash, a seat, the
windshield, at four times the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are all these wrecks so bad these days?'' asks Bobby
Westmoreland, a trained accident analyst who now teaches police
officers to drive under the auspices of Texas A&AMP;M University.
``It's obvious: With these engines, and these light cars, when you
punch it up, the body can't take it when you hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which
measures horsepower per 100 pounds of automobile for a fleet
average, reported to Congress last year that, since 1978, that
figure for passenger cars has climbed from 3.68 to 5.05, the
highest level in 42 years of record keeping. At the same time, the
average weight of passenger cars has fallen, from 3,349 pounds to
3,075 pounds. The horsepower figures translate into an average
vehicle horsepower increase from 123.24 to 155.28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is astounding how the numbers go up,'' says Kevin
Riddell, a product specialist for J. D. Powers and Associates, a
consulting firm with expertise in automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Also eye-opening is that the horsepower numbers are rising even
as engine size is falling (from an average 260 cubic inches in 1978
to 161 last year) and fuel mileage figures are increasing (from
19.9 miles per gallon to 28.7 over the same period).
</P>
<P>
   These data mean smaller engines are generating added power more
efficiently, using sophisticated technology such as
computer-assisted fuel injection and valve timing, electronic
turbochargers, and light-alloy engine parts. In short,
manufacturers are simply getting much more bang for the buck out of
their engines.
</P>
<P>
   New models, which are already in showrooms or due in the coming
months, include a 250-horsepower Audi S4, a base model Nissan
Maxima with a 222-horsepower engine, Ford Mustangs with engines
delivering from 190 to 320 horsepower, a Saab Viggen with 230
turbocharged horses, and a Volkswagen Beetle expected to deliver
more than 200 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   And people will use that power. In 1997, speed was a factor in
13,036 fatal crashes nationwide, about a third of all such crashes.
Experts agree that horsepower can equal speed and quickness,
especially in lighter cars, and that drivers cannot resist the
temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the ability to go faster, you go faster,'' says
Scotti, the driving instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely true that the country has amnesia on the
impact of speed,'' adds Chuck Hurley, executive director for public
affairs at the National Safety Council. ``The message has become
that speed is the ultimate risk-free thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Cars that rip from 0-60 miles per hour in less than 8 seconds _
once considered hot machines _ are now commonplace, and many reach
that speed in less than 7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on the interstates hums along ever faster. It used to be
that an auto doing 80 or 85 miles per hour was the one weaving in
and out of traffic. Today, that is the ducks-in-a-line speed in the
passing lane during peak commuting hours. A recent survey found
that fatalities increased 17 percent on interstate highways in the
24 states that raised speed limits on those routes after the 55
mile per hour limit was abolished in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But only 13 percent of all traffic fatalities occur on
interstates. And there is strong evidence that, more than on the
interstates, speed limits are ignored on lesser roads _ where
corners are sharper, rapid acceleration is more treacherous, and
speed significantly reduces reaction times to dangers you don't
find on the interstates, such as structures, pedestrians, and
turning traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven percent of all traffic fatalities occur on these
smaller roads with lower speed limits. In Massachusetts, while 154
people were killed in auto accidents linked to speed in 1997, 121
of those fatalities happened in zones where the posted speed was 45
and lower.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, experts say, is that safety advances may be
making some drivers too comfortable with speed. Antilock brakes,
traction control, better tires, better suspension, and quieter yet
more powerful engines combine to expand the limits at which autos
can be driven.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, this means drivers may not be skilled or
experienced enough to handle the powerful engine beneath the hood
and the speed at their command. This can be troublesome because 5-
to 10-year-old models of this generation of higher horsepower cars
are already ending up in the hands of young drivers at relatively
inexpensive prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got hot rods on the streets, and they're not only
making them safer, they're getting 25 miles per gallon,'' says
Preston Miller, a NASCAR consultant for Ford Racing Technology, who
adds that the common modern automobile engine is far more
sophisticated than the engines found in Winston Cup race cars,
which run on standard carburetors without any computer assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lou McClanahan, coordinator of a project at MIT's Media
Laboratory studying the technological future of the automobile,
worries that all the improvements on modern cars from tires to
engines ``delude people into thinking they're better drivers than
they are and have more control than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotti says, ``Your confidence builds up a lot quicker than your
skill.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that students who have just pushed a cornering car to
within 10 percent of its safe turning limits in his training
sessions will commonly say they thought they had 40 percent to60
percent more to go. That is because, he says, drivers don't get the
``body lean'' they used to experience in older cars with less
sophisticated suspensions. Tires grip better, brakes slow you more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But you can reach that edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tougher to wreck . . . but when you do, you've got a lot
more speed thrown in,'' Scotti says.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Westmoreland draws a similar conclusion: ``You're
going so fast that when something goes wrong, you don't have any
kind of safety net. You're right at the ragged edge of whether
you'll survive or not.''
</P>
<P>
   And each year, because of higher speeds, thousands do not
survive _ offsetting, says Hurley of the National Safety Council,
``hard-won gains made because of better safety equipment, the war
on drunken driving, and increased seatbelt use.''
</P>
<P>
   Dead ahead is an even more potent mix: speed wedded to the
weight of SUVs. Mercedes-Benz will soon market its ML55, a
high-performance SUV that reportedly will do 0-60 in 6.9 seconds
with a top speed of 145 miles per hour. BMW will challenge with the
X5, an SUV it brags was developed on high-performance tracks. And
Porsche will offer an SUV in 2002. It is unlikely that it will be a
sluggish offering.

JAGUAR MAY LOSE MYSTIQUE, GAIN MARKET SHARE

<TEXT>
<P>
   I am driving a Jaguar and thinking about skiing.
</P>
<P>
   I am thinking about skiing because I am driving a Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   And what makes me think about skiing is how the 2000 S-Type
Jaguar is performing. As downhill skiers get older, and often
heavier, the way they ski and what they ski on often changes. Quick
skis used in tight, repetitive and crisp turns give way to more
stable boards, carving skis.
</P>
<P>
   These are skis that cut graceful, long curves across the fall
line, affording control and stability while still allowing the
skier to dabble with high speed and dance on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   I liken this new Jaguar _ the one the company hopes will lead it
into mass production on a scale Jaguar, pre-Ford ownership, did not
seek _ to a carving ski.
</P>
<P>
   It is smooth, stable, not necessarily quick on tight turns, and
fast if you want it to be.
</P>
<P>
   When Jaguar first announced it would build this new model, and
share some of its parts _ platform, suspension, some bits of
drivetrain _ with Lincoln and Ford models, a curious hubbub arose.
Would Jaguar somehow lose its mystique with such tangible American
influence?
</P>
<P>
   I say curious because Jaguars, while they have long held a
certain cache, have also been known as finicky cats. I suspect that
the American models with which it will do the sharing, the Lincoln
LS and the reborn Thunderbird, will be the better for the sharing.
</P>
<P>
   A short stint in the Lincoln, and more than a week in the
rear-wheel-drive Jaguar, led me to this conclusion: The 2000 S-Type
does a fine job of balancing luxury with a certain sportiness. I'm
not ready to call it a full-blown sports sedan _ it seems a bit too
``boaty,'' and it does weigh nearly two tons _ for that
appellation.
</P>
<P>
   But for straight-ahead surging in luxurious comfort, as in long
highway trips, it is fun and feisty.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it is a beautifully sculpted car. Its
sparkling ovate grill, chrome-rimmed, round quadlight housings, and
sweeping hood that flows back to a broad windshield say Jaguar even
in the unlikely event you do not notice the silver pouncing cat
hood ornament.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jaguar aficionados may not like what has been done to the
rear of the car, but I do: It has been chopped short (maintaining
some semblance of the old trunk lines), and this gives it a
sportier look.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, as you might expect, leather and wood (birdseye maple)
abound. Leather covers the seats, dash, and parts of the doors,
while the maple is worked into the dash and doors. The steering
wheel is wood and leather.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges are simple and easy to spot through the top half of the
steering wheel, and controls for climate and acoustics are wrapped
in an oval at the center of the dash. Controls for the trip
computer (miles to go before your tank is empty, average speed,
average miles per gallon, etc.) are separately and conveniently
located high on the dash to the right of the steering wheel. In
bright sunlight, I found the digital numbers on all the gauges hard
to read. I had the same problem with the screen for the navigation
system, which sits in the center of this cluster.
</P>
<P>
   The navigation system breaks the country down into nine
segments, and with the correct CD inserted, you can program trips
and even build in stops along the way. A voice command in any of
several languages, including a differentiation between English and
American English, warns of upcoming turns.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are firm and adjust in multiple ways. Dual airbags in
the front, with side bags there as well, protect you. Jaguar bills
this as a five-passenger car, but on a long trip I would not want
to be an adult squeezed into the rear middle seat.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, it's not snappy enough to be a true sports sedan
and that makes me question Jaguar's decision not to offer a manual
transmission (you'd at least feel sporty doing your own shifting).
Instead, it comes with a 5-speed automatic. Engine options include
a 3-liter V-6 and a 4-liter V-8. I drove the V-8, and having driven
the Lincoln LS in both V-6 and V-8 versions, I remain baffled as to
why a V-6 is even being offered. I just don't feel it has enough
juice to satisfy the folks likely to buy these cars.
</P>
<P>
   In a mix of highway commuting and driving rural roads, the DOHC,
all-aluminum engine got just under 20 miles per gallon of gas _ not
bad for a car that cranks out 281 horsepower, cruises at 75 miles
per hour while turning just 2,300 rpms, and that will do 0-60 in
about 7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It absorbed the bumps of back roads gracefully, carved sharp
corners smoothly if not crisply, and on highways worked through
commuter traffic in a fine touring style. Dynamic Stability Control
can apply individual brakes to correct for over- or understeer, and
disc brakes with rotors over 11 inches in diameter front and rear
brought it to straight, quick stops.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a car that's going to run with the 5 Series BMWs or
midrange Mercedes, but as Jaguar tries to increase its worldwide
production (22,000 of this model aimed at the United States for
this model year), it will find its niche among Jaguar fans who may
be surprised at the quality Ford has brought to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The lack of storage space in the passenger compartment.
Shallow bins in the doors; the telephone eats up all the space in
the center console; and the CD changer takes up most of the
glovebox.
</P>
<P>
   --The glossy wood portion of the steering wheel. Too slippery.
Wrap it all in leather.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The sound system. Van Morrison never sounded so good.
</P>
<P>

because this is a taller car than most Jaguars, the trunk space

TO EUROPEANS, RYDER CUP IS ABOUT MORE THAN GOLF 
</HEADLINE>

 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LONDON _ As the inventors and guardians of golf, the Scots took
it upon themselves to start heaving the first salvos, even months
before most people started thinking about the Ryder Cup that takes
place this week at The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish people spewed venom at David Duval, Tiger Woods, and
Mark O'Meara when the American golfers suggested that they should
be paid to take part in the event pitting the United States against
Europe every two years. When Duval went on to say the Ryder Cup was
nothing more than an ``exhibition match,'' many Europeans, not just
Scots, were apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   As Alex MacPherson, an insurance salesman and 12 handicap, put
it recently, standing in a pub in St. Andrews, the birthplace of
golf, ``That's the difference between you Yanks and the rest of us.
We look at golf as a great game, with great traditions. You look at
golf as a way to become a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a friendly trans-Atlantic match of skills, the Ryder Cup
has become a battlefield in the cultural wars between Europe and
the United States. Not only is the Ryder Cup taken far more
passionately here than in the United States, it has come to be seen
by many Europeans as providing evidence of not only the differences
separating the two continents, but of the superiority of European
values and way of life.
</P>
<P>
   In European eyes, the American Ryder Cup team symbolizes
everything that is wrong with the United States. The American team
is seen as coarse, pampered, spoiled, ridiculously overpaid, and
wildly self-centered.
</P>
<P>
   Worst, in European estimation, is that the Americans are
uncouth. Two years ago, when the Ryder Cup was played in
Valderrama, Spain, the Americans publicly complained about the
local food and sent out for pizza. Many Europeans thought it an
unforgivable insult.
</P>
<P>
   As Paolo Micheli, a pizza maker in southern Italy, put it, ``The
worst food in Europe has got to be better than most of the best
food in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans find it unfathomable, and slightly obscene, that
Woods is being paid more money by Nike to promote its products than
he could possibly win on the golf course throughout his entire
career.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between European and American golfers are traced
to history and geography. Many Europeans, especially older ones,
believe Americans don't respond to adversity as well as they do
because the United States has not suffered as deeply the ravages of
two world wars. European golf courses, meanwhile, are not as lush
and meticulously groomed as American ones and are often more
susceptible to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Europeans gloat when American golfers falter
under difficult conditions, be it the whipping winds on a Scottish
course, or the expectation to win the Ryder Cup. The United States
has lost just seven times in 32 matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is made easy for the American tour players, from
the courtesy-car arrangements, to the hotels, to the pristine
condition of the courses,'' observed Lewine Mair, the golf writer
for The Daily Telegraph of London, in an article headlined,
``Europe spirit enriches challenge to the spoilt millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, she said, European tour players compete on more
difficult courses, sometimes in hostile environments in the Middle
East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angry elements can help to whip them into old friends,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister,
has been complaining that with the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the United States has gone from superpower to ``hyperpower,'' a
country so advanced economically and technologically that it
arrogantly dictates to even its closest allies.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Europeans share that assessment and point to the
last two American Ryder Cup teams as embodying that arrogance. In
1997, the Americans were heavily favored to win, talked and acted
like they would, but lost. Similarly, the American side at The
Country Club is seen, some say even by themselves, as unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, the words of Payne Stewart, a member of
the US team, have appeared daily in newspapers across Europe as he
offered an assessment of the European team.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, they shouldn't be caddying for us,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Few European newspapers have bothered to add what Stewart went
on to say: ``But that is not what the Ryder Cup is about. It is
about bringing your game to the event, and they bring it.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent war in Kosovo showed the depth and strength of the
trans-Atlantic alliance, and despite the carping over golf, there
is a mutual dependency between the Americans and their European
allies. But as the European Union attempts to rival the United
States as an economic bloc, trans-Atlantic spats in areas other
than golf are becoming more common. Besides creating a single
European currency this year, the European Union is trying to
fashion a common foreign policy that would make Europe less
subordinate to Washington in the realm of world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In much of Europe, and especially in Britain, there is
widespread opposition to the use of genetically-modified food, most
of it produced by American companies. The European Union refuses to
allow the importation of hormone-treated US beef. French farmers
have been retaliating against US trade sanctions by trashing
McDonald's outlets recently.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the European-American disputes get played out in
the ornate rooms of foreign ministries or the World Trade
Organization in Geneva, for many Europeans it is easier to look to
the Ryder Cup as offering a playing field where the differences
between Americans and Europeans can be seen, analyzed, and
commented on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even this is falling victim to the American-inspired
free-trade principles that the French deride as Yankee
globalization. In Britain, where interest in the Ryder Cup is the
most intense, the event is no longer on free TV. To watch it, you
must subscribe to Rupert Murdoch's satellite network, Sky.
</P>
<P>
   While it is conventional wisdom in Europe that the Ryder Cup
offers a metaphor for modern America, it is less common for
Europeans to admit that it says much about them, too, whether it is
their passion for sports, or their propensity to dismiss Americans
as too fat, too rich and, well, just too many.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott, a sportswriter for The Observer in London,
believes the Europeans have been able to dominate the Ryder Cup for
the last decade because they have exploited not only the
differences between the two continents, but also human psychology
common to all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans bond closer than the Americans, partly because
the European golf circuit is a friendlier, more sociable place than
the US Tour,'' he said, ``but also because the smart money almost
always suggested they were about to be taken outside and given a
good hiding.''

VENTURA SELLS OUT CITIZENS ON ISSUE OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 24 states, not including Minnesota, Americans enjoy the
ultimate power of self-government: They can vote to adopt or repeal
laws at the ballot box. As a candidate for governor last year,
Jesse Ventura assured Minnesotans that while they may have missed
out on the first century of initiative and referendum _ the first
state to adopt them was South Dakota, in 1898 _ they would be on
board for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initiative and referendum give people the right to bring
things before the general population that the Legislature cannot or
will not,'' Ventura said. ``Government is supposed to be for the
people, by the people. The powers of initiative and referendum
directly support that proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that Ventura has traded in his gold lame wrestling
shorts for a politician's pinstripe suit, he's decided he doesn't
think so highly of the people's judgment after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it would be refreshing to give the absolute will of the
people a chance to be heard on specific issues,'' he wrote this
month in a letter to The Wall Street Journal, ``it often results in
too many laws being proposed and too much confusion for voters on
Election Day. Perhaps more importantly, well-financed special
interests can circumvent the legislative process to push an
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong on all counts. Ballots are not flooded with initiatives in
the states that allow them, voters have no trouble passing judgment
on complicated measures, and big-money interest groups that manage
to get their pet bills on the ballot are routinely shot down on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against letting the voters occasionally decide an
issue directly are not new, and they haven't improved with age.
What most of them have in common is the belief that ordinary voters
are dumber than ordinary legislators. Voters won't consider the
merits of ballot measures, the critics say. They'll be easily
swayed by slick ad campaigns. They won't take the state's best
interests into account. They are liable to pass foolish laws, or
repeal sensible ones.
</P>
<P>
   There is a comical paradox to such arguments. If voters are too
foolish to be trusted with initiatives and referenda, how can they
be wise enough to vote for legislators? Conversely, if legislators
are such paragons of wisdom and insight, why do voters _ in poll
after poll, state after state _ express frustration at the refusal
of lawmakers to deal with issues they care about most?
</P>
<P>
   Activists typically resort to the initiative process when they
have exhausted every other means of getting a grievance redressed.
When the Legislature refuses to act, when the courts are no help,
when the governor can't be bothered, when the newspapers give them
short shrift, when paid lobbyists block them at every turn, ballot
activists have one last hope: the people. And the people, time and
again, come through.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot initiatives have been deployed to give women the right to
vote, to mandate an eight-hour workday, to abolish poll taxes, to
cut onerous taxes. Initiatives and referenda _ I&AMP;R, in political
argot _ have been used to ban steel traps in hunting, to legalize
medical marijuana, to limit politicians' terms in office, to
overhaul campaign finance laws, to end racial preferences, to
abolish rent control, to repeal blue laws, and to mandate English
instruction in the schools. Some of these are liberal reforms, some
are conservative; none is trivial. And most went on the ballot
because elected legislators preferred to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I&AMP;R is constantly under attack. In Nebraska, the Legislature's
bosses want to change the rules so that ballot measures would have
to be approved in two elections before taking effect. In
California, a bill in the state Senate would require all initiative
signature-gatherers to publicize _ right on the petition _ the
names of their major financial contributors.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that any
stray mark on a petition _ a doodle, a coffee stain, an underline _
invalidates every signature on the page. In Colorado, the high
court has been obsessively killing initiatives on the grounds that
they run afoul of a rule requiring ballot measures to deal with
only a single subject. In Oregon, opponents of direct democracy
want to sharply increase the number of signatures required to
qualify an initiative for the ballot. In Alaska, a proposed change
would require signatures from 30 of the state's 40 legislative
districts before a measure could go to the voters _ a huge hurdle
in a state as vast as Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only legislators who recoil from I&AMP;R. Business
interests fight it, too. They reckon that it's easier to buy a few
hundred state reps than to buy a few hundred thousand voters.
Clearly it is easier to promote a bad bill in a closed-door huddle
at the statehouse than to defend the same bill openly in a public
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Laws voted on at the ballot box tend to be more carefully
vetted, more thoroughly debated, and more widely understood than
those gaveled through on pro-forma voice votes in the capitol.Jesse
Ventura frets that allowing voters to consider a few ballot
measures every other year would lead to ``too many laws being
proposed'' _ yet in a typical two-year session, the Minnesota
Legislature disposes of 6,000 pieces of legislation. The worst laws
are always the ones passed out of sight, behind the voters' backs.
Candidate Ventura, who ran on a platform of ``Bringing Power Back
to the People,'' understood that. Who'd have guessed that Governor
Ventura would sell out so quickly?

ALL THE WORLD'S A PUMPKIN FOR SOME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHFIELD, Mass. _ Not everybody had problems with the drought
this year. Some folks at the Marshfield Fair were even grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big year for us,'' Raymond McKay explained. ``The
growing season was ahead of schedule, with all the sun we've had.''
I had called after wondering at the giant pumpkins on display at
the fair last month, and McKay is in charge of the annual contest.
Those giants, topped by a 650-pound monster grown by James Kuhn of
Goffstown, N.H., normally would have gone to later fairs, but not
this parched season.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn's behemoth topped the Marshfield record by 184 pounds and
put Marshfield's pumpkin contest squarely in the big leagues, at
least for one year. Kuhn showed up with a neighbor, John Gireus of
Derry, N.H., who brought a 705-pounder, which was disqualified
because of a hole, but Gireus just wanted to know how much it
weighed. These aren't things you can heft onto a bathroom scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing giant pumpkins is serious business,'' McKay told me.
``If you can't spend six or eight hours a week with your pumpkin,
you can't grow a big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people are doing just that, perhaps as many as 15,000
worldwide, according to Don Langevin of Norton, a
giant-pumpkin-growing guru, author of two popular books on the
subject, ``How-to-Grow World Class Giant Pumpkins I and II.''
</P>
<P>
   Langevin is dedicated to spreading the word, and second prize at
Marshfield went to a neighbor, Tim Donovan, a Norton veterinarian
whose son became entranced by the giants Langevin was growing and
took it up in a quest for a Boy Scout merit badge four years ago.
Scott Donovan, now 14, got the badge, growing a 250-pounder for the
Eastern States Exposition in Springfield. This year Scott placed
second in the Southeastern Massachusetts division at the Marshfield
Fair with a 287-pound cucurbit.
</P>
<P>
   His Dad got the bug big time, though, leading to his 595-pound
Marshfield entry. His 48-by-44-foot pumpkin patch accommodates
three plants, ``and that's tight,'' he said. Each plant was allowed
to send out two vines, each with a pumpkin. Pruning is intensive _
``if I planted one plant in that garden and didn't prune it, it
would fill that garden'' _ and purposeful: Too many branches and
leaves reduce the size of the pumpkin, and tertiary branches simply
are not allowed. The whole thing winds up looking like a flattened
Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Donovan's personal best was 676 pounds, only good enough for
10th place at the All New England Giant Pumpkin Weigh-off at the
Topsfield Fair, the premier event in our region. Despite the early
crop, he has some headed for Topsfield, if weather and luck hold.
``I have a dark horse in the garden,'' he said. ``The advantage to
having three plants is you have a little bit of flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And moving the pumpkins? ``The usual method for picking these
things up is to get a bunch of men,'' Donovan said. ``They make
tarps with handles on them for lifting these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan learned about growing competition-size giant pumpkins
from his neighbor, Langevin. ``It was Hurricane Bertha, and I
couldn't do anything else, so I read the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in New Hampshire, James Kuhn credits the hurricane with
bringing the aphids he never had to contend with before. He has
spent this summer watering and battling bugs, especially the stink
bug, but those aphids are tiny and hard to spot.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn holds the New England record, 929.4 pounds, weighed in
Topsfield in 1997 (the world record is 1,092 pounds), but he does
not expect to challenge that this year. ``I may go, but my biggest
pumpkin split on me when we had the rain about two weeks ago,'' he
told me.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn, who took up this hobby, called a sport by some, in 1992,
said there seems to be a cycle. Seed will produce 500-pounders one
year, that seed will produce 900-pounders the next, and the next
generation bounces back down to 500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a combination of luck, the right seed, and the
weather,'' Kuhn said.
</P>
<P>
   Langevin agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason you can't grow a world-record-holder the
first year you grow a giant pumpkin _ if you're lucky,'' he said.
Being a gardener can help, as can reading his books, but luck is a
big factor, Langevin said. Another big factor is the strain of
seed: Dill's Atlantic Giant, developed by Howard Dill of Nova
Scotia, where giant pumpkin contests have been a part of country
life for a long time. Dill spent 30 years developing this strain.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is growing, in no small part due to Langevin's books.
He has sold 12,000 copies of the first book, 5,000 of the second,
and they are increasingly available through mail-order seed
companies such as Johnny's Seeds (or call Langevin at
1-800-985-7878 or write Pumpkins, Box 247, Norton, 02766).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say 10 years ago, probably fewer than 1,000 people in the
world were growing Atlantic giants and competing with Atlantic
giants,'' Langevin said. Now there are 200 to 300 weigh-offs each
year, and three umbrella organizations _ the World Pumpkin
Confederation, the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth and the International
Pumpkin Association. (It almost sounds like boxing, except pounds
are pounds, and there's no need to unify the title.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a gardener all my life, and that's the case with
most people,'' Langevin said. You just get hooked. ``You can go out
every day at the end of July and throw a tape measure around a
giant pumpkin and find it has grown 6 or 7 inches,'' he said. Vines
can grow 2 feet in a day, and a plant in a 4-inch peat pot that
goes in the garden in early May can fill 1,000 square feet in July.
</P>
<P>
   And what do you do with the pumpkins? Well, the seed you save or
sell or trade. ``You can't eat them,'' Tim Donovan said. Two years
ago, he found another use. He carved a biggie into a Cinderella
carriage and stuck his 5-year-old daughter in it. Magical.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I bought a ranch house with a crawl space with a concrete
slab and containing a boiler and two oil tanks. I am concerned
about water; I found a bit of water at the end of April, and
noticed some rust at the bottom of a Lally column. There is a sump
and a pump in the crawl space. Should I put in a French drain (a
drain to keep water out), or should I wait?
</P>
<P>
   ANDY BRAUER, New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. For that little water, there should be no concern, because
the sump and the pump are keeping most areas dry; the wet area may
be a little low and the water does not get to the sump. I also
would not worry about the rusting Lally column; it will take a lot
more rusting for it to fail. The rusting column might be due more
to condensation of moisture than flooding. I would not consider a
French drain, which is expensive, unless the space really floods,
which I frankly think is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to make sure the pump is working when
necessary, pumping water out of the space and away from the house.
Then you tackle the condensation, water vapor condensing into water
when it hits a cool spot in the crawl space, such as a steel column
or a cool concrete floor. Ventilate the crawl space; open windows
or vents, and keep them open from April to October. In July and
August, when it is too humid to ventialte, close all windows and
vents and install a dehumidifier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a peculiar situation that no one seems to be able to
explain or fix. One hot water faucet in my bathroom smells of
mildew on metal. A plumber flushed the system without success. What
in the world is going on, and is there any cure?
</P>
<P>
   K.O., Pembroke, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That is, indeed, peculiar, and I am not sure the handyman has
an answer. I must assume that the odor occurs when the hot water is
on. If it does, I think it is this: the drain pipe has a buildup of
debris, oil and other noxious stuff; this usually smells rather
foul, but in your case it could indeed be mildew, which would
thrive in such environment. I've seen mildew growing in water, in
my own toilet tank.
</P>
<P>
   So, take out the stopper and clean it in household bleach; if I
am right you will find it coated with black mildew. Clean out the
drain as deeply as possible with an over-sized bottle brush, and be
careful of spattering. Then put a cup of bleach down the drain and
and let it sit in the trap for an hour or as long as practicable.
This all will clean the drain and sweeten things up a bit. If it
succeeds, put a cup of bleach in the drain once a month or so for
maintenance. If it doesn't succeed, it beats the heck out of the
handyman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there much involved with adding a second floor to our
rancher? We are concerned about the strength of the seond floor. We
would like to put a washer and dryer on the second floor, but are
worried they will be too heavy. We would also like to put a tray of
some sort under the washer so in case of an overflow, the floor
will not be ruined. Should we hang the washer from chains to take
the weight off the floor?
</P>
<P>
   CINDY and KENNY DOWNES, Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is a little amazing what people worry about, simply
because they don't know certain things. This does not reflect on
you; it simply an observation on the dilemma young people often run
into. It has happened to me, in my salad days, long before I
acquired such vast wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Put your minds at ease; all the things you mentioned can be
handled without a probem. Adding a second floor to the rancher will
probably require adding larger floor joists, because a one-story
house may not have joists big enough to support the second story.
If that is done, there will be absolutely no problem putting the
washer and dryer (or anything else) on that floor. The
water-catching tray in case of an overflow should drain somewhere
safe, to a sink or any sink outlet. It could even drain to an
outlet in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to hang the appliances by chains. In fact the
floor is probably stronger than any beams the chains would be
attched to.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What can I use to substitute for fiberglass ceiling
insulation, which is all matted down from nesting critters?
</P>
<P>
   TIM, Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>

   A. Any possibility of getting rid of the critters? If they are
rats or mice, you can use D-Con in the attic or other places they
are running free. Too free. If they are squirels, find how they are
getting in, wait until they are out of the attic, then seal up
those entry holes.

   A good substitute for the cuddly fiberglass is Styrofoam or
polyisocyanurate, a modified urethane foam called Thermax or High R

reason.

PAT BUCHANAN: REPUBLICAN OR REFORMER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The temptation to take Pat Buchanan too lightly is hard to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   But one must try earnestly to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Just because everyone from here to Katmandu knows that Buchanan
has about as much chance of being elected president of the United
States as a Yugo has of winning the Daytona 500 is no reason to
write him off as an egotistical distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is bright, well-educated, politically savvy, witty in a
rough-edged way and a crudely forceful orator. He has all the tools
of a good demagogue. One might even describe him as a right-wing
Huey Long, absent the Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, almost everyone who has paid any attention to the
American political scene during the past two decades knows what
Buchanan is all about and where he postures on most of the
important issues.
</P>
<P>
   And that being the case, most Americans would be scared to death
of him if they really thought he had a chance of being elected. But
then they know that he won't ever even win the Republican Party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It is not out of the question, however, that the perennial
also-ran might take the Reform Party nomination with or without the
blessing of Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura of Minnesota. And that
could make things very interesting in the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now obviously, the Reform Party candidate is not going to win.
But winning isn't everything from that party's perspective. Making
a statement of principle counts more than anything else with many
Reformers.
</P>
<P>
   With Buchanan heading the Reform ticket, the road to the White
House could get pretty muddy. And GOP leaders fear that Buchanan's
campaign would rain more heavily on the parades of their candidates
for president and Congress than it would on those of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That's why so many pundits of the right-leaning persuasion are
issuing entreaties for Buchanan to stay within the GOP fold. They
are echoing the Republican leaders' fear that in his quest for ego
gratification, Buchanan will lend aid and comfort to Al Gore, Bill
Bradley or whoever leads the charge for the ideological enemy.
</P>
<P>
   They have good reason to worry, because Buchanan does have a
substantial following. And if Buchanan takes his faithful,
far-right hard-liners with him, the GOP could be in a heap of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because of Buchanan's gifts of bombast, the general
view is that it would be far better for the GOP to have him among
them braying out than on the outside braying in.
</P>
<P>
   That would be particularly true if Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
substantial war chest proves to be enough to propel him to the GOP
nomination. It could get pretty ugly out there on the stump if Bush
has to face off against Buchanan in anything resembling a serious
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a wooden speaker, and he doesn't improvise well on his
feet. He is prone to gaffes of language and fact. Buchanan would
eat him alive. Gore or whoever wouldn't have to say a thing.
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep Buchanan on board, the GOP will have to offer
him something substantial _ some significant ideological planks in
the party platform and the promise of some high office in the next
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Even that, however, might not be enough. After all, the
possibility of heading the Reform Party ticket has to be very
alluring to Buchanan. It would mean that for the first time his
candidacy would extend beyond the parties' nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Just think of it. He would be around this time until the votes
are cast. Even if he lost, he would be able to claim something of a
moral victory. He could assert, as many did of Ross Perot in 1992,
that the Reform Party candidate decided the outcome of the
election. He would be a footnote to history.
</P>
<P>
   He could proclaim loudly that his campaign gave millions of
Americans, for the first time in a long time, the opportunity to
vote their consciences instead of just picking the lesser of two
evils.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his campaign would propel sales of his new book
_ the one that says that Nazi Germany posed no threat to the United
States after 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan then appears to be in the catbird seat. But he has a
problem _ a significant one. Not everyone in the Reform Party wants
him. And former professional wrestler Ventura is one of those who
doesn't. Buchanan could get body-slammed on his way to the Reform
Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   That would send him crawling ignominiously back to the GOP. For
Republican Party leaders, that is (as Shakespeare put it) ``a
consummation devoutly to be wished.''

DAFFODILS: THINK PINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK. So-called ``pink'' daffodils aren't really pink. At least
not yet. Most are glowing shades of coral, salmon, or apricot.
</P>
<P>
   But because these warm pastel blooms are far in hue from the
hosts of golden daffodils we're used to, they're called pink in the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another funny thing about them: If you plant them
this fall, they will make you look like a gardening genius next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Because most people have never seen a daffodil that isn't yellow
or white, these new apricot confections look awesome, rare and
exotic. Yet few flowers are more foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   So remember: They're called pink, but they're really salmon.
They look expensive and difficult, but they're really cheap and
easy. Got it?
</P>
<P>
   Pink daffodils have been grown and shown by connoisseurs for
decades, but they only recently reached the mass market at prices
on a par with the golden ones.
</P>
<P>
   And the pinks still haven't reached florist's shops at all.
Because they make great cut flowers, though, they will no doubt pop
up in commercial bouquets in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, however, home gardeners have a corner on the market,
and your pink daffodils will cause friends to sit up and take
notice the way they would upon seeing a new VW Beetle for the first
time. (And the way people did in the 1950s upon seeing the original
Bug.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't even bother to include yellow or white daffodils in my
home-grown arrangements anymore, since they are totally upstaged by
the pinks, surprising people who haven't seen them before. ``What
are these?'' people ask. Or, to quote Keanu Reeves, ``Whoa!''
</P>
<P>
   Though every year sees new and unusual flowers hit the market,
seldom are they as early-blooming and easy as these. Daffodils, of
course, are among the few bulbs that are rodent- and deer-proof.
You plant a bulb, you get a flower. And unlike most tulips,
daffodils return for years, if you don't cut off the foliage until
seven weeks after they finish blooming.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years of experimenting with bulbs have confirmed
for me that daffodils give you the biggest bang for the buck.
(Unless you have shade, in which case you should try hyacinths.)
But the problem with daffodils, at least until recently, has been
that they offered relatively little variety in form and color. They
were kind of the forsythia of the bulb world.
</P>
<P>
   The first pink daffodil was reportedly developed by crossing
white- and red-cupped daffodils with the wild poet's narcissis
(poeticus recurvus) early in this century. The breeder was a Mr.
R.O. Backhaus, who registered his prize as ``Mrs. R.O. Backhaus.''
Not exactly catchy, but a nice gesture to his wife that also
happened make his name famous.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Backhaus had problems, however. People complained that she
tended to rot. (Having a horticultural namesake can be a mixed
blessing.) She also faded to white unless situated in dappled
shade, and she lacked vigor.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, newer pink varieties shared her unfortunate
reputation for fungal problems, which hampered their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But the late Grant Mitch in Oregon and Brian Duncan in Ireland
were leaders in developing pinker pinks with stronger
constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinks have improved tremendously,'' says Naomi Liggett,
executive director of the American Daffodil Society. ``I can
remember when Grant Mitch came out with Accent. It was on the cover
of his 1960 catalog, and I thought, `I wish I could afford that!'
''
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous daffodil with a sunproof salmon-pink cup, Accent is
still a favorite among the cognoscenti but now it costs less than a
dollar a bulb. Way less, if you buy from a wholesale catalog like
Van Engelen.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite that's even less expensive is the soft salmon
Salome. ``It's the near-perfect variety, because the cup is nice
and extended with a little frill on it, and the flower looks up
somewhat,'' says Becky Heath of Brent and Becky's Bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other new varieties of pink daffodils have followed,
each a little different in coloration and form. ``There was an
explosion in breeding activity 20 years ago, and these new
varieties are now getting on the market at reasonable prices,''
says Jan S. Ohms, president of the Van Engelen and Scheepers bulb
companies, which sell 10 varieties of pink daffodils.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to mystify your friends, grow some of the new
pinks that don't look like daffodils at all. There are pinks with
puffed up peony-like heads of doubled petals, like the exquisite
new Delnashaugh. There are also pink daffodils with their cups
split apart to create faces flat as pansies, like the variety
Palmares, though for some reason these don't sell so well.
</P>
<P>
   I used to hate flowers that mimicked other species, preferring
purity of form. But I guess I've entered my fin-de-siecle baroque
phase of gardening, because now I find them a welcome change of
pace. I even plan to plant more lily-flowered and peony-flowered
tulips. It's not like we have a lot of different flowers to choose
from in Boston in April and May, so why not dress up the ones we've
got?
</P>
<P>
   But what I don't like is when pink daffodils start showing up in
catalogs with their photographs so cosmetically altered that they
actually look pink! The nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: called pink but looks apricot. If you see a photo of a
pink-looking daffodil, don't believe it, or you'll be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Misnomer and misrepresentation aside, the almost over-the-top
reactions these sensational flowers currently evoke may be
short-lived as they become more common. All the more reason to buy
and plant them this fall for next spring's blooms. After all, who
wants to be the second person in the neighborhood with the new VW
Bug?
</P>
<P>
   Daffodil bulbs should be planted in clusters eight inches deep
between mid-October and the end of November. Unlike other
daffodils, pinks prefer shade, not full sun, to bring out their
color. Daffodils are famously unfussy, and you don't have to go to
the trouble of diggin holes if you can pry out slots with a spade
or a bulb planter and slip the bulbs in. But daffodils do like good
drainage and will live longer if planted on a slope.

<P>
   The evidence is right there in the headlines on any magazine
rack: ``Screaming! S2000 Honda's Amazing 150-mph Roadster.''
``Toyota Celica _ 180-hp Integra Fighter.'' ``Mitsubishi Eclipse GT
_ The Pocket Rocket Grows Up.''
</P>
<P>
   While the dangers that behemoth SUVs may pose to occupants of
smaller autos have been reported extensively, a subtler yet
potentially more ominous trend has gone unnoticed: Passenger cars
are far more powerful and significantly lighter than they were 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the addition of better suspensions, radial tires, antilock
brakes, and computer-enhanced stability systems helps drivers use
that added power to reach ever higher speeds safely _ until
something goes wrong. Experts say it is a growing danger that has
gone largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are, moaning and groaning about SUVs, and we think
nothing of handing somebody a 225-horsepower vehicle,'' says Tony
Scotti, founder of the Scotti School of Defensive Driving in
Medford and a driving instructor for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   But speed sells, and manufacturers are selling it.
</P>
<P>
   And that means, accident analysts say, that even as cars are
getting safer, accidents are getting more violent.
</P>
<P>
   Double the speed of a car and you quadruple the kinetic energy.
It takes four times longer to bring it to a stop; an unbelted body
getting flung around inside stops against the dash, a seat, the
windshield, at four times the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are all these wrecks so bad these days?'' asks Bobby
Westmoreland, a trained accident analyst who now teaches police
officers to drive under the auspices of Texas A&AMP;M University.
``It's obvious: With these engines, and these light cars, when you
punch it up, the body can't take it when you hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which
measures horsepower per 100 pounds of automobile for a fleet
average, reported to Congress last year that, since 1978, that
figure for passenger cars has climbed from 3.68 to 5.05, the
highest level in 42 years of record keeping. At the same time, the
average weight of passenger cars has fallen, from 3,349 pounds to
3,075 pounds. The horsepower figures translate into an average
vehicle horsepower increase from 123.24 to 155.28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is astounding how the numbers go up,'' says Kevin
Riddell, a product specialist for J. D. Powers and Associates, a
consulting firm with expertise in automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Also eye-opening is that the horsepower numbers are rising even
as engine size is falling (from an average 260 cubic inches in 1978
to 161 last year) and fuel mileage figures are increasing (from
19.9 miles per gallon to 28.7 over the same period).
</P>
<P>
   These data mean smaller engines are generating added power more
efficiently, using sophisticated technology such as
computer-assisted fuel injection and valve timing, electronic
turbochargers, and light-alloy engine parts. In short,
manufacturers are simply getting much more bang for the buck out of
their engines.
</P>
<P>
   New models, which are already in showrooms or due in the coming
months, include a 250-horsepower Audi S4, a base model Nissan
Maxima with a 222-horsepower engine, Ford Mustangs with engines
delivering from 190 to 320 horsepower, a Saab Viggen with 230
turbocharged horses, and a Volkswagen Beetle expected to deliver
more than 200 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   And people will use that power. In 1997, speed was a factor in
13,036 fatal crashes nationwide, about a third of all such crashes.
Experts agree that horsepower can equal speed and quickness,
especially in lighter cars, and that drivers cannot resist the
temptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the ability to go faster, you go faster,'' says
Scotti, the driving instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely true that the country has amnesia on the
impact of speed,'' adds Chuck Hurley, executive director for public
affairs at the National Safety Council. ``The message has become
that speed is the ultimate risk-free thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Cars that rip from 0-60 miles per hour in less than 8 seconds _
once considered hot machines _ are now commonplace, and many reach
that speed in less than 7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on the interstates hums along ever faster. It used to be
that an auto doing 80 or 85 miles per hour was the one weaving in
and out of traffic. Today, that is the ducks-in-a-line speed in the
passing lane during peak commuting hours. A recent survey found
that fatalities increased 17 percent on interstate highways in the
24 states that raised speed limits on those routes after the 55
mile per hour limit was abolished in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But only 13 percent of all traffic fatalities occur on
interstates. And there is strong evidence that, more than on the
interstates, speed limits are ignored on lesser roads _ where
corners are sharper, rapid acceleration is more treacherous, and
speed significantly reduces reaction times to dangers you don't
find on the interstates, such as structures, pedestrians, and
turning traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven percent of all traffic fatalities occur on these
smaller roads with lower speed limits. In Massachusetts, while 154
people were killed in auto accidents linked to speed in 1997, 121
of those fatalities happened in zones where the posted speed was 45
er.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, experts say, is that safety advances may be
making some drivers too comfortable with speed. Antilock brakes,
traction control, better tires, better suspension, and quieter yet
more powerful engines combine to expand the limits at which autos
can be driven.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, this means drivers may not be skilled or
experienced enough to handle the powerful engine beneath the hood
and the speed at their command. This can be troublesome because 5-
to 10-year-old models of this generation of higher horsepower cars
are already ending up in the hands of young drivers at relatively
inexpensive prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got hot rods on the streets, and they're not only
making them safer, they're getting 25 miles per gallon,'' says
Preston Miller, a NASCAR consultant for Ford Racing Technology, who
adds that the common modern automobile engine is far more
sophisticated than the engines found in Winston Cup race cars,
which run on standard carburetors without any computer assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lou McClanahan, coordinator of a project at MIT's Media
Laboratory studying the technological future of the automobile,
worries that all the improvements on modern cars from tires to
engines ``delude people into thinking they're better drivers than
they are and have more control than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotti says, ``Your confidence builds up a lot quicker than your
skill.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that students who have just pushed a cornering car to
within 10 percent of its safe turning limits in his training
sessions will commonly say they thought they had 40 percent to60
percent more to go. That is because, he says, drivers don't get the
``body lean'' they used to experience in older cars with less
sophisticated suspensions. Tires grip better, brakes slow you more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But you can reach that edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tougher to wreck . . . but when you do, you've got a lot
more speed thrown in,'' Scotti says.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Westmoreland draws a similar conclusion: ``You're
going so fast that when something goes wrong, you don't have any
kind of safety net. You're right at the ragged edge of whether
you'll survive or not.''
</P>
<P>
   And each year, because of higher speeds, thousands do not
survive _ offsetting, says Hurley of the National Safety Council,
``hard-won gains made because of better safety equipment, the war
on drunken driving, and increased seatbelt use.''
</P>
<P>
   Dead ahead is an even more potent mix: speed wedded to the
weight of SUVs. Mercedes-Benz will soon market its ML55, a
high-performance SUV that reportedly will do 0-60 in 6.9 seconds
with a top speed of 145 miles per hour. BMW will challenge with the
X5, an SUV it brags was developed on high-performance tracks. And
Porsche will offer an SUV in 2002. It is unlikely that it will be a
sluggish offering.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I am driving a Jaguar and thinking about skiing.
</P>
<P>
   I am thinking about skiing because I am driving a Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   And what makes me think about skiing is how the 2000 S-Type
Jaguar is performing. As downhill skiers get older, and often
heavier, the way they ski and what they ski on often changes. Quick
skis used in tight, repetitive and crisp turns give way to more
stable boards, carving skis.
</P>
<P>
   These are skis that cut graceful, long curves across the fall
line, affording control and stability while still allowing the
skier to dabble with high speed and dance on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   I liken this new Jaguar _ the one the company hopes will lead it
into mass production on a scale Jaguar, pre-Ford ownership, did not
seek _ to a carving ski.
</P>
<P>
   It is smooth, stable, not necessarily quick on tight turns, and
fast if you want it to be.
</P>
<P>
   When Jaguar first announced it would build this new model, and
share some of its parts _ platform, suspension, some bits of
drivetrain _ with Lincoln and Ford models, a curious hubbub arose.
Would Jaguar somehow lose its mystique with such tangible American
influence?
</P>
<P>
   I say curious because Jaguars, while they have long held a
certain cache, have also been known as finicky cats. I suspect that
the American models with which it will do the sharing, the Lincoln
LS and the reborn Thunderbird, will be the better for the sharing.
</P>
<P>
   A short stint in the Lincoln, and more than a week in the
rear-wheel-drive Jaguar, led me to this conclusion: The 2000 S-Type
does a fine job of balancing luxury with a certain sportiness. I'm
not ready to call it a full-blown sports sedan _ it seems a bit too
``boaty,'' and it does weigh nearly two tons _ for that
appellation.
</P>
<P>
   But for straight-ahead surging in luxurious comfort, as in long
highway trips, it is fun and feisty.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it is a beautifully sculpted car. Its
sparkling ovate grill, chrome-rimmed, round quadlight housings, and
sweeping hood that flows back to a broad windshield say Jaguar even
in the unlikely event you do not notice the silver pouncing cat
hood ornament.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jaguar aficionados may not like what has been done to the
rear of the car, but I do: It has been chopped short (maintaining
some semblance of the old trunk lines), and this gives it a
sportier look.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, as you might expect, leather and wood (birdseye maple)
abound. Leather covers the seats, dash, and parts of the doors,
while the maple is worked into the dash and doors. The steering
wheel is wood and leather.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges are simple and easy to spot through the top half of the
steering wheel, and controls for climate and acoustics are wrapped
in an oval at the center of the dash. Controls for the trip
computer (miles to go before your tank is empty, average speed,
average miles per gallon, etc.) are separately and conveniently
located high on the dash to the right of the steering wheel. In
bright sunlight, I found the digital numbers on all the gauges hard
to read. I had the same problem with the screen for the navigation
system, which sits in the center of this cluster.
</P>
<P>
   The navigation system breaks the country down into nine
segments, and with the correct CD inserted, you can program trips
and even build in stops along the way. A voice command in any of
several languages, including a differentiation between English and
American English, warns of upcoming turns.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are firm and adjust in multiple ways. Dual airbags in
the front, with side bags there as well, protect you. Jaguar bills
this as a five-passenger car, but on a long trip I would not want
to be an adult squeezed into the rear middle seat.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, it's not snappy enough to be a true sports sedan
and that makes me question Jaguar's decision not to offer a manual
transmission (you'd at least feel sporty doing your own shifting).
Instead, it comes with a 5-speed automatic. Engine options include
a 3-liter V-6 and a 4-liter V-8. I drove the V-8, and having driven
the Lincoln LS in both V-6 and V-8 versions, I remain baffled as to
why a V-6 is even being offered. I just don't feel it has enough
juice to satisfy the folks likely to buy these cars.
</P>
<P>
   In a mix of highway commuting and driving rural roads, the DOHC,
all-aluminum engine got just under 20 miles per gallon of gas _ not
bad for a car that cranks out 281 horsepower, cruises at 75 miles
per hour while turning just 2,300 rpms, and that will do 0-60 in
about 7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It absorbed the bumps of back roads gracefully, carved sharp
corners smoothly if not crisply, and on highways worked through
commuter traffic in a fine touring style. Dynamic Stability Control
can apply individual brakes to correct for over- or understeer, and
disc brakes with rotors over 11 inches in diameter front and rear
brought it to straight, quick stops.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a car that's going to run with the 5 Series BMWs or
midrange Mercedes, but as Jaguar tries to increase its worldwide
production (22,000 of this model aimed at the United States for
this model year), it will find its niche among Jaguar fans who may
be surprised at the quality Ford has brought to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The lack of storage space in the passenger compartment.
Shallow bins in the doors; the telephone eats up all the space in
the center console; and the CD changer takes up most of the
glovebox.
</P>
<P>
   --The glossy wood portion of the steering wheel. Too slippery.
Wrap it all in leather.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The sound system. Van Morrison never sounded so good.
</P>
<P>
   --The trunk. Sure they chopped off the back of the car, but
because this is a taller car than most Jaguars, the trunk space
lost in length is made up for in depth. It's nice and roomy.
</P>
<P>
   --I didn't test it in this car, but an optional ($4,300) Deluxe
Communications Package _ navigational system, and voice-activated
controls for climate and audio system _ sounds intriguing. Tell it
73 degrees and that's what you get. Ask for a radio station, it
will find it.
</P>
<P>
   More on the Volvo 40s:
</P>
<P>
   As several readers correctly pointed out to me, I left out an
important bit of information in last week's review of the Volvo V40
wagon. Both the wagon and the sedan are front-wheel-drive
automobiles. And while I'm at it, the engine is transversely
mounted.

THIRD WATCH 
Starring: Coby Bell, Skipp Sudduth, Eddie Cibrian, Anthony

Cannavale 
On: NBC, Sundays at 8. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the deal with all the blood and bullets and childbirth on
subways? Not to mention all the heroism and decency and grace under
pressure? Gritty dramatic shows like ``ER'' shake us by the
shoulders and yell ``Safety is an illusion!,'' ``Life is
fragile!,'' ``Violence is rampant!,'' and ``Don't forget about
fire!'' They scare us half to death with their harrowing crises,
then slip us a soothing mickey of humane young professionals who'd
like nothing better on earth than to risk their lives to save us.
</P>
<P>
   It's the tension-and-release of rescue-fantasy TV, and it's
becoming formulaic and facile. ``Third Watch,'' from ``ER'' creator
John Wells, is the newest series to get your pulse in an uproar
before it hands you a bit of Valium-like solace. Unlike ``ER,'' the
NBC series is set outdoors, where a network of paramedics,
firefighters, and police officers protect a New York neighborhood
during the 3-11 p.m. shift. But it has theadrenaline intensity and
ensemble chemistry of ``ER,'' and it is an obvious attempt to
repeat the massive success of the top-rated hospital series. It
premieres in the ``ER'' slot Thursday at 10 p.m., then moves to its
regular home of Sundays at 8.
</P>
<P>
   The deceptive thing about ``Third Watch'' is that it's built
first and foremost to be riveting. The pace is frantic, the acting
is pumped, the music is driving, and the camera work is dazzling.
It's state-of-the-art jaw-clench TV. Even the comic relief _ a
nutty hotheaded cop named Bosco _ has an amphetamine edge to it.
But underneath the speed and sirens and tire-screeching, all you'll
find are a collection of overly familiar character types, from the
rookie cop to the cynical veteran, along with an endless series of
emergency situations that blur together. All you'll find is, like,
``Adam 12.''
</P>
<P>
   The premier ``Third Watch'' gives us a baby tossed from a
burning house, a gruesome car accident, a subway-car birth, and a
stairway shootout, among other momentous events. But by the end of
the hour, which passes in a New York minute, you realize that none
of these tragedies has been memorable or moving _ important
features to the emergency-drama genre that ``ER'' never forgot in
its peak years. The disasters feel generic, and leave you numb, or
worse, overworked and punchy like the paramedic who declares, ``Hot
damn! I love this job!''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, as the characters ricochet from house fire to gunfire
and back, they flirt, fight, and fool around. Sure, it's a little
strange when eyes lock lovingly over an intubated patient whose
open heart is glistening up from a gurney on ``ER.'' But it's
bizarre when young workers have sex in an ambulance or chitchat
about dating en route to the next five-alarm whatever on ``Third
Watch.'' The interplay between the personal and the professional is
forced and superficial as it occurs incidentally, when the
characters happen to merge at some smoky, glass-strewn calamity. On
``ER,'' the casual relationships seem more natural because the
doctors and nurses are together in the same location for large
chunks of time.
</P>
<P>
   The actors of ``Third Watch'' are better than the script, which
requires them to bring life to stock roles. To his credit, Wells
gives us one of the few genuinely racially mixed casts of the new
fall shows, but he doesn't give his actors much to chew on. The
most notable work is by Molly Price as a cop and mother of two,
Michael Beach (Al Boulet on ``ER'') as a mentoring paramedic, and
Anthony Ruivivar as his novice partner. When Ruivivar's character
sums up his first few days by saying, ``I felt nothing,'' it's a
little too easy to relate to him.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``A model with a womanly body _ that made me a
first,'' says Emme in a 15-second television spot for Revlon's
ColorStay makeup that shows closeups and full-length poses of the
plus-size model.
</P>
<P>
   She notes in the ad that the introduction of the compact version
of the brand's long-wearing foundation is another first.
</P>
<P>
   It's been seven months since Revlon broke ground as the first
major cosmetics firm to feature a large-size model in its ads,
taking diversity in cosmetics advertising to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   Emme's spots launched in February and gained widespread
attention during the Academy Awards broadcast in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we constantly put one image of beauty out there, we don't
do anyone any service,'' said Emme, the host of the E! Channel's
``Fashion Emergency'' and author of ``True Beauty,'' a guide to
positive self-image, during a recent interview at Revlon's
headquarters here. ``We should celebrate the differences in
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emme has broken a lot of amazing ground since getting this
contract,'' said Gary Dakin, an agent for the 12 Plus division at
Ford Models, where Emme was once represented.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work for plus-size models is still in fashion, he
noted, not cosmetics. ``I think everybody is waiting to see what
Revlon does and what response they get.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new Isabella Rossellini's Manifesto line, which launched
in limited distribution in September, features a range of models in
its ads, including large-size model Kate Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   And Cover Girl _ rumored to have eyed Emme before she was
snatched by Revlon _ may be on the lookout for new talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to use models in our Cover Girl campaigns that
represent the multi-dimensionality of all women. This includes
diverse personalities, ethnicities and life stages _ and may at
some point include full-figured women as well,'' said Anne Martin,
global designer and North American marketing director for Cover
Girl.
</P>
<P>
   Emme, who states her size as straddling 14/16, is quick to point
out that the majority of American women _ more than 60 percent _
are a size 12 and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't see diversity and only one type of image, it
makes consumers say to themselves, `There is something wrong with
me,''' said Emme, who reveals some of her own struggles with body
image in her best-selling book. ``You draw in more women with
acceptance than exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   A personal goal of hers is to ``break the notion that there is
one singular image of beauty,'' said Emme, who speaks to school
groups about body image, self-esteem and dieting. ``Revlon has
taken a giant step in breaking that mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Mandor, executive vice president of Revlon's brand equity
development group, said the company did not intend to start a trend
when it signed Emme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about Revlon going out and making sure women can see
themselves on a page. We are about making women feel like women and
making them feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mandor, Emme has been entrusted, along with Cindy
Crawford, to represent one of the company's hottest properties _
ColorStay foundation, a top seller in the category.
</P>
<P>
   At Revlon, the ads are written to highlight the product, then an
appropriate spokeswoman is assigned, noted Mandor.
</P>
<P>
   While next year's plans are still being made, it is likely Emme
will remain on ColorStay, she added.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Syracuse University, Emme, now 35, had a
brief stint as a TV reporter. Almost on a whim, she presented
herself to a New York modeling agency for possible plus-size
fashion assignments and was quickly embraced.
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by her TV show, Revlon contract and book deal, her
career quickly branched out beyond fashion modeling and she is now
represented by the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Emme recently signed a TV deal with ABC that could include her
own show and appearances on sitcoms or talk shows, said her agent,
Brian Dubin, senior vice president and head of the commercial
department at William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   He also is submitting her name for a movie role that he thinks
is ideal for her.
</P>
<P>
   Emme has been taking acting lessons and would like to break into
movies, with an eye to breaking some casting stereotypes. And she
is considering a second book, with a focus on health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revlon took a step in the right direction to make women feel
good about themselves and not bad about themselves,'' said Emme,
who adopted the singular name when her modeling career began to
take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to initiate change. If we can just get over the
stringent, tightly focused idea of beauty, we can relax a lot of
pressure and stress that women feel today.'' &QL;

<P>
   It's a sunny Saturday morning in Manhattan and the Pierre Michel
Salon on the Upper East Side is abuzz: blow-dryers, cappuccino
makers and a Janet Jackson soundtrack electrify the massive beauty
emporium.
</P>
<P>
   Clustered near the reception area is a group of giggling clients
awaiting a turn at beautification.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Edward Greene, the salon's artistic director, hushes
the group to attention. The first stop, he explains, will be the
manicure station on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Upon spotting a real, live manicurist, the group breaks into
squeals of delight.
</P>
<P>
   Such enthusiasm may not be unusual in a temple of beauty, but
its source certainly is: a raucous bunch of 9- to 11-year-olds,
here to celebrate their pal Brittney's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   That a beauty salon would be considered an ideal setting for a
preteen birthday party offers a glimpse into how girls are being
given an increasingly early introduction to the world of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spice Girls got us in so much trouble,'' Greene jokes with
a sigh. ``They liberated little girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberated'' is right. In between careful sips of iced tea and
decaffeinated cappuccino, Brittney's posse pauses to engage in
beauty dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming here since I was 9,'' says Marisa _ now all
of 10 years old _ summing up with a shrug the prevailing attitude.
</P>
<P>
   For the girls, getting the royal treatment at mom's beauty salon
is pure fun, but for the salon owners, grooming a new generation of
clients is _ despite the occasional migraine _ just smart business.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age girls spend an average of almost $200 a month on
clothing, jewelry and beauty. They are plugged in to the latest
trends, and for those who attend elite private schools, the
pressure for high-maintenance conformity is even greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a child, your parents take you to the dentist that
they trust. It's the same thing with your hairdresser,'' Greene
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was that age and I would bleach my hair. I
didn't want her to rebel and try to do that,'' explains Sandra
Green, the birthday girl's mother. ``I told Brittney that even if
she wants blue hair, then she'll see my colorist and have blue hair
done nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Lia Schorr, a skin-care specialist who owns a skin-care salon
and training center in Manhattan, reports that she regularly sees
clients as young as 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother brings them because she's the obsessed one,'' she
says. ``But the kids,'' she quickly adds, ``are fine about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakouts, the most common reason for the visit, are usually
treated with a 35-minute mini-facial.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in California, where early grooming is as inevitable
as good weather, salons go way beyond the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Balloon, a children's hair salon with five locations,
caters to the offspring of a number of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of manicures and highlights on 10- to
14-year-olds,'' reports Jason Douglas-Hiley, the salon's manager.
</P>
<P>
   The salon also hosts ``Glamour Parties'' on the weekends, where
the girls are treated with intricate hairdos and makeup
applications and are sent home clutching their portraits.
</P>
<P>
   But for the serious supermodel in training, Olivia's Dollhouse
Tea Room in Los Angeles might just offer the ultimate service:
full-blown fashion shows or, for budding socialites prepping for
the benefit circuit, dress-up tea parties. &QL;

   Many a cultural icon has had a home in Minneapolis, Minn.
Consider the Mall of America, Mary Tyler Moore, Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura and the Artist formerly known as Prince. But to a
star-struck breed of cereal lovers, Minneapolis means Lucky Charms.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Lucky the Leprechaun and his party-colored product
have thrived in the Minneapolis suburb of Golden Valley, on General
Mills Boulevard just south of Betty Crocker Drive. The
oat-and-marshmallow medley is one of General Mills' top sellers,
and one of the longest-running success stories in kids' cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Charms owes much of its success to continual reinvention.
Over the decades, the marshmallow bits have undergone radical
transformations in shape, size and color.
</P>
<P>
   At first it was pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars and
green clovers. Then the mutant marbits began to appear. Blue
diamonds, purple horseshoes, red balloons, swirled whales, a
rainbow, a snowman, a pot o'gold and The Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The frosted oat nuggets have stayed the same. What mysterious
forces are shaping the evolution of Lucky Charms?
</P>
<P>
   In the Bisquick conference room at General Mills headquarters,
assistant marketing manager Patricia Chang displays a box of Lucky
Charms featuring the cereal's latest permutation: tiny marbit
charms in saturated colors and substandard sizes that the company
launched last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have a new event like this, we see anywhere
between a 10 percent to 20 percent bump in sales,'' Chang says.
</P>
<P>
   The food engineers at General Mills first clued in to this
dynamic in 1975, when blue diamonds were introduced to the
``standard mix'' and sales of the cereal jumped 31 percent. Adding
purple horseshoes in 1983 increased sales another 25 percent. When
red balloons joined the party in 1989, sales increased again. Each
time, there were permanent gains.
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned researcher cites three factors for the cereal's
unique appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the marshmallows, it's the marshmallows, it's the
marshmallows,'' says Jim Geoffrion, a department head at the
General Mills technical center.
</P>
<P>
   To determine which marbit designs kids find most enticing, the
market research department conducts frequent ``concept-ideation''
studies. A general principle has emerged. More is better. Bright
colors are better than subdued pastels, and a greater variety of
designs in each package is better than the measly four that
launched the cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youths also prefer patterned charms in multiple colors.
Satisfying that preference requires manufacturing technology that
was perfected only in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The basic recipe for the marbits is uncomplicated: sugar, corn
syrup and gelatin. The ingredients are melted together and whipped
to a foamy consistency, then extruded in strips of specified shapes
that are cut into individual pieces and dried slowly at low
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are added during the foam phase, before extrusion,
and the shapes are determined by the extrusion dies. The trick lies
in getting those patterned marbits that children find so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Separate streams of colored foams have to be ``co-extruded'' _
squeezed out through the dies together at exactly the same rate,
such as the colors in striped toothpaste come out of the tube in
sync.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike toothpaste, the marshmallow foam is compressible, and
controlling the flow rate of a compressible foam is a problem more
worthy of rocket science than food science.
</P>
<P>
   It is relatively easy to make multicolored marbits with equal
volumes of each color, squeezed out at the same rate. A lower
volume color accent _ such as a smile on the man-in-the-moon marbit
_ requires a different flow rate during extrusion, and the only
thing harder than stabilizing compressible fluids at the same flow
rate, says Geoffrion, is synchronizing compressible foams with
varying flow rates.
</P>
<P>
   Within these daunting limits, General Mills has achieved an
impressive expansion in the complexity and diversity of the marbit
community. Themes have included charms shaped like Olympic torches
and medals, seasonal tokens such as mittens and snowmen, and an
around-the-world promotion featuring Egyptian pyramid- and Statue
of Liberty-shaped marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   The inspired notion of combining marshmallows with a whole-oat
cereal came to former vice president and product developer John
Holahan in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Holahan was brainstorming in the aisles of his local supermarket
when he came upon the orange Marshmallow Circus Peanuts that were
among his favorite confections. He took a bag back to the lab, cut
up the ``peanuts,'' and sprinkled them over a bowl of Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   They ``ate just right,'' Holahan recalls. ``I knew we had a
winner, a concept that had great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The charms were a technical challenge from the start. No one in
the food industry had ever tried to make small, intricately shaped
marshmallows. Chemists and candymakers from General Mills and Kraft
collaborated for months to devise the proprietary formula and
drying technology that are still used today. The resulting marbits
have the texture of candy pumice and make up over 25 percent of a
box's volume.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than three decades later, Lucky Charms is General
Mills' No. 3 seller, bested only by Cheerios and Honey Nut
Cheerios. Among presweetened children's cereals, it is No. 1, with
more than $150 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills engineers have a dozen new designs that will
speciate on supermarket shelves in years to come. When asked if
glow-in-the-dark charms can it be done, Geoffrion says, ``Not
yet,'' with a nervous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But when it can, Lucky Charms could be the first midnight snack
to provide its own illumination.

 By PAM GRIM  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Eleven weeks after NATO began raining bombs on Yugoslavia,
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo. By
then, more than 850,000 Kosovars had fled the region. A few
refugees immigrated. The vast majority are housed with host
families or in refugee camps in Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Grim, an American emergency physician, volunteered her
services at a Macedonian refugee camp during the thick of the war.
This is her journal.
 &UR; MAY 6, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Managers of Senokos Camp, a refugee shelter in northern
Macedonia, have been notified that 4,000 to 5,000 Kosovars are to
arrive. Doctors of the World, the organization that provides
medical care in the camp, has called for physician volunteers, so I
find myself in their headquarters in New York City, signing an
insurance policy for, among other things, kidnapping, ransom and
extortion.
 &UR; MAY 8, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I arrive at the headquarters of Doctors of the World emergency
relief project in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Senokos Camp is
about an hour's drive away, near the Macedonian-Kosovar border.
</P>
<P>
   I am introduced around the office. Doctors of the World had been
in Pristina, Kosovo, for six years. The staff had been evacuated
two days before the bombing began in March. In the kitchen I meet
the cook, an elderly Kosovar who has been here a month. As she
serves me potatoes and Turkish coffee, she tries to explain
something. But she speaks no English. She seats herself abruptly,
takes off her glasses and starts to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, we head off to Senokos Camp. The guard waves
us through the chicken- and barbed-wire fence that surrounds row
upon row of tents. The medical clinic is a small complex of three
tents joined by an awning.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have not yet arrived. The borders are closed. We
are not needed tonight.
 &UR; MAY 9, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several of the doctors working in the camp are Kosovars who fled
when the war began. The doctor in charge of the camp health
facilities, Visar Nushi, fled Pristina a few days after the bombing
started. He was separated from his fiancee and does not know if she
is alive or dead. He does not know if his parents are alive or
dead. His sister _ with his two nephews _ has also disappeared.
Still, Nushi puts in 14-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   Senokos Camp is a small shelter. It is equipped for 10,500
people. Some 2,500 have arrived. We await the rest. Everyone has
shelter, food, potable water and privies nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in Senokos _ the crowding, the boredom, the anxiety
_ are severe but manageable. At Stenkovec II, just down the road,
there are sometimes as many as 30,000 exiles. The expanding
population has assumed a critical mass, a level of chaos that
breeds rioting.
</P>
<P>
   We are experiencing similar problems. Today a doctor treats a
refugee with two teeth knocked out by another refugee. There was no
disagreement; they didn't even know each other. The assailant had
just walked up to this man and kicked him twice in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Fuller, an American internist, sees s 32-year-old woman
brought in by her husband. She is accompanied by their 4-year-old
son. The mother says something in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a headache,'' the translator explains.
</P>
<P>
   The woman covers her face with her hands. Her shoulders shake as
she weeps noiselessly.
</P>
<P>
   The translator frowns. ``She says she just found out her mother
and her father were massacred in Kosovo. They are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman weeps. Her son stares up her, confused. He starts
sobbing in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   That is one kind of case.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Fisher, one of the doctors working here, sees another. A
17-year-old kid who had stepped on a land mine in Kosovo had been
treated by an orthopedic surgeon in Pristina. The surgeon had fled
with him across the border and was now seated next to him on the
canvas cot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a medical emergency,'' the orthopedic surgeon told
Fisher. ``He must go to Germany for surgery immediately to save the
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon leaned forward and whispered, ``He is KLA, Kosovo
Liberation Army. If they find him here, they will kill him. You
must get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan looked down at the foot. ``You've worked a miracle here,''
he told the orthopedist sadly. ``I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The orthopedist was himself very lucky to make it out. According
to the refugees and the people that I talked to in the camp, the
first thing that the Serbs did was kill all the doctors.
 &UR; MAY 14, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, nurses and other medical technicians make up half of
the organizations like Doctors of the World. The other half is
``Logistics.'' No doctor can work without nurses, translators or
the tools of modern medicine: IV fluids and catheters, sterilized
equipment, antibiotics, bandages, needles and syringes.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Fraser is a big Canadian who is the logistician in
Macedonia for Doctors of the World.
</P>
<P>
   At the general staff meeting, Fraser describes the campaign to
distribute buckets filled with local foods. About 900 have been
prepared, and recent donations have provided funding for 20,000
more. There is talk of making up boxes to feed a family of five for
a week _ to be used when the refugees go home.
</P>
<P>
   There is silence. No one really talks about what will be needed
when the war ends.
 &UR; MAY 19, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 9:00 p.m. we get word: A couple of busloads of refugees _ the
first to cross the border in weeks _ will arrive in a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the buses pull up, young men stand crowded in the aisles
while old women peer out through the windows into the night.
Macedonian soldiers are shouting, pointing at the gates. The
medical staff stands ready.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have lined up on either side of the central
clearing, straining for a first glimpse of the arriving passengers.
Most are looking for relatives, friends, neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The doors open slowly. Faces, harshly lit by the camp light,
descend. Everyone looks startled by the light, the noise, the idea
of safety. Children are sobbing. Old women weep. Young men look
bewildered, as if they are surprised they are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   No one looks critically ill, although everyone appears
shell-shocked. Some older people, hunched and frail, stumble feebly
in the direction of the camp. I stop an ancient woman who appears
to have a broken nose. It happened two days ago, she tells me. She
fell running from the Serbian police.
 &UR; MAY 20, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and I have a rare day off, so we drive to the border,
about 25 kilometers from Skopje. The dry countryside looks like the
foothills of the Sierras in California.
</P>
<P>
   An aide from the camp points to a patch of hillside that
overlooks the roofs of a small village beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs were there three weeks ago. Emptied the town right
out and set fire to everything that would burn.''
 &UR; MAY 27, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly a month since I arrived at Senokos. The number of
refugees has risen from 2,500 to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Today we learn that Milosevic has been indicted by the United
Nations War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tending to an elderly women who hasn't slept for days. She
insists that otherwise she is fine _ as the tears stream down her
face. I prescribe Valium for what seems to be the hundredth time
tonight. In the waiting room are three more just like her.

GEORGE RENDERS ITS CHIEF GENTLY TO THAT GOOD NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Known for its eye-catching covers _ a nude Kate Moss, for
example _ George magazine goes the understated route for its
farewell tribute to founding editor John F. Kennedy Jr. in the
October issue _ a blurred, swirling American flag interrupted with
simple white lettering that says: ``John Kennedy: A Tribute.'' The
issue hits newsstands next week.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's mission with George was to ``make politics accessible
by covering it in an entertaining and compelling way.'' But inside
the 184-page issue are some of the staples that had critics
complaining that George had settled for being the People magazine
of politics: a sexy shot of 15-year-old model Lauren Bush, who
happens to be the former president's granddaughter; former New York
``Senator Pothole'' Al D'Amato offering advice to the lovelorn; and
actress Melanie Griffith pontificating on what she'd do as
president while posing in a red, white and blue push-'em-up bra.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-page tribute to Kennedy, who died in a July airplane
accident, is a mix of photographs of Kennedy with dignitaries from
Norman Schwarzkopf to Fidel Castro, and excerpts from his editors'
notes and from his interviews with people like Warren Beatty, Billy
Graham and Don Imus. Another section pays tributes to his heroes,
an eclectic group that ranges from John McCain to Bill Clinton.
(George always considered itself ``post-partisan.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, George faced the same dilemma as the rest of the media in
trying to balance Kennedy's legacy precariously between two poles:
the famous son of Camelot and the decent, regular guy still
searching for his place.
</P>
<P>
   So much of George's JFK Jr. tribute positions him in the
reflected glory of the celebrities his magazine chronicled that the
most poignant post-mortem is a simple two-page color shot of
Kennedy _ the decent, regular guy _ hurriedly glancing at some mail
in a lonely-looking office.

   Are the media barking up the wrong coca plant with George W.
Bush? Yes, according to a new Pew Research Center survey that finds
the public less interested than journalists in politicians' private
lives. A majority of respondents identified only four sins _ spouse
abuse, income tax evasion, exaggerated military record, and
exaggerated academic record _ that ``should almost always'' trigger
media scrutiny. But only 43% felt that way about an ongoing affair
and only 35 percent believed cocaine use almost always merited
attention, and that number dropped to 23 percent when marijuana was
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise to Pew Research Center director Andy Kohut,
who has polled on these issues since the 1987 Gary Hart debacle and
has found that the ``public has rather consistently said that we
don't care about the personal lives of these people.'' The best
illustration of this, he says, is ``the movie (Primary Colors) that
was made from Joe Klein's book. It was a very good movie. It was a
bomb at the box office.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, voters might have enjoyed the irony and the squirming on
last Sunday's ABC's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson &AMP; Cokie
Roberts'' when presidential hopeful Bill Bradley _ who, in response
to Donaldson, admitted he had smoked marijuana several times _
turned the table on his hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson was candid, saying ``I think a couple of times I've
tried it. And I inhaled.'' But Roberts said simply: ``Oh listen, I
was so pregnant during those years.'' And George Will offered a
mysterious, ``No. I'm from the Falstaff generation.'' (Tell me
those responses wouldn't have prompted follow-up questions at a
press conference.)

   Trying to change its image of being ``USA Yesterday,'' The
Christian Science Monitor has teamed with the Financial Times to
tackle one of its thorniest problems. The Times is helping the
73,000-circulation Monitor convert more than half its subscribers
from mail delivery to morning doorstep delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The Monitor's cumbersome mail system _ which brings the paper to
most people at midday or later _ not only means subscribers don't
read the paper until evening, it forces early deadlines that often
have the daily thinking like a weekly.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Monitor has rolled out doorstep delivery
programs in New York and Boston. While it's too early to gauge the
results here, New York circulation is up nearly 30 percent since
1995. And if the new distribution system allows the Monitor to
implement deadlines that are three hours later and subscribers see
the paper at 7 a.m. instead of 7 p.m., ``that's 15 hours fresher
news,'' says managing publisher Stephen Gray.

   In this era of Viacom-CBS marriages, the cross-ownership rule
banning a company from owning newspaper and broadcast outlets in
the same market seems anachronistic. At least that's the view of
Newspaper Association of America president John Sturm, who is
petitioning the Federal Communications Commission to ease the ban.
Sturm's argument is that in this era of rampaging mergers and
acquisitions, the cross-ownership ban is de facto discrimination
against newspaper companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important reason for getting rid of the rule is that
there's no reason to retain the rule,'' says Sturm. And more than
one observer believes it could be the next regulatory domino to
topple.

<P>
   Eleven weeks after NATO began raining bombs on Yugoslavia,
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo. By
then, more than 850,000 Kosovars had fled the region. A few
refugees immigrated. The vast majority are housed with host
families or in refugee camps in Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Grim, an American emergency physician, volunteered her
services at a Macedonian refugee camp during the thick of the war.
This is her journal.
 &UR; MAY 6, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Managers of Senokos Camp, a refugee shelter in northern
Macedonia, have been notified that 4,000 to 5,000 Kosovars are to
arrive. Doctors of the World, the organization that provides
medical care in the camp, has called for physician volunteers, so I
find myself in their headquarters in New York City, signing an
insurance policy for, among other things, kidnapping, ransom and
extortion.
 &UR; MAY 8, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I arrive at the headquarters of Doctors of the World emergency
relief project in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. Senokos Camp is
about an hour's drive away, near the Macedonian-Kosovar border.
</P>
<P>
   I am introduced around the office. Doctors of the World had been
in Pristina, Kosovo, for six years. The staff had been evacuated
two days before the bombing began in March. In the kitchen I meet
the cook, an elderly Kosovar who has been here a month. As she
serves me potatoes and Turkish coffee, she tries to explain
something. But she speaks no English. She seats herself abruptly,
takes off her glasses and starts to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, we head off to Senokos Camp. The guard waves
us through the chicken- and barbed-wire fence that surrounds row
upon row of tents. The medical clinic is a small complex of three
tents joined by an awning.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have not yet arrived. The borders are closed. We
are not needed tonight.
 &UR; MAY 9, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several of the doctors working in the camp are Kosovars who fled
when the war began. The doctor in charge of the camp health
facilities, Visar Nushi, fled Pristina a few days after the bombing
started. He was separated from his fiancee and does not know if she
is alive or dead. He does not know if his parents are alive or
dead. His sister _ with his two nephews _ has also disappeared.
Still, Nushi puts in 14-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   Senokos Camp is a small shelter. It is equipped for 10,500
people. Some 2,500 have arrived. We await the rest. Everyone has
shelter, food, potable water and privies nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in Senokos _ the crowding, the boredom, the anxiety
_ are severe but manageable. At Stenkovec II, just down the road,
there are sometimes as many as 30,000 exiles. The expanding
population has assumed a critical mass, a level of chaos that
breeds rioting.
</P>
<P>
   We are experiencing similar problems. Today a doctor treats a
refugee with two teeth knocked out by another refugee. There was no
disagreement; they didn't even know each other. The assailant had
just walked up to this man and kicked him twice in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Fuller, an American internist, sees s 32-year-old woman
brought in by her husband. She is accompanied by their 4-year-old
son. The mother says something in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a headache,'' the translator explains.
</P>
<P>
   The woman covers her face with her hands. Her shoulders shake as
she weeps noiselessly.
</P>
<P>
   The translator frowns. ``She says she just found out her mother
and her father were massacred in Kosovo. They are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman weeps. Her son stares up her, confused. He starts
sobbing in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   That is one kind of case.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Fisher, one of the doctors working here, sees another. A
17-year-old kid who had stepped on a land mine in Kosovo had been
treated by an orthopedic surgeon in Pristina. The surgeon had fled
with him across the border and was now seated next to him on the
canvas cot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a medical emergency,'' the orthopedic surgeon told
Fisher. ``He must go to Germany for surgery immediately to save the
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon leaned forward and whispered, ``He is KLA, Kosovo
Liberation Army. If they find him here, they will kill him. You
must get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan looked down at the foot. ``You've worked a miracle here,''
he told the orthopedist sadly. ``I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The orthopedist was himself very lucky to make it out. According
to the refugees and the people that I talked to in the camp, the
first thing that the Serbs did was kill all the doctors.
 &UR; MAY 14, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, nurses and other medical technicians make up half of
the organizations like Doctors of the World. The other half is
``Logistics.'' No doctor can work without nurses, translators or
the tools of modern medicine: IV fluids and catheters, sterilized
equipment, antibiotics, bandages, needles and syringes.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Fraser is a big Canadian who is the logistician in
Macedonia for Doctors of the World.
</P>
<P>
   At the general staff meeting, Fraser describes the campaign to
distribute buckets filled with local foods. About 900 have been
prepared, and recent donations have provided funding for 20,000
more. There is talk of making up boxes to feed a family of five for
a week _ to be used when the refugees go home.
</P>
<P>
   There is silence. No one really talks about what will be needed
when the war ends.
 &UR; MAY 19, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 9:00 p.m. we get word: A couple of busloads of refugees _ the
first to cross the border in weeks _ will arrive in a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   When the buses pull up, young men stand crowded in the aisles
while old women peer out through the windows into the night.
Macedonian soldiers are shouting, pointing at the gates. The
medical staff stands ready.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have lined up on either side of the central
clearing, straining for a first glimpse of the arriving passengers.
Most are looking for relatives, friends, neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The doors open slowly. Faces, harshly lit by the camp light,
descend. Everyone looks startled by the light, the noise, the idea
of safety. Children are sobbing. Old women weep. Young men look
bewildered, as if they are surprised they are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   No one looks critically ill, although everyone appears
shell-shocked. Some older people, hunched and frail, stumble feebly
in the direction of the camp. I stop an ancient woman who appears
to have a broken nose. It happened two days ago, she tells me. She
fell running from the Serbian police.
 &UR; MAY 20, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and I have a rare day off, so we drive to the border,
about 25 kilometers from Skopje. The dry countryside looks like the
foothills of the Sierras in California.
</P>
<P>
   An aide from the camp points to a patch of hillside that
overlooks the roofs of a small village beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs were there three weeks ago. Emptied the town right
out and set fire to everything that would burn.''
 &UR; MAY 27, 1999 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly a month since I arrived at Senokos. The number of
refugees has risen from 2,500 to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Today we learn that Milosevic has been indicted by the United
Nations War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tending to an elderly women who hasn't slept for days. She
insists that otherwise she is fine _ as the tears stream down her
face. I prescribe Valium for what seems to be the hundredth time
tonight. In the waiting room are three more just like her.

ALMOST ANYTHING GOES AS TV TURNS A DEEPER SHADE OF BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the season premiere of ABC's ``Spin City'' Tuesday night,
during an 8 p.m. block that two decades ago was television's
``family hour,'' Michael J. Fox's character scrambled to defend
himself when his girlfriend learned that he had spent the night
with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was spoon!'' he cried. ``We only spooned! We didn't
fork!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the fall TV season, during which the fast-moving line
determining acceptable boundaries of sexual references and
profanity is going to be pushed even further.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of that line is defended by some as an accurate
representation of reality and deplored by others as a form of
cultural corrosion. Either way, what seems indisputable is that
there's been a fundamental shift in the way television sees itself
and the way we see television. A medium once so prudish that it
showed married couples in separate beds and forbade even the
mildest expletives has now become a risque business.
</P>
<P>
   But even after years of that trend, and even in post-Monicagate
America, the new fall lineup seems likely to prompt more of the
startled refrain: ``Can they say (or show) that on TV?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they can, and increasingly, they do. Stuart Fischoff, a
professor of media psychology at California State University, says
that ``the number of shows that deal with sexual themes or
subthemes or innuendo has multiplied astronomically.'' At
Minneapolis-based Campbell Mithun Esty, John Rash, who analyzed the
fall season for advertisers, contends that ``it clearly goes
further this year. The amount of salacious sitcoms and challenging
content that can be found at 8 o'clock is unprecedented in the
history of the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence also continues to be rife on television: A study
released Wednesday by the Center for Media and Public Affairs in
Washington found that in the 248 episodes analyzed, about one
violent scene appeared every four minutes. While depictions of
violence are rampant, sex is still talked about much more than it
is seen on broadcast television.
</P>
<P>
   But it is talked about with striking _ and increasing _
regularity, serving as punch line or story line in show after show,
from the best-written shows to the worst. Beyond that, the networks
are also reveling in their new freedom to show racier scenes and to
use formerly taboo words and phrases such as ``ass,'' ``sucks,''
``piss off,'' and ``get laid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when you think they can't go any lower, they find new
depths,'' said Robert Lichter, head of the Center for Media and
Public Affairs. ``Some of the material out there is so aggressively
shocking, it's like a stick in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, head of Syracuse University's Center for the
Study of Popular Television, observed that ``this old notion that
television was a safe cultural form, that television was going to
be clean, that simply isn't the case anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is pulling its pants down and swearing as loud as
it can to get people's attention,'' he said. ``But television
didn't teach us to swear. This language has been going into the
mainstream. We taught TV to swear. It is a miracle that TV took so
long to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The medium has proven an apt pupil. Here is a small but
representative sample of scenes and dialogue from the new season:
</P>
<P>
   --In last week's premiere of ``Action,'' Fox's new Hollywood
satire, the lead character used the F-word, which was bleeped out,
six times in the first minute, before the opening credits had
finished. Moments later, he referred to a ``hum job.'' One scene
involved a prostitute putting her hand down the pants of actor
Keanu Reeves, playing himself; another scene revolved around
characters eating a salad into which a waiter had urinated. On
Fox's ``Get Real,'' a high school student's parents do nothing
after discovering that his girlfriend has spent the night with him
in their home. Shrugs his sister: ``He's the only one who's getting
any.''
</P>
<P>
   --In CBS's ``Love or Money,'' after a joke about hearing ``the
sound of drilling,'' a father sees his adult daughter having sex in
a shower stall with the superintendent of their building. ``I can't
believe on your wedding day you would tear one off with the
super,'' her sister complains.
</P>
<P>
   --``Oh Grow Up,'' a freshman comedy on ABC, opens with the
sounds of a couple having sex. Later, a randy 35-year-old leers at
a young woman he has just met; the woman turns out to be his
long-lost daughter. His girlfriend interrupts them in conversation
and demands: ``OK, who's she? 'Cause I am not into three-ways.'' On
the premiere of ABC's ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' the female lead strips to
her slip while promising her husband some ``nooky.'' In ``Spin
City,'' after Fox's character is bested by a rival politico, an
aide says sympathetically: ``So, I guess you're not running the
campaign?'' In his partially bleeped reply, he appears to say:
``Yeah, and doesn't that f------ suck.''
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for television's increasing boldness, its hunger
for _ to use the vogue word _ ``edgy'' shows? Carol Altieri, vice
president of program practices at CBS, said the networks are trying
to ``remain relevant to the culture, to what people are talking
about, how they're running their lives.'' She acknowledged that the
increasing competition networks face has also prompted network
standards-and-practices departments, which once played the role of
in-house censor, to become ``less doctrinaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Some TV producers also make an argument for verisimilitude. For
instance, Chris Thompson, creator of ``Action,'' contends that the
coarse language in his show realistically depicts its milieu. ``I
don't know anybody (in Hollywood) who says `kicked in the heinie'
or `that guy is a real doody-head.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at ABC, Fox, and NBC did not respond to Globe
requests for comment this week. But in appearances before TV
critics in July, they too made it clear that in expanding the
boundaries of programs they air, they are responding to what they
perceive as new competitive realities.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when cable channels such as HBO and Comedy Central are
poaching viewers with shows that include ``The Sopranos,'' ``South
Park,'' and ``Sex and the City,'' which are not subject to the
restraints broadcast networks face, the networks are desperate to
win back those defecting viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to push the envelope,'' insisted Doug Herzog,
president of Fox's entertainment division. ``We need to be relevant
and keep on exploring and experimenting. . . . I think that's what
the audience demands in general right now from network
television.''
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts such as Rash believe the networks are
jeopardizing their base of middle-aged and older viewers, and
possibly forfeiting political support just when they need
Washington's approval for mergers of the sort that CBS has
undertaken with Viacom. With a presidential campaign under way,
``Cleaning up the airwaves will join mom and apple pie as automatic
standards in the cultural debate,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors driving the networks toward the vaunted
``edge.'' Deregulation of the TV industry has loosened the reins
when it comes to content. Since three-quarters of all homes now
have more than one set (compared with just 35 percent in 1970), the
networks can argue that they should enjoy greater license to create
shows aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, networks no longer try to be all things to all people;
they focus less on the quest for mass audiences and more on niche
audiences, especially young viewers. While their elders may be
aghast at what they see or hear on TV, younger viewers who have
seen such films as ``There's Something About Mary'' or ``American
Pie'' aren't likely to bat an eyelash. ``TV has become radio, where
everybody has their own programming,'' said NPR commentator Steven
Stark.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the broader culture has changed: After a year of
weathering reports about oral sex in the Oval Office, many viewers
may be beyond shock. ``We're in a period of time when people are
much more outraged by ethnic slurs than by swearing,'' said
Fischoff.
</P>
<P>
   However jarring analysts find the new license, few believe that
turning back the clock to a more wholesome era would work. ``It
would be ludicrous to tell stories the way we did back then,'' said
Thompson. ``It doesn't explain a culture anymore.''

HOG HELL: A LIVE-ACTION `ANIMAL FARM' HITS A TIMELY NOTE

entertainment column)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of scenes from the
TNT production of ``Animal Farm.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    During more than 25 years of covering Hollywood, I've
interviewed hundreds of personalities, from Lassie to Lasse
Halstrom, from Elizabeth Taylor to Richard Burton.
 &HT;    But the thought did occur to me that perhaps I have been in the
business too long, when this summer I found myself in an ornate
ballroom at Pasadena's Ritz-Carlton hotel, putting questions to a
300-pound pig.
 &HT;    Of course, it wasn't just any pig, mind you: This porcine
presence was a state-of-the-art animatronic hog named Napoleon, the
star of Turner Network Television's formidable ``Animal Farm,'' a
remarkable film version of George Orwell's classic l945 satiric
novel that will air on Oct. 3.
 &HT;    Sharing the press conference with Napoleon was Robert Halmi Sr.,
head of Hallmark Entertainment and producer of such television
films as ``Gulliver's Travels'' (1996), ``The Odyssey'' (1997),
``Merlin'' (1998), ``Alice in Wonderland'' (1999), ``Cleopatra''
(1999) and ``Crime and Punishment'' (1999).
 &HT;    Halmi is rarely at a loss for words, but even he seemed a trifle
overwhelmed by the sheer technological magic that the London-based
Creature Shop has created for the film, including an entire
barnyard of talking pigs, donkeys, horses, geese, dogs and sheep.
 &HT;    Napoleon is surely the company's piece de resistance, however,
and it was hard not to marvel that a ton of computer-driven
machinery could so closely resemble a living, breathing, snorting
and sweating barnyard creature. He even answered reporters'
questions _ slightly better and more articulately than the average
television starlet.
 &HT;    Napoleon's co-stars include some real animals and a few humans
as well, notably Pete Postlethwaite _ best known for ``In the Name
of the Father'' (1993) _ as Jones, the drunken farmer whose
neglected animals rebel and take over the farm. But the animal
revolution, beginning so promisingly, gradually devolves into a
ruthlessly repressive system worse than that of the humans they'd
overthrown.
 &HT;    If that sounds all too familiar, it's no wonder. More than 50
years after Orwell's novel was published, its story is as topical
in the era of Slobodan Milosevic as it was when the British writer
penned his savage allegory of Stalin's Soviet Union. Its greatest
lines _ most notably, ``All animals are equal, but some are more
equal than others'' _ resonate today every bit as much as they ever
have.
 &HT;    Making the story into a live-action movie, however, was not an
obvious thought. At first, director John Stephenson recalls, he
literally laughed at the idea.
 &HT;    ``I told them not to be ridiculous,'' he says. ``I thought it
was an impossible project.''
 &HT;    But Stephenson, who manages the Creature Shop and worked on
``Babe'' (l994), another pig story, was quickly convinced by Halmi
that it could and should be done.
 &HT;    For the Hungarian-born Halmi, who has specialized in turning
classic books into television movies, ``Animal Farm'' was a project
particularly near and dear to his heart.
 &HT;    ``I lived with this book for more than 50 years,'' he explains.
``I was in Hungary during the Communist rule, surrounded by barbed
wire and the so-called Iron Curtain. I was completely desolated,
thinking that no one knew what Communism is or what terror is.
 &HT;    ``Then all of a sudden `Animal Farm' was published and smuggled
into Hungary,'' he says. ``It became my Bible, and when I left
Hungary I took it with me. But it's taken me 50 years to set it up
as a movie.''
 &HT;    Along with the brilliant animatronics, a series of famous voices
help to bring Orwell's animals to life. Patrick Stewart provides
the sonorous voice of Napoleon, the porcine dictator modeled on old
Joe Stalin himself. Kelsey Grammer speaks for Snowball, the Leon
Trotsky stand-in, a well-meaning pig whom Napoleon dupes and
finally betrays. Ian Holm voices Squealer, Napoleon's insidious
propagandist, with Peter Ustinov as Old Major, the Karl
Marx-inspired pig who inspires the revolution. Paul Scofield is the
voice of Boxer, the cart horse who is good at following orders,
while Julia Ormond speaks for the gentle collie, Jessie.
 &HT;    The film was shot on a specially built farm in Ireland's Wicklow
mountains, outside Dublin. An entire town was created, virtually
from scratch, with power, telephone lines and sanitation having to
be brought into the rural valley specially for the project.
 &HT;    The mammoth scope of the undertaking was one of the reasons he
initially was reluctant to get involved, Stephenson says. What
ultimately persuaded him was the book itself.
 &HT;    ``I knew the complexities involved in making this work would be
enormous,'' he recalls. ``But then I re-read the book, and it hit
me all over again what an amazing story it is. I felt the film
needed to be made. and that we had the technology to make it work.
 &HT;    ``Even three or four years ago, I'm not sure you could have made
it work,'' he adds. ``But now we have these amazing technical tools
at our disposal.''
 &HT;    To create a barnyard full of convincing animatronic animals
required the skills of scores of Creature Shop technicians. Some
measured, filmed and studied real animals for reference purposes,
while others worked on the machinery that would animate the
artificial animals. Then museum sculptors came in to oversee the
process of designing the animals.
 &HT;    The all-important pigs were made of silicone, which to judge by
my close encounter with Napoleon is virtually indistinguishable in
feel and appearance from real hide. Each animal was then
individually furred, haired or feathered, and their ``bodies''
mounted over the mechanical hulls which would drive them.
 &HT;    Some of the same technology was used for the Australian
box-office hit ``Babe,'' Stephenson adds _ but, though both feature
talking pigs, the two films are only superficially alike.
 &HT;    ```Babe' took audiences into a fantasy-world movie,'' the
director says, ``while this is a Grimm's fairy tale.''
 &HT;    As one would expect, Stephenson says, the greatest difficulty
lay in mixing the real animals with the computerized and
animatronic versions so convincingly that the audience wouldn't be
able to tell the difference.
 &HT;    ``You have to know how to shoot the computronic animals,''
Stephenson explains. ``To try to get some personality into them and
some kind of performance out of them takes an immense amount of
work.
 &HT;    ``The key to this film is working the real animals into
situations where I can then use the animatronic ones to finish off
the scenes,'' he adds. ``No matter how well-trained a real animal
is, they can't concentrate for a second on anything. There were
times, however, when watching the rushes, that even we were not
able to tell whether we were seeing a fake horse or a real horse.''
 &HT;    One thing is for certain, however: No fake Orwell was used. The
only previous film version of the story, a 1954 animated version
made in England, provoked considerable controversy because Orwell's
pessimistic ending was changed. According to a documentary made by
TNT as a companion piece to the current film, the CIA funded the
earlier production and influenced the filmmakers to change the
ending and have the other animals overthrow the dictatorial pig
regime and restore democracy to the farm.
 &HT;    This time around, however, the story ends as Orwell intended it.
And that's no hog heaven.

NEW BABY? IT'S NORMAL TO WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If 1999 follows the pattern of the past decade, more babies will
have been born in August than in any other month, which means that
in September and October, there are more nervous parents in our
midst than at any other time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first six weeks after birth is a time full of fear,'' says
developmental psychologist Marguerite Barratt.
</P>
<P>
   Fear, of course, is not the dominant emotion new parents have
imagined for themselves. That only makes matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't expect to be anxious, it's that much harder when
you are,'' says Barratt. She is director of the Institute for
Children, Youth and Families at Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
   During pregnancy, most parents worry about labor, delivery and
having an impaired baby, says pediatrician and internationally
known author T. Berry Brazelton. When the euphoria of birth wears
off, he says, the focus shifts dramatically: ``How on earth can I
keep this baby alive?''
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility is so overwhelming it borders on terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's normal,'' insists Claire Lerner, a child development
specialist with Zero to Three, a national nonprofit group that
promotes healthy development in the first three years. ``Normal to
be fixated on worst-case scenarios. Normal not to fall instantly in
love. Normal not to feel joy every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra and Andy Diaz are among this year's crop of normal,
frightened parents, although now that baby Diego is 10 weeks old,
they're getting to be old pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while,'' says Sandra, ``I was so anxious I wouldn't let
anyone touch him without washing their hands, and I panicked if our
two dogs got near him. Now, I just try to be sensible. If your
hands are dirty, you have to wash. I even let the dogs lick him.
Well, one lick a day. Right before his bath.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Sandra and Andy were so unsure of themselves,
they couldn't imagine they could be good parents. ``If he crossed
his eyes I thought, `Oh my God, he's going to be cross-eyed!' ''
says Sandra. ``At night, I'd jump out of bed two or three times to
make sure he was breathing. At bath, I worried about how floppy his
head was.''
</P>
<P>
   Her list goes on, but it could just as easily be the list of any
other new parent _ including Jack Maypole, who you'd think wouldn't
be easily ruffled. The father of 4-month-old Krishan, he is a
pediatrician at Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those first few weeks, practically everything made me
worry, `Oh my God, what if . . .' I've worked in NICU (infant
intensive care). I've seen all the rare complications. It wasn't
hard to imagine.'' Indeed, when his son developed jaundice, a
condition not uncommon in newborns, he had to work hard to keep
himself calm and not to frighten his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, he was fine,'' he says sheepishly of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Because there isn't preparation for this overlay of negative
emotions, parents feel guilty _ ``If I'm so anxious, maybe I don't
love him enough'' _ and conclude they're inadequate: ``I'm no good
at this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the same as being no good at tennis, though. That
the stakes are so high literally paralyzes some parents, men and
women, so that they constantly defer to their partner or to a
grandparent and never develop their confidence or skills. ``The
newborn seems more like a creature than a baby,'' says Barratt.
</P>
<P>
   The fears she hears about are universal:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``How do you hold him without crushing him?'' (There's no one
right way. Some babies like to be tightly nestled, others don't;
experiment to find what's comfortable for you both.)
</P>
<P>
   --``How do you keep the head from flopping?'' (Neither the head
nor the soft spot on the skull, called the fontanel, are as fragile
as we think. Gentle support does the trick.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``How do I make sure she won't suffocate?'' (To reduce the
risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, place babies on their back or
side to sleep. Remove soft bedding. Baby wedges can prevent
rolling.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``How do I know he isn't starving?'' (Breast milk and/or
formula is a rich source of nutrition; a baby can miss a feeding
without damage. If he's hungry, he'll let you know.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``How do I comfort her when she cries so much?'' (Some babies
cry more than others, and it has nothing to do with your ability as
a parent. Run through your checklist: Change the diaper, offer
milk, cuddle, rock, coo, check for skin irritation or fever. If
crying persists, find someone to spell you.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the practical how-to's that are so frightening,
however, says child and adolescent psychiatrist Arnold Kerzner,
founder of the Boston Institute for the Development of Infants and
Parents. Sleep deprivation can make either parent feel, think, and
act like a different person. In addition, mothers have the stress
of postpartum hormonal change, while fathers tend to be overwhelmed
by financial worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic between husband and wife can get out of whack
pretty quickly,'' says Pam Jordan, a researcher with a doctorate in
nursing and the lead author of ``Becoming Parents: How to
Strengthen Your Marriage As Your Family Grows'' (Jossey Bass).
</P>
<P>
   ``The dad typically goes back to work, sees his wife falling in
love, and feels jealous, left out, and resentful. At the same
time,'' she says, ``he's preoccupied: `How are we going to manage
with another mouth to feed? Am I in the right job? Do I need better
hours/less travel/more money?' ''
</P>
<P>
   To his wife, it looks like he doesn't care. ``He's not as
involved with the baby as she expected, and his head seems to be
elsewhere,'' says Jordan. ``She's thinking, `I've lost my husband!'
So she feels resentful.'' That all of this unfolds at a time when
couples expect to be more in love with each other than ever,
because they've just created this wonderful baby together, only
adds fuel to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote is to talk feelings through and work as a team. But
who has time or energy to talk? Jordan offers a potent example of
why it's critical to make the effort:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Mom is breastfeeding. The father has no role in the
nighttime feedings, but he gets awakened for each one and he's not
functioning at work from lack of sleep. Since there's not much
point to his presence, he decides he should sleep in the spare
room. If he just tells his wife he's doing this, it could leave her
feeling isolated, lonely, and angry. But if it happens as the
result of brainstorming together, it can feel perfectly reasonable,
like they're functioning as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, says Barratt, it's good to talk before the birth
about divvying up marketing, cleaning, laundry, and meal
preparation, but it's also important to remain flexible when faced
with reality: ``I know I planned to do the groceries with the baby,
but it's more stressful than I thought; we need a new plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, simply voicing concerns to each other can make all the
difference. Diaz worried every time her husband burped Diego.
Finally she let it out: ``It sounds so hard when you burp him, it
frightens me!'' Talking about it made her realize Andy wasn't
hurting Diego, she says. ``I could relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Attitude counts, too, says Lerner:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the baby cries and you rock him and it doesn't help, do you
say, `This isn't what he needs, I'll try something else,' or do you
throw up your hands: `I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm totally
incompetent!'?'' Parents in the first case will succeed sooner or
later, she says, and feel good for it, but a negative attitude can
become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel inadequate, you tend to stiffen up,'' Lerner
says. ``The baby feels that and gets more upset, and then you're
afraid it will happen every time, so you're even more stiff. It's a
vicious cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of neglect or abuse, there is no such thing as a
make-it-or-break-it mistake, Lerner reassures parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're waiting and waiting for your baby to gaze lovingly at
you. Finally she does for the first time, and the phone rings. You
instinctively answer, and then you think, `Oh no, I answered the
phone instead of returning that gaze! How could I do that?' and you
feel sick. Forget it,'' she says. ``No one moment counts so much.
It's the aggregate of the whole relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   By six weeks, most couples experience a change. Sleep and
hormones are evening out, experience is catching up: One day,
you're putting his Jell-O arms into his sleeves, deathly afraid
you'll squish him, and the next day it's just not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the baby is more responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a turning point for me with our first child,'' says
Brazelton. At six weeks, his daughter responded to his coos and
smiles. Suddenly, he felt he had a role after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was captured,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks was magic for the Diazes, too. ``Things suddenly felt
less chaotic. I could wake up in the morning and get into a
routine, and I started to feel like I was actually pretty good at
what I was doing,'' says Sandra. ``You really do learn as you go.
Plus, it helps to be in this together, me and Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The more support systems parents have in place before the baby
is born, the better, including people to call on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ No question is stupid. If your pediatrician or anyone in her
office makes you feel ashamed or silly, switch practices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exposure to germs may not be as big an issue as you think: A
typical baby carries the mother's immunities for three months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ten to 15 percent of new mothers experience depression that is
more than temporary hormonal change. Consult a professional if any
of these feelings persist for more than three weeks: You feel sad,
weepy, or disliked all the time; you're still in PJ's at 6 p.m.
because you never get yourself going; you have constant trouble
caring for the baby.
</P>
<P>
   _ The current generation of mothers tends to need more
professional support with nursing because their own mothers
probably didn't breastfeed and don't know how to help them.
</P>

WEB BANKING COMES OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I got an upsetting letter from my credit card company last
weekend. The letter, from First USA, informed me that the way I do
my on-line banking was about to change.
</P>
<P>
   The change really started about a year ago, when First USA
bought First Card, the company that sponsors my Mileage Plus
MasterCard. I've had my Mileage Plus First Card for more than three
years. The best thing about the card, besides the fact I get a
frequent-flier mile for every dollar I spend, is that I can
automatically download a record of my purchases into Quicken. Since
then, I've used the credit card for all my expenses, and I've
gotten an uncannily accurate picture of where I spend my money.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken's One Step Update feature is pretty cool. Every time I
start up my copy of Quicken 2000, the program automatically
contacts these companies over the Internet, checks to see if I have
new pending transactions, and automatically downloads them into my
register.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I'm in the minority. According to David Webster, a
spokesperson with First USA, only a tiny number of the company's
customers are using Quicken's One Step Update. First USA's Web site
is far more popular; more than 500,000 customers have registered to
review their First USA credit card accounts over the Web. So First
USA has discontinued One Step Update in favor of making information
available over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based home banking actually lets companies such as First USA
offer far more services to consumers than they ever could do
through Quicken's proprietary interface. As with Quicken, the First
USA Web site shows me the date of each charge, the amount, the name
of the merchant, and a category of the transaction. But I also can
see ``authorizations'' _ that is, the amount of credit that has
been reserved on my credit-card pending a settlement. I can even
click on a link and dispute a charge, all without having to pick up
the phone or write a letter.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial institutions also are bypassing direct
integration with Quicken and moving straight to the Web. In the
process, they are offering new services and features to their
customers. My bank, the Cambridge Trust Company, lets me use their
Web-based bank statement to pay bills with electronic payments and
balance my checking account statement on line. The Web-based system
gives customers who aren't using Quicken _ the majority of the
bank's customers _ an easy way to manage their finances.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine is so enamored with his bank's on-line services
that he has decided to move to a ``paperless statement.'' Instead
of getting his credit card statement in the mail each month, he
gets an e-mail message telling him that the statement is ready to
download. He then clicks to the Web site, downloads the statement,
and saves it on his hard drive. A few more keystrokes and he has
programmed in a payment on the credit-card bill from his on-line
checking account. This is great for my friend, who travels a lot.
It's also great for the credit card company, which does away with
the expense of sending out the paper bill.
</P>
<P>
   For people who are already using Quicken, these Web-based
systems can be something of a step backward _ or they can be a step
forward. It all depends on how the bank sets up its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Most financial companies that have set up Web-based services let
customers export their transactions into a file. The data in this
file then can be imported into Quicken. It used to be that the only
file format that Quicken supported was something called a ``QIF
File.'' QIF stands for Quicken Interchange Format; it's a simple
technique that Intuit created years ago for moving data in and out
of the Quicken application. But starting with Quicken '99, Intuit
created a new file format called Web Connect. The reason that the
letter from First USA upset me so much was that the letter said
that I would have to download my statement using QIF. As it turns
out, the letter was wrong: First USA supports the Web Connect
standard.
</P>
<P>
   In general, importing transactions with QIF is something that
consumers should avoid. Using QIF, it's all too easy to import your
transactions into the wrong Quicken register, or to accidentally
get double transactions in your register. Once when I imported a
QIF file from Cambridge Trust I had to spend more than an hour
trying to undo the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken's Web Connect system, on the other hand, works just as
well as the company's One Step Update. You just click a button and
Quicken transfers the data into the correct register and lets you
compare these numbers with the rest of your statement. If your
financial institution doesn't offer Web Connect, tell them that
they should. Don't trust your finances to a QIF!
</P>
<P>
   One lingering fear I have regarding this is that some crook or
identity thief might get access to my account over the Internet and
start spending my money. Alas, this is a problem many financial
institutions need to address. At Cambridge Trust, for instance, I
had to get a paper application, send it in, and then wait for the
company to send me my username and password by US mail.
Unfortunately, when I got the letter, I discovered the bank had
used my Social Security number as my username. That's not very
secure, since there are many ways to discover a Social Security
number.
</P>
<P>
   First USA, on the other hand, allowed me to set up my Web
account electronically. All I had to do was to provide my
credit-card number, my birthday, my mother's maiden name, and the
zip code where my credit card statements are sent. The whole
process took less than three minutes. I guess I'm lucky that I
activated my credit card's on-line account and set up a password
before somebody else _ an identity thief, for instance _ did it
using my account.

A SAFE PLACE TO SOUND OFF ABOUT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: XXPat is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rayjay is a self-described African-American lesbian mother
living in ``tiny town USA.'' XXPat is a minister in Michigan who
moonlights in a rock 'n' roll band. Both Ginger in Austin and BigT
III in Atlanta are happily married to partners of different races.
Betty, meanwhile, is a retired chemist in New Jersey who will tell
you she ``is not opposed to interracial marriages or dating but was
never given the opportunity to try.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these people have ever met in person, but for the past
week, they have been revealing emotional details about their
personal lives in a unique online forum. Spurred by the engaging
PBS documentary series, ``An American Love Story,'' these intimate
strangers have volunteered to participate in an ongoing dialogue
about race, relationships, prejudice, and other provocative topics.
It's an experiment masterminded by a New York operation called Web
Lab, which aims to show that the Internet, despite its crass
commercialism, can foster intelligent communication among diverse
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Love Story,'' the 10-part series that concluded
Thursday (Sept. 16), highlighted the unvarnished story of Bill Sims
and Karen Wilson, an interracial couple living in Queens, N.Y.;
there was something extraordinarily compelling about the
ordinariness of lives played out against a backdrop of racism and
intolerance. The online forum is proving to be just as
irresistible. As the participants become more vulnerable, they are
unwittingly creating a fascinating study of American attitudes
about race and relationships that is as engrossing as the
documentary itself _ uncensored, honest, and raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from the tradition of using a film as a catalyst for
getting people to think and talk about things in different ways,''
says Web Lab founder Marc Weiss, a former filmmaker who also
founded the PBS program ``Point of View.'' ``We wanted to create a
safe place on the Web for people with historically profound
differences to create a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum, at www.pbs.org/weblab/lovestories/dialogues/, is not
a typical chat room or bulletin board, where the discussion often
degrades to inanity or profanity. Participants fill out an
application form, and then Web Lab staffers create small groups of
people who agree to join for at least three weeks. After the group
is formed, the members moderate their own discussions, which are
posted publicly on the Web site. ``Most of what happens on regular
posting boards is random at best,'' says Weiss. ``We call it
drive-by postings, with people who post once and never come back to
engage in a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to provide a combination of anonymity along with
accountability. Participants submit a bio, in which they reveal as
much as they choose. They are also bound by the group ethos to
remain civil, despite any disagreements. So far, the ``Love Story''
discussions have politely tiptoed around controversy. But Weiss,
who has overseen similar online discussions about the Vietnam War
and the Starr Report, predicts that the boards will heat up as
people become more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking people to leave their emotions at the door,''
says Weiss. ``Ordinary people can find a way to talk about the
things they disagree on without blowing each other away or
obliterating their opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what Anthony Fontana hopes will happen. He
joined the discussion because he is a white man married to a black
woman and is naturally interested in the dynamics of the
discussion. ``I tend to deal in the extreme; I'm not a
middle-of-the-road kind of guy,'' says Fontana, who runs a
construction business in Atlanta and uses the screen name BigT III.
``I don't allow people to stay in their comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the groups are lingering in the comfort zone, with
most of the postings expressing a kind of ``We are the world''
mentality. But both Weiss and Fontana note that the discussions
will generate an edge as time goes by. In Fontanta's group, for
instance, some members have already begun challenging each other.
Consider this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've experienced more and more blacks with a chip on their
shoulder regarding relationships or contacts with whites,'' writes
a retired educator in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm white, married to a young, black Christian man,'' responds
Ginger in Austin. ``He has been stopped by police several times for
doing things I take for granted. . . . Yes, I do think that some
black people have a chip on their shoulders. But as a white person
who has seen firsthand what it's like to be black in America, I can
understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Betty in New Jersey retorts, ``My chip is that I resent
the fact that black men marry white women and leave eligible black
women alone, to remain single all their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   These are ordinary people sharing everyday triumphs and woes,
similar to the Sims-Wilson family in ``American Love Story.'' At a
time when entrepreneurs are tripping over each other trying to
figure out how to turn a profit from the Internet, some folks are
trying to carve out a public interest niche online, a sort of
uncorrupted PBS of the Web. ``I'm not against commercialism,'' says
Weiss, ``but the Web needs to have a soul.''

MAKING HISTORY IS PAR FOR THE COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When the Ryder Cup was first played at
Worcester Country Club in 1927, it was just a friendly little match
between teams from the United States and Great Britain. Seventy-two
years later, it is a major golfing event.
</P>
<P>
   And where better to hold a major golfing event than at The
Country Club, the staid club on Clyde Street where a neighborhood
kid named Francis Ouimet made history in 1913 when he overcame the
celebrated Britons Harry Vardon and Ted Ray to win the US Open? The
victory both glamorized the game among those who could afford to
play it and aroused the curiosity of the general populace, making
Ouimet a Tiger Woods of his time and establishing The Country
Club's place in golf history.
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club may be the perfect venue at the perfect time
for this competition to visit Greater Boston. Just a few miles
away, at Fenway Park, the Red Sox are reawakening the echoes of
past baseball glory. The Country Club has seen its share of golf
glory.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 15 events put on by the United States Golf
Association at the club, with the US Women's Amateur beginning the
historic parade in 1902, when Genevieve Hecker of the Appawamis
Club in Rye, N.H., defended her title with a 4-and-3 victory over
Louisa Wells of the host club. Ouimet won the first of three US
Opens at the Brookline tract. Fifty years later, another native son
of New England, Julius Boros, defeated Jack Cupit and Arnold Palmer
in a playoff to win the Open there, and in 1988 _ the 75th
anniversary of Ouimet's victory _ Curtis Strange edged Nick Faldo
in another US Open playoff at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 USGA events hosted by The Country Club, 12 have been
amateur events, and general chairman John Cornish has said, ``We've
always thought of ourselves as an amateur club.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA of America approached The Country Club's then-golf
chairman, Peter Ingraham, in 1994 about the possibility of a Ryder
Cup/PGA Championship package. The club, faced with an excessive
bill to remodel the ancient and storied clubhouse, bought in and
will realize more than $6 million from the tournament. The game is
golf, the bottom line money.
</P>
<P>
   Given the richness of its history as host of multiple US
Amateurs, the Walker Cup, the US Women's Amateur, and a 1968 US
Junior in which US Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw advanced to the
quarterfinals, the course would seem ideal for match play. There is
no USGA-style rough, just enough to make it a sporty test. ``I
think it lends itself beautifully to match play,'' said Crenshaw.
``There's one great thing about match play: It lends itself to a
little more aggressive play. That's the way you win holes. You've
got to keep playing what you think is your best golf, and it's got
to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The aggressiveness of competition will be expressed over the
next three days, beginning with the first of four foursome matches
Friday at 7:30 p.m. Will Woods be paired with No. 2-ranked David
Duval and sent off first? How about Woods and Duval versus European
No. 1 Colin Montgomerie and Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal
for starters? Will Woods ever get to meet PGA Championship nemesis
Sergio Garcia in the Sunday singles? These decisions lie in the
hands of the captains, and neither Crenshaw nor his English
counterpart, Mark James, is tipping his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's love of the course was a factor in his suggestions
for its preparation and setup prior to this event. ``You have to
think your way around this golf course,'' he said. ``It is what it
is. The fascinating thing about this course, I think, is its
collection of holes and routing and undulation. There's undulating
fairways and there's perched greens that are very small. You have
to know your game, but you have to know how to apply it on this
golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw believes there are certain places along the course
where a playeake a risk, but other places where he just has
to execute. ``These greens average between 3,000 and 3,500 feet,
and that's very, very small,'' he said. ``You have to play very,
very good irons. In a match-play situation, you must hole out to
win holes. It's a thinking test, a fascinating test. This course
was always set up for a USGA event in the past, and obviously heavy
rough was everywhere. This is not a medal play event.''
</P>
<P>
   In Crenshaw's opinion, there will be no room for cruise control,
regardless of setup factors such as pin placement. ``The second
shots here, in my mind, one of the great essences of this course,''
said the captain. ``Still, to play to those greens, you have to
keep it in the fairway. You're always going to play beetter shots
to the greens from the fairway. You're still going to reward
shot-making. There's nothing I or anyone else could conceivably do
to get our side to get that much of an advantage, not on a golf
course like this. It's too good. There's too many problems about it
when you play it. It's a wonderful test.''
</P>
<P>
   There is great variety among the 18 holes. The par-4 sixth hole
measures just 310 yards, but it is all carry. Woods will probably
go for it; Duval won't. ``I hit it pin-high to the right,'' said
Woods after playing the hole with a trailing wind on Tuesday.
``You've got to have a little help, because it's all carry. It's
not going to release, it's not going to roll. You have to hit the
ball 330 yards in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   That essentially makes Duval's strategic decision for him. ``I
don't hit it far enough,'' he said. ``I can't hit a golf ball 330
yards in the air. So I practice my wedges.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's practice, James was warming up to the moist
weather, as any good Brit might. ``It's just a question of letting
the guys practice and get used to the British weather,'' he said.
``I think it's just getting ready for the main event. I think on
this type of a course you start off playing fairways and greens and
then, as the game develops, you have to weigh up the risk on each
shot. Essentially, any US Open standard is fairways and greens, and
this is set up far better than a normal US Open. It's much, much
fairer and much better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great golf course,'' said US veteran Tom Lehman. ``It's
a fantastic venue for match play. It should be a thrilling week.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure in this Ryder Cup, added Lehman, will be as great
as in any of the game's major championships, if not greater. ``I've
been more nervous in a Ryder Cup match than I ever have in any
other golf tournament,'' he said. ``The reason? It's the team
thing. You feel the desire of your teammates, and you know you have
the burning desire within to do well. You have all the expectations
you're carrying with you.''
</P>
<P>
   So The Country Club undoubtedly will see a new chapter of its
history written over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   This is a course where the Vardon traps loom large on the 17th,
where Chick Evans lost in the US Amateur final in 1910 to William
C. Fownes of Oakmont CC. This is a course where Bobby Jones lost to
Jess Sweetzer, 8 and 7, in the semifinals of the US Amateur in
1922, where Ouimet replaced Jones as captain of the US team that
met Great Britain in the Walker Cup of 1932. This is a course where
Lawson Little completed his sweep of the British and US Amateur
championships in 1934, where Elizabeth Hicks Newell defeated Helen
Sigel, 5 and 3, in the final of the 1941 US Women's Amateur on the
eve of World War II. And this is a course where her nephew, Jay
Sigel, won the first of his two US Amateurs in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   This a course that intrigued a Texas teenager named Ben Crenshaw
when he first saw it 31 years ago, and where he will be at center
stage in what for many has become golf's grandest show, played out
this weekend over some of the game's most hallowed turf.

CARRYING AN ENEMY BAG DOESN'T FAZE CADDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The voices piped up from the back seat of a
Ryder Cup courtesy car caught in traffic in front of the clubhouse
at The Country Club. The caddie for Europe's Sergio Garcia had been
spotted talking to an American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember whose side you're on,'' England's Lee Westwood
shouted in mock indignation. ``Yeah, yeah,'' the caddie countered.
``Europe. Oh, yeah, Europe. Oh, yeah, Europe!''
</P>
<P>
   That was just after Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke had issued
the first mock loyalty reminder to the caddie. ``Be careful what
you say . . . you're on our team.'' Garcia's caddie laughed then
began talking about his interesting week to come. Talking in a flat
American accent, a California guy ``who loves America'' carrying a
Spaniard's bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in fun,'' said Jerry Higginbotham, ``and they were
just joking around. `Remember what team you're on.' I've known Lee
Westwood and Darren Clarke for a long time, and it was all just
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be funny,'' continued the caddie. ``And I've got
some family and friends coming to the matches and it's going to be
interesting for them, too. And I think they might be rooting for
Sergio. It's not really the US vs. Europe for me. It's just a golf
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham had just come from the practice putting green
behind the clubhouse ``and I had six or seven American caddies
around me and they were giving it to me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Ryder Cup has one characteristic that distinguishes it
from virtually all other golf events, it is the jingoism that hangs
over every shot. When in Europe, the Ryder Cup is marked by huge
cheers for European quality shots and, perhaps, for American
bogeys. Same here, except the US fans will be cheering for American
birdies and for European slices. Especially late Sunday, when
matches could be decided by one shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all friends, whether you're on the European side
or the American side,'' said Higginbotham of the mixed bag he'll be
carrying this week. ``Both teams are here to win and they want to
take the Cup home. But I'm working for my boss and my boss is
Sergio Garcia.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham is one of two American caddies toting bags for the
Europeans. Lance Ten Broeck, a Chicago native and former PGA Tour
player (he cashed his last check for $3,000 at the 1998 CVS Charity
Classic at Pleasant Valley in Sutton) will be caddying for Sweden's
Jesper Parnevik. Ten Broeck, like Higginbotham, said he loves his
country but he'll be doing everything possible to make sure his
boss wins his matches.
</P>
<P>
   Caddie loyalty ordinarily might seem a reach as a key factor
when analyzing the Ryder Cup. Indeed, it was common in earlier
Ryder Cups for American golfers to have European caddies when
matches were played in Europe and vice versa when the matches were
played in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed in 1997. American Lee Janzen lost his
regular caddie just before the matches at Valderrama in Spain as
Dave Musgrove, an Englishman, said his European loyalty would not
allow him to carry a US bag. The inner conflict would be too great.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now touchy enough that when Parnevik decided he
wanted Ten Broeck, a close friend, to caddie for him, the Swede
said he first asked teammates Clarke and Westwood their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They actually told me to bring him on,'' said Parnevik. ``You
never know what (Ten Broeck) is going to feel like, but Lance said
he would feel very comfortable on the European side. But you never
know. Sometimes you can feel a little bit strange being on the
opposing side.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten Broeck recalled that Parnevik ``wasn't quite sure of the
reaction of his teammates, or his teammates' caddies, to myself,
being an American, caddying for the European team. But they didn't
have a problem with that because they felt that probably what was
best for (Parnevik) was best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Janzen scrambled to find a caddie after Musgrove backed
out and went with Bruce Edwards, an American who has long been Tom
Watson's caddie, as a fill-in. Janzen went 2-1 in his matches as
the US team was upset by the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really surprised when (Musgrove) did that,'' said
Higginbotham, who carried the bag of the US's Mark O'Meara in the
1997 Ryder Cup but was let go by O'Meara in April. ``That's because
we all know Dave and he's an Englishman and he sticks to his guns
and it was on the (European) home turf.''
</P>
<P>
   As for this Ruder Cup, ``I would like to see the Europeans win
because I don't ever like to be on the losing side,'' said
Higginbotham. And while players have different lounges in the
clubhouse _ where loyalty is clearly defined _ not so the American
and European caddies, who share one. Higginbotham expects to
experience more needling as the week goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Broeck (``I was only marginal on the Tour'')also had no
doubts when he was offered the chance to carry a European bag on
American soil. ``I wanted to do it,'' said the former pro, who
became friends with Parnevik when the Swede moved to Florida to
concentrate on the American tour. ``Why would anybody want to pass
this up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I have no idea,'' Ten Broeck said when asked how
he expects to feel when he hears the reaction of the American
crowds this weekend. ``I've never been here before.''

MOUNDS OF TROUBLE OFF THE 7TH GREEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It is the most charming aspect to a course
drenched in charm, a conversation piece for golfers, as well as
spectators, in this 33d Ryder Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   Just to the right of the green at the par-3 seventh hole sits a
series of small mounds, 10 of them. Affectionately called ``The
Chocolate Drops,'' they lend great character to a hole that has
plenty of it to begin with. It is called ``The Oldest Hole,'' and
plays 197 yards. A 4- or 5-iron for most of the players to the
Redan green that is some 32 yards deep.
</P>
<P>
   During the practice round, every player has gone out of his way
to drop balls on these chocolate drops. The rough isn't thick, but
it is snarly, and chipping the ball close is a chore from the funky
lies.
</P>
<P>
   When Payne Stewart played out of them, his swing coach stood
three mounds away and felt a quiver under his feet. ``What is under
these things?'' said Chuck Cook. ``I felt the ground vibrate over
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart prodded, as did virtually ever player on both teams.
They, too, were intrigued by the mounds. Though not necessarily
looking forward to playing out of them.
</P>
<P>
   When he gave it a shot, Hal Sutton put his ball in an awkward
downhill lie, choked way down on the club, and had trouble getting
the blade down to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia dropped a half-dozen balls in there and seemed
like he was having a lot of fun just hitting high, soft lob wedges
out.
</P>
<P>
   Don Callahan, the longtime head pro at The Country Club who now
is the director of golf, theorized that the area was mostly rock
and the drops were covered with dirt. Probably easier than removing
the rock, though Callahan, like so many others, is a big fan of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But more than decorative, the drops serve a huge purpose. They
protect the right side of the green, which is beautifully
contoured, and when the pin is back right (Sunday's position,
perhaps) the drops are most definitely in play.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be fun _ for the spectators.

OPEN DRAMA AT NO. 18 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The storied 18th hole at The Country Club has
provided a significant backdrop to some of golf's significant
moments.
</P>
<P>
   When Francis Ouimet won the playoff against British giants Harry
Vardon and Ted Ray in the 1913 US Open, heavy rains had soaked the
course. ``The rains had turned the race track in front of the green
into a bog,'' noted Ouimet in his autobiography. He successfully
carried it in regulation and the playoff. The track was eventually
grassed over in 1969, and the first and 18th holes made into
doglegs in order to put a practice range in between the fairways.
US Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw played the last year the track
was still intact, in the 1968 US Juniors.
</P>
<P>
   There was always the towering elm tree that loomed to the right
of the 18th green, but the landmark was taken down in the 1980s
because of disease. Julius Boros (1963) and Curtis Strange ('88)
also won playoffs on the 50th and 75th anniversary of Ouimet's
historic victory, and the 18th figured in the competition. The
Walker Cup was also dented in 1932 when Leonard Crawley, a
garrulous British golf correpondent, flew the green and his shot
struck the Cup, which was on a table behind the 18th. The Yanks won
the matches, 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   In '63, there were two rounds played on Saturday, and the score
of 293 that would qualify for a playoff Sunday was the highest
since 1935, when Sam Parks won with a 299. Harsh winter conditions
and high, blustery winds made scoring difficult. Boros, who grew up
in Fairfield, Conn., and played a lot of amateur golf throughout
New England and the Great Boston area before turning pro, had
birdied the 17th on Saturday but was so convinced he was out of it
he was even cleaning out his locker to leave the premises.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the locker room where club steward Dick Charchut
recommended a $12 bottle of champagne. Boros preferred a couple of
Carling Black Labels, since he won a few tournaments sponsored by
the brewery. As he sipped on the beer, leader Jack Cupit took a six
out of the Vardon trap on the 17th, and Palmer took three putts on
the hole. When Cupit's putt from 12 feet and a victory on the 18th
just slid past the cup, it was Boros, Palmer, and Cupit in the
playoff. Boros was in command from the start.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a third US Open playoff in 1988, and the 18th
hole had undergone modest restoration under the eye of architect
Rees Jones, who added 30 yards to the hole by lengthening the tee.
There were three new fairway bunkers added on the left, forcing
shots farther to the right and making the hole play longer. The
large elm had been taken down, which opened that side of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   This would come down to a confrontation between American Curtis
Strange out of the southern colony of Virginia and British Open
champion Nick Faldo out of Surrey. After Strange had taken the lead
by one shot over Faldo, Scott Simpson, and Bob Gilder entering
Sunday's final round, Strange and Faldo separated themselves by the
turn. Strange let Faldo pull even on the 17th when he let his putt
from 15 feet ``get away from me'' and he ended up with a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   So they walked to the 18th tee. Strange, who had won the
Memorial en route to The Country Club, saw his 3-wood tee shot
trickle into the left rough. He pulled out a 7-iron, and his second
shot came up short and found the bunker. Faldo, whose drive split
the middle of the fairway, hit his second shot to the right fringe.
``I didn't have time to think about it,'' said Strange. ``I had to
do my damndest not to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Staring into the blazing setting sun with a huge crowd jammed
into the grandstands _ and countless more straining to see the shot
_ Strange fluffed the shot out within a foot. When Faldo rolled his
putt to within 2 feet and sank the putt, Stange obliged to create
the playoff at the historic course.
</P>
<P>
   When Faldo bogeyed the 17th out of the rough behind the green
and the 18th out of a downhill lie in the rough, Strange would be
free with pars on the 16th, 17th, and 18th holes to win the first
of his two consecutive Opens. He defended the following year at Oak
Hill.

   EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL/``TEMPERAMENTAL'' (Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   Talk about moving on. The ninth studio recording from EBTG's Ben
Watt and Tracey Thorn travels beyond even the gorgeous trip-hop,
jungle and electronica-tinged 1996 effort ``Walking Wounded,''
which itself was miles from the mannered cocktail jazz the duo
crafted in the '80s. Watt, who spins records at a London
underground dance spot, was clearly inspired by some of the edgiest
after-hours sounds in European club music, including deep house,
jazzy drum 'n' bass and hip-hop. But thanks to Thorn's warm, broad
voice and a sweetly soulful streak in the material, there's nothing
chilly about the oddly spelled ``Temperamental'' (released
Tuesday). Within these often thrilling tracks, Watt experiments
with spoken word, falsetto and edited voice fragments, making songs
like the current dance hit ``Five Fathoms,'' ``Blame'' and the
marvelous title track sound a lot like the future. 4 stars

   CLINT BLACK/``D'LECTRIFIED'' (RCA/BMG)
</P>
<P>
   The first album country ``hat'' star Black has produced by
himself showcases his skills as an arranger and casting director
since ``D'lectrified'' (out Tuesday) features him alongside the
likes of Kenny Loggins, Bruce Hornsby, Steve Wariner, Edgar Winter,
Waylon Jennings and even Monty Python's Eric Idle. It's also the
first Black disc to use outside material, including a slick remake
of the Marshall Tucker Band's ``Bob Away My Blues'' and a
rollicking reading of Leon Russell's ``Dixie Lullaby'' with Hornsby
on the rockin' 88's. Longtime fans, though, will be returning to
the current country hit, ``When I Said I Do,'' Black's touching
vocal collaboration with wife Lisa Hartman Black. The album ends on
an unexpected note: a sure-fire instrumental called ``Something
That We Do,'' featuring Black's dazzling fretwork accompanied by
just bass and drums. 3 stars

VARIOUS/``CENTRAL AVENUE SOUNDS'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   Blame William Claxton. When most people think of West Coast
jazz, they think of Chet Baker, Bud Shank and other ``cool''
players beautifully photographed by Claxton on dozens of memorable
album covers in the 1950s. (The music wasn't half-bad, either, of
course.) But Los Angeles had long enjoyed a thriving jazz scene in
clubs along Central Avenue, which ran from South Central to Watts.
The music in this four-disc box begins in 1921 and spans 35 years,
including the scene's indigenous artists as well as visiting
all-stars (Louis Armstrong, Lester Young, Lionel Hampton, Charlie
Parker, Nat King Cole, Charles Mingus, Art Tatum, Dexter Gordon)
who favored the area. The cover bills this era as jazz central,
but, in fact, more than half of this collection is firmly rooted in
blues and r&AMP;b stylings. That's particularly true of the Avenue's
last decade, represented here with prime cuts from Johnny Otis, Roy
Milton and Big Jay McNeely. But the classifications don't matter as
much as the quality of the music, which is uniformly outstanding,
as is the meticulous 92-page book that accompanies the set. 4 stars

   Like its predecessor (the ``Rare on Air'' series), this
inaugural volume in a new set of compilations titled for KCRW's
free-form music program offers a terrific snapshot of one of Los
Angeles' few radio treasures. The enormously wide-ranging output of
host Nic Harcourt's tiny Santa Monica studio includes gems like
pianist Brad Mehldau's imaginative reading of Radiohead's ``Exit
Music (For a Film),'' Ednaswap's jarring take-back of their own
``Torn,'' Air's delightful ``All I Need'' and lesser items from
Cake, Semisonic and Sixpence None the Richer. Best of all, though,
is Brit folkie John Martyn's slinky reinvention of Portishead's
``Glory Box.'' 3 stars

   Babs-resistant types will probably giggle over the cover shots
of la Streisand in full canoodle with hubby James Brolin. But
there's no denying the feeling within these grooves. Babs has a
remarkable voice, which she usually uses to evil ends. However,
collaborating with top producers, songwriters and arrangers _
what'd you expect, Barbra's $600 album? _ plus cameos from
saxophonist Kenny G and country star Vince Gill, ``A Love Like
Ours'' with its rendition of ``Isn't It a Pity?'' first single
``I've Dreamed of You'' and the ``Funny Girl'' leftover ``The Music
That Makes Me Dance'' is her strongest record of the decade. 3

</P>
<P>
   Cuban-born pianist Rubalcaba chose an apt title for this quiet,
introspective album of deeply felt music. Playing with members of
his working trio _ bassist Jeff Chambers and drummer Ignacio Berroa
_ Rubalcaba emphasizes subtlety over virtuosic muscle, at times
playing so softly that you almost have to strain the hear the
delicate music. It sounds like Rubalcaba _ who comes to Catalina
Bar &AMP; Grill next month _ has been listening to a lot of Bill Evans
lately, the result standing as a definite change-up from a master
of the Afro-Cuban form. And that's OK because the music (most of
the nine cuts were inspired by family and friends, according to the
detailed liner notes) is every bit as impressive as previous
powerhouse efforts like ``The Blessing'' and ``Rapsodia.'' He can
still cook, too, as evident in the two upbeat numbers with guest
Michael Brecker on tenor sax. 3 1/2 stars

glory days of Britpop features mostly remixes, including Moog
Cookbook's version of Air's ``Kelly Watch the Stars,'' a Moby remix
of Blur's ``Beetlebum'' and a My Bloody Valentine remix of Lush's

   This superb 50-track four-disc box spotlights the consistent
quality that came out of Prestige during the 22 years it operated
as an indie jazz label (1949-71). The music here falls into three
categories: bop and hard-bop, jam sessions featuring top young
players, and '60s soul-jazz organists. Vocalists were a rarity,
although there are a few here: Annie Ross' original reading of
``Twisted'' among them. But the label was about groove and hard
playing above all, and the artists who carry the flag here include
Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Gene Ammons, Sonny Rollins, James Moody
and Jack McDuff. 4 stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mighty China, which stood tall as capitalist neighbors from
Thailand to South Korea collapsed in 1997, is now struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has skidded, prices are dropping, and foreign
lenders are demanding tougher terms from Chinese borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   So many forces are squeezing China simultaneously that it's
difficult to discuss the crisis systemically. But the big picture
is essentially this: The Communist Party, which celebrates 50 years
in power on Oct. 1, can't keep its stranglehold for another 50 _
and maybe not even for another 10.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalist ideas and aspirations of thriving in a global market
economy are the Western seeds taking root in Chinese soil, and
their bloom will lead to Communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, fax machines, and untappable digital transmissions
have liberated Chinese entrepreneurs. And the healthy economy that
the Communist Party desperately needs cannot be had without further
freedom from state control and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Party may be striving to stifle the Internet's impact, but
its efforts will ultimately not succeed. Not in a country that
manufactures computers for Dell Computer and that launched its
first initial public offering for a Web site on the Nasdaq last
July (China.com).
</P>
<P>
   Because the Party seems nervous, Beijing's authority is being
challenged both at home and overseas. Thousands of citizens
belonging to a sect, Falun Gong, that stresses heavy-breathing
exercises have taken to the streets, daring arrest and brutal
imprisonment; they have been urged on over the Internet by the
sect's founder, an immigrant who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the president of Taiwan verbally slapped China when he
insisted that Taiwan is a separate country. And earlier, in the
spring, U.S. President Bill Clinton contributed to Beijing's
turmoil by retracting a deal for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   This has cost economic czar Zhu Rongji a great deal of
credibility; increasingly he is the scapegoat for China's slow
economy, where prices are falling and the vaunted trade surplus
dropped by 64 percent during the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders within the Chinese government are sniping at one
another, most prominently Zhu and former prime minister Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors sniff danger. Standard &AMP; Poor's recently cut China's
bond rating from BBB+ to just BBB. The loss of that plus sign will
force China to pay an extra quarter-point when it borrows from
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The budget deficit will climb by about 50 percent in 1999, too,
as Beijing pumps up the money supply and increases spending on
infrastructure projects to combat a slowing economy. And China is
lagging while the rest of Asia is recovering nicely this year.
</P>
<P>
   Exporters from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, which
devalued their currencies in 1997, are stealing market share from
Chinese exporters, which are hampered by a strong currency, the
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Shanghai stock exchange has been bleeding this
year. The shares that foreigners can own slumped by 28 percent
during the first three weeks of July alone.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't China devalue the yuan to speed up exports and
wipe out the uncertainty that is scaring investors away?
</P>
<P>
   China resists for the following reasons: First, a devaluation
might spiral out of control. Second, the G-7 might respond by
barring China from the WTO. Third _ and most important _ Beijing's
pride would suffer, especially given the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese pride wouldn't be the only victim: A plunging yuan would
spook investors and rock China's recovering neighbors, robbing them
of this year's strong equity gains. &QL;

TAIWAN'S ECONOMY WILL SPRING BACK AFTER QUAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A generation ago, ``Made in Taiwan'' was not a
compliment. The island was best known for cheap labor and shoddy
exports, from clothes to calculators.
</P>
<P>
   Not today. In its vast modernization drive since the 1970s,
Taiwan has grown from a Third World backwater into one of the
world's largest makers of computer chips, circuit boards and other
high-tech equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Its corporate mandarins and entrepreneurs are courted from
Singapore to the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But the devastating earthquake that struck central Taiwan this
week may stall the economy and the island's talented work force.
High-tech companies in the United States _ including Acer America
in San Jose, Apple Computer in Cupertino and Hewlett-Packard in
Palo Alto _ may not get shipments from Taiwan in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The delays shouldn't last long. Before the quake, the Taiwanese
were storming the global stage, intent on building a stronger
presence. Dozens of business people, government leaders and
scholars have expressed tenacious faith in their island's future.
</P>
<P>
   No, Taiwan isn't Nirvana. Crime and poverty plague the country.
Political corruption has outraged the public. Feverish consumerism
has led some to call Taiwan the ``Island of Greed.'' And elders
fear that a brash generation of hip, long-haired young people _
dubbed the ``new-new people'' _ has abandoned Buddhism to worship
drugs and booze.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of communist China also looms over the Taiwanese,
who declared independence from Mao Tse-tung's Communists after
World War II. China still views Taiwan as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   But this did not dismay the strong-willed Taiwanese. On a visit
Taipei two years ago, I spoke for hours with media executive Diane
Ying, the publisher of a popular business and political journal
called Tien Hsi, or Under the Sky. Her eyes glimmered as she talked
of her country.
</P>
<P>
   Ying, a former Asia correspondent for the New York Times and
Wall Street Journal, was guardedly optimistic. Much debate and
soul-searching was sweeping her country _ a good sign, she thought.
In the end, she predicted, Taiwan's entrepreneurial spirit would
prevail against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are thinking, thinking, thinking about the future,''
Ying said at the time. ``That is good. Somehow, we will find a way
forward for Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   I believed her _ even now, as her people emerge from the quake's
carnage. Empires rise and fall, and Taiwan will come roaring back.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Their names do not roll off the tongue with
familiarity. Nick Faldo isn't here, but Miguel Angel Jimenez is.
Ian Woosnam isn't here, but Andrew Coltart is. Bernard Langer is
not here, but Jarmo Sandelin is.
</P>
<P>
   When the 33d Ryder Cup Matches begin Friday at The Country Club,
the European team will not be filled with veterans used to the
almost unique pressure of Ryder Cup competition, but with seven of
its 12 members playing in a Ryder Cup for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup, almost everyone who has gone through it agrees,
an experience that can turn the most confident golfer into a
nervous duffer who wonders whether he will be able to even hit the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   A stretch you say? Consider what Paul Broadhurst said about
playing in Kiawah Island in the 1991 matches: ``Standing on the
first tee, I thought I was going to miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Per-Ulrik Johansson, who was so nervous on the first tee at
Oak Hill in 1995 that he didn't want to hit the opening shot in the
foursomes match against Ben Crenshaw and Curtis Strange, opting to
give that honor to Langer, his first-match teammate.
</P>
<P>
   The European rookies _ Jimenez, Coltart, Sandelin, gallery
favorite Sergio Garcia, Padraig Harrington, British Open champion
Paul Lawrie, and Britiish Open near-champion Jean Van de Velde _
went through another practice round Wednesday as the countdown
continued to what has become golf's version of a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   European captain Mark James, who must meld these rookies into
veterans who can retain The Cup, which the Europeans have owned
after six of the last eight Ryder Cup matches, does not minimize
what his first-time players must do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what's at stake,'' said James. ``I think it's just a
question of helping them realize what they are going to be feeling
like when they get under pressure for the first time this week and
telling them how to to deal with it and how to react.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're explaining to them what it's going to be like so they
are under no illusions about the way they're going to be feeling
when they get on the first tee or have a 4-foot curler on the first
green. We're telling them how to deal with it, and impressing upon
them that the opposition are going to be as nervous as they are.
Everyone gets nervous in the Ryder Cup; it's a high-pressure
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandelin, a free-spirited Finn, who is coming off his best
season on the European tour, said he already is feeling the
pressure. ``I feel it,'' he said, ``because everybody talks about
it. But I haven't seen it. I look forward to seeing the pressure,
because I don't know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde has come under particular scrutiny this week,
primarily because of his blowup in the British Open at Carnoustie
when his triple-bogey on the 18th hole in the final round cost him
the lead and subsequently the Claret Jug when he lost a playoff to
Justin Leonard and Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde has not faced as situation as high-pressured since,
and a poor performance this weekend will be undoubtedly be another
negative added to his permanent record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my dream to play in the Ryder Cup when I was a kid, and
I worked pretty hard for it,'' said Van de Velde, who has won
victory on the European Tour since he joined it in 1989. ``And I'm
going to cherish every moment of it, every little detail, and
everything that happened this week. I'm going to keep it in the
back of my mind and have it for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   So many things are different at Ryder Cup matches, a first-time
player can not process all of them unless he has experienced them.
Take the crowds for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that having played in Ryder Cups you know what is
going to happen,'' said Payne Stewart, who will be playing in his
fifth. ``You are going to know that there's going to be different
cheers out on the golf course and you're going to be able to
understand what those mean. We're playing in the United States; the
cheers are going to be a lot louder for the Americans than for the
Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Different noises. Playing not for yourself, but for a team.
Match-play competition with the entire world watching, judging.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are here, with seven new faces. They say they're
ready and can handle not only the Americans, but the pressures that
are building each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine Friday is going to be the tougest test I've
faced in my career so far,'' said Lawrie, who has been on the
European Tour since 1992 and has three victories, highlighted by
the playoff victory at Carnoustie. ``I don't know what it's going
to be like. I'm sure I'm going to be shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Coltart, a captain's selection, also conceded he would be
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you try and follow your dreams, you just have to go
ahead and go after them,'' he said.

first initial public offering for a Web site on the Nasdaq last
July (China.com).
</P>
<P>
   Because the Party seems nervous, Beijing's authority is being
challenged both at home and overseas. Thousands of citizens
belonging to a sect, Falun Gong, that stresses heavy-breathing
exercises have taken to the streets, daring arrest and brutal
imprisonment; they have been urged on over the Internet by the
sect's founder, an immigrant who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the president of Taiwan verbally slapped China when he
insisted that Taiwan is a separate country. And earlier, in the
spring, U.S. President Bill Clinton contributed to Beijing's
turmoil by retracting a deal for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   This has cost economic czar Zhu Rongji a great deal of
credibility; increasingly he is the scapegoat for China's slow
economy, where prices are falling and the vaunted trade surplus
dropped by 64 percent during the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders within the Chinese government are sniping at one
another, most prominently Zhu and former prime minister Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors sniff danger. Standard &AMP; Poor's recently cut China's
bond rating from BBB+ to just BBB. The loss of that plus sign will
force China to pay an extra quarter-point when it borrows from
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The budget deficit will climb by about 50 percent in 1999, too,
as Beijing pumps up the money supply and increases spending on
infrastructure projects to combat a slowing economy. And China is
lagging while the rest of Asia is recovering nicely this year.
</P>
<P>
   Exporters from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, which
devalued their currencies in 1997, are stealing market share from
Chinese exporters, which are hampered by a strong currency, the
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Shanghai stock exchange has been bleeding this
year. The shares that foreigners can own slumped by 28 percent
during the first three weeks of July alone.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't China devalue the yuan to speed up exports and
wipe out the uncertainty that is scaring investors away?
</P>
<P>
   China resists for the following reasons: First, a devaluation
might spiral out of control. Second, the G-7 might respond by
barring China from the WTO. Third _ and most important _ Beijing's
pride would suffer, especially given the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese pride wouldn't be the only victim: A plunging yuan would
spook investors and rock China's recovering neighbors, robbing them
of this year's strong equity gains. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mighty China, which stood tall as capitalist neighbors from
Thailand to South Korea collapsed in 1997, is now struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has skidded, prices are dropping, and foreign
lenders are demanding tougher terms from Chinese borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   So many forces are squeezing China simultaneously that it's
difficult to discuss the crisis systemically. But the big picture
is essentially this: The Communist Party, which celebrates 50 years
in power on Oct. 1, can't keep its stranglehold for another 50 _
and maybe not even for another 10.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalist ideas and aspirations of thriving in a global market
economy are the Western seeds taking root in Chinese soil, and
their bloom will lead to Communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, fax machines, and untappable digital transmissions
have liberated Chinese entrepreneurs. And the healthy economy that
the Communist Party desperately needs cannot be had without further
freedom from state control and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Party may be striving to stifle the Internet's impact, but
its efforts will ultimately not succeed. Not in a country that
manufactures computers for Dell Computer and that launched its
first initial public offering for a Web site on the Nasdaq last
July (China.com).

SURGEON'S STORIES SLICE TO THE HEART OF HUMANNESS

THE BLOOD OF STRANGERS 
Stories from Emergency Medicine 
By Frank Huyler 
University of California Press, 154 pp., $19.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There seems to be an emerging genre of medical writing that
crosses idioms, hovering between first-person account,
philosophical essay, and straight reportage. I'm thinking of Jerome
Groopman's writing for The New Yorker, Sherwin B. Nuland (``How We
Die,'' ``The Wisdom of the Body''), and even the novelist Ethan
Canin (``For Kings and Planets'').
</P>
<P>
   All these writers are doctors, many of them write true stories
(as much as a ``story'' is ever true), and all, at their best,
produce work that is deeply humane, deeply moral, achieving a
certain intellectual grace and integrity that at times approaches
the spiritual. Ironically, it's accomplished by detailing _
carefully and in blood-spattered precision _ the realm of the
physical.
</P>
<P>
   There is to this literature a certain voyeuristic quality, a
participatory, grisly curiosity on the part of the reader. But
there is also a transcendence that occurs when statistics and
factoids are crystallized into something finer in a sensitive mind
_ filtered and honed to their essence.
</P>
<P>
   To that list we can add poet and physician Frank Huyler, whose
book ``The Blood of Strangers: Stories From Emergency Medicine'' is
what it sounds like: firsthand accounts of tragedy up close. But as
with the books mentioned above, what begins like something out of
television's ``ER'' is beveled into something more like poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Huyler's writing is sharp and spare, clean as a scalpel. His
first-person memoir reads like a journal: Each chapter is the story
of a particular patient, his illness, her treatment. Huyler,
however, is always present. He is, after all, these patients'
surgeon, their protector, sometimes their savior, in a frightening,
dazzling-white world of blades and needles and whirring machines.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a gray-haired professor he's just treated for a manic
episode: ``I wondered how she felt, knowing what she carried in her
head. . . . I imagined her little bottle of lithium, kept in her
purse like money. Lithium, molecular weight 6.9, number 3 on the
periodic table of the elements. A pure substance, the only thing
keeping her in the world. And she had no idea that I was
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   As the book begins, the chapters are short _ sometimes too
short, like a bite of lemon that stings but begs to be more.
Probably the earliest ones should have been left out, since they
can't stand on their own. Satisfyingly, however, the stories
increase in length, in scope, and in Aristotelian wholeness as the
book proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Huyler is what everyone hopes for in a bad situation: a
compassionate doctor who's not afraid to admit (sometimes in a
brutally honest aside) that he's human. There's the broken neck he
fails to diagnose, the accident victim he stitches together but
can't save, the murderer and drug addict he resents having to treat
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That night, tired as I was, their glib revision of him
infuriated me. Their grief was real, but the words they used to
describe it were not. It was a eulogy for another life, another
man, a fiction, a wish. My anger was disproportionate, unseemly, I
knew; but I was tired, I told myself, of staying up all night with
bleeding alcoholics, overdosing drug addicts, murderers and gang
members, and I was tired of families who remade history for the
convenience of personal loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as you cringe from Huyler's honesty, you have to
admire, on the other hand, his generosity of spirit:
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them when they are brave in the face of it. I like the
old women who say they're ready, that they understand the surgery
is dangerous, if they die they die, who smile and pat my hand and
tell me to send send their children in. I like the men who flirt
with the nurses even though the EKG is unmistakable.''
</P>
<P>
   Huyler, who is only 32 at the end of the book, has a lifetime
ahead of him, and many years to hone his literary as well as his
surgical skills. This volume is a modest jewel, a compact, faceted
gem that shines with intelligence. And, like the work of those more
senior doctor/writer/philosopher kings who precede him, it proves
that even in these days of lawsuits and HMOs and health-care
hysteria, there are doctors and nurses who truly value the lives in
their charge.

   Over 90 percent of the world's desktop computers run some sort
of Microsoft operating system. However, this is mainly due not to
Microsoft's undeniable mean streak but to the ineptitude of Apple
Computer Inc. and IBM Corp., which were well-positioned to compete
against Microsoft, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, monopolies have their uses. Having Windows as a
near-universal software standard makes computing a lot easier for
the clueless masses. Consumers were bound to standardize around one
favorite operating system for simplicity's sake. And software
developers benefit because they can save the cost of writing
different versions of their products. Just write a Windows version,
and you can sell to nearly everybody.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the talk about the liberating effects of technology,
it's obvious computing as we know it wouldn't exist without a
number of well-placed monopolies _ institutions that set standards
that nearly everybody relies on.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Windows is such a standard, and has gained its
monopoly for exactly that reason. I'm at a loss to see any harm to
the public in this. Indeed, I believe it was bitter rivals, like
the deceased Netscape Communications Corp., whose whining to the US
Justice Department spawned this antitrust suit in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's something in the American character that winces
at the sight of powerful organizations that exercise vast sway over
us, even when they are indispensable to our high-tech lives. That's
why I've been getting so much hostile e-mail about a different sort
of monopoly _ ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers.
</P>
<P>
   A Web page address is actually a number up to 12 digits long.
You don't actually type in the numbers. Instead, you might type in
``globe.com,'' and the name is converted into numbers. What makes
this process simple is the Domain Name System or DNS. It's a
monopoly, of course; the naming system has to be standardized so it
works worldwide. And until a year ago, DNS was run by precisely one
guy _ Jon Postel, a gray-bearded computer whiz so respected and so
powerful that his nickname was ``God.'' But last October, Postel
died, and now his duties have been taken over by ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   Monopoly or no, there were few protests when the revered Dr.
Postel was in charge. That's largely because he concentrated on
ensuring that DNS worked. But in its first year of existence, ICANN
has been the target of furious criticism from Internet businesses
and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, ICANN tried to charge a $1 fee for each Internet
domain name to fund its operations, enraging Internet service
providers who complained it had no legal right to levy such a fee
and spawning a congressional hearing. In addition, the agency has
moved slowly to introduce new Internet domains to supplement the
overstuffed ``.com'' domain. Lots of entrepreneurs think they can
get rich selling selling ``.sex'' or ``.trade'' Internet addresses.
Not yet, says ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   There's even concern ICANN wants to bar the purchase of domain
names that might resemble well-known corporate names. That's a job
for lawmakers, not ICANN's 10-member high priesthood, says David
Post of Temple University Law School. Post even says that recording
industry groups are urging ICANN to deny Internet domain names to
people who post copyrighted music files on their sites. That would
transform ICANN from a vital technical service to a kind of
Internet cop.
</P>
<P>
   An ICANN spokeswoman says most of the criticism is being
inspired by agents of Network Solutions Inc., the company charged
by the federal government with controlling the hugely lucrative
.com domain, at least until next year. She said undermining ICANN
might ensure that Network Solutions will get an extension on its
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But ICANN is not Microsoft. In a sense, it's more
powerful. Microsoft's monopoly isn't airtight. I can always buy a
Macintosh or Linux computer. But to get a Net domain name, I'll
have to play by the rules of ICANN, a nonprofit organization that
will never have competition. As monopolies go, ICANN may be more
worrisome than Microsoft.

ORGANIZER GUARDS AGAINST TROUBLES OF WOODSTOCK '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By the time they got to Woodstock '99, they were a
quarter of a million strong, and the last hours of the three-day
event were marred by looting, arson and assault.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of next month's Coachella Valley Music and Arts
Festival say it can't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so different from Woodstock,'' said Rick Van Santen,
co-owner of Goldenvoice, promoters of Coachella. ``That was all
about maximizing profit. This is the complete opposite of having
hard-rock acts like Rage Against the Machine, the Red Hot Chili
Peppers and Limp Bizkit playing one after the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Rage is appearing at Coachella. But the show Oct. 9-10
at the Empire Polo Field in Indio near Palm Springs is clearly
modeled after Britain's eclectic Glastonbury festival.
</P>
<P>
   That means the accent is on electronica, dance and the more
experimental side of things. Along with headliners Beck, Tool and
Morrissey singing with the Chemical Brothers, Coachella offers
acclaimed European acts such as Roni Size, Gus Gus, Spiritualized
and Lamb, plus about a dozen turntable stars.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 performances per day will take place on two stages
and in three dance tents. Tickets cost $50 per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you don't know who everyone is, you'll find something
to like,'' says talent buyer Lauren Matsui. ``It's not a
headliner-driven festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Santen promises plenty of shade, free parking, a 70-acre
grass site and ``mild October days and cool autumn nights with lots
of room to roam around.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he says, everyone gets a free bottle of water and is
invited to refill it throughout the day at the water fountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really thinking about the individual's experience,'' Van
Santen said. ``We're not selling to capacity. We're capping sales
so each person can have a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Woodstock '99 drew 250,000 people to a paved former air
base in Rome, N.Y., where food and drink prices reached exorbitant
levels, apparently sparking some of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Coachella's organizers expect 35,000 per day at the site where
Pearl Jam played in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a lot safer in all aspects when you have less
people,'' Van Santen said, adding there will be no camping on site
since countless hotels, motels, resorts and camp grounds are
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   For information, go to www.coachella.com or call (323) 692-9361.
</P>
<P>
   Reunion on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   One more thing.
</P>
<P>
   The British music press is abuzz with speculation of a possible
Smiths reunion at Coachella. The reason: Ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny
Marr is playing with Beck while Morrissey will sing with the
Chemical Brothers on the same stage Oct. 9. The Smiths, considered
the definitive British indie-rock band of the '80s, disbanded 12
years ago. &QL;

ENDLESS TINKERING YIELDS NASCAR ENGINE GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are in the crowd at New Hampshire International Speedway in
Loudon, N.H. You and 90,000 other souls.
</P>
<P>
   A sizzling line of Winston Cup cars comes roaring out of the
fourth turn and heads down the straight-away. Glasses shake on the
bridges of noses. Chests thump with cacophonous vibration. Fillings
rattle. Mouths move, but no one hears what comes from them.
</P>
<P>
   So what's making all the racket? What is there at the heart of
these NASCAR racers, all clad in similar skins and bearing their
sponsors' names and badges, that makes them so loud, so fast, and
so hotdamn competitive? So different from the engine in your own
car?
</P>
<P>
   The answer might surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Preston Miller, the NASCAR program technical consultant for
Ford Racing Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engine in the car you drove to the track in is way more
sophisticated than any engine out there on the track,'' Miller
says.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: You likely arrived with an engine with an aluminum
block; overhead cams; fuel injection; computer chips everywhere
monitoring fuel and air.
</P>
<P>
   Those three cars out there with, say, Robert Yates Racing
engines in them _ the 88 of Dale Jarrett, the 28 of Kenny Irwin,
and Ted Musgrave's 75 _ why they've got veritable dinosaurs beneath
the hood. They're finely-tuned dinosaurs, and what they lack in
sophistication technology-wise, they more than make up for in the
sophistication of the years of study and handling they've had, but
dinosaurs nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Cast iron blocks. 3.8-liter V8s. Two valves per cylinder (``Feed
Me,'' screams the engine), cams in the blocks, push rods, for God's
sake, 8 1/2 to 9 inches long, and as valves open and then close and
try to seat themselves, these skinny little rods deflect and the
valves may open just a bit when they should be firmly seated. Open
twenty-thousandths of an inch when they should be shut for the burn
is a bad thing says Doug Yates, son of Robert and in charge of the
engine side of that racing operation. Wouldn't have that deflection
problem with overhead cams.
</P>
<P>
   Dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could take the basic parts from a 1984 engine and put them
up against one from today and you'd have a tough time telling them
apart,'' says Yates.
</P>
<P>
   But here's another surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The engines have changed little in 20 years, but under NASCAR
rules compression has been cut back. And you know what? Through
diligence, smarts, and serendipity, the engine builders have coaxed
200 more horsepower out of those dinosaurs over that time period.
</P>
<P>
   How'd they do it?
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, says Miller, by fooling with the fuel and air mixture.
Pretty basic, but unless you move into a whole new technology,
which NASCAR will not do because they don't want the cars to get
too fast and ever more dangerous, then the mixture of fuel and air
_ building pressure faster than the piston can move away from it _
is the single most important variable.
</P>
<P>
   You can't dedicate the mixture cylinder by cylinder like you can
with fuel injection. Got to let it get sucked by the intake cycle,
from the carburetor, through the plenum and distributed from that
metal box out to the cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   So you fool with valve openings. You fool with rudders and
butterflies. You tinker with exhausts and back pressures and
manifolds. Sometimes you have an idea and it works. Sometimes, as
Yates says once happened on his team, serendipity strikes. A weld
breaks and a fragment travels through the manifold and lodges
inside the engine. For whatever reason, you've suddenly got more
horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, says Miller, luck has little to do with it.
Countless hours at the flow bench looking for quality of mixture
and velocity of air flow, a willingness to try and try and try, to
experiment, to tinker, wins more horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll work night and day. There's nothing they won't try,''
says Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But once you get an edge on your opponents, how do you keep it?
Used to be you might hold onto such an edge for a whole season,
says Yates. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Now it might last a race or two.
</P>
<P>
   In the garages, the doors are open; there are no screens to
separate the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help see what they're doing to their intake
manifold, exhaust . . .,'' says Yates. ``And if that guy's beating
you, you better start looking at what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of this ``sharing'' of technology?
</P>
<P>
   Used to be there'd be a 50-horsepower spread in a field of cars.
Today, it's down to about 10 at any given race. Today's cars run in
the range of 750-775 horsepower at the engine, 680-700 at the rear
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   All this horsepower, Yates says, even though the sport purposely
``keeps the technology down to keep the racing close.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it takes a lot of work to stay close to the competition.
Especially when, as Robert Yates Racing does, you have about 75
engines in play at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Three teams at Loudon this weekend race with Yates engines, for
instance. That means for each, the race car arrives with its
qualifying engine installed. There's a backup qualifying engine on
the truck. Then the race engine and two backup race engines. Plus
you've got the backup car with a race engine of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to coin a phrase, back at the ranch at North Carolina
headquarters, there are rebuilds going on.
</P>
<P>
   The parts alone for a Winston Cup engine cost about $25,000. Put
it together and you're up to $40,000-45,000. Rebuild it after every
race (saving only block, head castings, crank) at a cost of $15,000
and at the upper limits _ way upper limits, says Yates _ you might
get 10 races out of it. Expensive dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   But my, don't they roar. My, don't they rattle the fillings. My,
don't those Chevys and Fords and Pontiacs flat-out scream with
these engines as their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Miller knows these engines and marvels at what gets coaxed from
them.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows his limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't attempt to work on the car I drive,'' he chuckles.

   MOSCOW _ Russians would be the first to admit their strange
national propensity for envying others their success, yet pitying
them in misfortune. That was how they treated Raisa Gorbachev, who
died of leukemia in a German hospital Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When she was the first Soviet President's glittering First Lady,
they detested her. When she fell ill, Russians gave her their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The news that she had succumbed to an infection before she could
receive a transplant of bone marrow from her sister was the first
item on the television news here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raisa Maximovna suffered very much in the past few weeks but
her death was peaceful,'' NTV's correspondent in Germany assured
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped to end the Cold War with his
policies of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness),
would bring his wife home to be buried in Moscow's Novodevichy
cemetery, he said. President Boris Yeltsin had sent his condolences
and promised a charter plane to fly the body to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Raisa Gorbachev's last weeks, not only did her
husband keep a vigil at the Muenster Clinic that tried to save her
but also the whole of Russia followed her saga, as if she were a
soap opera star.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ordinary Russians sent letters, recipes for herbal
medicines and even offers of money to the couple they once reviled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way we are,'' said Olga Podolskaya, a
secretary. ``We used to find Raisa extremely irritating. But at the
end, we felt sorry for her and even more sorry for him, the loyal
and loving husband, constantly at her bedside.''
</P>
<P>
   Raisa Gorbachev herself knew how the Russian public felt about
her. In an interview for the TV show ``Hero With His Tie Off,''
recorded when she was well, she recounted how hard it had been to
be the first ever First Lady in a society that hid its political
wives.
</P>
<P>
   Russians almost never saw Viktoria, wife of the late Communist
leader, Leonid Brezhnev, and as for one of his successor's, Yuri
Andropov, they were not sure whether he had a wife at all.
</P>
<P>
   Raisa broke a taboo by appearing in public with her husband. For
him, admitting that he had a partner and that she played an
important role in his life was a personal act of glasnost, an
extension of his policy of openness.
</P>
<P>
   Like all pioneers, the Gorbachevs paid for being ahead of their
time. Raisa was a clever, educated woman, a species that many
Russians still have trouble in accepting. &QL;

<P>

</P>
<P>
   She was born Raisa Maximovna Titorenko in the Siberian region of
Altai in 1932. Her father, Maxim Titorenko, had gone out to Siberia
to help build the railways. The young Raisa was bright enough to go
all the way from this provincial backwater to Moscow State
University (MGU), where she studied philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   There she met Mikhail, a promising law student, whom she married
in 1953. When he returned to his native Stavropol district in
southern Russia to become a local Communist Party boss, she joined
him and took up a career in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   When he was promoted to a party job in Moscow, in charge of
Soviet agriculture, she did research at her old philosophy faculty
at MGU. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her public appearances began soon after her husband became
Kremlin leader in 1985. Not only did she take on the chairmanship
of the Soviet Culture Fund but she also joined Gorbachev on his
domestic outings to meet the people and his numerous trips to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   She always wore an elegant dress or suit and a tasteful amount
of jewelry. That was her mistake. Russians were green with envy
because she had a measure of sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   And not only Russians. It was said that Nancy Reagan could not
abide her either because on one occasion she showed her knowledge
of art while guiding the American First Lady around Moscow's famous
Tretyakov Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Russians would have preferred Raisa Gorbachev to be
more homely. Naina Yeltsina, wife of President Yeltsin, has
cultivated an image of the little woman in the kitchen, probably
because of all the bile directed at Raisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit I hated her too,'' said Ms. Podolskaya. ``I
remember once seeing her following Gorbachev on some agricultural
or industrial visit. She was trotting along behind him in
high-heeled shoes and I thought `why doesn't she just stay at
home?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I realize that I was jealous because she had
more dresses than the average Russian woman. She was trying to be a
real First Lady. But I think she was badly advised. Someone should
have told her to wear the same outfit more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Once her husband was out of power, Raisa avoided the limelight.
In 1996, she sold the extensive wardrobe that had attracted so much
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   She devoted her time to fund-raising for cancer care and
research. Before she knew she had leukemia herself, she was helping
other victims.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Russians came to love her and why many will shed
tears when Raisa flies home for the last time. &QL;

<P>
   Russians almost never saw Viktoria, wife of the late Communist
leader, Leonid Brezhnev, and as for one of his successor's, Yuri
Andropov, they were not sure whether he had a wife at all.
</P>
<P>
   Raisa broke a taboo by appearing in public with her husband. For
him, admitting that he had a partner and that she played an
important role in his life was a personal act of glasnost, an
extension of his policy of openness.
</P>
<P>
   Like all pioneers, the Gorbachevs paid for being ahead of their
time. Raisa was a clever, educated woman, a species that many
Russians still have trouble in accepting. &QL;

<P>
   She was born Raisa Maximovna Titorenko in the Siberian region of
Altai in 1932. Her father, Maxim Titorenko, had gone out to Siberia
to help build the railways. The young Raisa was bright enough to go
all the way from this provincial backwater to Moscow State
University (MGU), where she studied philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   There she met Mikhail, a promising law student, whom she married
in 1953. When he returned to his native Stavropol district in
southern Russia to become a local Communist Party boss, she joined
him and took up a career in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   When he was promoted to a party job in Moscow, in charge of
Soviet agriculture, she did research at her old philosophy faculty
at MGU. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her public appearances began soon after her husband became
Kremlin leader in 1985. Not only did she take on the chairmanship
of the Soviet Culture Fund but she also joined Gorbachev on his
domestic outings to meet the people and his numerous trips to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   She always wore an elegant dress or suit and a tasteful amount
of jewelry. That was her mistake. Russians were green with envy
because she had a measure of sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   And not only Russians. It was said that Nancy Reagan could not
abide her either because on one occasion she showed her knowledge
of art while guiding the American First Lady around Moscow's famous
Tretyakov Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Russians would have preferred Raisa Gorbachev to be
more homely. Naina Yeltsina, wife of President Yeltsin, has
cultivated an image of the little woman in the kitchen, probably
because of all the bile directed at Raisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit I hated her too,'' said Ms. Podolskaya. ``I
remember once seeing her following Gorbachev on some agricultural
or industrial visit. She was trotting along behind him in
high-heeled shoes and I thought `why doesn't she just stay at
home?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I realize that I was jealous because she had
more dresses than the average Russian woman. She was trying to be a
real First Lady. But I think she was badly advised. Someone should
have told her to wear the same outfit more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Once her husband was out of power, Raisa avoided the limelight.
In 1996, she sold the extensive wardrobe that had attracted so much
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   She devoted her time to fund-raising for cancer care and
research. Before she knew she had leukemia herself, she was helping
other victims.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Russians came to love her and why many will shed
tears when Raisa flies home for the last time. &QL;

   Is this the year of the earthquake? After the devastating quakes
in Turkey and then Greece in two months, one might think the
latest, its epicenter less than 100 miles from the capital of
Taiwan, marks a worrying trend.
</P>
<P>
   But geologists say there is no direct connection between the
three disasters; they are simply part of the continual commotion in
the Earth's crust, as the massive tectonic plates floating on the
molten mantle _ the continents and the ocean floors _ move and
grind into each other, sometimes sliding under or over.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the latest quake, measuring 7.6 on the Richter
scale, is not unusual. There are scores above magnitude 7.0 every
year, and four or five above 7.5.
</P>
<P>
   But most happen far from population centers, and deep
underground. The one in Taiwan is devastating because it is
comparatively near the surface, only 33 km (20 miles) down, rather
than 600 km, as is more common in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might seem there are more earthquakes,'' said Alice Walker
of the British Geological Survey. ``But last year there were two
big ones _ the first in Afghanistan which killed 4,000 people, and
one which caused a tidal wave that killed 6,000 people in Papua New
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that the latest ones have happened in the past two
months; and Turkey and Greece are vacation destinations, which
makes people here more interested in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan lies where the edge of the (comparatively small)
Philippine plate abuts the larger Eurasian plate, which contains a
huge expanse including the United Kingdom, Europe, Russia and
China. Slowly, the Philippine plate is being forced under the
Eurasian plate.
</P>
<P>
   The last large tremor to hit the island, on Nov. 14, 1986,
measured 7.5, but it happened hundreds of miles out to sea. The
death toll was 15. &QL;

<P>
   Why is there a little bit of East Timor surrounded by West
Timor?
</P>
<P>
   The small triangle of land, folded into the north coast of
Indonesian West Timor, is the enclave of Oecussi, and its continued
existence as part of East Timor is the result of a historical
accident.
</P>
<P>
   When Portuguese and Dutch traders first visited the island of
Timor in the early sixteenth century, they had separate spheres of
influence. The situation became even more complicated with the rise
of the Topasses, a class of mixed blood Portuguese-Timorese who
seized control of much of the island, often at the expense of the
Portuguese themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1701, a governor newly arrived from Lisbon was forced by the
Topasses to relocate his capital to the port of Lifau, which later
became known as Oecussi. When the two European power formally
partitioned the island between them in the 19th century, it
remained part of the Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   Oecussi has always been the part of East Timor most susceptible
to the influence of the West.
</P>
<P>
   During the period of Indonesian infiltration leading up to the
invasion of 1975, it quickly came under the control of Jakarta.
Throughout the 24-year war, the guerrilla army Falintil had
virtually no presence there.
</P>
<P>
   Many suspect that the recent violence and ethnic cleansing
inflicted on Timor is an attempt to justify the partitioning off of
some of the East's provinces. If this turns out to be the case,
then Oecussi _ surrounded by Indonesia and with no independent land
route to Dili will be especially vulnerable. &QL;

 By IMRE KARACS  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ At a disused listening station in the Berlin woods,
aging Cold Warriors fought possibly the final battle of the
conflict, and this time the Commies won.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited on a recent weekend, spies from East and West poured
scorn on their rivals, trumpeted their double agents, and pitted
their intelligence against the other side.
</P>
<P>
   More than pride was at stake. The convention, organized in West
Berlin by the CIA and its affiliates, had set out to prove Western
superiority in this, as in all other, domains.
</P>
<P>
   Agents of the CIA, KGB, MI5 and other related organizations were
brought together for a discussion about the intelligence war in
Berlin before the Wall was built.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA called that era its ``Golden Times,'' years when its
agents roamed East Berlin unhindered, mining the rich seam of
Communist secrets. They had no equal, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're sitting here points to which side had the
most developed spy network,'' crowed Burton Gerber, former CIA
station chief.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber and his colleagues cited their triumph during the
blockade, the tank confrontation in the autumn of 1961, and other
episodes in which only Western intelligence averted a global war.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians listened for a while to all this triumphant talk,
and then retaliated with a barrage of boasts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of deception and disinformation, we were the best,''
declared Oleg Kalugin, former head of KGB Counter-Intelligence.
``No one could lie the way we did. The British came close, but we
were better.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went on for two and a half days, punctuated with meal
breaks _ smoked salmon and Riesling _ a bus tour of Berlin's spooky
sites and a trip to the Allied Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Snug behind the electric gates and barbed wire of the
Teufelsberg listening station, the participants were in their
element, merrily swapping anecdotes about past misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   In the glare of television lights at the museum, they seemed out
of sorts, insecure, the bonhomie suddenly gone. This is where
Kalugin, former Major General of the Evil Empire, decided to strike
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years after the CIA's launch, with the help,
incidentally, of our very own Kim Philby, the CIA had no agent in
the USSR worth mentioning,'' he said. ``At that time, there were
Soviet agents at every federal agency in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   For every spy the West could boast of, the Soviets had dozens.
Berlin, the hub of operations for both sides, was saturated with
Soviet spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ordained priests of the Russian Orthodox church in
Berlin was a colonel in the KGB,'' Kalugin said. ``He was very
good. He did a beautiful service.''
</P>
<P>
   No Stasi agents were present at the convention; a glaring
omission the Russians could not help remarking upon.
</P>
<P>
   East German spies were among the best, Kalugin said. ``You
should pay tribute to the organization which was the real pride of
the intelligence community,'' the former KGB officer urged his
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   They did not feel inclined to take up the invitation, just as
they were in no mood to applaud other exploits of the enemy. The
Cold War has long been over, yet red spies are still causing red
faces in the Western intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, the first great reunion of the second
oldest profession took place in the shadow of events unfolding in
Bexleyheath, England.
</P>
<P>
   As the revelation of Britain's latest double-agent drama grabbed
headlines, ``Hola,'' the latest KGB disciple, was mentioned by no
one at Teufelsberg, except Kalugin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of this lady before,'' he said. ``But I knew
from some sources that there was a lady involved in atomic
espionage,'' he told the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin, former controller of the British traitor George Blake,
thought dozens more KGB agents were still living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that generation works any more, because the game has
moved on. East still spies on the West and vice versa, but
technology is taking over the agents' work, and increasingly, their
sights are shifting to industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   With that happy thought, the class of 1961 dispersed and
returned to their desks and sinecures.
</P>
<P>
   Old CIA war-horses gallop through the U.S. chat shows, Stasi
agents live on West German pensions, and the KGB have taken up
private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin, whose calling card with a Washington address describes
him as an ``International Consultant,'' helps to design CD-ROM
spying games. &QL;

MANY MORE WAYS TO SAVE HEAT BUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Second of two articles on insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Insulate, insulate, insulate! Insulating your walls, floor,
ceiling, and anywhere else in the house is the way to save on all
those fuel bills, both in heating and cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but . . .: there is more to saving heat than insulating.
Insulation is good, but it needs help in its work of saving heating
and cooling bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Before we get tangled up in words like heating, cooling, hot and
cold, and heating and/or cooling, let's just refer to saving heat,
although all the things done to save heat in winter also save cool
in summer.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that helps insulation do its work is a vapor barrier,
which in the right position will stop the passage of air (and heat)
from indoors to outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to help insulation do its work is to caulk
everything in sight; well, nearly everything. It is amazing how
many chinks and cracks and holes and nooks and crannies there are
in an old house, all losing precious heat.
</P>
<P>
   And look after your windows and doors: New or old, they must be
as tight as possible. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The essential vapor barrier &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the main rule concerning a vapor barrier is that
it should face the heated space of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The paper backing of most fiberglass insulation is a vapor
barrier, and should be used wherever possible: on an attic floor
and on a cellar ceiling, to mention two critical places.
</P>
<P>
   Polyethylene plastic is also an effective vapor barrier, used
when the paper is not available, and sometimes in conjunction with
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but . . . (here we go again!): Isn't it possible to
overinsulate a house, and isn't adding all those vapor barriers
making the house too tight, resulting in buildup of indoor water
vapor and other pollutants?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. An old house, even a new one, cannot be
overinsulated, and it is impossible to seal up an old house with
vapor barriers enough to cause a pollution problem. There are just
too many holes in an old house. You can't see them, but they are
there, losing air to the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Only by rebuilding a house from the ground up or building a new
one, using an unbroken vapor barrier that covers all areas, can you
tighten it enough to cause a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days of rehabbing and insulating an existing
house, contractors would not put a vapor barrier on the attic floor
because they mistakenly thought this would prevent the escape of
water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   As noted, this was a mistake, long since corrected. So, a vapor
barrier should go in all possible places.
</P>
<P>
   What about the walls? You can blow insulation in the wall
cavity, but you cannot install a vapor barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you cannot do it the old-fashioned way (attached to the
insulation), but you can do it another way; in fact, you may
already have a vapor barrier on the walls and ceilings of your old
house.
</P>
<P>
   Vinyl-coated wallpaper, Wall-Tex type wallpaper (a vinyl-coated
canvas), and many wall and ceiling paints are vapor barriers,
either complete or partial.
</P>
<P>
   So, there is really little else you have to worry about
concerning vapor barriers. It is not worth the energy expended. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Caulk up a storm &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you can expend your energy on other things, and have
fun doing it, more or less. And that is to caulk up a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a cartridge of good, flexible caulking compound in a
hardware or building supply store, buy a gun to hold the cartridge
and start caulking. Call yourself the caulker stalker. If you
bought only one cartridge, you will run out mighty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Start caulking outdoors: Caulk all obvious openings, stray holes
or joints, or seams. Caulk where wires and pipes enter the house or
the foundation. Caulk the bottom of windows, just under the outside
sill. Do not caulk the sides of the outside window casing, where
the frame meets siding.
</P>
<P>
   The reason you don't caulk old windows along their vertical
sides is this: The casing is nailed to the sheathing, usually with
a strip of tarpaper under it. This arrangement allows any water
that gets behind the casing to run down behind it, and out at the
bottom, away from harm's way. Does water actually run down behind
the casing when it is securely nailed to the sheathing? Yes,
indeed. And, the tarpaper acts as a water shed. It sounds weird,
but it works.
</P>
<P>
   If you caulked the sides of the casing on the outside, you could
trap water behind the casing, causing decay. It sure has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Caulk around pipes and wires that enter the house. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Caulk indoors, too &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indoors, you can caulk every opening you see, if you can get
away with it. You can even caulk the inside casing; a thin bead of
white caulking will not show at the top of the casing, and a neat
strip along the sides will not only not show much, but will be
covered by curtains or draperies.
</P>
<P>
   Getting She Who Must Be Obeyed to cooperate or accept these
rather bizarre things you are doing is not the easiest thing, but
with tact, humor, tact, love and gentleness, plus more tact, you
can do it. And that goes for He Who Must Be Obeyed, too.
</P>
<P>
   During the energy crisis of 25 (whew!) years ago, companies
produced a strippable caulking just for this purpose. They stopped
making it when the energy crisis allegedly ended. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Windows . . . &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consider windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
   If your old, single-glazed windows are tight, well
weatherstripped, and with high-quality, airtight storm windows,
there is little else you have to do _ can do, in fact _ except
perhaps put in inside storms, which provide triple glazing and an
extra measure of insulating value.
</P>
<P>
   If your windows are loose, drafty, and rattling, you can tighten
them by weatherstripping them. The best weatherstripping for old
wood windows is spring bronze, a metal strip that is inserted
between window and jamb. It is virtually invisible and will last
for decades. It not only tightens a window, but stops the escape of
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Spring bronze may be hard to find, in the wake of the invention
of vinyl stripping, which is good but not as good as spring bronze.
</P>
<P>
   If your windows are intact and tight, with a good storm window,
they do not need replacing.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend your hard-earned money on a lot better things than
replacement windows. &QL; 
 &QL; 
. . . and doors &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for doors. Vendors talk about insulated doors as
saving a lot on heating bills, but ignore the fact that your front
and back doors make up less than 1 1/2 percent of wall area of a
two-story house, less than 3 percent of the wall area of a
one-story house.
</P>
<P>
   Do the math, and if you have a weatherstripped wood door and a
storm door, forget about a new door.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ At a disused listening station in the Berlin woods,
aging Cold Warriors fought possibly the final battle of the
conflict, and this time the Commies won.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited on a recent weekend, spies from East and West poured
scorn on their rivals, trumpeted their double agents, and pitted
their intelligence against the other side.
</P>
<P>
   More than pride was at stake. The convention, organized in West
Berlin by the CIA and its affiliates, had set out to prove Western
superiority in this, as in all other, domains.
</P>
<P>
   Agents of the CIA, KGB, MI5 and other related organizations were
brought together for a discussion about the intelligence war in
Berlin before the Wall was built.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA called that era its ``Golden Times,'' years when its
agents roamed East Berlin unhindered, mining the rich seam of
Communist secrets. They had no equal, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're sitting here points to which side had the
most developed spy network,'' crowed Burton Gerber, former CIA
station chief.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber and his colleagues cited their triumph during the
blockade, the tank confrontation in the autumn of 1961, and other
episodes in which only Western intelligence averted a global war.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians listened for a while to all this triumphant talk,
and then retaliated with a barrage of boasts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of deception and disinformation, we were the best,''
declared Oleg Kalugin, former head of KGB Counter-Intelligence.
``No one could lie the way we did. The British came close, but we
were better.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went on for two and a half days, punctuated with meal
breaks _ smoked salmon and Riesling _ a bus tour of Berlin's spooky
sites and a trip to the Allied Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Snug behind the electric gates and barbed wire of the
Teufelsberg listening station, the participants were in their
element, merrily swapping anecdotes about past misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   In the glare of television lights at the museum, they seemed out
of sorts, insecure, the bonhomie suddenly gone. This is where
Kalugin, former Major General of the Evil Empire, decided to strike
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years after the CIA's launch, with the help,
incidentally, of our very own Kim Philby, the CIA had no agent in
the USSR worth mentioning,'' he said. ``At that time, there were
Soviet agents at every federal agency in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   For every spy the West could boast of, the Soviets had dozens.
Berlin, the hub of operations for both sides, was saturated with
Soviet spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ordained priests of the Russian Orthodox church in
Berlin was a colonel in the KGB,'' Kalugin said. ``He was very
good. He did a beautiful service.''
</P>
<P>
   No Stasi agents were present at the convention; a glaring
omission the Russians could not help remarking upon.
</P>
<P>
   East German spies were among the best, Kalugin said. ``You
should pay tribute to the organization which was the real pride of
the intelligence community,'' the former KGB officer urged his
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   They did not feel inclined to take up the invitation, just as
they were in no mood to applaud other exploits of the enemy. The
Cold War has long been over, yet red spies are still causing red
faces in the Western intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, the first great reunion of the second
oldest profession took place in the shadow of events unfolding in
Bexleyheath, England.
</P>
<P>
   As the revelation of Britain's latest double-agent drama grabbed
headlines, ``Hola,'' the latest KGB disciple, was mentioned by no
one at Teufelsberg, except Kalugin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of this lady before,'' he said. ``But I knew
from some sources that there was a lady involved in atomic
espionage,'' he told the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin, former controller of the British traitor George Blake,
thought dozens more KGB agents were still living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that generation works any more, because the game has
moved on. East still spies on the West and vice versa, but
technology is taking over the agents' work, and increasingly, their
sights are shifting to industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   With that happy thought, the class of 1961 dispersed and
returned to their desks and sinecures.
</P>
<P>
   Old CIA war-horses gallop through the U.S. chat shows, Stasi
agents live on West German pensions, and the KGB have taken up
private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin, whose calling card with a Washington address describes
him as an ``International Consultant,'' helps to design CD-ROM
spying games. &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ When Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide on April
20, 1945, a little ceremony was held at the Fuhrerbunker.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated at last from the tyrannical house rules, the residents
lit up. Then they poured gasoline on the corpses and set fire to
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even by his own overblown standards, Hitler's fanatical hatred
of smoking was extraordinary. Eva Braun, Josef Goebbels and the
other unfortunate addicts who shared a roof with the Fuhrer in the
last days of the war had to sneak out into the smoldering ruins of
Berlin for a few furtive drags. Braun covered up her guilty secret
by chewing on mints.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, this historic first smoking ban at a
public place seems enlightened, at least from an American
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   And now a scholar from the U.S. has assembled compelling
evidence to prove that, largely because of Hitler's obsession, not
only the bunker but wartime Germany as a whole was at least 20
years ahead of the rest of the world in nailing tobacco down as the
cause of lung cancer, and in attempts to curb the filthy habit.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this discovery are enormous. Millions of
people puffed on after the war, oblivious to the dangers. On proper
medical advice, some might well have given up smoking and lived a
good few years longer.
</P>
<P>
   A reappraisal of German medical science is also in order. The
diabolical experiments of Robert Mengele and his ilk debased the
work of an entire generation of German scientists.
</P>
<P>
   It has been generally assumed that no worthwhile work was
carried out by biologists of the Third Reich, so tainted they all
were by their search for racial purity and related pseudo-science
projects. Rockets, the Nazis could build, but curing human ailments
was not their forte.
</P>
<P>
   The American historian Robert Proctor, author of the book ``The
Nazi War on Cancer,'' explodes that myth, only to raise further
unanswered questions: How did the knowledge gathered in the Third
Reich get lost, and why did it take the medical establishments in
Britain two decades and in the U.S. even longer to rediscover it?
Or did they know it all along?
</P>
<P>
   First, the evidence. It all goes back to the day Adolf Hitler
chucked his last packet of cigarettes into the Danube. Smoking, he
decided, was bad for him, and therefore bad for Germans. Tobacco
was one of the first things he would try to wipe off the face of
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of posters proclaiming nicotine as ``poison for the
Aryan race'' were printed. Measures were promulgated, restricting
the sale of cigarettes to women, cutting soldiers' rations on the
Eastern Front, and banning smoking from cars, trains and buildings.
The Hitler Jugend were drafted in to spread the message with their
inimitable subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, money was poured into research. A link between
rising consumption of alcohol and tobacco and the incidence of
stomach and lung cancers had long been suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The first breakthrough came in 1939, when a PhD student at
Cologne University demonstrated for the first time a connection
between smoking and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 Hitler helped set up the ``Institute for the Struggle
Against the Dangers of Tobacco'' at Jena with 100,000 Reichsmarks
from his own budget.
</P>
<P>
   A year later the Jena scientists came up with the goods. Two
researchers named Eberhard Schairer and Erich Schoniger had carried
out a statistical analysis of the correlation between tobacco and
lung cancer, using a group of smokers as well as a control group.
</P>
<P>
   Their study, described by Professor Proctor as the ``crown jewel
of 20th century epidemiology,'' established that smokers ran an
increased risk of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To put this finding into perspective, Britain's Medical Research
Council claims to have been the ``first national institution in the
world to accept formally the evidence that tobacco is a major cause
of death.'' The MRC took that leap of faith in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Germany did not just investigate, it acted on its findings. As
early as 1939, the Nazis convened a congress on the dangers of
tobacco, attended by 15,000 scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, Hermann Goring forbade soldiers from smoking
on marches, in the streets or patrols. Cigarettes could not be sold
to women; drivers faced lawsuits for criminal negligence if found
smoking behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Research continued, with mixed success. Hitler was convinced of
tobacco's lingering genetic effects. But scientists did not dare to
report the results of their fertility studies which showed that
nicotine was, if anything, making laboratory rats more randy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of German life sciences. much of the tobacco
research was motivated by the Nazis' preoccupation with ``racial
hygene,'' and inevitably ended up in blind alleys. Stomach cancer
also drew a blank.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of their research has stood the test of time. ``If
it hadn't been for the war and the fact that this research had
ideological grounding, the Jena study would be considered a classic
early epidemiological work,'' says Professor George Davey-Smith of
Bristol University, who was the first to unearth this piece of the
jigsaw. ``I think it was underestimated.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   What a pity it all got lost. Or did it? German in those days was
the language of science, its scholars well enough respected _
prejudices and distaste notwithstanding _ to elicit academic
curiosity among their competitors elsewhere in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Their work was published by reputable journals. Even Mengele's
disgusting research on human guinea pigs in Auschwitz and the
inquiries German scientists were conducting at Buchenwald appeared
in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary what was in the medical journals of the
time,'' says Professor Paul Weindlings of Oxford Brookes
University, a leading expert on Nazi eugenics research. ``And the
British and Americans would just read them.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not own up to it, of course. The international
scientific community did not want to get mixed up with the
unethical work of German colleagues, and therefore created the myth
that all German medical science had been paralyzed by primitive
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that there were some really mad scientists
involved, but on the other hand you have to look at the people who
used the opportunities available to do very advanced work,'' says
Professor Doris Kaufmann.
</P>
<P>
   The German historian leads a group in Berlin which is going
through the archives of Germany's elite research institutes. What
they have discovered so far is that many scientists employed on
Goring's human projects were considered good enough to be given
jobs in the United States after the war. &QL;

<P>
   Japan's biggest cigarette manufacturer has ignited a row over a
plan to donate millions of free cigarettes to thousands of nursing
homes around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Tobacco says the gift is its effort to mark the country's
national ``Respect for the Aged'' day.
</P>
<P>
   But the outraged Japanese anti-smoking lobby has accused the
company of plotting to kill millions of elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is practically telling people to hurry up and die,'' said
Bungaku Watanabe, head of the Tobacco Problems Information Center.
``It is almost the same as pushing them in front of a train.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Japan Tobacco, a former state monopoly, said
their ``contribution to society'' was a way ``to give something
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The company still enjoys the sole right to produce tobacco in
Japan and has an 80 percent share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigners lodged official protests saying the gift is a clear
breach of the spirit of the day, which is supposed to pay homage to
``the longevity of the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoking costs Japan more than 4 trillion yen a year in
smoking-related diseases and premature death. &QL;

TURN DOWN THE VOLUME ON `THIRD WATCH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching ``Third Watch'' makes you want to holler.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest effort from John Wells, the man behind
``ER.'' Once that show took off, NBC rewarded him with millions of
dollars and locked him in for future shows. He delivered
``Trinity'' to the network last season, notable as the drama about
an Irish family that tried to pack as many cliches into one hour as
humanly possible.
</P>
<P>
   It thunked to the ground rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's ``Third Watch,'' which had its season premiere
Thursday night. Typical to Wells and his kitchen-sink philosophy of
which more is not enough, the premise of the show is that we get to
follow three action-packed teams _ cops, firefighters and
paramedics. But, of course, that's not enough. We have to watch
those on the third watch, the late shift, on which more danger will
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, more yelling happens. There's a whole lot of hollerin'
in ``Third Watch,'' which becomes painfully comic after about eight
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's stopped breathing!'' is one ear-piercer. Which is
followed by: ``Half his head is gone!'' Quickly trumped several
octaves higher by, ``There's a kid in here!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Wells, wishing to capitalize on the ``ER'' yelling
(which will sound as though it's filmed in a library after this
show), has it in his head that volume equals drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need those IVs!'' Wrong. This show needs those IVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch'' clearly went for the triple dose of testosterone
because cops are played out as a genre, firefighters are unproven
as a show unto themselves (and expensive), and The WB tried and
failed to make paramedics a hit. Why not combine all three? Triple
your yelling options.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, we merely get three times as many cliches as we'd
get in a show about one public-safety team.
</P>
<P>
   If the yelling doesn't keep you awake, the shootings, accidents,
fires, car chases, foot chases and babies being tossed out of
windows ought to do it. Wells quickly is proving he's incapable of
repeating his successes.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the midst of all this obviously bad material, you
can tell he's trying to do his homework. He's at least stumbled
upon two of the legends of police and fire work.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, he shows us what a ``waffle'' is. When a
belligerent, awful suspect is handcuffed in the back seat, yelling
and/or spitting, you speed up and break violently for a nonexistent
dog, thus propelling the suspect's face into the steel waffle grate
separating the front and back seats. And, for firemen, having the
car parked next to the hydrant so firefighters smash out the
passenger and driver windows, running a hose through the center of
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, maybe because those are so well-known,
Wells really didn't do his homework.

 KEVIN SPACEY SHINES IN `AMERICAN BEAUTY' xxx  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No film of the fall season has created a bigger advance stir
than ``American Beauty,'' and, for once, the product lives up to
its buzz. The film is a dynamite comedy-drama that, unless it
stiffs big-time at the box office, should be up for multi-Oscar
nominations come February.
</P>
<P>
   It's so daring and original that it's impossible to predict how
it will do commercially. On the surface, it's such an
uncompromisingly bleak look at the hollowness of the American Dream
that audiences may just turn off to it en masse.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also genuinely hilarious, directed with a breathtaking
flair (by stage director Sam Mendes), and fueled by a
career-defining performance by Kevin Spacey. It also rises above
its darkness to make an affirmation of life that's so exquisite
it's hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a screenplay by Alan Ball (TV's ``Cybill'') and set in
some unidentified American suburb, it's the story of Lester
Burnham, a 42-year-old hack writer for a media magazine whose
14-year career has left him empty, bored and increasingly
self-destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the passion is completely gone from his marriage to
Caroline (Annette Bening), his equally dissatisfied but very
shallow, real-estate salesperson wife. And his rebellious, teenage
daughter, Janie (Thora Birch), hates his guts.
</P>
<P>
   One night Lester meets his daughter's Lolita of a best friend,
Angela (Mena Suvari), and he snaps: he not only goes as gaw-gaw as
Humbert Humbert, the emotion makes him see how wasted his life has
become, and sparks a personal rebellion that soon takes over every
aspect of his existence.
</P>
<P>
   While Lester is pumping up, returning to his '70s youth, and
burning his bridges left and right, the movie is also following
Caroline's frustrations and affair with another Realtor (Peter
Gallagher) and Janie's romance with the spooky, drug-dealing,
boy-next-door (Wes Bentley).
</P>
<P>
   Giving the film its tension is that we know exactly where's it's
leading. In the opening scene, Lester's voice tells us he's going
to be killed. Like ``Sunset Boulevard,'' the film is narrated by a
corpse, and the movie is a grand tragedy in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' has a few weaknesses _ Bening, for one.
Normally the best thing of any film she happens to grace, her
performance somehow never quite finds the believable human core
that ultimately shines through the caricatures of all the other
characters.
</P>
<P>
   But it's primarily Spacey's movie, and he's never been better.
His cynicism, his humanity, and the nobility of his rebellion is so
appealing and charismatic it seems to crystallize him as a star, in
the same way ``Casablanca'' crystallizes Bogart. (And Spacey is, I
think, laying claim here to being the Bogart of our time.)
</P>
<P>
   England's Mendes (Broadway's ``Cabaret'') makes one of most
impressive feature film debuts in recent memory, trusting his
script (which was reportedly shot exactly as written in Ball's
first draft), finding just the right surrealistic edge to his
visuals, and staying anchored just a tad below the level of farce.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, his film communicates the script's wonderful
transcendent vision. Its hero's insistence on seeing beauty in all
aspects of life (the title is not ironic) comes through with a
resounding impact, and lingers long after the movie is over to give
the audience a most unexpected parting gift: an emotional high.
</P>

TEN ESSENTIAL KEVIN SPACEY FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey has had a long and prolific career as a supporting
actor, and even won an Oscar in that category in 1995. But, though
he's been edging toward leading man status in his last few films,
he's never been considered a bankable star.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' however, is the movie that should finally
push him over the line _ and is likely to be the clear dividing
line of his career. Here are 10 essential Spacey movies leading up
to this watershed, all available on video:
</P>
<P>
   Long Day's Journey Into Night (1988) _ The first time Spacey
received notice as an actor in a filmed role was in this taped
version of the Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's play about a
deteriorating Southern family.
</P>
<P>
   Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) _ In David Mamet's adaptation of his
own Tony Award-winning play, Spacey plays one of the seven sleazy
real-estate salesmen struggling to retain their soul-devouring
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Consenting Adults (1992) _ In this Alan Pakula-directed sex
thriller, Spacey is the wife-swapping neighbor who leads an
innocent married couple (Kevin Kline and Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio) astray.
</P>
<P>
   Iron Will (1993) _ Spacey is surprisingly memorable as
opportunistic, pre-World War I journalist following a grueling
Winnipeg-to-St. Paul dog-sled race in this underrated Disney
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming With Sharks (1994) _ This low-budget American Indie
gave Spacey his most riveting, pre-``American Beauty'' leading role
as a monstrously abusive Hollywood studio executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Usual Suspects (1995) _ Spacey won his supporting actor
Oscar for his portrayal of the most enigmatic member of a group of
criminals trying to sort out a puzzle in this pretentious gangster
saga.
</P>
<P>
   A Time to Kill (1996) _ Spacey followed up his Oscar win with
his portrayal of a ruthless Southern prosecuting attorney in this
effective film version of John Grisham's first legal thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997) _ Spacey plays a
gay Savannah aristocrat who shoots his live-in lover in this
overlong Clint Eastwood-directed film version of John Berendt's
novel.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Confidential (1997) _ Spacey won the British Academy Award
for his his performance as a slick '50s police sergeant who serves
as an advisor for a ``Dragnet''-like television show in this
neo-film noir hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator (1998) _ In this entertaining thriller, Spacey
plays a famed police negotiator trying to psych out a renegade cop
(Samuel L. Jackson) who is himself a famed police negotiator.

OFTEN OVERLOOKED, ACTOR'S BEEFED-UP HOLLYWOOD CAREER IS RED-HOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one wants to talk to Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1994 at one of those press soirees for Disney's
dog-sledding movie ``Iron Will.'' When Spacey arrives at a table,
the seven or so journalists seated there start leafing through
press kits and turning off their tape recorders to save the
batteries for a chat with the film's young star, Mackenzie Astin.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey isn't bothered by their lack of interest, exhibiting a
casual manner, a cutting wit and an infectious charm.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Spacey has a string of unforgettable
performances under his belt and a successful revival, ``The Iceman
Cometh,'' on Broadway. Oh, yeah, and there's that Best Supporting
Actor Oscar on his mantel for his work in ``The Usual Suspects.''
Now it looks as if he may be gearing up for a Best Actor award for
his stunning work in ``American Beauty,'' opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (I wonder what Astin's doing?)
</P>
<P>
   It would be understandable if Spacey longed for the days when
people weren't that interested in talking to him. Celebrity brings
with it an overstuffed cargo hold worth of baggage. Consider his
recent fracas with Esquire magazine when it intimated that Spacey
might be gay. But just as he was unfazed by the lack of media
interest in him five years ago, he seems unshaken by the feverish
obsession with his private life now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure that there's no reason for these things to change me
and the way that I think,'' Spacey says. ``I just continue to try
to move forward and do things that are different, and all the stuff
that's on the exterior, on the periphery, that's where it is and
that's where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's where it will remain for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Burnham, Spacey's character in ``American Beauty,'' knows
something about life on the periphery. He's lived there for most of
his unremarkable life, which, we learn at the beginning of the
film, has already ended. Ignored by his real-estate agent wife
(Annette Bening), loathed by his sullen teen-age daughter (Thora
Birch) and on the list for downsizing at his grating magazine job,
Lester is about to hit the middle-age doldrums at full speed.
(Apropos considering Spacey turned 40 in July.)
</P>
<P>
   But his unexpected obsession with his daughter's vampy
schoolmate (Mena Suvari) brings about a gradual transformation in
Lester _ he grows a spine. He learns the joys of being selfish.
Spacey described it as ``one of the most challenging roles that I'd
ever come across.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to play a character that is not 10 steps ahead of
everybody else was a great shift for me in the terms of the kind of
roles I've done in the past,'' Spacey says. ``We never wanted an
audience to see Lester suddenly change in a scene, but for there to
be a very organic growth and evolution into this sort of new
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is not only spiritual, but physical as well. Spacey
had to go through intense training to beef up when Lester begins
working out to impress the object of his obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical training is you just do it every day, and half
the battle of that is just showing up and having a good trainer and
eating nutritionally. So there's a certain physical liberation in
that I hadn't played a role in a film that required quite so much
physical work,'' he says. ``But I think the harder aspects of it
are the emotional and spiritual changes that Lester goes through
and how to gauge those, and how to try to properly play those
scenes that were bordering on the outrageous _ because it's
terribly, terribly funny ... until it's just not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey succeeds in exploring new ground, but frankly, this is
uncharted territory for Hollywood. Faint comparisons with films
like Ang Lee's ``The Ice Storm'' and Todd Solundz's ``Happiness''
may come up, but more than anything, ``Beauty'' is an American
original.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try very hard not to be in the game of comparing things to
other things,'' Spacey says. ``We live in this world where
something can't live on its own, and I think that this movie lives
on its own. It's not an easy film to talk about, but most films
that are complex and challenging aren't easy films to describe.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the more unusual aspects of the film that have sparked a
new response among preview audiences around the country:
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things people are experiencing and questioning and
asking are dealt with in this film in a way that isn't catering to
or trying to make anyone like it _ people do the wrong things, they
say the wrong things, and yet it's quite honest,'' Spacey says. ``I
think that we're finding that there are great discussions
happening, and people are staying like an hour afterwards to talk
about it and its effect on them.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   THE ESSENTIAL SPACEY
</P>
<P>
   ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992): His uncaring sales manager sells
out his staff in the name of ``just following orders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ref'' (1993): It's not such a wonderful life for Spacey
and Judy Davis, a backbiting couple kidnapped by cat burglar Denis
Leary on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swimming With Sharks'' (1994): His repellent movie producer
who torments assistant Frank Whaley makes your boss seem like a
peach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Usual Suspects'': There's a secret reason why his
performance here earned him an Oscar. Find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven'' (1995): As a serial killer obsessed with deadly sins,
Spacey is one cool, creepy customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997): Spacey's
erudite New Orleans closet case accused of murder was largely
responsible for folks questioning his own sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Confidential'' (1997): His corrupt cop shines in a film
filled with Oscar-worthy performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' (1998): Spacey's wicked grasshopper is the
baddest bug in the whole dang town.

GOVERNOR VETOES MEASURE AGAINST SUPERSTORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis has vetoed a measure that
would have effectively banned any new Wal-Mart, Super Kmart or
other megastore in California, a bill drawn up in the final hours
of the legislative session by pro-union lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Without a single committee hearing and limited debate in the
state Senate and Assembly, the Legislature wrote and passed the
bill earlier this month to ban the superstores.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning, according to lawmakers who supported it, was the
stores do not provide enough tax revenue to communities, crush
smaller grocery stores and put an unfair burden on government
services.
</P>
<P>
   While the bill was seen as a favor for grocery store employee
unions _ Costco, Kmart and Wal-Mart are not unionized _ the
governor said the timing of the bill bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process by which it is coming to my desk (was)
deplorable,'' Davis said Wednesday. ``When you make major public
policy changes, they should be subject to public scrutiny and have
the benefit of policy committee hearings in both houses.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have banned local governments from approving new
retail stores with more than 100,000 square feet and more than
15,000 square feet used for the sale of nontaxable merchandise such
as groceries and prescription drugs. The chief targets were said to
be Costco, which has 88 stores in California, and Wal-Mart, which
operates 110.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sent a panic through the industry. In recent weeks,
Costco paid for full-page ads in newspapers urging Davis to veto
the bill and hung huge banners in its stores asking shoppers to
urge the governor to veto the measure. Kmart also rallied chambers
of commerce around the state in its bid to persuade Davis to veto
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was written by Assemblyman Dick Floyd, D-Wilmington,
and Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, both
strong union supporters. The measure also was supported by Senate
President pro tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, who helped push it
through in the final hours of the 1999 session, which ended three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Davis did not close the door on the idea for the bill, however,
and indicated in his veto statement that he was signing a related
measure that deals with the issue of large retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   That bill prohibits local governments from offering financial
incentives to large retail stores or auto dealers relocating from
one jurisdiction to another in the same market area, unless the
receiving local government offers a share of some of the resulting
sales tax revenue to the jurisdiction losing the retail outlet.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest supporter of the measure that Davis rejected was a
coalition of unions that represent workers at grocery stores,
including Safeway, Vons, Pavilions, Food 4 Less and Ralphs
supermarkets, all of which are feeling a pinch from the huge retail
outlets like Wal-Mart that often include pharmacies and
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Joint Labor Management Committee,
representing many of the grocery store unions, called Davis' veto
unfortunate and said the measure fell victim to the way it was
passed rather than being judged by its merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is very unfortunate that the legislative process
distracted from the merits of the policy and concerns which this
bill addresses,'' said Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Joint
Labor Management Committee. ``We had hoped that the governor would
put politics aside in considering an important issue which cities
are struggling with in growing numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart spokeswoman Cynthia Lin gave much of the credit for the
veto to shoppers throughout California who signed petitions that
were delivered to the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers may not have been given the opportunity to voice
their opposition to the bill before the vote, but they delivered a
very loud and clear message afterward,'' Lin said. ``This bill
would have stifled competition in the retail industry and the end
result would have been higher prices for California consumers.''

OK THRILLED `DOUBLE JEOPARDY' SUFFERS FROM CREDIBILITY GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The obvious idea behind ``Double Jeopardy'' was to make a female
version of ``The Fugitive,'' with a much-maligned and profoundly
innocent victim-heroine on-the-run (Ashley Judd), a series of
clever stunts and Tommy Lee Jones slogging along in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   It more or less works as a fast-paced thriller, but it's not
nearly as much fun as its model, it's loaded down with credibility
problems and there's a heavy-handedness about it that's surprising,
considering it was directed by Bruce Beresford (``Driving Miss
Daisy'').
</P>
<P>
   Judd plays Libby Parsons, who sails off one day on her yacht
with her wealthy Seattle businessman husband (Bruce Greenwood),
only to wake up the next morning covered with blood and surrounded
by evidence that she sliced her hubby up and tossed his body
overboard.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, he's declared legally dead, and she's railroaded
into prison, where she discovers, via a phone call to her former
best friend, that the husband is alive and well and living in San
Francisco with the insurance money that went to their young son.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, no one will believe her, and she has no choice
but to do her five years or so of hard time, knowing that she can
kill the jerk when she gets out, because she can't be convinced
twice for the same crime _ hence the title.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like I'm giving the movie away, be assured all this
(and more) is in the preview, and it's really only an excuse to get
Judd on the run, so Tommy Lee Jones _ her Seattle parole officer _
can start chasing her around the country as she tries to find the
husband no one believes exists.
</P>
<P>
   As it cranks into gear, Judd is appealing, Greenwood makes a
marvelously hissable villain, and the movie has a couple of good
car chases, one terrific stunt (Judd driving a car right off a
state ferry), and a scene of show-stopping creepiness in which Judd
wakes up inside a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   But every other scene rings false or preposterous, and the
script doesn't even bother to explain how the beautiful fugitive is
able to so easily pop up in the film's various far-flung locations
_ or, for that matter, how Jones is able to stay on her trail.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other films set in Seattle but actually filmed in
Vancouver, ``Double Jeopardy'' also has a built-in credibility
problem with local movie consumers: Its fake Seattle and Whidbey
Island scenes don't look a bit like the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Double Jeopardy. Directed by Bruce Beresford. Written by David
Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook. Cast: Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones,
Bruce Greenwood, Annabeth Gish. 112 minutes. Rated R for violence.

   1. SOME PEOPLE PARALYZED WITH SPINAL CORD INJURIES
</P>
<P>
   ARE GAINING MOBILITY New studies on the human spinal cord
demonstrate that far from being a passive conduit ferrying
information to and from the brain, or a repository of unchanging
reflexes, it has its own contribution to make. Spinal cord neurons,
researchers are finding, are capable of learning in simple ways and
show changes in response to environmental cues that many
investigators interpret as a form of memory. By Erica Goode. New
York Times Science Times. 2,000 words + photo + graphic.

RAISA GORBACHEV INTERVIEW In the mid-1980s, Raisa Gorbachev, in her
crisp pastel business suits, became an internationally known figure
as the Kremlin's first visible first lady. In her 60's, she was
still a voice to be heard, particularly in support of women and
children, struggling to advance, or merely to survive, in the
morass of post-communist Russia. We are re-releasing this
interview, conducted in June 1998, with Raisa Gorbachev, in the
light of her death this week in Germany. By Carolee Morrison. 2,000
words.

KUNGURTUK, FREE IN THE TAIGA Tuva Autonomous Republic is one of the
poorest and smallest (population : 310,000) of the Russian
republics, tucked away between southern Siberia and Mongolia. The
2,000 inhabitants of the village of Kungurtuk are obsessed by the
visits of the two-engine Yak light aircraft, without which they
could not survive. In summer the plane arrives once or twice a
week, but when winter temperatures drop as low as 50 C, they
sometimes don't see it for two months. Only the resources of the
taiga (coniferous forest) enable them to stay alive. By Frangois

CHRIS CARTER GETS VIRTUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Chris Carter
on the set of ``Harsh Realm.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Harsh Realm'' is virtually here.
 &HT;    ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter's latest excursion into the
dark and bizarre, ``Harsh Realm'' debuts Oct. 8 on Fox. The series
arrives following the relative failure of ``Millennium'' and just
as ``X-Files'' enters its final season.
 &HT;    ``Once you've experienced the kind of success I have with `The
X-Files,' I think you have to be _ no, you don't have to be, I have
to be _ very selective about what I do next,'' Carter says,
speaking by telephone from his production office in Los Angeles.
``I don't want to repeat myself, and I don't want to do a regular
franchise show.
 &HT;    ``I wanted an idea that could generate 100-plus episodes, which
is what a successful series does,'' he adds. ``But I didn't want to
do anything that was like anything else on television.''
 &HT;    Carter found inspiration for his new saga in James Hudnall's
comic book ``Harsh Realm,'' not to mention the 1982 sci-fi classic
``Blade Runner'' and such war epics as 1953's ``Stalag 17'' and
1998's ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The pilot introduces Lt. Thomas
Hobbes (Scott Bairstow), who fought in Bosnia and intends to quit
the military to marry his fiance, Sophie (Samantha Mathis).
 &HT;    Before he can leave, a general (Lance Henriksen, in a cameo)
asks Hobbes to test a top-secret training system: Harsh Realm.
Hobbes agrees, and is promptly plopped into a war-simulation game
where bullets fly, renegade military man Omar Santiago (Terry
O'Quinn) reigns supreme and escape seems impossible.
 &HT;    As Hobbes deals with his new reality, he forms an uneasy
alliance with well-connected loner Mike Pinocchio (D.B. Sweeney),
encounters VR versions of familiar faces, including Sophie, and
comes to realize that Harsh Realm's denizens consider him a savior.
 &HT;    ``On a weekly basis you're going to see a parallel world that
provides allegorical potential,'' says Carter, who serves as the
series' writer/producer. ```What if the world were like this?'
 &HT;    ``What you'll see is this guy Hobbes _ a hero, a selfless hero,
in a world where anything but selfishness is a death wish and a
liability,'' he says. ``It's a world without God, without codes,
standards and morals.
 &HT;    ``The show's about a man, Hobbes, trying to change this world,''
Carter concludes, ``and he becomes something of a revolutionary
character within this world. And that's based on not only what he's
doing, but the mythology that he has walked into.''
 &HT;    Speaking of mythology, ``The X-Files'' begins its seventh and
apparently final season on Nov. 7. Carter won't rule out an eighth
year _ which, given David Duchovny's desire to move on and his
lawsuit against Twentieth Century Fox Television, would likely
leave Agent Scully (Gillian Anderson) to carry on without Agent
Mulder and leave the series to forge ahead without its male lead _
but he admits to feeling compelled to craft upcoming episodes as a
sprint to the finish line.
 &HT;    ``You can expect us to deliver on the promises the show gave you
seven years ago, as far as the Mulder mythology and the
Mulder-Scully relationship are concerned,'' he says. ``There's
going to be a significant episode for Mulder and Scully that will
deeply affect their relationship.
 &HT;    ``Beyond that we're going to do really good, scary shows this
season,'' Carter says. ``Last year, after the movie, I think we
decided to do something different with the show. It was as
imaginative as it had even been, but was also fanciful and somewhat
whimsical.
 &HT;    ``I was very proud of year six, but for year seven we want to
see if we can get back to scaring the pants off people,'' he says
with an ominous chuckle, ``and maybe take a bit of a break from
last year's light episodes.''
 &HT;    Carter knows that audiences and critics will be quick to compare
``Harsh Realm'' to ``X-Files,'' and that expectations will be
sky-high for a series Fox itself hyperbolically refers to as
``another innovative, ground-breaking television event.''
 &HT;    Can ``Harsh Realm'' live up to the hype?
 &HT;    ``So many things comes and go, even from good producers,
directors and writers,'' Carter says. ``What you want to do is make
sure you get enough people believing in you and in the show to give
it its due.
 &HT;    ``You know you can do good work,'' he says, ``but the worry is
will you have the resources to do it? There's always some hedging
by the production entities in the beginning of any show, and it
doesn't matter who you are.
 &HT;    ``We're just trying to make everything as good as we can
possibly make it. I can't worry about expectations or pressure.''

SHOULD BUSH, GORE KEEP UP SPANISH? MANY SAY `SI' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories) 
 
By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Al Gore speaks his scripted Spanish haltingly, with an
accent so heavy that hearing him speak the language just might be
funnier than listening to Pepe Le Pew speak English.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how humorous and tortured the vice president's
attempts at Spanish may sound, few Hispanics are snickering.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush greets Latino crowds with a firm handshake and an
imperfect Spanish sprinkled with words in English. If the Texas
governor's Spanish sometimes leaves onlookers more confused than
enlightened, none complain.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of neglect and discrimination, most Hispanics say
they are delighted to see the two leading presidential candidates
try to speak their language _ no matter how rehearsed, contorted,
ungrammatical or downright unintelligible the result may sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's funny'' to hear Gore and Bush speak Spanish,
said Maria del Pilar Marrero, a reporter with La Opinion, a
Spanish-language daily newspaper in Los Angeles. ``But on the other
hand, people say it's good that they are trying to communicate with
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she added, ``let's see if they try to understand us.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bush first drummed up the confidence to roll his R's
in public as Texas governor, and he has continued the practice as
he campaigns for president. Not to be outdone, Democrat Gore has
memorized a few short Spanish phrases, which he repeats _ over and
over _ on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could be described as fluent.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Latinos are pleased. Some see the token use of cue-card
Spanish as a disingenuous effort to charm voters through symbols
rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys get an `A' for effort and an `F' in sincerity,''
said Rolando Becerra, a local Cuban-American who hosts a
Spanish-language radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an entirely unscientific survey of the first 10 people
entering a grocery store in Houston's predominantly East Side
suggests that the idea of Anglo presidential candidates speaking
Spanish is quite popular among local Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 of those stopped spoke Spanish. Two were opposed, one had
no opinion, and the other seven said they considered it
``marvelous'' that Gore and Bush are speaking Spanish, no matter
how badly. Recent immigrants, who have themselves struggled with
the terror of daring to speak a second language in public, were
particularly willing to forgive the candidates' imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the two who opposed the idea of politicos speaking
Spanish were the only two interviewed who were bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're messing up our language,'' protested Elizabeth Garcia.
``We don't mess up their language, so why should they mess up
ours?''
</P>
<P>
   This country's stubbornly monolingual politicians have a long
history of messing up other people's languages, but their
linguistic transgressions have usually been forgiven. At the height
of the Cold War in 1963, President Kennedy stood before the Berlin
Wall and tried to capture the historic solemnity of the moment with
a few words of German. He said: ``Ich bin ein berliner`` (``I am a
jelly doughnut'').
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. The Germans understood that he meant to say
that West Berlin had become a symbol of freedom and that in the
broadest sense he considered himself one of the people of Berlin.
They cheered politely.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using a foreign language in a presidential campaign
caught on more recently. Democrat Michael Dukakis spoke competent
Spanish in his 1988 campaign, but it didn't win him the election.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush (with the ``W'' pronounced in Spanish, that's:
``George dub-LAY-oo Bush'') appears to have first shown off some
Spanish in public during his first term as governor, when he
recorded public service announcements. Discovering a good thing, he
went on to use the language in his gubernatorial re-election
campaign last year and has not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Bush captured about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 1998
re-election. National Republicans are hoping he can set a similar
record for a GOP candidate's share of the Latino presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Texas governor's reputation for being fluent baffles
most native Spanish speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the impression he spoke Spanish, but it isn't
true,'' said del Pilar Marrero. She said some observers may be
confusing Bush with his younger brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who
really is bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Turning more charitable, the journalist gives George W. credit
for understanding almost everything said to him in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gore's Spanish is much worse. His campaign has
spread the word that he is relearning the language he first picked
up during a high school summer spent in Mexico. But the vice
president clearly does not remember much. With a few unscripted
exceptions, his use of Spanish &UR;  &LR; is limited to a couple of
oft-repeated phrases, and even those he mispronounces badly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be too simple to condemn the candidates as insincere.
Even if their words in Spanish are sometimes practiced or
contrived, watching Gore and Bush attempt to speak the language can
reveal great insights into their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who finds Gore wooden in English ought to hear him try
Spanish, where the memorized words come slowly and with an odd
affectation, like a bookish high school valedictorian practicing
his commencement speech in front of a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his native language, Bush occasionally stands accused of
relying on charm to take him where preparedness lets him down. It's
doubly true in Spanish. The Texan will sometimes boldly move
forward to meet Spanish-speaking crowds, relying on language skills
a less courageous man might consider inadequate for the task at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   As the Spanish wire service EFE has noted, Bush speaks the
language poorly, ``but with great confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the influence all those immigrants and
their children will have on the presidential elections,
particularly the 30 million Americans of Hispanic descent. And a
chunk of those 30 million watch Spanish-language television.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, Univision, draws more than 4 million U.S. viewers to
at least one of its national news shows, and its credibility was
recently proven with an Emmy for reporting. Univision's chief
competitor, Telemundo, is also undergoing phenomenal growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles and Houston, Univision's local Spanish-language
newscasts now receive higher ratings than any single English
language news broadcast at the same times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish-language television has become a dominant force,''
said Rafael Buitrago, the editorial-page editor of La Opinion. He
notes that statewide California candidates, for the first time, put
together sophisticated Spanish-language television ad campaigns
last year. Other candidates are catching on.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing a translation of Al Gore saying, ``Our families deserve
the best,'' is not nearly as convincing as hearing the candidate
say the Spanish words in his own voice: ``Nuestras familias merecen
lo mejor.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore has shown a particular willingness to reach out to the
Spanish networks. While in Los Angeles to unveil his new
health-insurance proposal recently, Gore made a point of stopping
by Univision for an interview on the topic. He even offered a
couple of sentences in Spanish, before conducting the rest of the
interview in English.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians' willingness to discard all shame and speak
their butchered Spanish on television puts them in venerated
company. Other Anglos seen testing their limited language skills on
Spanish television are used-car dealers and ambulance-chasing
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the concern. If the candidates are learning
Spanish in the hope of better understanding culture, they will be
supported. But if it turns out that they have learned Spanish only
to win votes _ the way the most unscrupulous car dealers learn the
language to sell cars _ there could be a backlash.

 &HT;    AS FIRST ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, HDTV FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE
 &HT;    With HDTV-EXPLAIN And HDTV-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and
(f) financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Come Nov. 1, high-tech digital television
broadcasting will mark the first anniversary of its official
launch, having yet to solve its low-tech marketing problems.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-September, 76 stations had converted to digital
signals, well ahead of the timetable set by the Federal
Communications Commission. Some 140 stations in the nation's top 30
markets, serving more than 50 percent of all U.S. households, are
due to go digital by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Birkmaier, a veteran industry consultant, notes that
``just going digital eliminates a host of severe artifacts inherent
in the old analog system. All of the noise and ghosts are gone. The
brightness resolution goes up 30 percent. The color resolution
doubles. And the pictures can be wide-screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Says FCC chairman William Kennard: ``The (high-definition) train
is rolling out of the station, and broadcasters are climbing aboard
to be part of the digital revolution of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as it took the railroads several decades to adopt
common standards and gain wide acceptance in the early 1800s, the
digital television (DTV) revolution hasn't escaped severe birth
pangs.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason: the high-definition (HDTV) receivers, often sold
as part of an elaborate home theater package, cost $2,500 and up.
Although prices have been sliced nearly in half since the sets were
introduced a year ago, industry observers contend they must drop at
least by half again before sales take off.
</P>
<P>
   Warns Birkmaier: ``The bottom line is that it may be some years
before HDTV technology will be affordable to the mass market. It
will take some time and lots of money for stations to convert to
HDTV, much as it took many years for stations to transition from
black and white to color TV. Personal HDTV sets will be extremely
expensive for some years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, each U.S. household has 2.5 TV receivers, and the
nation as a whole is awash with some 250 million sets, each tuned
to an expiring broadcast standard that was first adopted in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the FCC have set a goal of conversion to
all-digital broadcasts by 2006. By then, all 1,600 U.S. TV stations
are required to return the channels that the government allocated
to them, in some cases more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts, however, doubt the broadcasters will meet the 2006
deadline. Since it was set, Congress has mandated that 85 percent
of all U.S. television sets must be digitally capable before the
changeover can occur. That policy offers broadcasters an escape
route.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association forecasts
penetration of digital sets will reach 30 percent of American homes
by 2006 _ including 150,000 sets to be bought this year. The trade
group predicts that the first 10 million sets will be sold from
1999 to 2003, while the next 10 million will be purchased in 2004
and 2005, with annual unit sales reaching nearly 11 million in
2006.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry analysts liken the glacial transition to HDTV with
the one that occurred for an earlier generation of Americans when
they moved to color screens from monochrome ones.
</P>
<P>
   NBC beamed the first coast-to-coast colorcast, the Tournament of
Roses Parade, on Jan. 1, 1954. In that year, 5,000 sets were sold.
While it took a full decade before sales initially topped 1 million
units, they then took off rapidly. It was no accident that the fall
of 1965 saw CBS and ABC offer regular series broadcasts in color
for the first time, while in 1966, NBC became the first all-color
network.
</P>
<P>
   Back in March, HBO began offering its new HBO HDTV service. Now
it airs more than half of its feature films and HBO original movies
in HDTV format. By year's end, that figure is expected to climb to
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters and several major HDTV manufacturers have formed an
alliance aimed at accelerating adoption of the sets as a mainstream
consumer item. Thus, Monday Night Football viewers with HDTV sets
can see each play this season with startling clarity under a
programming subsidy deal between ABC and Panasonic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the NFL and weekly movies on ABC, HDTV-enabled
viewers can also watch several prime-time series and occasional
movies on CBS, as well as the Tonight Show on NBC. Two set makers,
Samsung and Mitsubishi, have aligned themselves with CBS, while
Sony is working with NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The expanding menu of programs ``assures consumers that they no
longer have to be concerned about the chicken-and-egg problem with
high-definition television,'' says Bob Perry, director of marketing
for Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   But recent surveys suggest that these digital eggs may be a long
time hatching in the broadcasters' chicken coops.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Yankee Group, a high-tech industry analyst
firm, only 10 percent of U.S. set buyers are willing to pay more
than $800 for a TV of any quality. Most expect to pay about $450,
the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper HDTV sets, still bearing low four-figure price tags,
won't be available for at least another year, and prices aren't
expected to drop into the hundreds of dollars until perhaps the
middle of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, another widely respected analysts' group,
similarly concludes that marketing the pricey sets will prove to be
a tough job, at least in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found 31 percent of 10,000 people we surveyed in the United
States had no knowledge whatsoever about digital TV,'' Ekaterina
Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   She spread the blame equally among manufacturers, retailers and
broadcasters. ``They have made absolutely no effort to create a
broad-based consumer campaign to let people know what DTV is. ...
Under current market conditions, DTV is headed for failure,'' she
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Todd Thibodeaux, vice president of market research for
the consumer electronics trade group: ``Seeing is believing. Once
people see it, they want it. That's why I don't take any stock in
DTV phone surveys, and we stopped doing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thibodeaux admits, however, that high prices pose a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``With only six major manufacturers in the field, current prices
are totally unrealistic and not where they'll be in the near
future,'' he says. As he sees it, prices for high-end large-screen
TVs have to come down to around $3,000, a target he expects will be
reached by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond uncertainties over how to spark broad consumer interest,
the industry must also grapple with such other issues as the actual
time frame for returning the current analog spectrum to the
government, must-carry cable requirements and connections of
digital sets to the cable industry's set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get through this period where essentially we don't
know what the ultimate business plan will be,'' Peter Smith, vice
president of technology at NBC, told a recent DTV seminar here.
</P>
<P>
   But another panelist at the seminar, Marty Franks, CBS's senior
vice president for Washington, looked at the same glass and found
it half full. ``Digital television,'' he said, ``is now finally
shifting out of its lobbying and engineering phase and into a
business phase.''

 &HT;    AS FIRST ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, HDTV FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE
 &HT;    With HDTV-EXPLAIN And HDTV-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and
(f) financial categories for release Sunday, Sept. 26.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Come Nov. 1, high-tech digital television
broadcasting will mark the first anniversary of its official
launch, having yet to solve its low-tech marketing problems.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-September, 76 stations had converted to digital
signals, well ahead of the timetable set by the Federal
Communications Commission. Some 140 stations in the nation's top 30
markets, serving more than 50 percent of all U.S. households, are
due to go digital by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Birkmaier, a veteran industry consultant, notes that
``just going digital eliminates a host of severe artifacts inherent
in the old analog system. All of the noise and ghosts are gone. The
brightness resolution goes up 30 percent. The color resolution
doubles. And the pictures can be wide-screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Says FCC chairman William Kennard: ``The (high-definition) train
is rolling out of the station, and broadcasters are climbing aboard
to be part of the digital revolution of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as it took the railroads several decades to adopt
common standards and gain wide acceptance in the early 1800s, the
digital television (DTV) revolution hasn't escaped severe birth
pangs.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason: the high-definition (HDTV) receivers, often sold
as part of an elaborate home theater package, cost $2,500 and up.
Although prices have been sliced nearly in half since the sets were
introduced a year ago, industry observers contend they must drop at
least by half again before sales take off.
</P>
<P>
   Warns Birkmaier: ``The bottom line is that it may be some years
before HDTV technology will be affordable to the mass market. It
will take some time and lots of money for stations to convert to
HDTV, much as it took many years for stations to transition from
black and white to color TV. Personal HDTV sets will be extremely
expensive for some years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, each U.S. household has 2.5 TV receivers, and the
nation as a whole is awash with some 250 million sets, each tuned
to an expiring broadcast standard that was first adopted in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the FCC have set a goal of conversion to
all-digital broadcasts by 2006. By then, all 1,600 U.S. TV stations
are required to return the channels that the government allocated
to them, in some cases more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts, however, doubt the broadcasters will meet the 2006
deadline. Since it was set, Congress has mandated that 85 percent
of all U.S. television sets must be digitally capable before the
changeover can occur. That policy offers broadcasters an escape
route.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association forecasts
penetration of digital sets will reach 30 percent of American homes
by 2006 _ including 150,000 sets to be bought this year. The trade
group predicts that the first 10 million sets will be sold from
1999 to 2003, while the next 10 million will be purchased in 2004
and 2005, with annual unit sales reaching nearly 11 million in
2006.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry analysts liken the glacial transition to HDTV with
the one that occurred for an earlier generation of Americans when
they moved to color screens from monochrome ones.
</P>
<P>
   NBC beamed the first coast-to-coast colorcast, the Tournament of
Roses Parade, on Jan. 1, 1954. In that year, 5,000 sets were sold.
While it took a full decade before sales initially topped 1 million
units, they then took off rapidly. It was no accident that the fall
of 1965 saw CBS and ABC offer regular series broadcasts in color
for the first time, while in 1966, NBC became the first all-color
network.
</P>
<P>
   Back in March, HBO began offering its new HBO HDTV service. Now
it airs more than half of its feature films and HBO original movies
in HDTV format. By year's end, that figure is expected to climb to
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters and several major HDTV manufacturers have formed an
alliance aimed at accelerating adoption of the sets as a mainstream
consumer item. Thus, Monday Night Football viewers with HDTV sets
can see each play this season with startling clarity under a
programming subsidy deal between ABC and Panasonic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the NFL and weekly movies on ABC, HDTV-enabled
viewers can also watch several prime-time series and occasional
movies on CBS, as well as the Tonight Show on NBC. Two set makers,
Samsung and Mitsubishi, have aligned themselves with CBS, while
Sony is working with NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The expanding menu of programs ``assures consumers that they no
longer have to be concerned about the chicken-and-egg problem with
high-definition television,'' says Bob Perry, director of marketing
for Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   But recent surveys suggest that these digital eggs may be a long
time hatching in the broadcasters' chicken coops.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Yankee Group, a high-tech industry analyst
firm, only 10 percent of U.S. set buyers are willing to pay more
than $800 for a TV of any quality. Most expect to pay about $450,
the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper HDTV sets, still bearing low four-figure price tags,
won't be available for at least another year, and prices aren't
expected to drop into the hundreds of dollars until perhaps the
middle of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, another widely respected analysts' group,
similarly concludes that marketing the pricey sets will prove to be
a tough job, at least in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found 31 percent of 10,000 people we surveyed in the United
States had no knowledge whatsoever about digital TV,'' Ekaterina
Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   She spread the blame equally among manufacturers, retailers and
broadcasters. ``They have made absolutely no effort to create a
broad-based consumer campaign to let people know what DTV is. ...
Under current market conditions, DTV is headed for failure,'' she
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Todd Thibodeaux, vice president of market research for
the consumer electronics trade group: ``Seeing is believing. Once
people see it, they want it. That's why I don't take any stock in
DTV phone surveys, and we stopped doing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thibodeaux admits, however, that high prices pose a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``With only six major manufacturers in the field, current prices
are totally unrealistic and not where they'll be in the near
future,'' he says. As he sees it, prices for high-end large-screen
TVs have to come down to around $3,000, a target he expects will be
reached by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond uncertainties over how to spark broad consumer interest,
the industry must also grapple with such other issues as the actual
time frame for returning the current analog spectrum to the
government, must-carry cable requirements and connections of
digital sets to the cable industry's set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get through this period where essentially we don't
know what the ultimate business plan will be,'' Peter Smith, vice
president of technology at NBC, told a recent DTV seminar here.
</P>
<P>
   But another panelist at the seminar, Marty Franks, CBS's senior
vice president for Washington, looked at the same glass and found
it half full. ``Digital television,'' he said, ``is now finally
shifting out of its lobbying and engineering phase and into a
business phase.''

 &HT;    HDTV _ A TECHNICAL PRIMER
 &HT;    With HDTV. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While conventional TV sets vary in screen size and
features, all units have the same resolution, or number of lines on
the screen. However, high-definition digital (HDTV) signals can be
sent and received in three formats. They are known as 480p, 720p
and 1080i.
</P>
<P>
   The 1080i format is interlaced, meaning that every other line of
the picture is transmitted, quickly followed by the other half of
the lines. While this format is more efficient in terms of
conserving video bandwidth, it only allows half of the lines to be
viewed on the screen at any instant. The 480p and 720p formats are
progressive, meaning all the lines of the program are sent at once.
</P>
<P>
   Which is better? First, the bigger (more lines of resolution)
the better. Second, progressive scan systems (p) are better than
interlaced (i) ones. So if you compare 720p to 480p, 720p is much
better. Most video experts believe that 1080i is best for scenes
where there is little motion, while 720p will probably win out over
1080i in scenes with lots of motion in them.
</P>
<P>
   The standards under which HDTV sets are marketed in the United
States not only specify the three vertical resolution formats of
HDTV, but also other settings, each of which can vary among both
transmission signals and receiving sets.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA) has
published a set of definitions for the marketing of digital sets
that seeks to distinguish HDTV from standard definition digital
television (SDTV) sets.
</P>
<P>
   CEMA-certified HDTV receivers must (1) have a vertical
resolution of 720p, 1080i or higher, (2) be capable of displaying
images in a rectangular proportion of 16 to 9 (the shape of a movie
screen) at their minimum resolution level, (3) reproduce Dolby
digital sound and (4) receive and, if necessary, convert all 18
potential broadcast digital signal combinations.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of lines governs picture quality, the number of
pixels and the number of frames that are scanned each second _ they
can vary from 24 to 60 _ can also have a significant bearing on the
final viewing results. Thus, a set maker that cuts costs by
lowering the pixel count and slowing picture rates can easily
neutralize the inherent quality advantages of a 720p or 1080i
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry observers believe viewers require a darkened room,
such as is common in home theaters, and a large glare-free screen
to enjoy the full benefits of HDTV. Finally, an adequate
over-the-air signal must feed the set if cable set-top boxes aren't
being used.
</P>
<P>
   Signal quality can vary widely, with weather conditions,
terrain, antenna orientation and multipath (bounce) problems. When
the quality gets bad enough so that the computerized error
correction embedded in the signal stream is no longer able to
restore or recreate the lost information, the picture can freeze up
or ``pixelize.''
</P>
<P>
   So long as the signal exceeds a certain threshold, viewers can't
tell a ``good'' signal from a ``less good'' one, since the images
will be identical. But if the quality of the signal falls below
those levels, or worse, fluctuates, the picture can quickly become
unviewable.

EX-MAYOR'S COMEBACK LACKS MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When former Mayor Frank Jordan walked into this
season's first mayoral debate behind the two other leading
contenders, he slipped into the room practically unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, at a meeting of the National Women's Political
Caucus, Jordan quietly sat at a table with a member of his campaign
staff while Mayor Willie Brown and challenger Clint Reilly worked
the room for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is making a plink instead of a splash in his return to
San Francisco politics.
</P>
<P>
   With six weeks before the Nov. 2 election, the former mayor is
short on time and money. His advertising so far is limited to one
mailer sent out late this summer. Jordan hired an unknown campaign
consultant, a rarity in San Francisco politics, and just set up
campaign headquarters and a phone number last week. And Jordan's
headquarters, an office with no signs in the windows or on the
door, is as low-key as the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan, who declared his candidacy only a month ago, says he
is doing it right this time with a strategy totally unlike his
losing re-election campaign of 1995 _ run by Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Reilly orchestrated an aggressive Jordan
campaign that focused heavily on attacking then-Assemblyman Willie
Brown as an untrustworthy career politician.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy Jordan blames for his loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we missed the mark of getting our own message out
properly about my accomplishments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those accomplishments included taking over a city with a
potential $300 million deficit during the recession and leaving San
Francisco with a multimillion-dollar surplus, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly campaign spokesman Tom Pier said Jordan was ultimately
responsible for the tenor of his 1995 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Jordan was the candidate, and the buck stops with the
candidate,'' Pier said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a former police chief who still sells himself as a
citizen mayor, said he was upstaged in 1995 by Reilly and Jack
Davis, another colorful consultant who represented Brown. Davis
helped Jordan win election in 1991, then switched to Brown's side
four years later. Davis is helping run Brown's re-election campaign
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them (Davis and Reilly) became bigger than life.
That's what's wrong with San Francisco politics,'' Jordan said.
``It became a war of campaign managers.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Jordan hired Ed Slevin, an unknown consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Slevin is excellent,'' Jordan said. ``He is allowing me to
be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan prides himself on taking his campaign to the
neighborhoods, to community picnics, to youth soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this because a lot of politicians don't come out here
and do this,'' he said during a visit Saturday to West Sunset
Park's soccer fields, which attract teams from all over the city.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has spoken generally at campaign events about problems
with public transportation, homeless people, street crime and other
issues. But when asked for his plans for addressing those problems,
his campaign staff declined to provide them.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Reilly is holding regular news conferences
unveiling detailed plans for solving the issues he believes
confront the city, such as homelessness and the neighborhood
invasion of chain stores.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers interviewed for this story wonder where
Jordan's low-key approach will take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen Frank Jordan's campaign anywhere. I haven't
seen one house sign. There is just no presence of a campaign,''
said Ellie Schafer, who is working for district attorney candidate
Bill Fazio.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer believes Jordan, who declared his candidacy in August
after Reilly and Brown, could be hampered by his late start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has name ID because he is a former elected official; that
is a bonus for him,'' she said. ``But I think people are looking
more and more for answers on how he is going to run the city, and
you need sufficient time to develop that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he didn't enter the race just to be a place holder,
someone who would prevent Brown from winning 51 percent of the
votes in November and force a December run-off election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in it to win,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he decided to run when friends and strangers with
``buyer's remorse'' lobbied him for about four months.

BLAND ROBIN WILLIAMS PERFORMANCE HURTS `JAKOB THE LIAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's impossible not to like Robin Williams, but a little of him
goes a long way and, as he appears in movie after movie (one critic
noted he seems ``incapable of turning down a part''), he's getting
close to becoming dangerously overexposed.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it: He's not a great actor, or even a strong
leading man. He's a fine sketch comedian, he's great with dialect
and he may be the fastest, most brilliant comic improviser in show
biz history. But as a ``serious'' lead in films like ``What Dreams
May Come,'' he's totally dull.
</P>
<P>
   And ever since his mediocre ``serious'' performance in ``Good
Will Hunting'' was rewarded with an Oscar, this is exactly what he
wants to be. Hence, ``Jakob the Liar,'' a Holocaust drama that he
executive produced and stars in as a resourceful victim of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   A remake of an East German film that was nominated for a foreign
language film Oscar in 1976, it's the reportedly true story of a
Polish cafe owner who lives in an unnamed Jewish ghetto that's been
sealed off and turned into a prison by the occupying German Army.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1944, when the war is nearing its end but the imprisoned
Jewish community doesn't know it, the story begins when Jakob
(Williams) is taken to a Nazi office for a curfew offense, and
learns via a radio broadcast that the Russians are rapidly
advancing toward the Polish border.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the ghetto, he spreads this happy news, and when the
people mistakenly assume that he has a secret radio, Jakob keeps up
the pretense _ going to extreme and even comic lengths _ because it
gives hope, and prevents despair and even suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's very close to the same story as in ``Life Is
Beautiful.'' In both films, the Holocaust-victim hero takes absurd
measures to keep up an optimistic illusion, and extravagantly lies
to those he loves. (Indeed, because of this similarity, the release
of ``Jakob'' was held up for more than a year.)
</P>
<P>
   But this time the formula doesn't work nearly as well. It's
never quite as magical, emotionally gripping or as darkly funny as
Roberto Benigni's film, and Williams' self-conscious and rather
bland performance never comes close to bringing his character to
life.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska:
</P>
<P>
   Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama. In this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale'' Not rated, but the theme may be
</P>
<P>
   too mature for children.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Marie Riviere
</P>
<P>
   and Beatrice Romand.
</P>
<P>
   Magali (Beatrice Romand), a widowed Frenchwoman in her mid-40s,
becomes the object of matchmaking by her best friend and by the
young woman who's dating Magali's son. By being both sympathetic to
and ironic about the simple fact that seeking out romance reduces
us all to cringing adolescents, director Eric Rohmer, now almost
80, imparts wisdom that's aged to perfection. Subtitles. (ERG)1
hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM)1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chill Factor'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Skeet Ulrich.
</P>
<P>
   Summer's last-gasp action movie. There's a newfound deadly
chemical substance that'll blow and snuff out millions if not kept
cold. And two bickering heroes (Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr.)
who must keep military hooligans away from that chemical by
stuffing it inside an ice cream truck and putting pedal to the
metal. Unfortunately, ``Chill Factor'' doesn't have enough gas to
outgun its own concept. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service)1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality. violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' PG (mild comic action violence,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Sarah Jessica Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' is just plain wrongheaded. Based on one of
the weaker elements of Jay Ward's TV 'toon series ``The Bullwinkle
Show,'' this live-action takeoff has so much less to offer. Brendan
Fraser (``George of the Jungle'') plays Dudley and it's clear he'd
rather not be here. There's not one joke or one slapstick moment
that's funny. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 27 minutes (including a new
``Fractured Fairy Tales'' cartoon short). F+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' PG-13 (sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner
</P>
<P>
   and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard it tries to hit, Kevin Costner's baseball
flick whiffs a lot. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a Detroit Tigers
pitching god in his waning years who first learns his team is being
sold and he'll be traded and then that his girlfriend is dumping
him. As he pitches what could be a perfect game, he flashes back
over his life. (Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 18 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' R (profanity, sensuality, some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances. Omar Epps is quite good as the detective, but LL Cool
J is a revelation as the ruthless drug kingpin, a monster made all
the scarier by his seeming benevolent charm. (SM)1 hour, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (fantasy action and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG)1 hour, 24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob the Liar'' PG-13 (violence and disturbing)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Alan Arkin
</P>
<P>
   and Armin Mueller-Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a Polish Jew who inspires his neighbors in
the Nazi-controlled ghetto by pretending to own a radio that's
broadcasting news of German defeat. While you'll be grateful that
Williams avoids his mawkish, laughter-through-tears routine, you
keep wanting him to do something memorable. Ultimately, it's what a
film like this should never be: dull. (SM)1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' PG-13 (profanity, some violence
</P>
<P>
   and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan
</P>
<P>
   and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer (Hugh Grant) experiences culture
clash when he finds himself married to the mob, literally. Call it
a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy. Grant's one-trick
performance as an elegant bumbler is treadworn. He's terrific at
it, yes. But it's time to show more range. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' R (profanity, sex-related images,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Loren Dean,
</P>
<P>
   Hope Davis, Jason Lee
</P>
<P>
   and Alfre Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan delivers a sunny, low-key
crowd-pleaser about a therapist named Mumford (Loren Dean) whose
effect on his clients changes the mood of their whole town (also
called Mumford). With a crack supporting cast, it's a gentle
vacation from the high-concept bangs and lowbrow laughs found
elsewhere in the multiplex. (SM)1 hour, 51 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Minus Man'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Owen Wilson
</P>
<P>
   and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   Not many pluses. An affable drifter (Owen Wilson) moves to a
small town and insinuates himself into the lives of the residents.
Trouble is, he's also a serial killer. The idea of a compulsive
killer as a freaky cipher who, if anything, seems TOO normal is
intriguing, but the film is as flat and affectless as Wilson's
performance. After a point, you kinda hope Wilson will kill again,
just to pick things up. (ERG) 1 hour, 55 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone
</P>
<P>
   and Andie MacDowell.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks wrote, directed and stars in this Hollywood fable
about a screenwriter who's ``lost his edge'' and is sent to an
honest-to-the-gods Muse (Sharon Stone) for inspiration. Stone is
delicious. She plays her Muse as a mix of material girl, expert
networker and distracted spoiled child. In other words, she's
modeled her after half of Hollywood. (ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' R (teen drug use, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Shawn Hatosy
</P>
<P>
   and Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Just ignore the Miramax marketing campaign. This movie may be
written by the ``There's Something About Mary'' gang, but it's
bittersweet funny, not raucous comedy. It's a coming-of-age tale of
a '70s Rhode Island teen (Shawn Hatosy) that captures the shaggy,
druggy ``what-next'' feeling that followed in the uncertain years
after the Summer of Love had come and gone. (SM)1 hour, 42 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' R (profanity, sexuality, intense violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Let it bleed without you. This mishmash of ``The Exorcist,''
``The Omen,'' etc. stars Gabriel Byrne as a Vatican investigator
sent to examine a young woman (Patricia Arquette) who's showing
signs of the stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross.
Unfortunately, the movie prefers sensationalism to making sense.
It's enough to make you long for the good ol' days of pea soup and
spinning heads. (ERG)1 hour, 42 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' R (profanity, sexual content
</P>
<P>
   and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon
</P>
<P>
   and Kathryn Erbe.
</P>
<P>
   A ghost story with too many echoes of other flicks. It might
have seemed intriguing had it landed in theaters before ``The Blair
Witch Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense'' gave us new twists on the
spooky movie genre. A little boy sees ghosts and his hypnotized dad
(Kevin Bacon) goes wiggy while hunting what happened to a teen girl
haunting their home. (SM)1 hour, 50 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   teen drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson and Marisa
Coughlan.
</P>
<P>
   It barely makes a passing grade. Three high school kids take
their evil history teacher hostage in her home and then try to
figure out how to get out of the mess they've created. It ends up
being a wishy-washy remake of 1980's silly ``Nine to Five.'' As the
tied-up teach, Helen Mirren is pretty good. Her young co-stars,
however, fail to match her talent. (Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, cheesy movies can be great fun. That's true of this
rip-roaring yarn about a medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas)
who's drafted by a roving gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a
Norse village from a mysterious enemy that comes from the mist,
kills everything in sight and leaves a trail of headless corpses.
This flick hits the ground running and never stops. (ERG)1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``trick'' R (sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Campbell
</P>
<P>
   and John Paul Pitoc.
</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' R (kinkiness and adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Polish.
</P>
<P>
   Eerie. Intriguing. Identical twins, Mark and Michael Polish,
play conjoined (the popular term is Siamese) twins. Moving at its
own slow, surreal pace, the picture shows what happens when a young
hooker (Michele Hicks) falls for one of the twins, thus creating a
strange pas de trois. Exploring themes of love and loneliness, the
movie suggests that sometimes, wholeness can only be found by
letting go. (ERG)1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska)41 minutes. B-

   OBIT-SCOTT (Undated) _ George C. Scott, an actor of

<P>
   WHITNEY-EXHIBIT (New York) _ America Takes Command.'' These
jarring, jingoistic words, redolent of a Marshall Plan approach to
cultural influence, appear on a large sign in the first gallery of
``The American Century, Part II: 1950-2000'' at the Whitney Museum
of American Art. They float above paintings by Jackson Pollock and
Willem de Kooning and sculpture by David Smith, and they refer of
course to what is often called the triumph of American art,
specifically of Abstract Expressionism, that occurred after World
War II. By Roberta Smith.

<P>
   NY-BOOK-COUNTRY (New York) _ ``New York Is Book Country'' makes
its annual festive return this weekend. The slogan may annoy a
resident of Somewhere Else: once again the city is proclaiming
itself a metonym for the universal. To be a great city, of course,
it is necessary in some respect to be greatly provincial. Look at
London until it lost its nerve and Paris anytime. In any case,
``Book Country'' is wonderful. This is what books are: a country,
and in a way the computer screen and the misnamed electronic book
never can be. By Rchard Eder.

   TV-WEEKEND (Undated) _ Much of television is one giant recycling

that recycling has gone far beyond cable's endless loop of ``Happy

story of the season's supposedly fresh network shows, too. Several

 &HT;    Let the Oscar race begin: Superb acting fills this darkly comic
story of a fractured American family on the brink
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's only September and we have the Oscar-conscious Christmas
season ahead of us. But at this point in the year, I'd readily call
``American Beauty'' one of the best movies of 1999. It is certainly
the best-acted, with Kevin Spacey a standout among a stellar
ensemble cast.
</P>
<P>
   As scarily unsettling as it is daringly hilarious, this mordant
comedy-drama dissects dysfunctional suburban America with a
precision that's astonishing. No wonder writer Alan Ball and
director Sam Mendes _ both making their feature debuts _ can count
Steven Spielberg as one of their biggest admirers.
</P>
<P>
   With the millennium bearing down on us with the inevitability of
an iceberg waiting for the Titanic, Mendes (he directed the revival
of ``Cabaret'' on Broadway) and Ball (a sitcom heavy hitter) have
fashioned a fin de siecle tragifarce with a Renoir-ish
everyone-has-his-reasons subtext. It transforms the picture's
surface heartlessness into something far more haunting. For all its
bitingly sardonic posing, ``American Beauty'' is, at its core, a
touchingly optimistic film.
</P>
<P>
   The center cannot hold, Yeats wrote. The center not holding in
``American Beauty'' is Lester Burnham (Spacey). Lester is a
42-year-old burnout case with an ambitious Realtor wife, Carolyn
(Annette Bening), whom he barely recognizes anymore, and a teenage
daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), who can barely stand to recognize
him.
</P>
<P>
   His reflections on his midlife limbo range from caustic (``See
the way the handles on Carolyn's pruning shears match her gardening
clogs? That's not accidental'') to offhandedly nihilistic (``I've
lost something. I'm not sure what it is, but I don't think I always
felt this ... sedated.'').
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are the new next-door neighbors. The father
(Chris Cooper) is a former Marine who gives his son regular urine
tests. The son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), is a philosopher with a
videocam who initially comes off as a standard-issue geek but
slowly reveals a far more complicated persona.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Carolyn's rival and object of abject worship: a
supersuccessful real estate broker (Peter Gallagher) with a
bumper-sticker approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   But our focus is mostly on Lester, a dead man walking who gets
his wake-up call during the halftime show at a high school
basketball game. Out there on the floor, doing the same ridiculous
Bob Fosse cum Michael Jackson routine as his daughter, is Angela
(Mena Suvari).
</P>
<P>
   She's Jane's best friend, and she immediately taps into the
libidinous core of Lester's paralysis. Her ripe, youthful promise
evokes visions of rose petals _ as soft and tender and fresh as her
firm young thighs. Of course, that's not exactly how Angela sees
herself. Smugly satisfied with her newfound power as a nymphet, she
takes a more prosaic view, telling Jane that if people who don't
even know her want to sleep with her, ``it means I really have a
shot at being a model.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens to these characters, individually and collectively,
is somehow startling and unavoidable. Especially Lester, who leaves
his boring job, starts smoking reefer with Ricky (they discuss the
greater meanings of ``Re-Animator'') and happily signs up to flip
hamburgers at a fast-food place.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' combines the compassion and quirkiness of a
James L. Brooks movie (``As Good as It Gets'') with the darker
charge of David Lynch during his ``Blue Velvet'' period. There's
also a touch of Jonathan Demme's sheer exuberant loopiness circa
``Melvin and Howard.''
</P>
<P>
   The world is turning upside down for these characters. Some know
it; some don't. Some learn it over the course of the movie. Thus
``American Beauty'' can invite us to enjoy Carolyn's comic
obliviousness while simultaneously asking us to embrace Lester's
sardonic despair. Or to marvel with Ricky at the mysterious joy of
discovering a small white paper bag delicately dancing in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is a portrait of America the Beautifully
Screwed Up. As Pogo so famously said, we have met the enemy and he
is us. But this beauty of a movie goes one step further. We are the
enemy. And we are forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty''

   Grade: A
</P>

   Starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Directed by Sam
Mendes. Rated R for strong sexuality, nudity, profanity, violence

 &HT;    A small town talks it all out in `Mumford'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' is the name of one of those sleepy American towns
where blooming vines twine around porch railings and folks say hi
to strangers. It's not quite the title setting in
``Pleasantville,'' but like the sparkling burg in ``Runaway
Bride,'' it's the kind of town you find only in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that's fine. As a writer or director, Lawrence Kasdan
has been responsible for some of the thrills of the first ``Star
Wars'' trilogy, Indiana Jones' first big adventure and cultural
touchstones such as ``The Big Chill'' and ``Body Heat.'' But he
also understands that sometimes a gentle, sunny character comedy is
a good enough reason to go to the multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' also happens to be the last name of a psychologist
(the engaging, boyish Loren Dean) whose mixture of empathy and
cut-to-the-chase directness have won him the town's largest client
list in the four months since he arrived. His habit of talking
publicly about his clients' kinks is both appealing and appalling
to the townsfolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your secret?'' asks his landlady, Lily (Alfre Woodard),
one of the few locals who isn't a client.
</P>
<P>
   His secret, when it's revealed, isn't such a big surprise. It's
not the point of the movie, either. Kasdan's slight comedy rests on
the shoulders of his superb character actors, each of whom has just
enough screen time to sketch a distinct impression.
</P>
<P>
   There's Sofie (Hope Davis), the wry divorcee whose official
complaint is chronic fatigue syndrome. As Mumford takes her on
therapeutic strolls, during which they start to fall in love, he
realizes that the real problem is her vicious mother (Dana Ivey).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's shopaholic Althea (Mary McDonnell), whose children
have insisted she seek therapy, and whose husband (Ted Danson, in a
priceless, snide cameo) is an investment banker who measures life
in brandy snifters and Cuban cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Pruitt Taylor Vince is a portly pharmacist whose fantasy life is
a jumble of film-noir sex stories _ like the ones Kasdan himself
drew on for ``Body Heat'' _ and Jason Lee plays a skateboarding
genius whose line of modems has made him a billionaire but left him
lonely. His secret project: to build the perfect,
computer-generated sexual companion.
</P>
<P>
   Kasdan lets Mumford sort through its problems, finding ways to
pair people off in reliable romantic-comedy fashion. He throws in
complications, via an irate lawyer (Martin Short) and rival
therapists (David Paymer and Jane Adams). But there's never any
doubt that all will end happily in a script that's held together by
Kasdan's smart but forgiving observations about human foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse ``Mumford'' with ``American Beauty,'' which also
opens today. Both toy with the secrets brewing beneath sunny
suburban surfaces. But ``Mumford'' is much lighter, and much more
disposable. It reassures audiences with the gentle illusion that
all we need to do is talk our problems through, that everything can
be worked out and made right. It's a gentle vacation from the
high-concept bangs and lowbrow laughs of most of the other movies
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee and Alfre Woodard.
Rated R for sex-related images, language and drug content.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 51 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An enjoyable minor ensemble comedy about a
therapist and his patients.

 &HT;    Earnest `Jakob the Liar' unsure of its mission
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you walk through the graves of the Holocaust's dead?
</P>
<P>
   Metaphorically, that's what a filmmaker has to decide when
addressing the atrocities of World War II. Does he wish to
memorialize the suffering of the victims or celebrate their
too-short lives? Does he approach this subject with respect? With
outrage? With giddy madness? Or maybe with laughter?
</P>
<P>
   Past directors have filtered the Holocaust through a wide range
of moods: the monolithic sobriety of documentaries such as
``Shoah,'' the intimate-epic dramas of ``Schindler's List,'' the
black comedy of ``Europa Europa,'' the daring, exuberant slapstick
of Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful.'' Given so many
sure-footed forebears, the last thing a filmmaker wants to do is
stumble aimlessly through this emotionally mined territory.
</P>
<P>
   That, unfortunately, is what ``Jakob the Liar'' does. It's a
plodding, well-intended comedy-drama drowned in a muddy palette of
grays and browns, thick with the odd sound of American actors using
fake Polish accents. Robin Williams plays Jakob, a Jewish former
restaurateur scraping along in a Nazi-controlled ghetto in the
final months of the war. By accident, he overhears news of a
Russian victory from a Nazi official's office radio. When he shares
the information with neighbors, they become convinced that he has a
radio hidden at home _ a crime punishable by death if discovered by
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Though he knows the dangers of the rumor, Jakob starts to invent
reports from the front, seeing how good news gives others in the
ghetto a reason to hope, to live. Given Williams' recent spate of
manipulative movies that encouraged audiences to laugh through
their tears (``What Dreams May Come,'' ``Patch Adams''), you cringe
when Jakob takes in an orphaned girl (Hannah Taylor Gordon),
knowing how mawkish Williams can get.
</P>
<P>
   But the film winds up surprising you, if not in welcome ways. It
keeps the goo to a minimum. Williams does impersonate a radio
broadcast to amuse the girl, but it's a restrained scene; after a
point, you wish Williams would go over the top and breathe some
life into the movie. His occasional comic moments only serve to
remind you of the fantastic, fablelike exaggerations Benigni risked
in his ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   A remake of an Oscar-nominated 1974 German movie, ``Jakob the
Liar'' shuffles to its end, uncertain whether it's a comedy or a
tragedy. Though the supporting cast _ including Alan Arkin, Bob
Balaban, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Liev Schreiber _ is wonderful, the
actors never emerge from the general background gloom.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Peter Kassovitz, whose son Mathieu made an
international splash in 1995 with his urban thriller ``La Haine
(Hate).'' Maybe the wrong Kassovitz directed this new movie.
``Hate'' had the sort of unapologetic rigor and speed that
``Jakob'' sorely needs. It is a respectable piece of work, but
ultimately it's what a film of this nature should never, ever be:
dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob
</P>
<P>
   the Liar''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams, Alan Arkin and Armin Mueller-Stahl.
Rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   An emotionally uneven, muddled fable about hope in the face of
horror.

MARIUCCI, WALSH TRY TO MAKE IT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Steve Mariucci has lost count of how many
television interviewers have heard him say that working for Bill
Walsh is an honor. But he knows exactly how many times the quote
has appeared on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not once,'' he said after Wednesday's practice. ``They always
cut it. Always.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci looked perplexed, as if he had no idea why his message
kept getting lost. He couldn't see that any time he pays homage to
Walsh, he's bound to sound predictable, maybe even insincere. In
fact, anyone who lavishes praise on a boss sounds like a spin
doctor at work.
</P>
<P>
   In Mariucci's case, the kind words disrupt a great soap opera
plot:
</P>
<P>
   Can the young coach find happiness answering to Walsh, the
imperious football dean, the gridiron genius, the Hall of Fame
coach who set the San Francisco 49er's dynasty on course?
</P>
<P>
   Can Walsh find happiness assembling the best team possible for
Mariucci, in helping the young coach try to match Walsh's own
legacy?
</P>
<P>
   Or does the team's general manager have an eye on someone else,
on a coach who wasn't hired by a departed team executive, a coach
who would be his ``chosen one,'' who would always be a reflection
of the football dean and, therefore, could never outshine him?
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. And in the meantime, remember this: If Walsh earned
the nickname ``the Professor,'' then Mariucci is ``the Prodigy.''
</P>
<P>
   His record as an NFL head coach stands at 26-8.
</P>
<P>
   Critics will argue that Mariucci was handed a great, veteran
team, and he has simply worked as a caretaker. But few fledgling
coaches go through the trauma Mariucci has endured.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci's first game as head coach resulted in CAT scans for
Steve Young and knee surgery for Jerry Rice. After that, Mariucci
couldn't live off his inheritance anymore. He had to earn his
success. The team reached the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   In his second season, the front office vaporized. The owners
engaged in sibling war games. The president resigned at the start
of training camp. The interim president tried to run the team from
Nashville. Most of the time, Mariucci was the only hand on the
rudder. Under him, the Niners played some of the most erratic,
exasperating and utterly thrilling football in franchise history.
They made the playoffs again and finally stifled Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   If Mariucci could succeed under those circumstances, he must
know what he's doing. If he and the Niners start to falter now,
Walsh will be as much to blame as anyone. He, in turn, can fault
Carmen Policy's funny math for the salary-cap jam the team faced
this offseason. But he can't pin it on Mariucci. The coach was 25-7
before Walsh. If his record takes a dive now, Walsh's reputation
must be attached to the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   They are in this together, the Professor and the Prodigy, all
the way. If it's an uncomfortable spot, Mariucci won't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the house that Bill Walsh built,'' Mariucci
said, gesturing to the practice fields and the team headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded like a dutiful son, which he is. He sends postcards
to his mother from road games. He chats with his parents on the
phone regularly.
</P>
<P>
   His office pays tribute to other authority figures. One wall is
decorated with pictures of all the coaches he has worked for, from
John Robinson to Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci's reverence for bosses can come across as deference,
and according to the football manual, head coaches defer to no one.
His smiling, let's-make-lemonade-from-lemons personality seems
almost naive at times. Superficially, it all adds up to weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci, who came to the Niners after one year as coach at the
University of California at Berkeley, has been accused of being too
``college'' to deal with pros. He has been accused of letting
veterans run the team in the past, and now of yielding too much to
Walsh by letting him address the players, usurping part of the
coaching role.
</P>
<P>
   Would a Bill Parcells or a Jimmy Johnson ever allow this? Both
left teams immediately after a Super Bowl appearance because they
battled their bosses. Mariucci didn't come from the same mold.
</P>
<P>
   But when Walsh became the Coach of the '80s, he was a different
sort of creature, too. On the sidelines, he looked as if he had
just stepped off the back nine. He had an elitist aura that galled
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tried to act like Vince Lombardi or Mike Holmgren or Bill
Walsh, it would be a big mistake,'' Mariucci said. ``I can learn
from all of them, but I can't be them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said Walsh has already taught him a lot about the politics of
NFL personnel. During offseason negotiations with agents, Walsh
often called in Mariucci and player personnel director Terry
Donahue to listen in on the conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like we script our first 15 plays, he had the whole
conversation written out in advance,'' the coach said. ```If they
say this, we say that.' It was like a game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci wishes the stories about conflict with Walsh would go
away. He also thinks his methods are occasionally misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let veterans run the team,'' he said. ``I allow the
veterans to be leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   So is he misrepresented completely? He put his chin on his fist,
thought for a few seconds, then smiled boyishly as he confessed:
``I am a little bit `college.'''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, after a 28-21 escape against the New Orleans
Saints, the usually ebullient coach looked almost grim. A spin
doctor might have put on a grin and ignored the fact that his
quarterback barely came out of the win alive.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci managed a few smiles, but at far less than his usual
wattage. Has anything changed in the last three years? ``I'm grayer
and balder,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't abandoned his collegiate zeal, and all the flak in
the world won't make him give it up.

TROUBLED PAST HAUNTS CHANG-RAE LEE'S NEW PROTAGONIST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``A Gesture Life''; By Chang-rae Lee; Riverhead Books, $23.95.) 
 
 
By LINDSAY HEINSEN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most auspicious first novels of recent years was
Chang-rae Lee's ``Native Speaker,'' winner of the PEN/Hemingway
Award for First Fiction in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This month the creative-writing professor at Hunter College
publishes his second novel, ``A Gesture Life,`` the touching,
perplexing memoir of a lifelong outsider.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator is Franklin Hata, retired medical supply salesman
and upstanding citizen of Bedley Run, a small community just north
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Hata, as the townspeople affectionately call him, is Korean
by birth, Japanese by culture and American by choice. The book's
opening finds him with a bit too much time on his hands, reflecting
obsessively on his status as a successful merchant and trusted town
elder.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Hata displays a nuanced grasp of what the surrounding
culture requires. Here he reminisces about buying a charming older
home in a picturesque neighborhood:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In towns like Bedley Run, and particularly on streets like
ours, being neighbors means sharing the most limited kinds of
intimacies, such as sewer lines and property boundaries ...
anything that falls to a more personal realm is only tentatively
welcomed. ... When I received welcome cards and sweets baskets from
my immediate neighbors, I judged the exact scale of what an
appropriate response should be. ... To reply with anything but the
quiet simplicity of a gracious note would be to ruin the delicate
and fragile balance. ... I must have given them the comforting
thought of how safe they actually were, how shielded, that an
interloper might immediately recognize and so heed the rules of
their houses.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In like fashion Hata has created his whole life, remaining on
the margins of Bedley Run while embracing, even personifying its
values. And yet the stasis is temporary. Before long, a series of
minor incidents will awaken painful memories and secrets,
triggering the agonizing self-appraisal that is the heart of this
book.
</P>
<P>
   We learn, for example, that the lifelong bachelor has an adopted
daughter, a Korean war orphan who arrived in Bedley Run decades
earlier, at the age of 7.
</P>
<P>
   Hata raised Sunny with his characteristic restraint and exacting
standards, producing an 18-year-old who taunts local police, rebels
sexually and confronts her father in a cold rage. ``All I've ever
seen is how careful you are with everything, how you sweep the
sidewalk and nice-talk to the other shopkeepers. You make a whole
life out of gestures and politeness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunny flees Bedley Run, heading for New York in the company of
her lover, a drug dealer. When the story opens, Hata hasn't heard
from her in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even more distressing, perhaps, are Hata's flashbacks to his
service in the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II, which
form the vivid, dramatic center of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Hata attempts to obscure his Korean heritage through slavish
devotion to the brutal values of his Japanese superiors. Then one
day a supply convoy arrives at his camp carrying not only sacks of
rice and dried fish for the troops but a small band of ``comfort
women,'' young Korean girls forced to service them sexually.
</P>
<P>
   ``That there were only five of them seems remarkable to me now,
given that there were nearly 200 men in the encampment,'' Hata
muses with stupefying detachment, ``but at the time I had no
thoughts of what was awaiting them in the coming days and nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet his distance soon is breached. As medical officer, he is
placed in charge of the girls. Speaking secretly to her in their
native language, he gains the trust of hopeless Kkutaeh, whose name
means ``bottom'' or ``last.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief interlude that follows provides Hata with his first
sexual experience and a devastating taste of dishonor. Realizing
that these girls may not last as long as the provisions that
arrived with them, he attempts to protect Kkutaeh with a tentative
act of bravery.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in his tale, words simply fail Hata, he of the pat
answers and calm facade. In the masterly hands of Chang-rae, he
renders the denouement of his wartime life in a kind of
pre-language, words and fragments enlisted to describe what no
words ever can.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Gesture Life'' is the touching, multilayered rumination of
an uneasy psyche. It is also a tragic, horrifying page-turner,
whose evocation of the pathetic comfort women and other wartime
victims is unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Chang-rae's structure seems unnecessarily complicated, with some
bewildering leaps through time and too few guideposts to help the
reader. And he gives Doc Hata several chances _ perhaps a few too
many? _ to redeem himself in the final pages.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``A Gesture Life'' is a deeply involving tale, no less so
because we realize, almost from the first chapter, that we can't
trust Hata's version of events. Chang-rae enlists the reader's full
energies to interpret this enigmatic speaker, who saddens, baffles
and infuriates us all at once.

SHOULD BUSH, GORE KEEP UP SPANISH? MANY SAY `SI'

By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Al Gore speaks his scripted Spanish haltingly, with an
accent so heavy that hearing him speak the language just might be
funnier than listening to Pepe Le Pew speak English.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how humorous and tortured the vice president's
attempts at Spanish may sound, few Hispanics are snickering.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush greets Latino crowds with a firm handshake and an
imperfect Spanish sprinkled with words in English. If the Texas
governor's Spanish sometimes leaves onlookers more confused than
enlightened, none complain.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of neglect and discrimination, most Hispanics say
they are delighted to see the two leading presidential candidates
try to speak their language _ no matter how rehearsed, contorted,
ungrammatical or downright unintelligible the result may sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's funny'' to hear Gore and Bush speak Spanish,
said Maria del Pilar Marrero, a reporter with La Opinion, a
Spanish-language daily newspaper in Los Angeles. ``But on the other
hand, people say it's good that they are trying to communicate with
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she added, ``let's see if they try to understand us.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bush first drummed up the confidence to roll his R's
in public as Texas governor, and he has continued the practice as
he campaigns for president. Not to be outdone, Democrat Gore has
memorized a few short Spanish phrases, which he repeats _ over and
over _ on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could be described as fluent.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Latinos are pleased. Some see the token use of cue-card
Spanish as a disingenuous effort to charm voters through symbols
rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys get an `A' for effort and an `F' in sincerity,''
said Rolando Becerra, a local Cuban-American who hosts a
Spanish-language radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an entirely unscientific survey of the first 10 people
entering a grocery store in Houston's predominantly East End
suggests that the idea of Anglo presidential candidates speaking
Spanish is quite popular among local Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 of those stopped spoke Spanish. Two were opposed, one had
no opinion, and the other seven said they considered it
``marvelous'' that Gore and Bush are speaking Spanish, no matter
how badly. Recent immigrants, who have themselves struggled with
the terror of daring to speak a second language in public, were
particularly willing to forgive the candidates' imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the two who opposed the idea of politicos speaking
Spanish were the only two interviewed who were bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're messing up our language,'' protested Elizabeth Garcia.
``We don't mess up their language, so why should they mess up
ours?''
</P>
<P>
   This country's stubbornly monolingual politicians have a long
history of messing up other people's languages, but their
linguistic transgressions have usually been forgiven. At the height
of the Cold War in 1963, President Kennedy stood before the Berlin
Wall and tried to capture the historic solemnity of the moment with
a few words of German. He said: ``Ich bin ein berliner`` (``I am a
jelly doughnut'').
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. The Germans understood that he meant to say
that West Berlin had become a symbol of freedom and that in the
broadest sense he considered himself one of the people of Berlin.
They cheered politely.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using a foreign language in a presidential campaign
caught on more recently. Democrat Michael Dukakis spoke competent
Spanish in his 1988 campaign, but it didn't win him the election.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush (with the ``W'' pronounced in Spanish, that's:
``George dub-LAY-oo Bush'') appears to have first shown off some
Spanish in public during his first term as governor, when he
recorded public service announcements. Discovering a good thing, he
went on to use the language in his gubernatorial re-election
campaign last year and has not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Bush captured about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 1998
re-election. National Republicans are hoping he can set a similar
record for a GOP candidate's share of the Latino presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Texas governor's reputation for being fluent baffles
most native Spanish speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the impression he spoke Spanish, but it isn't
true,'' said del Pilar Marrero. She said some observers may be
confusing Bush with his younger brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who
really is bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Turning more charitable, the journalist gives George W. credit
for understanding almost everything said to him in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gore's Spanish is much worse. His campaign has
spread the word that he is relearning the language he first picked
up during a high school summer spent in Mexico. But the vice
president clearly does not remember much. With a few unscripted
exceptions, his use of Spanish &UR;  &LR; is limited to a couple of
oft-repeated phrases, and even those he mispronounces badly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be too simple to condemn the candidates as insincere.
Even if their words in Spanish are sometimes practiced or
contrived, watching Gore and Bush attempt to speak the language can
reveal great insights into their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who finds Gore wooden in English ought to hear him try
Spanish, where the memorized words come slowly and with an odd
affectation, like a bookish high school valedictorian practicing
his commencement speech in front of a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his native language, Bush occasionally stands accused of
relying on charm to take him where preparedness lets him down. It's
doubly true in Spanish. The Texan will sometimes boldly move
forward to meet Spanish-speaking crowds, relying on language skills
a less courageous man might consider inadequate for the task at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   As the Spanish wire service EFE has noted, Bush speaks the
language poorly, ``but with great confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the influence all those immigrants and
their children will have on the presidential elections,
particularly the 30 million Americans of Hispanic descent. And a
chunk of those 30 million watch Spanish-language television.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, Univision, draws more than 4 million U.S. viewers to
at least one of its national news shows, and its credibility was
recently proven with an Emmy for reporting. Univision's chief
competitor, Telemundo, is also undergoing phenomenal growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles and Houston, Univision's local Spanish-language
newscasts now receive higher ratings than any single English
language news broadcast at the same times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish-language television has become a dominant force,''
said Rafael Buitrago, the editorial-page editor of La Opinion. He
notes that statewide California candidates, for the first time, put
together sophisticated Spanish-language television ad campaigns
last year. Other candidates are catching on.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing a translation of Al Gore saying, ``Our families deserve
the best,'' is not nearly as convincing as hearing the candidate
say the Spanish words in his own voice: ``Nuestras familias merecen
lo mejor.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore has shown a particular willingness to reach out to the
Spanish networks. While in Los Angeles to unveil his new
health-insurance proposal recently, Gore made a point of stopping
by Univision for an interview on the topic. He even offered a
couple of sentences in Spanish, before conducting the rest of the
interview in English.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians' willingness to discard all shame and speak
their butchered Spanish on television puts them in venerated
company. Other Anglos seen testing their limited language skills on
Spanish television are used-car dealers and ambulance-chasing
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the concern. If the candidates are learning
Spanish in the hope of better understanding culture, they will be
supported. But if it turns out that they have learned Spanish only
to win votes _ the way the most unscrupulous car dealers learn the
language to sell cars _ there could be a backlash.

 &HT;    ABCs losing out in the battle for our brains
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I used to think I was left-brained, not because I was
left-handed but because I was fairly good at things that
left-brained _ and some lame-brained _ people were supposed to be
good at. I could diagram sentences better than I could hit a curve,
and I went undefeated in spelling bees for three years running. I
still stumble on ``stiletto,'' the misspelling of which cost my
side of the room a weekend of no homework and very nearly cost me a
bloody nose from a class tough who had placed his bet on the
defending champ.
</P>
<P>
   Then I began to think maybe I was more right-brained than
left-brained. Left-brained people are also supposed to be good at
logic, and I wasn't always. But I seemed to have a certain
intuition at times _ unsuspected, to be sure, and contrary to the
blueprint. Intuition, the thinking went, resided on the right,
logic on the left.
</P>
<P>
   But I kept going back and forth, straddling my own head, not
sure whether I was thinking from this side or that side or whether,
indeed, the two of them together added up to full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, believe it or not, has to do with the rise and fall
of civilizations, the spread of monotheism and the winning of
women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   A surgeon's-eye view of the head
</P>
<P>
   First things first: Sandra Blakeslee, in the Arts &AMP; Ideas pages
of The New York Times two Saturdays ago, crystallized the picture
in a column whose peg was a book titled ``The Alphabet Versus the
Goddess'' (Viking Putnam, $24.95 hardback, $14.95 paperback) by
Leonard Shlain, a brain surgeon in San Francisco. It's Shlain's
contention, after sawing into who knows how many craniums, that the
development of an alphabet represented a break in the way the mind
works and societies organize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A civilization's principal means of communication,'' he
writes, ``molds it more than the content.'' Marshall McLuhantaught
us that the medium is the message, but without invasive procedures.
Shlain is more ambitious still, and where proof is absent he
defaults to cultural metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   With the invention of alphabets, he contends, primitive images
gave way to new ways of both communication and comprehension. As
they did so, the right brain became subordinate to the left brain
and remained so for five millennia or more. Point of clarification:
The right brain _ for reasons I don't quite grasp _ is believed to
be the ``feminine'' side, and the left brain the ``masculine''
side. Thus do men gravitate toward engineering, the sciences, top
management, important things like that, and women toward
homemaking, entertaining, the writing of thank-you notes.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the birth of abstract thinking
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of Shlain's title is simply this: Once alphabets
took hold, goddess worship went into decline. Masculine values
became ascendant. The religions of the West _ Judaism, Christianity
and Islam _ paid homage to a God said to be revealed by the Word.
As Blakeslee summarizes it, conceiving of a deity with no image
prepares the way for abstract thinking that leads to codes of law,
dualistic philosophy and the scientific method.
</P>
<P>
   East and West went their separate ways because literacy remained
ideographic for the one while becoming written for the other, with
consequences far-reaching. ``In the Arabian desert,'' Blakeslee
writes, ``Mohammed is given the gift of literacy and within a
couple of hundred years men are veiling their women and forbidding
them to shop.'' In Europe, Gutenberg's printing press not only
accelerated sales of the Bible, but set in motion the various
states of mind we today call sexist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, mirabile dictu (then again, maybe not), the electricians of
technology are rewiring us all. Even before computers, words began
giving way to images when photography and motion pictures became
principal forms of media, and television only carried things
further. In the public schools, posters and collages count somehow
as exposition of ideas, equivalent to what a student might be able
to put into words.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of cognition has changed altogether. Linear,
sequential thinking, the strength of the left-brained, isn't
compatible with the new software of rapidly changing images. The
right-brained are again on top. You don't think so? Then tell me
why the habitual channel surfer is almost always a male, in free
fall from ESPN2 to the Weather Channel to the Spice Channel. You'd
have thought it was simple attention deficit disorder, the national
disease.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Shlain tells us, left-brained men are reacting
to the continuously changing images that the right-brained are
comfortable with. Armed with his channel changer, the left-brained
male is looking for constancy in a medium _ and a world _ in which
nothing stays the same for long.

 &HT;    Parker tries hand at different brand of tough
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard enough for a man to get inside a woman's
head under normal circumstances. It's even more difficult in
fiction, especially if you're an author who has made his reputation
writing about a tough, muscular private eye.
</P>
<P>
   That's the situation Boston author Robert B. Parker found
himself in when he was asked to write a film project for actress
Helen Hunt. Instead of doing a screenplay, the creator of Spenser
offered to write a first-person novel with a female protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Family Honor'' (Putnam, $22.95), a whodunit
featuring Sunny Randall, a former Boston cop and aspiring painter.
The story focuses on Randall's rescue and subsequent guardianship
of the runaway daughter of a wealthy family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the idea for making her a painter when Helen Hunt told
me she liked to do primitive paintings,'' said Parker, 66, in a
telephone interview from Miami. Otherwise, he added, he did not
make the character a replica of Hunt. ``I wasn't thinking of Helen
when I wrote it; I was thinking of Sunny Randall.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker scoffs at a New York Times review that criticized him for
not making Randall as independent and tough as Spenser.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all,'' he said, ``Spenser is a former boxer who
weighs 200 or so pounds and has this physical strength. Sunny
Randall has to rely on her gun and her wits in dangerous
situations. I was under the continuous guidance of my wife, Joan
Parker, who is as female as anybody and a lot tougher than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hunt film is still in development, Parker said, but plans
are to start shooting in Boston next year.
</P>
<P>
   If the book and/or movie is successful, there may be more Sunny
Randall novels. Meanwhile, he is finishing the next Spenser novel
and working on the new Spenser television series on A&AMP;E starring
Joe Mantegna.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Family Honor,'' Parker admits it was fun writing a
novel from a woman's viewpoint, but not that enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what women think when they look at a man when I
started,'' he said, ``and I still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Family affair: Emmy Award-winning actress Alfre Woodard (
``Miss Evers' Boys,'' ``Down in the Delta'') has signed on to play
the ghost of a slave named Rachel in the DownSouth Filmworks'
production of ``Baby of the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooting will begin in mid-October on the film, which is based
on the 1989 New York Times Notable Book of the Year by St. Simons
(Ga.) author Tina McElroy Ansa.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard received an Oscar nomination for her performance in
``Cross Creek'' (1983), and won Emmys for recurring roles in the TV
dramas ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``L.A. Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Others signed on for the film include St. Simons novelist
William Diehl and actresses Sheryl Lee Ralph, Loretta Devine and
Vanessa Williams. Ansa is executive producer and her husband,
Jonee', is director of the independent film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby of the Family'' is the story of Lena, an African-American
child who is born with a caul and therefore, according to legend,
has the powers to see ghosts and predict the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  War stories: Most Americans are familiar with the horrors of
the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam war, but there's an
encouraging side to the story as well. Atlanta native Hugh Thompson
describes how he rescued nine South Vietnamese civilians in a new
biography, ``The Forgotten Hero of My Lai'' (Acadian House,
$19.95), written by journalist Trent Angers. The book explains
where Thompson got the moral courage to stand up to Lt. William
Calley and his men who were killing unarmed women, children and old
men.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Army helicopter pilot during the war, Thompson was
reunited with some of the people he saved on a 1998 segment of ``60
Minutes.''

 &HT;    Women's role rewritten, feminist says; masculinity still being
redefined
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By Cynthia Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For at least two decades, headlines have borne witness to the
crisis of the American male. From the terrorism of an alienated
veteran named Timothy McVeigh to the sexual antics of teenage
superstuds calling themselves the ``Spur Posse,'' from the despair
of downsized executives to the disappearance of fathers, the news
about men has not been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   In their attempt to deal with the upheaval that has shaken many
of them loose from the traditional male roles of provider and
protector, some men have gathered for ``Iron John'' weekends of
drumming and sweating; they have assembled by the hundreds of
thousands on the Mall in Washington for the Million Man March; they
have convened by the tens of thousands in stadiums under the banner
of Promise Keepers. Still, there has been no satisfactory
resolution of the predicament of the modern male, struggling to
regain or recast his masculinity as the millennium draws to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes feminist author Susan Faludi, attempting to find the
common thread running through the varied tapestry of the male
dilemma. Her book ``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man''
blames male anguish and alienation on a celebrity-worshipping,
consumer culture _ not coincidentally, the same forces which, she
says, oppress women.
</P>
<P>
   You may argue with the conclusions _ and many will _ but
``Stiffed'' is a tour de force of reportage, a remarkable
travelogue through American maleness in all its forms. Faludi
journeys from Promise Keepers to porn stars, from The Citadel to
the Dawg Pound of betrayed Cleveland Browns fans, from the jail
cell of a Los Angeles gangbanger to the movie-set trailer of
Sylvester ``Rambo'' Stallone. Along the way, she offers penetrating
insights and sharp analyses in highly readable and engaging prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, despite all their wartime heroics, the fathers
abandoned their sons, however inadvertently, in an image-based,
commercial-ruled world that they had largely created in their
postwar haste to embrace the good life,'' she writes. ``The fathers
had their reasons _ years of deprivation in the Depression followed
by the brutal hardships of World War II _ but what they bestowed
was a culture where the sons could not exercise the sorts of
traditional manhood that the fathers so judgmentally endorsed.
Symbolically speaking, what the fathers really passed on to their
sons was not the GI ethic but the GI Joe `action figure,' a
twelve-inch shrunken-man doll whose main feature was his ability to
accessorize.''
</P>
<P>
   Faludi gained remarkable access to men who might have been
secretive. The resulting portrayals are intimate, poignant and
sometimes funny. She follows Stallone as he turns aside his macho
action-hero image and gains weight to play a plodding, small-town
sheriff in an ensemble drama called ``Cop Land.'' But he can hardly
tolerate being seen with a paunch. ```This isn't me!' he recalled
telling people. `I'm doing this for a film!''' Another memorable _
and pathetic _ character Faludi encountered was a failed porn actor
named Cal Jammer, who committed suicide at the age of 34. Jammer's
success was thwarted by his ``wood problems,'' the industry's
euphemism for an inability to produce erections on command.
</P>
<P>
   Though Faludi is best known for her feminist polemic ``Backlash:
The Undeclared War Against American Women,'' her new book is no
attack on men. It is, instead, a sympathetic account of the lives
of men who have been tossed about by forces beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder men are so misperceived; they are always seen as in
control; their problems all of their own making,'' she writes.
``What if we were to consider men as the subjects of their world,
not just its authors? What if we put aside for a time the
assumption of male dominance, put away our feminist rap sheet of
men's crimes and misdemeanors, or our anti-feminist indictment of
women's heist of male authority _ and just looked at what men have
experienced in the past generation? Even the most `powerful' man
has had at least as much happen to him as he has made happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the exhaustive reporting, ``Stiffed'' is more
impressionistic than scholarly. Faludi paints vivid portraits of
individual men, but some of her broader conclusions about the male
dilemma are unsupported. As just one example of such overreaching,
she casts the generation of World War II veterans as poor fathers
who couldn't or wouldn't ``teach their sons to be men.'' Indeed,
she encounters several baby boomers who describe fathers who
abandoned or abused them, either physically or psychically. But
that may be a result of the pool of men about whom she chose to
write _ many of whom represent the notorious male meltdowns of the
past several years.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, ``Stiffed'' is devoted to the notion
that the feminist movement does not present a threat to healthy
masculinity, a manhood that should be, in Faludi's view, based on
``character, on the inner qualities of stoicism, integrity,
reliability, the ability to shoulder burdens, the willingness to
put others first, the desire to protect and provide and
sacrifice.'' Unfortunately, that peaceful co-existence of feminism
and a recast masculinity may be difficult to achieve. More than any
other factors _ including a transformed economy and the celebrity
culture _ the changing roles of women seem to have precipitated the
crisis of the modern American male.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Faludi's book is a provocative reminder that both men and
women are struggling in the aftershocks of seismic cultural shifts.
``Stiffed'' may help us move past the politics of blame that has
characterized too much of the public conversation.

 &HT;    Crafting a mountain homecoming
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tennessee Fall Homecoming, the mountain heritage festival
celebrating its 20th anniversary next month at the Museum of
Appalachia in Norris, Tenn., was never meant to become a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I had this great vision,'' says festival and
museum founder John Rice Irwin. ``I just thought it would be a
one-time affair.''
</P>
<P>
   To be held this year Oct. 7-10, the festival began in 1979 when
an independent book distributor contacted Irwin and asked him for
help selling several titles on the history of southern Appalachia.
The distributor brought the books to the museum, located at Irwin's
60-acre homestead in Norris, 16 miles north of Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin hyped the book sale by scheduling performances by local
bluegrass musicians. He also asked some neighbor ladies to bring
over apple butter and hominy, and publicized the event with
appearances on local TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe 50 people would show up,'' Irwin says. ``But
we had a few hundred, and a lot of people asked if I was going to
do it again. That got me to thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Irwin expects 50,000 people to swarm the festival
grounds. More than 250 music acts will perform, including the great
bluegrass banjo player Ralph Stanley (noon and 3 p.m. Oct. 7) and
bluegrass/country star Ricky Skaggs (2 p.m. Oct. 10).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 200 craftspeople from the region will
demonstrate activities such as molasses making (by mule-drawn
mill), whittling and blacksmithing.
</P>
<P>
   And those simple servings of apple butter and hominy have grown
into an indigenous feast of country ham, fried pies, pit barbecue,
corn bread and homemade desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Festivalgoers can also wander through the sprawling museum,
which covers 20 acres of Irwin's property. More than 250,000 pieces
of memorabilia are showcased in two large display buildings, an
antebellum inn and 30 log structures.
</P>
<P>
   Among the relics: a grandfather clock owned by Sam Houston and
an old tax return by Cordell Hull, the Byrdstown, Tenn., native who
served as secretary of state for Franklin D. Roosevelt. Turns out
ol' Cordell claimed a deduction for his wife's dentures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 9 a.m.-dark Oct. 7-10. Admission: $15-$20 adults,
$5 children 6-12; under 6 free. Oct. 6 is student day (9 a.m.-4
p.m.), with limited music performances and youth-oriented games
(tug-of-war, stilt-walking). For information or a free brochure,
call 423-494-7680.

 &HT;    Artifacts for afterlife on view in Birmingham and New York
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 26.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the prospect of the end of this century has whetted the
appetite for timeless art. Artifacts from ancient Egypt, most of
which were destined to help the dead to enjoy an eternal afterlife,
are on display this fall in special exhibitions in New York,
Richmond and, closer to home, in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Searching for Ancient Egypt,'' opening Oct. 3 at the
Birmingham Museum of Art, takes a panoramic view of Egyptian
culture from 5000 B.C. to A.D. 500.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pennsylvania has loaned 130 objects acquired
through a century of excavation for this traveling exhibition,
which is co-organized by the Dallas Museum of Art. It includes a
rich array of objects, from stone portrait sculpture, mummy cases
and a papyrus ``Book of the Dead'' to mirrors, jewelry and wine
jars. The entire west wall of a 4,300-year-old funerary chapel is
the show's architectural centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is intended to chronicle everyday life in ancient
Egypt. There is also a special section of Nubian art. Visitors can
take a tour via a random access CD-ROM audio guide, which permits
them to select which objects they want to know more about. They can
also visit the nearby McWane Center to view the IMAX film,
``Mysteries of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has borrowed 250
works from more than 30 museums for the international loan show,
``Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids.'' It examines the first
great epoch in Egypt dating from 2650 to 2150 B.C., known as the
Old Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition includes sculpture, relief painting and
decorative arts. The variety and individuality of the many
sculptures of royalty and high officials in stone show how ancient
artists worked within rigid stylistic parameters to produce such
personalized portraits as the seated version of a flabby Hemiunu,
the prince in charge of building the Great Pyramid. Delicate relief
carvings are similarly lively and often reveal a sensitivity to
nature as well.

   By the end of today, The New York Times Syndicate will move a
special appreciation of actor George C. Scott by writer Ivor Davis,
including never-before-published excerpts from one of Scott's final
interviews, conducted earlier this year. Scott looks back on his
career, explains his philosophy of acting and remembers the
director Stanley Kubrick, who directed Scott's personal favorite of
his own films _ ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964) _ and why he refused
Kubrick's offer to appear in the classic film, ``2001.''

`JAKE THE SNAKE' CONTENT AS A CARDINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ This is the week the San Francisco 49ers
get a look at their future that got away. When they play the
Arizona Cardinals on Monday night amid the saguaros and ocotillos,
they will be opposed by quarterback Jake Plummer, Jake the Snake.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers could have drafted Plummer in 1997. They had the 26th
pick in the first round that year and were hankering for their
mythical Quarterback of the Future. They are still hankering. Their
choices at that point were Jim Druckenmiller or Plummer _ the man
with a cannon for an arm or the man with a Swiss Army knife in his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Much revisionist history has gone on since then, but simply put,
Steve Mariucci, Dwight Clark and Vinny Cerrato agreed on
Druckenmiller while Bill Walsh, who was not associated with the
49ers at the time, preferred Plummer because he reminded him of Joe
Montana for all his intangibles and leadership ability.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Clark, Cerrato and Druckenmiller are no longer
with the 49ers, and Walsh is back in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comparison,'' said Charles Haley, the 49ers' 35-year-old
pass rusher. ``I saw him (Plummer) throw more interceptions in his
first two games (this year) than Joe threw his entire career when I
was here. Jake is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway. Plummer, for all the excitement he has
generated as the future of the Cardinals franchise, is off to a
miserable start in 1999. In fact, he's the lowest-rated quarterback
in the league _ 29.1 _ based largely on one touchdown pass vs.
seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has completed 48 percent of his passes, 36 of 75, for
386 yards. A banged-up right thumb hasn't helped.
</P>
<P>
   Before being traded to Miami for a pizza to be named later,
Druckenmiller started one game as a 49er, at St. Louis in 1997, and
through no fault of his own emerged as the winning quarterback in
an artless outing. Because the Cardinals needed a Quarterback of
the Now, Plummer has started 27 games over two-plus seasons and has
a record of 13-14 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun yet pointless to speculate on what would have happened
if the 49ers had drafted Plummer instead of Druckenmiller. Would
Plummer have started 27 games by now? Not likely, given Steve
Young's ability to remain alive despite the best efforts of
defensive players around the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had gone there I wouldn't be on a telephone conference
call ... talking about starting, because Steve Young is starting
down there,'' Plummer said Wednesday. ``So I'd be riding the pine
behind him. I thought there might be a chance they might pick me. I
knew I'd sit there. I was happy to come here to Arizona. I couldn't
be happier with the way things turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Plummer would have hastened Young's transition to a
life free from meetings, maulings and Monday morning ruminations on
the radio. After all, Young's presence convinced the 49ers in 1993
to part with the godlike Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope, with my performance, I keep playing great football,''
Young said in deflecting the hypothetical angle. ``That's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point in their history, the 49ers did not hurt
themselves by drafting Druckenmiller, then trading him away for a
box of staples and a package of Post-its. Neither did they help
themselves by not taking Plummer, who is much more suited to their
offense than Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor, of course, to have a guy as well-known and
admired around the league as Bill Walsh compare me to a guy who's
even more well-known and admired,'' Plummer said. ``But it's not
something where I ... puff up my chest and say I'm going to be the
next Joe Montana.''

MAKER OF DRUG TESTS FACES QUESTIONS FROM SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLAIRE HUGHES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINDERHOOK, N.Y. _ When a company's stock price has taken a
beating and legal costs are eating up profits despite record sales,
stockholders are apt to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what about 70 shareholders of American Bio Medica
Corp. did Wednesday at their annual meeting at the company's new
headquarters, a 30,000-square-foot building in the middle of a
cornfield in Columbia County.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes easy-to-use kits that test urine for the
presence of as many as nine substances, and can offer immediate
results. The products, marketed under the name Rapid Drug Screen,
are in great demand among clients like hospitals and employers who
screen job applicants for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The market for the Rapid Drug Screen has grown so much that
American Bio Medica sales grew to $7 million in its last fiscal
year, up from $2 million the year before. With a national
distribution agreement with Abbott Laboratories well under way and
clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on a new
9-drug product, company Vice President of Sales Jay Bendis
predicted sales would reach $13 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company lost $1.7 million during its last fiscal
year. Key among its problems have been high manufacturing costs and
legal fees. Company officials attempted to reassure the
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profit eluded us mostly due to gross (operating) margins and
legal fees,'' said company President Stan Cipkowski. ``We hope that
both of those issues will be settled going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   American Bio Medica officials said they plan to begin making
in-house some components of the drug-test kits that are now
contracted out to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company faces a lingering legal issue, a patent infringement
suit that American Bio Medica is fighting against four other
companies it says have copied its technology and designs. Cipkowski
said he didn't expect those kinds of battles to ever go away, as
the company will need to defend itself against patent theft as it
continually improves its products.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern to shareholders was a recent warning letter
American Bio Medica received from the FDA. The FDA said American
Bio Medica didn't notify the federal agency, as required, about a
significant change in the way results are calculated in one of its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Casterlin, American Bio Medica vice president of
operations, said the company wrote to the FDA on Sept. 15 defending
its actions, and that the agency has until Sept. 30 to respond.

SHOULD BUSH, GORE KEEP UP SPANISH? MANY SAY `SI'

By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Al Gore speaks his scripted Spanish haltingly, with an
accent so heavy that hearing him speak the language just might be
funnier than listening to Pepe Le Pew speak English.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how humorous and tortured the vice president's
attempts at Spanish may sound, few Hispanics are snickering.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush greets Latino crowds with a firm handshake and an
imperfect Spanish sprinkled with words in English. If the Texas
governor's Spanish sometimes leaves onlookers more confused than
enlightened, none complain.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of neglect and discrimination, most Hispanics say
they are delighted to see the two leading presidential candidates
try to speak their language _ no matter how rehearsed, contorted,
ungrammatical or downright unintelligible the result may sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's funny'' to hear Gore and Bush speak Spanish,
said Maria del Pilar Marrero, a reporter with La Opinion, a
Spanish-language daily newspaper in Los Angeles. ``But on the other
hand, people say it's good that they are trying to communicate with
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she added, ``let's see if they try to understand us.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bush first drummed up the confidence to roll his R's
in public as Texas governor, and he has continued the practice as
he campaigns for president. Not to be outdone, Democrat Gore has
memorized a few short Spanish phrases, which he repeats _ over and
over _ on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could be described as fluent.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Latinos are pleased. Some see the token use of cue-card
Spanish as a disingenuous effort to charm voters through symbols
rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys get an `A' for effort and an `F' in sincerity,''
said Rolando Becerra, a local Cuban-American who hosts a
Spanish-language radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an entirely unscientific survey of the first 10 people
entering a grocery store in Houston's predominantly East End
suggests that the idea of Anglo presidential candidates speaking
Spanish is quite popular among local Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 of those stopped spoke Spanish. Two were opposed, one had
no opinion, and the other seven said they considered it
``marvelous'' that Gore and Bush are speaking Spanish, no matter
how badly. Recent immigrants, who have themselves struggled with
the terror of daring to speak a second language in public, were
particularly willing to forgive the candidates' imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the two who opposed the idea of politicos speaking
Spanish were the only two interviewed who were bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're messing up our language,'' protested Elizabeth Garcia.
``We don't mess up their language, so why should they mess up
ours?''
</P>
<P>
   This country's stubbornly monolingual politicians have a long
history of messing up other people's languages, but their
linguistic transgressions have usually been forgiven. At the height
of the Cold War in 1963, President Kennedy stood before the Berlin
Wall and tried to capture the historic solemnity of the moment with
a few words of German. He said: ``Ich bin ein berliner`` (``I am a
jelly doughnut'').
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. The Germans understood that he meant to say
that West Berlin had become a symbol of freedom and that in the
broadest sense he considered himself one of the people of Berlin.
They cheered politely.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using a foreign language in a presidential campaign
caught on more recently. Democrat Michael Dukakis spoke competent
Spanish in his 1988 campaign, but it didn't win him the election.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush (with the ``W'' pronounced in Spanish, that's:
``George dub-LAY-oo Bush'') appears to have first shown off some
Spanish in public during his first term as governor, when he
recorded public service announcements. Discovering a good thing, he
went on to use the language in his gubernatorial re-election
campaign last year and has not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Bush captured about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 1998
re-election. National Republicans are hoping he can set a similar
record for a GOP candidate's share of the Latino presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Texas governor's reputation for being fluent baffles
most native Spanish speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the impression he spoke Spanish, but it isn't
true,'' said del Pilar Marrero. She said some observers may be
confusing Bush with his younger brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who
really is bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Turning more charitable, the journalist gives George W. credit
for understanding almost everything said to him in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gore's Spanish is much worse. His campaign has
spread the word that he is relearning the language he first picked
up during a high school summer spent in Mexico. But the vice
president clearly does not remember much. With a few unscripted
exceptions, his use of Spanish &UR;  &LR; is limited to a couple of
oft-repeated phrases, and even those he mispronounces badly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be too simple to condemn the candidates as insincere.
Even if their words in Spanish are sometimes practiced or
contrived, watching Gore and Bush attempt to speak the language can
reveal great insights into their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who finds Gore wooden in English ought to hear him try
Spanish, where the memorized words come slowly and with an odd
affectation, like a bookish high school valedictorian practicing
his commencement speech in front of a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his native language, Bush occasionally stands accused of
relying on charm to take him where preparedness lets him down. It's
doubly true in Spanish. The Texan will sometimes boldly move
forward to meet Spanish-speaking crowds, relying on language skills
a less courageous man might consider inadequate for the task at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   As the Spanish wire service EFE has noted, Bush speaks the
language poorly, ``but with great confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the influence all those immigrants and
their children will have on the presidential elections,
particularly the 30 million Americans of Hispanic descent. And a
chunk of those 30 million watch Spanish-language television.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, Univision, draws more than 4 million U.S. viewers to
at least one of its national news shows, and its credibility was
recently proven with an Emmy for reporting. Univision's chief
competitor, Telemundo, is also undergoing phenomenal growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles and Houston, Univision's local Spanish-language
newscasts now receive higher ratings than any single English
language news broadcast at the same times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish-language television has become a dominant force,''
said Rafael Buitrago, the editorial-page editor of La Opinion. He
notes that statewide California candidates, for the first time, put
together sophisticated Spanish-language television ad campaigns
last year. Other candidates are catching on.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing a translation of Al Gore saying, ``Our families deserve
the best,'' is not nearly as convincing as hearing the candidate
say the Spanish words in his own voice: ``Nuestras familias merecen
lo mejor.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore has shown a particular willingness to reach out to the
Spanish networks. While in Los Angeles to unveil his new
health-insurance proposal recently, Gore made a point of stopping
by Univision for an interview on the topic. He even offered a
couple of sentences in Spanish, before conducting the rest of the
interview in English.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians' willingness to discard all shame and speak
their butchered Spanish on television puts them in venerated
company. Other Anglos seen testing their limited language skills on
Spanish television are used-car dealers and ambulance-chasing
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the concern. If the candidates are learning
Spanish in the hope of better understanding culture, they will be
supported. But if it turns out that they have learned Spanish only
to win votes _ the way the most unscrupulous car dealers learn the
language to sell cars _ there could be a backlash.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GIZA, Egypt _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Sunday will
extend his reign in a way befitting the land of the pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   Unopposed in a planned referendum, Mubarak will win his fourth
six-year term from Egyptians accustomed to distant leaders and
limited options.
</P>
<P>
   The stocky son of humble origins in the Nile delta is already
Egypt's longest serving president. He has held office 18 years,
surpassing such giants as Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hardly has their charisma or ego, the 71-year-old
ex-bomber pilot has championed ``mega-projects'' that literally
divert the Nile and create new cities. He has stabilized his
country's once-bankrupt economy, though poverty is still widespread
among the 67 million people.
</P>
<P>
   He re-established Egypt's status as the most influential Arab
country, with a foreign policy based on a closeness with the United
States. Finally, he has contained terrorists that seek to replace
his regime with one based on fundamental Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But, Egyptians wonder whether Mubarak can now set aside his
government's authoritarian tactics and create a modern democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups count thousands of political prisoners in
Egyptian jails where torture, including electric shock, is
systematic. Even Mubarak's campaign tours are preceded with
sweeping arrests of locals. Egyptian officials say they only jail
members of terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The slums of the Imbaba area of downtown Giza has seen both
sides of the Mubarak rule _ the hard edge and the public works.
</P>
<P>
   Here, 800,000 people live on streets strewn with trash and
rutted by donkey carts. Retired construction worker Fathi Mabruk
broke into wry laughter when asked if he will vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? You think I am going to tell you if I'm not,'' he said,
drawing his index finger across his throat.
</P>
<P>
   This was once a stronghold for anti-government Islamists. Six
years ago, Mubarak sent thousands of troops and armored cars onto
these streets. They jailed many, including Imams who were replaced
in their mosques by other religious leaders friendly to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Mubarak followed up with badly needed sewage systems,
water service and health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   His National Democratic Party held a rally there last week. He
did not attend, but the roads were lined with signs, such as,
``Yes, Mubarak, president for life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government provides all these services, the least I can
do is vote,'' construction worker Mabruk conceded, as a government
worker urged him to hang a campaign poster.
</P>
<P>
   Salah Eissa, a political writer and leader of a drive to
establish a parliamentary democracy, said Mubarak phased out
Egypt's old socialist economic approach. But, he held off needed
political reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the closest thing to an absolute monarchy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is some latitude for free speech, political parties
must be approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian law lets the president control the parliament, appoint
local governors, and keep the country under sweeping emergency
powers allowing detention without trials.
</P>
<P>
   Eissa's coalition, including political parties and human rights
groups, calls for an end to the emergency law, a scaling back of
presidential powers and free elections.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Mubarak has had to focus on the economy before
political reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``His priority was not the constitution,'' said Nabil Osman,
chairman of the Egyptian state information service and close
Mubarak aide. ``His priority was the bankrupt economy. A
constitutional debate would not unify the country. It would have
divided the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech to college students, Mubarak made vague
promises of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the forthcoming period,'' he said. ``We shall not hesitate
to achieve changes or reforms that enhance the participation of
citizens in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   But, questions about what that means highlight how closed
Egyptian politics are.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of change? Only the president will know,'' Osman
said. ``He is the only one. He is studying it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional adds follow.)
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak is famous, and sometimes criticized, for his studious
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Born in a farming community in the Nile delta, he rose through
the Egyptian Air Force to become a bomber pilot, receiving training
twice in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   He flew missions in the 1956 and 1967 wars against Israel. He
commanded the air force in its surprise attack on Israel,
considered a huge success in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, 1981, Mubarak and Sadat were reviewing a parade
commemorating the 1973 war. Militants in the army attacked the
reviewing stand and killed Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   The assassins opposed the peace Sadat had made with Israel and,
some say, the brush with death is one reason the cautious Mubarak
has only traveled to Israel once.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has little of Sadat's imperial manner. He uses a
common-man's Arabic and occasionally drives his own Mercedes-Benz
in official motor pools.
</P>
<P>
   At 71, he is said to be an avid squash player and not yet
entertaining notions of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very simple man and a very modest man,'' said Osama
El-Ghazali Harb, editor of the semi-official International Politics
Review and a member of the Egyptian parliament. ``He insists he is
not a politician by profession and came to politics accidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, Mubarak has followed Sadat's path in peace, reaffirming
relations with Israel even while much of the Egyptian press has
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   That has helped seal relations with the United States. Egypt
receives $2 billion a year in U.S. aid, second only to Israel's
nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has put the aid, and Egyptian money, into thousands of
health clinics and industrial complexes. His government oversaw the
$7 billion Cairo subway, a badly needed and popular transportation
system.
</P>
<P>
   His largest project is the diversion of water from the Nile to
create new farmlands in the desert. It is expected to cost more
than $40 billion when completed.
</P>
<P>
   But, the country's illiteracy rates still hover around 50
percent and government bureaucracy is still notoriously lethargic.
</P>
<P>
   The political scene is especially lifeless and few feel Sunday's
referendum is anything but a democratic facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is challenging the power of the regime itself,'' said
Walid Kazziha, political scientist at the American University in
Cairo. ``In that sense, the regime has been successful.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George C. Scott, an actor of extraordinary range and daring,
celebrated for his performances as Gen. George S. Patton Jr. in the
movie ``Patton'' and as Shakespeare's Richard III in Central Park,
was found dead Wednesday afternoon at his home in Westlake Village,
40 miles northwest of Los Angeles. He was 71 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was described as ``a natural death from a
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,'' by Dr. Janice Frank, who
conducted the autopsy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With a clear, articulate understanding of character and an
almost volcanic intensity, Scott created a gallery of indelible
portraits on stage and screen. Often cast in sinister roles, he
played killers and con men, gamblers and thieves. But he also
played doctors and social workers and so many lawyers, for the
defense and the prosecution, that he could have taken up law as an
alternative profession.
</P>
<P>
   In common with Marlon Brando he was a natural, intuitive actor,
but unlike Brando he scorned the Actors Studio and its Method.
Unpredictable in the extreme, Scott carried with him a threat of
violence, which was one reason he was often cast as a villain. He
came alive onstage, with a visceral awareness of the power of
performance. Acting in front of audience, he once said, was like
``riding a terrific roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did he play losers. Even when one of his characters
seemed to fail, he would come out of the ordeal with inner
resilience. Scott's force of personality was irrepressible: it was
hard for him to play simple, ordinary men. Passion rather than
tenderness was his forte, but when called upon he could project
sensitivity, as he did as a vulnerable doctor in love in the 1968
film ``Petulia.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was playing a leading or a supporting role he was
generally the dominant figure. With equal ease, he portrayed
characters of contrasting ethics and temperament. On screen in
``The Hustler'' (1961), appearing with Paul Newman, he was a
high-stakes gambler with an allegiance only to himself. Onstage in
``The Andersonville Trial'' in 1959 he was a prosecuting attorney
with a keen sense of moral purpose. Though he was most identified
with dramatic roles, he was also adept at comedy, moving easily
from Eugene O'Neill to Noel Coward.
</P>
<P>
   Both in theater and in movies, audiences were riveted by his
magnetism. Tall and lithe as a young man, he became heavier as he
grew older. He conveyed a sense of authority, as if to say, don't
tread on me. His features, sharp and chiseled, could have been
sculptured by Rodin. In his voice was a raspy rumble. He could be
chilling, both in manner and in speech.
</P>
<P>
   A perfectionist, Scott was as demanding on himself as he was on
his colleagues. Because of his fiery temper, he acquired a
reputation for being difficult. He had no time for career-building.
Throughout his life, he remained independent, avoiding long-term
contracts and sometimes changing his mind about doing a role at the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood he was considered a renegade. He declined three
straight nominations for Academy Awards, for his performances in
``Anatomy of a Murder,'' ``The Hustler'' and ``Patton,'' not for
any self-doubts about his acting but because he reacted against the
``childish and damaging unnatural competitiveness'' of the awards.
Despite his attitude, he won an Oscar in 1971 as best actor for
``Patton,'' a role for which he was also honored by the New York
Film Critics and the National Society of Film Critics. The next
year he won an Emmy for his work in Arthur Miller's play ``The
Price'' on television. He refused that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Patton became the defining role of his career. When he made a
sequel to the film for television in 1986, he said, ``After 35
years in the business, people still identify me more with Patton
than any other character.'' No wonder: from the opening moment of
the film he  &UR; was &LR;  Patton. An American flag fills the entire screen
as Scott, all spit and polish, strides on and delivers a smart
salute. ``All Americans love the sting of battle,'' he says.
``That's why we never lost a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Scott's performance in a Broadway revival of ``Death of a
Salesman,'' the director and critic Harold Clurman said: ``He is an
actor of tremendous clout. He is always vivid, never less than
arresting. He is one of the few American actors who create the
impression of a mature manliness: most others strike me as grown-up
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Offstage as well as in character, he projected a swaggering
self-assurance. When he was in the marines, he broke his nose five
times: hence his craggy look. Then and later he made no secret
about his drinking, describing himself as a ``functioning
alcoholic.'' His life was marred and his career damaged by drunken
tantrums and barroom brawls. He was married five times, twice to
Colleen Dewhurst, with whom he often appeared on stage, and he had
several well-publicized romances, including one with Ava Gardner,
who starred with him in the film ``The Bible.'' Since 1972, he had
been married to the actress Trish Van Devere.
</P>
<P>
   He made his New York debut as ``Richard III'' for the New York
Shakespeare Festival in 1957, at the Hecksher Theater in Central
Park. After that came several decades of prolific and rewarding
work in theater and films, but increasingly he seemed to shy away
from challenging himself. Although the natural progression would
have been for him eventually to play King Lear, ``The Merchant of
Venice'' was his last effort at Shakespeare. He also missed other
titanic roles for which he was suited. When he went back to
Broadway in 1991, it was as a cozy curmudgeon in ``On Borrowed
Time,'' by Paul Osborn, and two years later he was Off Broadway in
``Wrong Turn at Lungfish,'' an undemanding comedy about blindness
and old age.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was on Broadway again in a revival of ``Inherit the
Wind'' as a lawyer based on Clarence Darrow. It was the kind of
flamboyant role that should have been the capstone of his career.
But he became ill during rehearsal and the opening was postponed.
When the play finally opened, Scott received favorable notices and
was nominated for a Tony award, an honor that had previously eluded
him. Because of illness, he missed several performances. Once he
left the stage in the middle of the show and was replaced by Tony
Randall, who produced the play through his National Actors Theater.
Subsequently, it was disclosed that Scott had an aortic aneurism.
</P>
<P>
   Further clouding his triumphant year an actress who had been his
personal assistant accused him of sexual harassment. Early in May
1996 he left ``Inherit the Wind'' and went to California for
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   George Campbell Scott, the grandson of a coal miner, was born on
Oct. 18, 1927, in the Appalachian coal town Wise, Va. Faced by the
Depression, his father moved his family to Detroit, where he worked
on the Buick assembly line and later became a businessman. His
mother, a semi-invalid, was an amateur poet and elocutionist who
gave recitations; she died when her son was 8, and he was brought
up by his older sister, Helen. At Redford High School in Detroit he
was an athlete and aspiring writer of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   After he graduated in 1945, he joined the marines. Missing
combat duty, he spent four years at a desk job in Washington and on
the graves detail at Arlington National Cemetery. Looking back on
his military days, he said, ``I stayed drunk most of the time.''
After his discharge, he enrolled at the University of Missouri
School of Journalism. Casually he tried out for and won a role in a
student production of Terence Rattigan's play ``The Winslow Boy.''
His pleasure in performance was immediate. ``I was hooked,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been difficult to subjugate myself to a part
because I don't like myself too well,'' he once told an
interviewer. ``Acting was, in every sense, my means of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In search of a career, he played more than 125 roles in stock
companies and moved to Washington, where he supported himself as a
construction worker. By that time, he was in his second marriage.
In 1956 he came to New York and worked nights operating a
check-sorting machine in a bank while trying with increasing
futility during the days to find acting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 having been an actor for seven years but with no
success, he was about to give up the theater. ``I had failed over
and over,'' he said. ``I had been failing that whole year. I was as
low as anyone could be.'' Then he heard about the forthcoming
production of ``Richard III,'' for Joseph Papp's newly formed New
York Shakespeare Festival. He managed to get an audition, was
called back for a second time and by his own measure failed the
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to drink,'' he said. ``And I got very depressed. I
said, `I can't let this job go.' I called and begged for another
chance.'' He was allowed to read again, and prepared himself by
memorizing two soliloquies. ``After two or three days of agony, Joe
called and said, `You got the job.' I damned near died.''
</P>
<P>
   Totally unknown and inexperienced in Shakespeare, he made his
New York debut, outdoors, in one of the most demanding of classical
roles, and he was mesmerizing. Critics soared into superlatives and
four decades later Scott's Richard is remembered by those who saw
it as the towering performance of Shakespeare in the park, the one
that all others are measured against. Scott said years later that
not a day went by that he did not think of his early Shakespearean
performances. It was for him the best of times.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Richard III'' his career took off. Two months later he
played the melancholic Jacques in ``As You Like It,'' and quickly
followed that as the diabolical Lord Wainwright in a revival of
``Children of Darkness'' at Circle in the Square. For all three
roles played within the space of one year he won a series of acting
awards. In ``Children of Darkness'' his co-star was Ms. Dewhurst.
They soon became acting partners, a tempestuous couple on and off
stage. (They were married in 1960, divorced, married again and
divorced.) As ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' they were, said Scott, in
an emotional sense ``like two drunken lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ms. Van Devere; a daughter,
Victoria, from his first marriage, to Carolyn Hughes; a son,
Matthew, and another daughter, Devon Scott, from his second
marriage, to Patricia Reed; and two other sons, Alexander and
Campbell, an actor, from his marriage to Ms. Dewhurst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, only a year after ``Richard III,'' he made his Broadway
debut in ``Comes a Day,'' opposite Judith Anderson. Playing a
psychopath, every evening he decapitated a pet bird onstage. On the
strength of that malicious performance, he won his role as a
prosecutor in Otto Preminger's ``Anatomy of a Murder'' (his second
movie; his first was ``The Hanging Tree,''in which he played a
villain).
</P>
<P>
   From then on, his twin career was in overdrive. He played a
prosecutor in the Civil War drama ``The Andersonville Trial,'' a
hero of the Warsaw Ghetto in ``The Wall'' and he did three comic
roles in Neil Simon's ``Plaza Suite'' on Broadway, ``The Merchant
of Venice'' for the New York Shakespeare Festival (he considered
his performance as Shylock a high point of his career), O'Neill's
``Desire Under the Elms'' at Circle in the Square and Lillian
Hellman's ``Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In films, he did
``The Hustler,'' ``The List of Adrian Messenger,'' ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (memorably as the bomb-happy Gen. Buck Turgidson),
``The Flim-Flam Man'' and ``Petulia,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   On television, he starred for several seasons as a social worker
in ``East Side/West Side,'' and he and Ms. Dewhurst played the
ill-fated Proctors in an adaptation of Arthur Miller's ``Crucible''
and also played husband and wife in ``The Price.''
</P>
<P>
   The second turning point in his career was ``Patton.'' Searching
for an actor to play the title role, Frank McCarthy, the producer
of the film, sought the advice of Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of
20th Century Fox. Zanuck showed him the film ``The Bible,'' and
said, ``There's your Patton.'' Hidden under the beard of Abraham
was Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently he acted in ``They Might Be Giants'' (as a lunatic
judge who thinks he is Sherlock Holmes), ``The Hospital'' (as a
suicidal doctor, Paddy Chayevsky's idea of a modern hero), ``The
Day of the Dolphin,'' ``Islands in the Stream,'' ``Movie Movie''
(Larry Gelbart's spoof of Hollywood), ``The Formula'' (in which he
acted with Brando), ``Taps'' and ``Malice.'' He also played Fagin,
Scrooge and Benito Mussolini on television.
</P>
<P>
   He also began moving into directing. While his films ``Rage''
and ``The Savage Is Loose'' failed, he was successful as a director
onstage (of ``Death of a Salesman'' and ``Present Laughter,'' among
others). On Broadway he appeared in ``Uncle Vanya'' (as the
emotionally bankrupt Dr. Astrov) and ``Sly Fox.'' In 1986, he and
John Cullum starred as aging versions of Huckleberry Finn and Tom
Sawyer in ``The Boys in Autumn.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his frequent threats to stop acting onstage, he
repeatedly returned. ``I'm too mean to quit,'' he said. For him,
movies were ``a tedious, deadly, boring way to make a living,'' and
he said he worked in the theater ``to stay sane.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there were only two kinds of actors: ``risk actors and
safe actors.'' ``Safe actors hold back, experiment not, dare not,
change nothing and have no artistic courage,'' he said. ``I call
them walkers. I may stagger a little now and then, but I have never
been accused of walking.''

   George C. Scott, an actor of extraordinary range and daring,
celebrated for his performances as Gen. George S. Patton Jr. in the
movie ``Patton'' and as Shakespeare's Richard III in Central Park,
was found dead Wednesday afternoon at his home in Westlake Village,
40 miles northwest of Los Angeles. He was 71 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was described as ``a natural death from a
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,'' by Dr. Janice Frank, who
conducted the autopsy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With a clear, articulate understanding of character and an
almost volcanic intensity, Scott created a gallery of indelible
portraits on stage and screen. Often cast in sinister roles, he
played killers and con men, gamblers and thieves. But he also
played doctors and social workers and so many lawyers, for the
defense and the prosecution, that he could have taken up law as an
alternative profession.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was playing a leading or a supporting role he was
generally the dominant figure. With equal ease, he portrayed
characters of contrasting ethics and temperament. On screen in
``The Hustler'' (1961), appearing with Paul Newman, he was a
high-stakes gambler with an allegiance only to himself. Onstage in
``The Andersonville Trial'' in 1959 he was a prosecuting attorney
with a keen sense of moral purpose. Though he was most identified
with dramatic roles, he was also adept at comedy, moving easily
from Eugene O'Neill to Noel Coward.
</P>
<P>
   His life was marred and his career damaged by drunken tantrums
and barroom brawls. He was married five times, twice to Colleen
Dewhurst, with whom he often appeared on stage, and he had several
well-publicized romances, including one with Ava Gardner, who
starred with him in the film ``The Bible.'' Since 1972, he had been
married to the actress Trish Van Devere.In Hollywood he was
considered a renegade. He declined three straight nominations for
Academy Awards, for his performances in ``Anatomy of a Murder,''
``The Hustler'' and ``Patton,'' not for any self-doubts about his
acting but because he reacted against the ``childish and damaging
unnatural competitiveness'' of the awards. Despite his attitude, he
won an Oscar in 1971 as best actor for ``Patton,'' a role for which
he was also honored by the New York Film Critics and the National
Society of Film Critics. The next year he won an Emmy for his work
in Arthur Miller's play ``The Price'' on television. He refused
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Patton became the defining role of his career. When he made a
sequel to the film for television in 1986, he said, ``After 35
years in the business, people still identify me more with Patton
than any other character.'' No wonder: from the opening moment of
the film he  &UR; was &LR;  Patton. An American flag fills the entire screen
as Scott, all spit and polish, strides on and delivers a smart
salute. ``All Americans love the sting of battle,'' he says.
``That's why we never lost a war.''
</P>
<P>
   George Campbell Scott, the grandson of a coal miner, was born on
Oct. 18, 1927, in the Appalachian coal town Wise, Va. Faced by the
Depression, his father moved his family to Detroit, where he worked
on the Buick assembly line and later became a businessman. His
mother, a semi-invalid, was an amateur poet and elocutionist who
gave recitations; she died when her son was 8, and he was brought
up by his older sister, Helen. At Redford High School in Detroit he
was an athlete and aspiring writer of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   After he graduated in 1945, he joined the marines. Missing
combat duty, he spent four years at a desk job in Washington and on
the graves detail at Arlington National Cemetery. Looking back on
his military days, he said, ``I stayed drunk most of the time.''
After his discharge, he enrolled at the University of Missouri
School of Journalism. Casually he tried out for and won a role in a
student production of Terence Rattigan's play ``The Winslow Boy.''
His pleasure in performance was immediate. ``I was hooked,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 having been an actor for seven years but with no
success, he was about to give up the theater. ``I had failed over
and over,'' he said. ``I had been failing that whole year. I was as
low as anyone could be.'' Then he heard about the forthcoming
production of ``Richard III,'' for Joseph Papp's newly formed New
York Shakespeare Festival. He managed to get an audition, was
called back for a second time and by his own measure failed the
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to drink,'' he said. ``And I got very depressed. I
said, `I can't let this job go.' I called and begged for another
chance.'' He was allowed to read again, and prepared himself by
memorizing two soliloquies. ``After two or three days of agony, Joe
called and said, `You got the job.' I damned near died.''
</P>
<P>
   Totally unknown and inexperienced in Shakespeare, he made his
New York debut, outdoors, in one of the most demanding of classical
roles, and he was mesmerizing. Critics soared into superlatives and
four decades later Scott's Richard is remembered by those who saw
it as the towering performance of Shakespeare in the park, the one
that all others are measured against.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Richard III'' his career took off. Two months later he
played the melancholic Jacques in ``As You Like It,'' and quickly
followed that as the diabolical Lord Wainwright in a revival of
``Children of Darkness'' at Circle in the Square. For all three
roles played within the space of one year he won a series of acting
awards. In ``Children of Darkness'' his co-star was Ms. Dewhurst.
They soon became acting partners, a tempestuous couple on and off
stage. (They were married in 1960, divorced, married again and
divorced.) As ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' they were, said Scott, in
an emotional sense ``like two drunken lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ms. Van Devere; a daughter,
Victoria, from his first marriage, to Carolyn Hughes; a son,
Matthew, and another daughter, Devon Scott, from his second
marriage, to Patricia Reed; and two other sons, Alexander and
Campbell, an actor, from his marriage to Ms. Dewhurst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, only a year after ``Richard III,'' he made his Broadway
debut in ``Comes a Day,'' opposite Judith Anderson. Playing a
psychopath, every evening he decapitated a pet bird onstage. On the
strength of that malicious performance, he won his role as a
prosecutor in Otto Preminger's ``Anatomy of a Murder'' (his second
movie; his first was ``The Hanging Tree,''in which he played a
villain).
</P>
<P>
   From then on, his twin career was in overdrive. He played a
prosecutor in the Civil War drama ``The Andersonville Trial,'' a
hero of the Warsaw Ghetto in ``The Wall'' and he did three comic
roles in Neil Simon's ``Plaza Suite'' on Broadway, ``The Merchant
of Venice'' for the New York Shakespeare Festival (he considered
his performance as Shylock a high point of his career), O'Neill's
``Desire Under the Elms'' at Circle in the Square and Lillian
Hellman's ``Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In films, he did
``The Hustler,'' ``The List of Adrian Messenger,'' ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (memorably as the bomb-happy Gen. Buck Turgidson),
``The Flim-Flam Man'' and ``Petulia,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   On television, he starred for several seasons as a social worker
in ``East Side/West Side,'' and he and Ms. Dewhurst played the
ill-fated Proctors in an adaptation of Arthur Miller's ``Crucible''
and also played husband and wife in ``The Price.''

`NOW AND AGAIN' BUILDS A BETTER BIONIC MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Goodman is run over by a subway train in the early going of
the drama ``Now and Again,'' and who'd guess it would be an
improvement? He's patched up, you could say, to look 20 years
younger and 100 pounds lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Saved by a nameless, faceless defense division of the U.S.
government _ or at least his brain is _ the once middle-aged
insurance executive named Michael Wiseman is now in the body of a
26-year-old (Eric Close), completely manufactured in a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Why, you ask? ``To travel to dangerous places, takes risks, wage
war,'' beams Dr. Theodore Morris, played by Dennis Haysbert as part
egomaniacal scientist, part proud father, part menacing mob boss.
Even when Michael is merely a brain hooked up to a sophisticated
computer system allowing us to hear his thoughts, Morris gives him
an enticing offer: Cooperate, you live. Don't, well, you know the
drill. ``It's that simple,'' Morris informs him.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't, of course. Michael's memory is left intact, which
means he pines for his widow (Margaret Colin) and teen-age
daughter, (''Heather Matarazzo from ``Welcome to the Dollhouse''),
with whom he is to have no contact. ``You must stay dead,'' Morris
warns Wiseman. ``If you contact anyone of your former life, it
guarantees your death and the death of the person you confided
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this lead-in is a bit deceiving. ``Now and Again'' is an
action-drama that's lighter and more romantic than I've managed to
convey. It is, in fact, the kind of wildly ambitious cinematic
gumbo that usually has difficulty finding an audience. (Why do you
think it took us so long to warm up to David E. Kelley's writing in
general and ``Ally McBeal'' in particular?)
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the series, from ``Moonlighting'' producer Glenn
Gordon Caron, begins with two international acts of terrorism,
including a horrific scene, all I'll divulge of which is that it
involves a lot of blood and a lot of screaming people.
</P>
<P>
   We shift from there to Goodman's Wiseman, who was already having
a bad day before he was accidentally knocked into the path of a
train.
</P>
<P>
   In the body of Close, Wiseman has the same dry wit and good
heart but is obviously freaked about what has occurred. He's shown
looking in the mirror (it's a two-way with Morris and others
watching his every move), particularly at his body, and, well,
certain parts of it, which gets a round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Learning that he has terrific strength, Wiseman asks: ``Can I
fly? Like Superman?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' grunts Morris, just as they pass a blonde in a short
skirt and high heels, Wiseman eyeing her like mad. ``You can't see
through people's clothes, either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' has the potential to become an enjoyable hour,
or it could simply die in its tracks. From one episode, it's
impossible to tell exactly where this series will go or how it will
stack up against the other new sci-fi drama, Chris Carter's ``Harsh
Realm,'' over on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Caron says Wiseman will fight injustice and keep trying to
re-enter the life of his widow, who probably won't buy for a minute
that this pretty young thing wants her. (Not that Colin, whom you
might remember as the first lady in ``Independence Day,'' couldn't
compete with any miniskirted twentysomething.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the pilot let on just how powerful Wiseman is. It shows
him standing on his hands on a wheelchair, and picking up the chair
while a pretty big orderly sits in it. That's about it.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, superpowers mean little if he can't pull off the
most difficult feat for all newcomers: getting ratings.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Feet''
</P>
<P>
   Premieres: 9 p.m. CST Friday, NBC
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Jean Louisa Kelly, David Sutcliffe, Alicia Coppola,
William Keane, Dina Spybey, Anthony Starke
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Feet'' suggests that we're all a bit freaked out when it
comes to love, romance and especially marriage with children. And
that we tread lightly when we should simply dive in headfirst. The
same could be said about the handling of this pilot, which tiptoes
ever so gingerly around a topic that is like a wide-open playground
when it comes to dramatic and comedic possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought ``Cupid'' tackled love and romance last season
with heart, wit and poignancy, consider this the easy-viewing
version. It revolves around several characters at different stages
of the love wars. Adam (Sutcliffe) and Shelley (Jean Louisa Kelly)
are single commitment-phobes. Marrieds Pete (Keane) and Jenny
(Spybey) are redefining the roles of pre-babydom, as are Karen
(Coppola) and David (Starke), with their different parental
philosophy regarding a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   They all have their issues. Pete loathes going home to Jenny,
who has a much stronger libido than he does. Karen can no longer
take life without a nanny, as David spends weekdays at work and
weekends on the golf course. (Karen solves this by bursting into
one of his negotiation seminars, baby in arms, with her own form of
negotiation: Get a nanny, or we walk.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pilot revolves around Adam and Shelley, who do their
share of silly game-playing. He's a womanizer who considers three
weeks a long relationship. She isn't afraid of marriage, she tells
her shrink _ she's terrified of relationships that end badly.
</P>
<P>
   How'd they meet? Shelley, talking on her cell phone while
carrying a bag of groceries, walks into Adam's car. While it's
moving. ``I just got hit by a car,'' Shelley tells a friend, still
on her cell phone, sprawled across the pavement. ``I'll call you
back.''
</P>
<P>
   With cute, funny lines like that, and characters that are
attractive, likable and, in the case of Kelly (maybe you remember
her from that MCI commercial), a bizarre mix of adorable and
annoying, ``Cold Feet'' could very well gain an audience of people
who like their romance tentative.
</P>
<P>
   Me? Headfirst is the only way to go.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Odd Man Out''
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Erik von Detten, Markie Post
</P>
<P>
   Premieres: 8:30 p.m. CST Friday, ABC
</P>
<P>
   Post is the attention-getting name here, but the series revolves
around her character's son, Andrew (von Detten), through whose eyes
we're supposed to view life in a female world. He's a high school
freshman surrounded by a mother, three sisters and an aunt, which
leads to a number of can't-get-in-the-bathroom scenarios and
young-man-in-heat jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Post is the all-knowing, nurturing mother trying to raise a son
without a father. She's balanced by Andrew's self-centered sister,
Paige (Natalia Cigliuti), who doesn't pass on a chance to put him
down. ``So you're telling me there's no way in the world that any
one of your friends could possibly be interested in me?'' Andrew
asks Paige, after one actually shows interest. ``No,'' she snaps.
``I'm saying there's no way ANYONE would be interested in you.''
</P>
<P>
   With jokes like that, the question is: Who'll be interested in
this sitcom?

`GOING NOMAD': FIRST SHE KEELHAULS HIM, THEN SHE INVITES HIM TO
DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to be Jack Kerouac, you don't even have to leave the
island of Manhattan to go on the road. That's the whimsical conceit
of Art Jones' film ``Going Nomad,'' a comic ode to urban night
driving, puffed up with quasi-Beat poetry and peopled with the
contemporary equivalents of William Saroyan characters spouting Tom
Waits-style riffs.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens Friday, aspires to be a cult item like
``Bagdad Cafe,'' a movie that flaunted a similarly tough surface
masking a warm and fuzzy heart. But ``Going Nomad'' carries its
rhapsodic beatnik whimsy over the brink. It is too cute by half.
</P>
<P>
   The story focuses on El Cid Rivera (Damian Jones), 33, a
Manhattan layabout, and his friends who hang out in a downtown bar
spinning their fantasies and letting the days roll by. One friend
is an apartment broker dealing in ratty tenements, another a tunnel
toll collector, another involved in the lower echelons of
professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   As for El Cid, he drifts from job to job, including a disastrous
stint as a short-order cook. The pals' nighttime revels are so
ritualized that each member of the circle always sits in the same
chair. When one suggests a change in the seating, the possible
realignment assumes an earth-shaking significance.
</P>
<P>
   One strand of the story follows the comically sadomasochistic
relationship of El Cid with Geraldine Fusco (Jourdan Zayles), an
ominous young policewoman who has never forgiven him for having
punched her in the mouth in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   After seething for more than two decades, Geraldine finally
retaliates by chasing El Cid on the street and throwing him down on
the pavement. No sooner does she gain the upper hand than her
resentment melts, and she asks him out for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   During the torrid romance that follows, she likes to get him in
hammer locks in the kitchen and forcibly extract a vow of love.
</P>
<P>
   Between his meetings with his friends and his dates with
Geraldine, the movie follows El Cid around Manhattan as he speeds
through the streets in a gold car.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes are punctuated by Beat-style riffs of working-class
New Yorkers, the so-called Asphalt Nomads, waxing poetic over cars
and the mystique of the city at night. Occasionally our hero, named
after his mother's favorite Charlton Heston character, hears her
voice berating him for not being a success. During the road scenes
a soundtrack that suggests the instrumental background for a Bruce
Springsteen ballad supplies a nervous electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Going Nomad'' pushes so hard for its urban romantic
ambiance that its riffs sound stilted and repetitive, and the movie
never resolves the contradiction between its coy humor and its
romanticism. What Martin Scorsese can accomplish in five minutes,
it takes ``Going Nomad'' an hour and a half to miss doing.

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES' ZANY CEO IS NO JOKE TO HIS RIVALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he occasionally dresses like Elvis to deliver
presentations or because he calls his leadership style ``management
by fooling around.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's because he once told top airline executives that
his proudest achievement was that he'd ``never had a really serious
venereal disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is impossible to write a reverential story about
the man who began his 1997 testimony before the National Civil
Aviation Review Commission thusly: ``My name is Herb Kelleher.
Because I am unable to perform competently any meaningful function
at Southwest, our 25,000 employees let me be CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of these exploits, the 68-year-old Kelleher _ ``Herb''
to his employees _ rocks back in mid-drag on his omnipresent
cigarette and fills the conference room of Southwest Airlines'
Dallas headquarters with loud, wheezing laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turns suddenly earnest: ``I guess I've tried to be a
little bit iconoclastic, striving to get people to think outside
the box.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``little'' bit? This from the man whose flight attendants have
been known to emerge from overhead bins to rap the pre-flight
safety instructions? From the man who won a fare war against
Braniff by offering fliers a fifth of Chivas Regal?
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher smiles and says, ``I've always said that if it's
conventional, it's not wisdom, and if it's wisdom, it's not
conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years ago, then-lawyer Kelleher and pilot Rollin
King huddled in a Texas bar to invent low-fare airline service.
Scribbling on a cocktail napkin, King proposed a regional carrier
that would shuttle passengers between Dallas, Houston, and San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   If it could keep costs low enough, King argued, an airline could
create a new class of fliers out of folks who normally traveled
between those cities by car, train, or bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're crazy,'' Kelleher responded. ``Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three decades since, Southwest has emerged as the most
consistently profitable venture in the history of American
commercial aviation: in the black every year since 1973, with
record profits each year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests there's nothing funny about Kelleher's management
credo _ that a laid-back, jargon-free, slightly loony environment
inside a company breeds apostolic fervor outside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago,'' he says, ``the business schools would ask,
`Which comes first: employees, customers, or shareholders?' It was
regarded as a conundrum; any answer would get you in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I said the employees come first, because if they're
happy and satisfied and ennobled by what they're doing, they treat
your customers better, and then the customers come back, and that's
good for your shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest workers seem preternaturally happy and ennobled, and
not just because their employer was one of the first airlines to
offer profit participation and stock ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's low annual employee-turnover rate is legendary in
the industry, and the company's one work stoppage lasted less than
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are happy, too. Between 1992 and 1996, Southwest led
the industry in three key service categories: best on-time
performance, fewest flier complaints, and best baggage handling.
And Southwest consistently ranks near the top of the airline
quality ratings.
</P>
<P>
   As for shareholders, anyone who invested $1,000 in Southwest
stock (NYSE:LUV) 25 years ago is a millionaire today.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent share price of $32, Southwest stock trades at 24.7
times last year's earnings, almost double the industry norm of 13.5
The company's 1998 net income of $433 million marked a 36.4 percent
gain over 1997. First-quarter profits in 1999 beat 1998's first
quarter by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Operationally, Southwest has hardly changed since it first took
to the air in 1971. Its fleet consists only of Boeing 737s, which
keeps service costs down and achieves economies of scale in
purchases and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There's only token meal service; seating is first-come,
first-served; and the planes, says Kelleher, fly into ``overpriced,
underserved markets not plagued by slot controls, congestion, and
air-traffic delays.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Baltimore/Washington International, not Washington
National; Providence, not Boston. Following this regimen, Southwest
last year carried 52.6 million passengers to 52 cities, mostly in
the South and the West.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Southwest has added three cities to its route map,
but the industry is buzzing about just one of them. That city is
New York, or at least an airfield as close as Southwest's strategy
allows: MacArthur Airport, 50 miles east on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Kelleher's foray into Gotham is whether
it will trigger the notorious ``Southwest Effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Short-haul fares out of D.C. dropped 35 percent after Southwest
set up in BWI; one-way fares to Boston sagged from about $200 to
about $120. But New York has historically resisted rate-cutting
efforts, and US Airways and Delta won't cede turf without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The New York venture also raises the prospect of nonstop
coast-to-coast service. A Southwest Effect on the super-competitive
transcontinental routes could be devastating to larger airlines,
whose costs on longer flights are an estimated 30 to 35 percent
higher than Southwest's.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Kelleher denies any plans to fly nonstop coast
to coast. And yet there was that nonstop run from Baltimore to
Oakland last Thanksgiving, which Kelleher dismissed as a ``onetime
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   And the airline has firm orders into Boeing for 105 new
737-700s, planes with cross-continental range.
</P>
<P>
   If Southwest does break nationwide, will Kelleher be around to
enjoy the furor? Not to be morbid, but Herb is nearing 70, was
recently diagnosed with cancer, and he's not exactly a poster boy
for clean living.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he's ``not going anywhere,'' but in any case, the
Southwest organization already bears his imprint.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the message that callers to Southwest's reservation
line hear when they're waiting on hold: ``If you have been holding
for more than 30 seconds, please press 8. It won't get your call
answered any faster, but it may make you feel better.'' &QL;

`SUITS': UNSOPHISTICATED SATIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intended to poke fun at the advertising business, ``Suits''
turns out to be an unsophisticated satire. Clearly based on
observed behavior, it founders on its inability to invest its
truths with inspired comedy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, its story of conflict at an ad agency between its
casual, irreverent and supposedly truly creative forces and their
neatly dressed, stupid, stuffy, duplicitous rivals becomes a
one-sided contest, with the bad guys _ including a woman _
amounting to no more than comic-strip targets for its disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suits'' was written and directed by Eric Weber, whose
publicity credits him with a stint as an award-winning creative
director of a large advertising agency and as the author of the
book ``How to Pick Up Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The film revolves mainly around the travails of Ken Tuttle
(Randy Pearlstein), a young copywriter undergoing a crisis of
confidence on the job and in bed after the failure of his $35
million deodorant campaign for United Standard, a major client of
his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, United Standard's angry chief executive, Robert
Naylor Sr. (Frank Minucci), has put its entire account up for
review, while giving Tuttle's firm, led by Tom Cranston (Robert
Klein), one last chance: creation of a winning campaign for a new
sanitary napkin that admits 80 percent more air than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   While Cranston is abroad with his mistress, his agency's
transparently rotten forces, led by Peter Haverford (Larry Pine),
contrive the ouster of its creative genius, George Parkyn (Tony
Hendra), who is a mentor to Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Will the sloppily dressed, irreverent good guys find a way to
get Parkyn back? Against a pressing deadline, will young Tuttle
come through with a smart idea? Will the blunt, foulmouthed Naylor
prefer Tuttle's campaign to the slick beauty of the commercial
created at Cranston's rivals by the smug, superconfident wunderkind
Johnny Akida (Edoardo Ballerini)? Will the suits get their
comeuppance?
</P>
<P>
   In a film like ``Suits,'' the answers are really never in doubt.
But how they are attained makes the difference between a satire
that punctures its targets with engagingly barbed wit and one whose
idea of clever response to dull, dense authority figures amounts to
a thumbed nose.

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES' ZANY CEO IS NO JOKE TO HIS RIVALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's because he occasionally dresses like Elvis to deliver
presentations or because he calls his leadership style ``management
by fooling around.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's because he once told top airline executives that
his proudest achievement was that he'd ``never had a really serious
venereal disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is impossible to write a reverential story about
the man who began his 1997 testimony before the National Civil
Aviation Review Commission thusly: ``My name is Herb Kelleher.
Because I am unable to perform competently any meaningful function
at Southwest, our 25,000 employees let me be CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of these exploits, the 68-year-old Kelleher _ ``Herb''
to his employees _ rocks back in mid-drag on his omnipresent
cigarette and fills the conference room of Southwest Airlines'
Dallas headquarters with loud, wheezing laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turns suddenly earnest: ``I guess I've tried to be a
little bit iconoclastic, striving to get people to think outside
the box.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``little'' bit? This from the man whose flight attendants have
been known to emerge from overhead bins to rap the pre-flight
safety instructions? From the man who won a fare war against
Braniff by offering fliers a fifth of Chivas Regal?
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher smiles and says, ``I've always said that if it's
conventional, it's not wisdom, and if it's wisdom, it's not
conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years ago, then-lawyer Kelleher and pilot Rollin
King huddled in a Texas bar to invent low-fare airline service.
Scribbling on a cocktail napkin, King proposed a regional carrier
that would shuttle passengers between Dallas, Houston, and San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   If it could keep costs low enough, King argued, an airline could
create a new class of fliers out of folks who normally traveled
between those cities by car, train, or bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're crazy,'' Kelleher responded. ``Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three decades since, Southwest has emerged as the most
consistently profitable venture in the history of American
commercial aviation: in the black every year since 1973, with
record profits each year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests there's nothing funny about Kelleher's management
credo _ that a laid-back, jargon-free, slightly loony environment
inside a company breeds apostolic fervor outside it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago,'' he says, ``the business schools would ask,
`Which comes first: employees, customers, or shareholders?' It was
regarded as a conundrum; any answer would get you in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I said the employees come first, because if they're
happy and satisfied and ennobled by what they're doing, they treat
your customers better, and then the customers come back, and that's
good for your shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest workers seem preternaturally happy and ennobled, and
not just because their employer was one of the first airlines to
offer profit participation and stock ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's low annual employee-turnover rate is legendary in
the industry, and the company's one work stoppage lasted less than
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are happy, too. Between 1992 and 1996, Southwest led
the industry in three key service categories: best on-time
performance, fewest flier complaints, and best baggage handling.
And Southwest consistently ranks near the top of the airline
quality ratings.
</P>
<P>
   As for shareholders, anyone who invested $1,000 in Southwest
stock (NYSE:LUV) 25 years ago is a millionaire today.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent share price of $32, Southwest stock trades at 24.7
times last year's earnings, almost double the industry norm of 13.5
The company's 1998 net income of $433 million marked a 36.4 percent
gain over 1997. First-quarter profits in 1999 beat 1998's first
quarter by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Operationally, Southwest has hardly changed since it first took
to the air in 1971. Its fleet consists only of Boeing 737s, which
keeps service costs down and achieves economies of scale in
purchases and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There's only token meal service; seating is first-come,
first-served; and the planes, says Kelleher, fly into ``overpriced,
underserved markets not plagued by slot controls, congestion, and
air-traffic delays.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Baltimore/Washington International, not Washington
National; Providence, not Boston. Following this regimen, Southwest
last year carried 52.6 million passengers to 52 cities, mostly in
the South and the West.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Southwest has added three cities to its route map,
but the industry is buzzing about just one of them. That city is
New York, or at least an airfield as close as Southwest's strategy
allows: MacArthur Airport, 50 miles east on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Kelleher's foray into Gotham is whether
it will trigger the notorious ``Southwest Effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Short-haul fares out of D.C. dropped 35 percent after Southwest
set up in BWI; one-way fares to Boston sagged from about $200 to
about $120. But New York has historically resisted rate-cutting
efforts, and US Airways and Delta won't cede turf without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The New York venture also raises the prospect of nonstop
coast-to-coast service. A Southwest Effect on the super-competitive
transcontinental routes could be devastating to larger airlines,
whose costs on longer flights are an estimated 30 to 35 percent
higher than Southwest's.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Kelleher denies any plans to fly nonstop coast
to coast. And yet there was that nonstop run from Baltimore to
Oakland last Thanksgiving, which Kelleher dismissed as a ``onetime
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   And the airline has firm orders into Boeing for 105 new
737-700s, planes with cross-continental range.
</P>
<P>
   If Southwest does break nationwide, will Kelleher be around to
enjoy the furor? Not to be morbid, but Herb is nearing 70, was
recently diagnosed with cancer, and he's not exactly a poster boy
for clean living.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he's ``not going anywhere,'' but in any case, the
Southwest organization already bears his imprint.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the message that callers to Southwest's reservation

`MUMFORD': SURE, THE DOCTOR IS IN: IN DEMAND AND IN TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Kasdan's likable semi-screwball comedy ``Mumford'' has
two big pluses on its side. In tackling psychotherapy, a subject
Hollywood has traditionally treated with a quaking solemnity, it
sustains a tone that is refreshingly commonsensical and irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's enigmatic hero (Loren Dean), who renamed himself
Mumford after the town to which he has moved to start a new life as
a therapist, is almost as astonished as his clients are by how
quickly he is able to change their lives for the better.
</P>
<P>
   But as he admits halfway into the movie, he is a charlatan with
no therapeutic training. The credentials on his office wall are as
bogus as his name.
</P>
<P>
   In creating a heroic therapist who turns out to be a fraud but
still ends up a good guy, ``Mumford'' is paradoxically subversive.
While the movie appears to be enthusiastically pro-therapy
(Mumford's intuitive, offbeat approach to people's problems works
wonders), it is also anti-therapist in its implication that in the
age of ``Oprah'' any sensitive person who is a good listener could
conceivably establish a successful practice without the benefits of
training or certification.
</P>
<P>
   The film's other big plus is Mumford's endearing star client,
Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee). A bushy-haired billionaire man-child
whose company produces 23 percent of the world's modems, Skip is
the very model of a computer nerd who is richer than God.
</P>
<P>
   A perpetual adolescent, Skip likes to whiz around the town on a
skateboard. The headquarters of his company, Panda Modem (named
after his favorite animal), has its own elaborately contoured
skateboarding area.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Mumford'' were a '40s movie, you could imagine Skip being
played by the gangly young James Stewart with every other phrase
out of his mouth a quaveringly sincere ``gosh'' or ``aw shucks.''
(Mumford would have to be played by Cary Grant.)
</P>
<P>
   But Skip isn't quite that naive. He's canny enough to recognize
that women have pursued him for his money but pure enough at heart
not to be tempted. He is also desperately lonely: so lonely, in
fact, that he has set about devising a technological solution to
his romantic travails. His top-secret work in progress is a line of
robotic sex surrogates that are virtually indistinguishable from
flesh-and-blood humans.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, all the townspeople seeking Mumford's counsel are
sexually and romantically blocked. The movie opens in a
delightfully off-kilter way with a black-and-white 1950s-style
film-noir spoof that turns out to be the pulp-fiction fantasy of
one of Mumford's clients, Henry Follett (Pruitt Taylor Vince).
</P>
<P>
   Follett is in despair that real life can never match his Barbara
Stanwyck meets Frederick's of Hollywood vision of down-and-dirty
pleasure. Whenever the movie threatens to become too serious, it
dips back into Follett's overheated fantasies for the sheer fun of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Follett, like everyone in the film, is a caricature. So is
Althea Brockett (Mary McDonnell), the repressed, wound-too-tight
wife of a loathsome investment banker and cigar aficionado (Ted
Danson) who becomes Mumford's client. Other local neurotics who end
up on his couch include Nessa Watkins (Zooey Deschanel), a
tortured, sarcastic, self-hating teen-ager who lives in a dream
world of fashion magazines, and Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis), a
depressed young woman suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   As Sofie's spirits revive on long walks that her therapist
insists she take with him, their mutual (and secret) romantic
feelings for each other begin to bubble up.
</P>
<P>
   With a sensibility rooted in psychotherapy and a major character
who resembles a warmer and furrier Bill Gates, ``Mumford'' is right
in step with the mood of the moment. So is its all-American theme
of self-invention in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   When Mumford and Skip swap life stories, the autobiography
Mumford relates has seemingly nothing to do with the bland,
clean-cut young therapist who listens so attentively to other's
people's problems. In his previous life, we learn, he was a
ruthless investigator for the Internal Revenue Service and a
cocaine addict who crashed and burned.
</P>
<P>
   Mumford would be secure in his new life if he weren't so good at
his new trade. His troubles begin when two local rivals, prodded by
an irate, megalomaniacal lawyer (Martin Short), whom Mumford turned
down as a client, begin an investigation into his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' is at heart a Frank Capra-style social fable for the
'90s in which therapy (rather than civic duty or social conscience)
is the catalyst that rouses people from their isolation and brings
them together, often in conveniently well-matched couples.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also adds a running joke that pays off handsomely in
having Mumford, who has seceded from his former life, attracted to
the television series ``Unsolved Mysteries.'' There's a touch of
science fiction in this ``Zelig''-like character who is so unmarked
by the depravity and desperation of his previous existence that he
seems almost as freshly made as one of the robots in Skip's secret
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments when ``Mumford'' gets carried away with its
vision of the therapist as everyman, social healer and savior
spreading sweetness and light. But there's always that fly in the
ointment. Mumford's successful self-reinvention (not unlike that of
certain crooked politicians who conveniently find Jesus) is
suspect.
</P>

`DOUBLE JEOPARDY': FROM DAINTY LITTLE WIFE TO ONE RECKLESS
AVENGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in the touristy thriller ``Double Jeopardy,'' Nick Parsons
(Bruce Greenwood) proves himself a wealthy art bore by browbeating
a young man who mistakes Nick's Kandinsky for a Picasso. This is
reason enough for Nick to meet a violent end. Photogenically, he
happens to have bought a nice new sailboat for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) wakes up to find blood all over the
boat, Nick missing and a telltale gory knife lying on deck. She
clutches the knife without benefit of gloves. This is enough to get
Libby imprisoned for murder.
</P>
<P>
   And that setup is enough to send ``Double Jeopardy'' roaming
from the coastline of Washington State to the French Quarter of New
Orleans, once the third piece of the puzzle has fallen into place.
Nick has been having an affair with Libby's sister (Annabeth Gish)
and he has run off with Libby's son. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; He merely faked being overboard and dead. Now Libby, who has
managed to look princessy even while wearing a hairnet and stirring
a vat of prison gruel, is out of the slammer and out for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Bruce Beresford, the film moves mechanically
through these early stages. It shows so little true momentum that
lines like ``I feel like I've grown in the past six years'' are all
that signify the passage of time, as opposed to change in the
characters. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Not even Ms. Judd is beautiful enough to get away with rote
acting straight out of a beauty pageant's talent competition, but
she perks up as Libby becomes less of a victim. The latter part of
the film invokes Tommy Lee Jones as another weathered sourpuss with
a knack for barking orders. A coed homage to ``The Fugitive'' is
part of the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Judd looks too dainty to throw herself into anything more
reckless than a manicure. But the film has her driving
demolition-derby-style, hurtling a car off a ferry, becoming a
computer-smart investigator and stealing an Armani evening gown.
(There are helpful pointers on how to pull off this last feat.) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Though the action revolves around Libby's legal right to whack
the odious Nick (see title), the lawyers and investigators who
might have sent Nick to prison are conveniently absent from the
story. Jones' role, that of a law professor turned probation
officer who (like Libby) is heartbroken over a lost child, seems to
have been devised by a plot-o-matic machine.
</P>
<P>
   Jones continues to hone the fine art of the acid wisecrack,
combining it with an attractively gruff, paternal side. And there
are lively supporting performances from Roma Maffia and Davenia
McFadden as Libby's prison pals. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Greenwood, memorable for fine work in Atom Egoyan's films,
gets lost in the slick villain's role, partly because Beresford
makes would-be Hitchcockian cat-and-mouse games the film's main
concern. These are more memorable for their settings, like an
elaborate New Orleans cemetery, than for their sense.

   When it opens for business in November, the gargantuan resort
will be capable of hosting 3,100 guests in its 1,557 guestrooms and
10 dining rooms and restaurants. They'll have the run of nine bars
and lounges, a 1,350-seat theater, a casino, a gaming arcade, an
indoor ice rink, an inline skating track, an 18-hole golf
simulator, a pool, a fitness center with jogging track, a 4-story
shopping arcade featuring a Johnny Rockets hamburger joint, and a
30-foot rock-climbing wall.
</P>
<P>
   Which would all be impressive enough, even on dry land. But this
resort floats. Set to launch from Miami on Nov. 21 on its maiden
voyage, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas will be the biggest
(1,021 feet long!), heaviest (142,000 tons!), most gizmo-laden
cruise liner ever afloat.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, that's saying something. Trying to attract
younger, more active, more affluent guests who want more out of a
cruise than a shuffleboard tournament and a midnight buffet on the
Lido Deck, cruise companies have spent the past decade one-upping
each other, building ever-bigger boats with ever-growing lists of
amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Want to get connected to the Internet? Norwegian Cruise Line
introduced an Internet cafe and stateroom Internet connections on
its Norwegian Sky last month. (Other lines have quickly followed
suit.)
</P>
<P>
   Want to sail with a crowd? With its new Triumph, Carnival this
summer set a record for carrying the most passengers on a single
cruise (3,413, for those who are counting.)
</P>
<P>
   A round of mini-golf? That's old hat _ Royal Caribbean
introduced the first mini-golf course in 1995 on its Legend of the
Seas. Now several lines are going further. For instance, the small
Seabourn Sun, a luxury ship that holds fewer than 800 passengers,
in 2000 will introduce a nine-hole putting green and a golf
simulator that will re-create more than 20 courses worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not even taking into account the various ships
boasting 24-hour pizzerias and multi-floor mini-malls, the gyms
equipped with Lifecycles and top-of-the-line aerobics floors, the
cigar lounges and the sports bars and the soaring, eight-deck-high
atriums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a point where it doesn't even have to go
anywhere,'' says Arline Bleecker, a Florida-based travel writer who
has reported on the cruise industry for more than 10 years. ``It
becomes all about the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is where it all started. Americans weaned on
``Love Boat'' reruns may not realize it, but until the '50s
and'60s, cruise ships were primarily a means of transportation, and
largely for the wealthy. Those ships more often had the ambience of
a spa, with good food and little to do but relax or play the
occasional game of shuffleboard.
</P>
<P>
   But with the advent of jet travel, companies had to do something
with those now-empty ships. Cruises to nowhere _ or, rather, to a
few tropical ports _ slowly became popular. The first passenger
ship specifically built for warm-weather cruising was introduced in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the business grew exponentially, particularly after
the mid-'80s, when the first megaships were introduced. In 1998,
5.4 million people cruised on ships serving the North American
market _ about four times as many as in 1980, says Bob Sharak,
director of marketing and product development for Cruise Lines
International Association, a trade organization for 25 cruise
lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the next five years, 60 new ships are scheduled to debut. A
few will be megaships carrying 3,000 passengers or more, a few will
be ultra-luxury small ships for 200 or fewer guests, and the rest
will stake out the territory in between, Sharak says.
</P>
<P>
   The new ships allow for every niche. For instance, Carnival
unveiled a totally nonsmoking ship last November, the Paradise. If
you get caught sneaking a puff, punishment is for real _ you're
fined $250 and are summarily deposited at the next port.
</P>
<P>
   Brand name retailers and restaurants are getting into the act;
there aren't any Gaps or McDonalds yet, but the day is surely
coming. Fossil has opened stores on some Celebrity Cruises; Reebok
has outlets on some Royal Caribbean International ships. Some
Princess cruises boast Haagen-Dazs ice-cream parlors. Sharper Image
just opened an outlet on Royal Caribbean International's Monarch of
the Seas.
</P>
<P>
   And how big will they get? Royal Caribbean, which is unveiling
the biggest-ever ship, the Voyager, this fall, says they've reached
their limit. But cruise companies have said that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, Princess (cruise line) unveiled a 77,000-ton
ship. Most of us spent a good deal of time on that ship being
lost,'' Bleecker says. ``Now, that is being called a midsize
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last September, in fact, Princess' new ship, the Grand
Princess, was being heralded as the largest, most expensive cruise
ship ever. Twice the size of the Titanic, weighing in at 109,000
tons, the ship boasts 17 bars, four swimming pools, nine
whirlpools, a virtual reality center with a motion-based simulator
ride, and the first wedding chapel at sea. (The line's Ocean
Princess, debuting in 2000, will add even more: It will have six
swimming pools and a 24-hour food court.)
</P>
<P>
   But now Princess is being trumped by Royal Caribbean's Voyager,
which weighs 33,000 tons more and includes features that seem an
unlikely fit for a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   The upper deck, for instance, will have a rock climbing wall
that will allow guests to climb 200 feet above sea level. There
will be an inline skating track, volleyball and basketball courts,
and a 1,350-seat replica of Milan's La Scala theater. (In a nod to
traditional cruising, however, announced guest stars at the theater
include Charo.)
</P>
<P>
   The Voyager even travels with its own Zamboni machine. (Well, of
course it does; it has an ice rink, where in November, Katarina
Witt will star in a show to be televised by NBC.)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it's difficult to be bored on such a cruise, but
these giant ships aren't for everyone. For instance, when you and
your fellow 3,000 passengers get off in a small port, the local
charm may quickly evaporate under the tourist crush. And those who
prefer quiet vacations might be turned off by a ship where there's
something going on nearly 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of small, intimate personal spaces'' on
megaships like the Voyager, says Daniel Hanrahan, a Royal Caribbean
spokesman. ``If you want a quiet evening, looking at the stars, you
can have that. Or if you want to play full-court basketball or go
inline skating, you can do that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Or rock climbing. Don't forget rock climbing. What would a
cruise be without that?

`JAKOB THE LIAR': A FLICKER OF HOPE SUSTAINS THE GHETTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Holocaust film to make Roberto Benigni look like Primo
Levi, Robin Williams plays the clowning but compassionate title
role in ``Jakob the Liar.'' Based on a book by Jurek Becker, this
well-intentioned tragicomedy has a good cast, a whiff of ``Fiddler
on the Roof'' and a strangely inappropriate spirit of bonhomie,
under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   While its Holocaust hot buttons are so familiar that the cast
even includes a little girl resembling Anne Frank (Hannah Taylor
Gordon), this is a film whose Anne may just live happily ever
after.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' yen to play the clown who cried has served him
inexplicably well through some maudlin recent movies. But it
certainly isn't bringing out his best. In a performance that would
go down more easily without self-serving close-ups of big emotional
moments, he plays Jakob, an amiable ex-restaurateur living in a
Polish ghetto with a stellar band of cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Armin Muller-Stahl is the community's proud doctor; Bob Balaban
is its comical barber; Liev Schreiber plays the dimwitted boxer who
makes a good sidekick for Jakob. Despite Williams' presence, the
irascible Alan Arkin is the funniest man in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The premise, predicated on the idea that Nazi officers spent
time on lengthy dramatic dialogues with the Jews they imprisoned,
is that Jakob can kindle hope in the hearts of his friends and
neighbors by pretending that he has a radio, and that it brings
good news of an imminent Russian invasion.
</P>
<P>
   This offers Williams a fine opportunity to imitate Winston
Churchill, but not much of the film takes advantage of the mock
radio and its comic possibilities. Instead, ``Jakob the Liar''
alternates between bumbling group antics and strained poignancy, as
in any scene featuring Ms. Gordon. The film anticipates all
laughter and emotion in ways that make it its own worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The direction of Peter Kassovitz (father of the director
Matthieu Kassovitz, who plays a role in the movie) is earnest but
sometimes distractingly inept. In a scene about a marriage proposal
set in the apartment of Arkin's character, the boom microphone can
be seen descending conspicuously from the ceiling in six separate
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents do happen, of course, especially in such close
quarters. But in ``Jakob the Liar,'' microphones also intrude on
scenes set outdoors.
</P>
<P>

   They're not going to huff and they're not going to puff, but
researchers at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) are
wielding 10 huge hydraulic jacks that could easily bring down a
shoddily constructed house down.
</P>
<P>
   The team is using the jacks to subject a 60-percent-scale model
of a five-story concrete building to a series of simulated
earthquakes; like the third little pig, they believe they've got a
better building technique that will keep their structure standing.
</P>
<P>
   The testing is the culmination of a 10-year collaboration
between universities, industry and the National Science Foundation
to develop seismically sound structures using prefabricated, or
``precast,'' concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Builders generally prefer precast to poured-in-place concrete _
it's cheaper and faster to erect. What's more, factory fabrication
allows for better quality control and frees a project from the
whims of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   But conventional precast construction is susceptible to damage
from earthquakes, and building codes have traditionally frowned
upon its use in earthquake-prone areas such as the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   That could be all about to change. UCSD Professor of Structural
Engineering Nigel Priestley, who coordinates the collaboration,
says that the results will form the basis of new design
recommendations and ultimately new building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Tests will give data on four different systems for connecting
columns and beams, two approaches to flooring and one method of
connecting wall panels. Researchers will simulate several
earthquakes of increasing intensity by pushing on the structure
with the hydraulic actuators.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers expect the tests to show that _ if the right
methods are used _ the precast concrete systems actually perform as
well as, or better than, those dictated by existing codes. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ When Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide on April
20, 1945, a little ceremony was held at the Fuhrerbunker.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated at last from the tyrannical house rules, the residents
lit up. Then they poured gasoline on the corpses and set fire to
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even by his own overblown standards, Hitler's fanatical hatred
of smoking was extraordinary. Eva Braun, Josef Goebbels and the
other unfortunate addicts who shared a roof with the Fuhrer in the
last days of the war had to sneak out into the smoldering ruins of
Berlin for a few furtive drags. Braun covered up her guilty secret
by chewing on mints.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, this historic first smoking ban at a
public place seems enlightened, at least from an American
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   And now a scholar from the U.S. has assembled compelling
evidence to prove that, largely because of Hitler's obsession, not
only the bunker but wartime Germany as a whole was at least 20
years ahead of the rest of the world in nailing tobacco down as the
cause of lung cancer, and in attempts to curb the filthy habit.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this discovery are enormous. Millions of
people puffed on after the war, oblivious to the dangers. On proper
medical advice, some might well have given up smoking and lived a
good few years longer.
</P>
<P>
   A reappraisal of German medical science is also in order. The
diabolical experiments of Robert Mengele and his ilk debased the
work of an entire generation of German scientists.
</P>
<P>
   It has been generally assumed that no worthwhile work was
carried out by biologists of the Third Reich, so tainted they all
were by their search for racial purity and related pseudo-science
projects. Rockets, the Nazis could build, but curing human ailments
was not their forte.
</P>
<P>
   The American historian Robert Proctor, author of the book ``The
Nazi War on Cancer,'' explodes that myth, only to raise further
unanswered questions: How did the knowledge gathered in the Third
Reich get lost, and why did it take the medical establishments in
Britain two decades and in the U.S. even longer to rediscover it?
Or did they know it all along?
</P>
<P>
   First, the evidence. It all goes back to the day Adolf Hitler
chucked his last packet of cigarettes into the Danube. Smoking, he
decided, was bad for him, and therefore bad for Germans. Tobacco
was one of the first things he would try to wipe off the face of
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of posters proclaiming nicotine as ``poison for the
Aryan race'' were printed. Measures were promulgated, restricting
the sale of cigarettes to women, cutting soldiers' rations on the
Eastern Front, and banning smoking from cars, trains and buildings.
The Hitler Jugend were drafted in to spread the message with their
inimitable subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, money was poured into research. A link between
rising consumption of alcohol and tobacco and the incidence of
stomach and lung cancers had long been suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The first breakthrough came in 1939, when a PhD student at
Cologne University demonstrated for the first time a connection
between smoking and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 Hitler helped set up the ``Institute for the Struggle
Against the Dangers of Tobacco'' at Jena with 100,000 Reichsmarks
from his own budget.
</P>
<P>
   A year later the Jena scientists came up with the goods. Two
researchers named Eberhard Schairer and Erich Schoniger had carried
out a statistical analysis of the correlation between tobacco and
lung cancer, using a group of smokers as well as a control group.
</P>
<P>
   Their study, described by Professor Proctor as the ``crown jewel
of 20th century epidemiology,'' established that smokers ran an
increased risk of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To put this finding into perspective, Britain's Medical Research
Council claims to have been the ``first national institution in the
world to accept formally the evidence that tobacco is a major cause
of death.'' The MRC took that leap of faith in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Germany did not just investigate, it acted on its findings. As
early as 1939, the Nazis convened a congress on the dangers of
tobacco, attended by 15,000 scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, Hermann Goring forbade soldiers from smoking
on marches, in the streets or patrols. Cigarettes could not be sold
to women; drivers faced lawsuits for criminal negligence if found
smoking behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Research continued, with mixed success. Hitler was convinced of
tobacco's lingering genetic effects. But scientists did not dare to
report the results of their fertility studies which showed that
nicotine was, if anything, making laboratory rats more randy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of German life sciences. much of the tobacco
research was motivated by the Nazis' preoccupation with ``racial
hygene,'' and inevitably ended up in blind alleys. Stomach cancer
also drew a blank.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of their research has stood the test of time. ``If
it hadn't been for the war and the fact that this research had
ideological grounding, the Jena study would be considered a classic
early epidemiological work,'' says Professor George Davey-Smith of
Bristol University, who was the first to unearth this piece of the
jigsaw. ``I think it was underestimated.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   What a pity it all got lost. Or did it? German in those days was
the language of science, its scholars well enough respected _
prejudices and distaste notwithstanding _ to elicit academic
curiosity among their competitors elsewhere in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Their work was published by reputable journals. Even Mengele's
disgusting research on human guinea pigs in Auschwitz and the
inquiries German scientists were conducting at Buchenwald appeared
in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary what was in the medical journals of the
time,'' says Professor Paul Weindlings of Oxford Brookes
University, a leading expert on Nazi eugenics research. ``And the
British and Americans would just read them.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not own up to it, of course. The international
scientific community did not want to get mixed up with the
unethical work of German colleagues, and therefore created the myth
that all German medical science had been paralyzed by primitive
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that there were some really mad scientists
involved, but on the other hand you have to look at the people who
used the opportunities available to do very advanced work,'' says
Professor Doris Kaufmann.
</P>
<P>
   The German historian leads a group in Berlin which is going
through the archives of Germany's elite research institutes. What
they have discovered so far is that many scientists employed on
Goring's human projects were considered good enough to be given
jobs in the United States after the war. &QL;

   BERLIN _ At a disused listening station in the Berlin woods,
aging Cold Warriors fought possibly the final battle of the
conflict, and this time the Commies won.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited on a recent weekend, spies from East and West poured
scorn on their rivals, trumpeted their double agents, and pitted
their intelligence against the other side.
</P>
<P>
   More than pride was at stake. The convention, organized in West
Berlin by the CIA and its affiliates, had set out to prove Western
superiority in this, as in all other, domains.
</P>
<P>
   Agents of the CIA, KGB, MI5 and other related organizations were
brought together for a discussion about the intelligence war in
Berlin before the Wall was built.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA called that era its ``Golden Times,'' years when its
agents roamed East Berlin unhindered, mining the rich seam of
Communist secrets. They had no equal, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're sitting here points to which side had the
most developed spy network,'' crowed Burton Gerber, former CIA
station chief.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber and his colleagues cited their triumph during the
blockade, the tank confrontation in the autumn of 1961, and other
episodes in which only Western intelligence averted a global war.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians listened for a while to all this triumphant talk,
and then retaliated with a barrage of boasts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of deception and disinformation, we were the best,''
declared Oleg Kalugin, former head of KGB Counter-Intelligence.
``No one could lie the way we did. The British came close, but we
were better.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went on for two and a half days, punctuated with meal
breaks _ smoked salmon and Riesling _ a bus tour of Berlin's spooky
sites and a trip to the Allied Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Snug behind the electric gates and barbed wire of the
Teufelsberg listening station, the participants were in their
element, merrily swapping anecdotes about past misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   In the glare of television lights at the museum, they seemed out
of sorts, insecure, the bonhomie suddenly gone. This is where
Kalugin, former Major General of the Evil Empire, decided to strike
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years after the CIA's launch, with the help,
incidentally, of our very own Kim Philby, the CIA had no agent in
the USSR worth mentioning,'' he said. ``At that time, there were
Soviet agents at every federal agency in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   For every spy the West could boast of, the Soviets had dozens.
Berlin, the hub of operations for both sides, was saturated with
Soviet spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ordained priests of the Russian Orthodox church in
Berlin was a colonel in the KGB,'' Kalugin said. ``He was very
good. He did a beautiful service.''
</P>
<P>
   No Stasi agents were present at the convention; a glaring
omission the Russians could not help remarking upon.
</P>
<P>
   East German spies were among the best, Kalugin said. ``You
should pay tribute to the organization which was the real pride of
the intelligence community,'' the former KGB officer urged his
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   They did not feel inclined to take up the invitation, just as
they were in no mood to applaud other exploits of the enemy. The
Cold War has long been over, yet red spies are still causing red
faces in the Western intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, the first great reunion of the second
oldest profession took place in the shadow of events unfolding in
Bexleyheath, England.
</P>
<P>
   As the revelation of Britain's latest double-agent drama grabbed
headlines, ``Hola,'' the latest KGB disciple, was mentioned by no
one at Teufelsberg, except Kalugin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of this lady before,'' he said. ``But I knew
from some sources that there was a lady involved in atomic
espionage,'' he told the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin, former controller of the British traitor George Blake,
thought dozens more KGB agents were still living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   None of that generation works any more, because the game has
moved on. East still spies on the West and vice versa, but
technology is taking over the agents' work, and increasingly, their
sights are shifting to industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   With that happy thought, the class of 1961 dispersed and
returned to their desks and sinecures.
</P>
<P>
   Old CIA war-horses gallop through the U.S. chat shows, Stasi
agents live on West German pensions, and the KGB have taken up
private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Kalugin, whose calling card with a Washington address describes
him as an ``International Consultant,'' helps to design CD-ROM
spying games. &QL;

HUMOR COLUMNIST'S FIRST FICTION WORK SHORT ON PLOT, LONG ON LAUGHS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Big Trouble'' (Putnam, $23.95) is a comic thriller that reads
like a book-length version of a column by Miami Herald writer Dave
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? It's written by Barry.
</P>
<P>
   This is billed as Barry's first foray into fiction _ something
this regular reader of his column, doesn't truly believe.
</P>
<P>
   Plot is not a strong point with Barry. Funny is. Suffice it to
say this is a thriller set in Miami that presents for our pleasure
the antics of: one atomic bomb, two New Jersey hit men, three crazy
teen-agers _ and here I've run out of ``Twelve Days of Christmas''
examples.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say there's also an alcoholic embezzler, a potentially
wandering wife, an embittered advertising man, his client from
hell, a homeless man who lives in a tree, a man named Snake, a
snake named Daphne, a bunch of FBI agents, two Russians gangsters
and Elizabeth Dole, who should sue for being included in this
group.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Big Trouble'' as funny as Barry's columns? No. His kind of
manic writing is best taken in smaller doses. So buy the book and
do it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Thriller writers can be divided into two camps. There are those
who write about events that could happen. Not always plausible
events, of course, but possible.
</P>
<P>
   And there are those who fly off into fantasy land _ the
equivalent of the science-fiction space opera.
</P>
<P>
   David Hagberg is an example of the latter. He has six previous
books about CIA officer Kirk McGarvey, a shoot-'em-up kind of guy.
McGarvey's personal body count probably exceeds the entire Iraqi
dead in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   McGarvey is back in ``White House'' (Forge, $25.95). Now he is
deputy director of operations at the CIA. And while the last time a
real person in that job saw a pistol was when his bodyguard's
jacket fell open, McGarvey is still blasting away.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the bad guys, led by a Taiwanese billionaire, are out
to kill him. And they are also after his girlfriend, daughter and
ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Add a nuclear explosion in North Korea, a resurgent Japan
spoiling for what looks like another Asian war, the Japanese launch
of a spacecraft, and lots and lots of shooting and you've got a
Hagberg-style outing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the self-imposed handicaps, Hagberg keeps the reader
turning the pages through sheer action. Just don't try this at
home, kids.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick A. Davis, on the other hand, belongs to the realist
school of thriller writers. An Air Force Academy graduate, former
U-2 spy plane pilot and now pilot for a major airline, Davis scored
a hit with his first novel, ``The General.''
</P>
<P>
   He's back with another good one, ``The Passenger'' (Putnam,
$24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Col. John Quinn is an Air Force officer going nowhere. Injured
in the Gulf War, he's back on duty, but his injuries mean he can no
longer fly. His future involves a series of boring staff jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Then he's assigned to investigate the crash of a military Lear
jet. There are no survivors, and the sole passenger happens to be
the brother of the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From the first hour of the investigation there's great pressure
on Quinn to write off the cause as simple pilot error. Some of that
pressure is coming from his ex-wife, an investigator with the
National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts don't fit that scenario. And what about the
mysterious disappearance of a neighbor who was the first to get to
the crash site? And the equally mysterious appearance of a military
helicopter that arrived early at the site but left before anyone
else got there?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those rumors that the president was on the outs
with his brother and is not at all unhappy about his death.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wrote his first book when he was furloughed from his
airline employer during a cutback. His temporary loss was the
reader's gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Experiment'' by John Darnton (Dutton, $24.95) is a
painless lesson in cutting-edge medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Darnton, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and now cultural news
editor of the New York Times, has been down this route before with
his best-selling novel ``Neanderthal.''
</P>
<P>
   Skyler is a young man living on an island off the coast of South
Carolina. He and his fellows receive minimal education, maximum
medical care and indoctrination in the glories of science.
</P>
<P>
   And every once in a while, one of their members in good health
suddenly dies. One of those dead was the young woman Skyler loved _
a love forbidden by the rules of the island. It's then that Skyler
escapes.
</P>
<P>
   Jude Harley is a reporter for a New York tabloid newspaper and a
successful novelist with a strange past. He grew up outside a small
mining town in Arizona. His parents were part of a scientific cult.
Both died early, and Jude wound up in a New England prep school.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harley starts receiving some weird reports. He's been seen
living on the streets of New York, rummaging through garbage cans.
Harley investigates and finds Skyler. And except for the fact that
Skyler is a few years younger, he is Harley's identical twin.
</P>
<P>
   Darnton does it all in this book. He mixes sound science, a
far-out plot, sympathetic characters and relentless action.
</P>
<P>
   It's New Year's Eve in Washington. The end of the century. And
on an escalator to the city's Metro subway, someone opens fire with
a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not a senseless act of terrorism. A note is delivered
to city hall demanding $20 million or the killings will continue.
The note warns that it will do no good to apprehend its writer, for
the person doing the actual killing will continue unless called off
by the note writer.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after leaving the note, the writer is accidentally
killed in a traffic accident. The police and the FBI scramble to
accomplish a nearly impossible task: Find the anonymous killer
before he kills again.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI turns to Parker Kinkaid, one of the best document
examiners in the world, for help in learning what they can from the
note. But Kinkaid has a condition. His children were threatened by
a killer in a prior case. He's divorced and has custody. If his
wife finds out his role in this investigation, she will go to court
and probably wind up with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``The Devil's Teardrop'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25).
The author is Jeffery Deaver, a veteran thriller writer. This one
is a grabber, marred only by an unbelievable ending. But while the
ending is bumpy, the ride is wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   At least five novelists have made or are making a living writing
about naval action during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Most write about the British navy. James L. Nelson, a native of
Maine and a former professional sailor on a square-rigged sailing
ship, sticks with his own kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lords of the Ocean'' (Pocket Books, $23) is the fourth
offering in his ``Revolution at Sea Saga.'' In this series, the bad
guys are the British.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Isaac Biddlecomb _ perhaps the most oddly named action
hero ever to tread a fictional deck _ starts his latest adventure
in New York. The American Revolution is under way. The British are
attacking, and Gen. George Washington's troops face defeat. There's
no way to get them off the island of Manhattan. The Revolution
could end right here.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Biddlecomb, who leads a successful raid on the tied-up
British fleet, steals their boats and ferries Washington's army to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to France. Biddlecomb's mission is to ferry
Benjamin Franklin to that country so he can rally French support
for the fledgling nation. Next, the captain sets out to bring the
war to British waters.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson knows sailing, and he knows people. In Biddlecomb he has
an all-too-human hero willing to step over any barrier to keep the
British at bay and his own career on track.

 &HT;    GOVERNORS STALEMATE AT HEARING ON SCHOOL VOUCHERS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida refused Thursday to use
``the V-word'' as members of Congress searched for a compromise
over the role of vouchers in public school reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all can call them vouchers,'' Bush told the House Budget
Committee. But because the term had become ``politicized,'' he
added, ``we call them opportunity scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers are payments of tax money to parents who choose to send
their children to private or parochial schools. Republicans tend to
see them as giving parents more options in educating their
children, and Democrats tend to see them as a threat to public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   No signs of compromise emerged during hours of questioning of a
parade of witnesses led of Bush and two former governors, Education
Secretary Richard Riley and Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who chairs the committee and describes
himself as ``an aggressive supporter of vouchers,'' lamented, ``If
we are unable to reach a consensus on vouchers, we will never be
able to move forward _ to do what we all want to do, improve
education for all kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush this year convinced the Florida legislature to offer
vouchers to the parents of any child whose public school is graded
``F'' two years in a row on a report card based on how well its
students do in standardized tests. The parents can also use the
vouchers to send their child to a better-performing public school.
</P>
<P>
   In a small-scale test of Florida's statewide experiment, parents
of 134 students at two failing elementary schools in Pensacola
accepted vouchers. This fall, the parents sent 58 of the children
to four parochial schools and a private Montessori school, and the
other 76 to better-performing public schools, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said school officials told him that roughly half of the
children whose parents used the vouchers had had high scores on the
standardized tests that Florida uses to rate its public schools,
and the other half had low scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``But none of the fourth and fifth graders whose (very) poor
grades led to the failure took vouchers,'' said Rep. Jim Davis,
D-Fla. He said it was unfair that their schools were left with a
high concentration of the lowest-performing students who are
hardest to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them stayed,'' he told Bush. ``You have ensured
inevitable failure for many of our struggling schools.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter that charge, Bush described the 61,000 students in 78
public schools which in June received an F grade on the Florida
Comprehensive Assessment Test for the first time. He said all but
19 percent of those students are minorities and all but 15 percent
qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a welfare program for the rich,'' Bush said.
``It's an opportunity program for the disadvantaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's private-school voucher option is far less important
than the fact that Florida's reforms offer extra resources to a
failing school, require that it develop a state-approved plan for
improvement, and give its administrators and teachers proof that
they must raise their students' scores, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration remains strongly opposed to vouchers,
said Riley, a former South Carolina governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voucher proposals can only distract the American people from
the hard work of real education reform, drain critically needed
funds from our public schools, and undermine support for public
education,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, a former Cleveland mayor and Ohio governor who
supports vouchers, told the House committee that it is far too
early either to draw lessons from or to criticize Bush's education
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida's schools are horrible, and he's trying something new.
Good for him,'' Voinovich said. ``Some people say terrible things
will happen. Who knows? I don't know. But why is it that so many
people are afraid of new ideas?''

of the late George C. Scott as he appeared in ``12 Angry Men.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was one of the greatest American actors of the 20th Century _
``the common man's Laurence Olivier,'' as one friend put it. And
George C. Scott, the reluctant Oscar-winner, went out the way he
would have wanted to.
 &HT;    Scott, who died on the night of Sept. 22 at his home in Westlake
Village, Calif., was a working actor to the end. Despite failing
health, he completed his final performance _ as the fanatical
fundamentalist orator Matthew Harrison Brady, opposite Jack Lemmon
in a Showtime adaptation of the classic stage drama, ``Inherit the
Wind'' _ and made it one of his best.
 &HT;    Earlier this year, during filming on ``Inherit the Wind,'' I sat
down for a rare interview with Scott in his dressing room outside a
sound stage in Valencia, Calif. Clearly in poor health, the actor
was nonetheless in rare form for what proved to be one of his final
interviews.
 &HT;    His acting chops were as good as ever, too. Fellow Oscar-winner
Geoffrey Rush _ who won a statuette for ``Shine'' (l997) _ happened
to be shooting a film nearby, and later revealed to me that he
regularly had snuck onto the ``Inherit the Wind'' set, just to
watch the great Scott in action.
 &HT;    The grand, distinctively booming voice from somewhere low in the
diaphragm was as robust as ever, but Scott was not in good shape.
Severe, debilitating arthritis in both his knees had left him hard
pressed to walk unaided _ he needed a golf cart for the 100-yard
trip to his dressing room _ and he had a history of heart problems,
including surgery for clogged arteries in 1990.
 &HT;    But when he took center stage Scott was as powerful as ever.
This was an actor who knew how to project to the back of the
gallery, a theatrical presence second to none.
 &HT;    ``He's being very brave,'' director Daniel Petrie told me.
``It's very tough on him. It's very hard for him to stand up _ he
has to grab onto something to push himself onto his feet ... When
you're looking at it, you'd think it would be impossible for him.
But when you see his performance, the concentration is there so
strongly you forget about it.''
 &HT;    After completing a key confrontation with Lemmon, Scott was
about to quit for the day, so for once he was relaxed and even
talkative.
 &HT;    In fact, he wanted to talk boxing. He was a fervent fan of the
ring, and we got into an animated discussion of the then-recent
Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight bout.
 &HT;    Standing up for my native England, I told Scott I thought that
the Britisher Lewis had been robbed. Scott roared back that I was
nuts _ he had seen the fight, and insisted that Holyfield deserved
his victory.
 &HT;    Boxing was a passion for Scott, who only months before had made
another Showtime film in which he played the Italian-immigrant
father of the heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano.
 &HT;    ``Ah, Rocky Marciano,'' the actor said nostalgically. ``He
wasn't a big man _ he weighed around 185 pounds, which was light
for a heavyweight. He could hit awfully hard. They said he was a
great heart puncher _ he'd hit you in the heart and your whole body
would stop. He was also an arm puncher. He hit you in your arms,
and after a while you couldn't lift your bloody arms. He was a
technician.''
 &HT;    Scott was not a technician. He once told me that he couldn't
bear the current fashion among young actors to talk about ``their
craft.''
 &HT;    ``It isn't a craft,'' he said grumpily. ``Carpentry's a craft.
Acting's an art.''
 &HT;    The way Scott did it, it was. When he won his Oscar as Best
Actor for ``Patton'' (1970), he turned it down, calling the whole
affair ``a meaningless, self-serving meat parade.'' Many observers
were scandalized, but they shouldn't have been surprised _ Scott
had refused a best-supporting-actor nomination for ``The Hustler''
in l961, and soon after spurning his ``Patton'' Oscar he rejected
an Emmy for his performance in Arthur Miller's ``The Price.'' Scott
was nothing if not consistent.
 &HT;    But he was so good that he could get away with it. In fact, the
year after he'd snubbed the Academy over ``Patton,'' he was
nominated again for his work in ``The Hospital'' (1971). You could
call him undiplomatic, dogmatic or downright surly, but his talent
was undeniable.
 &HT;    Scott, who would have turned 72 on Oct. l8, was never an easy
interview. Notoriously volatile, in his earlier days he was also a
legendary drinker on a par with Richard Burton or Peter O'Toole.
One lunch I shared with him went from 12:30 til almost 4:30 p.m.,
with Scott expounding from his favorite table at a Hollywood
restaurant as he knocked back drink after drink.
 &HT;    His famous temper spared no one, not even his friends or the
people he most admired. In fact, he told me, it cost him the lead
role in ``2001'' (1968), the masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick, his
favorite director and the man who had helmed Scott's favorite of
his own films, ``Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love the Bomb'' (1964).
 &HT;    ``He was a mad genius, there's no question about it,'' Scott
told me shortly after Kubrick's death. ``I liked him very much. He
was a great photographer, he had a great eye and he was a pretty
good writer as well.
 &HT;    ``But ever morning he'd come in, get Peter (Sellers) and the
rest of us together and say, `I hate this scene. I wrote it, and I
hate it. So I'll just have to rewrite it,''' Scott recalled. ``So
that's what we did practically every day. And we'd shoot it. I
hated that, because they shot for ever and ever. But he was never
dreary. He was a perfectionist _ there's no question about that.
 &HT;    ``He wanted me to do `2001,' but he wouldn't give me any
billing,'' Scott added. ``And I said, `I want billing.' I told him,
`My God, why do you think I've been in this business all these
years?'
 &HT;    ``He told me, `I'm not giving billing to anybody.' So I didn't
do it. I was doing what I was doing, and he was doing what he was
doing.''
 &HT;    Even as his health failed, Scott was still looking for his next
role.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking to do something with Bill Cosby for television,
just the two of us,'' he said. ``I've never worked with him. I'd
love to do it, because I've known him for years. And I may direct a
one-man show on Red Barber, the great sportscaster.''
 &HT;    As he waited for his driver to take him home _ he'd been married
to actress Trish Van Devere since 1972 _ Scott kept insisting that
he'd love to retire.
 &HT;    ``I've been trying to retire for over 30 years,'' he told me,
``but economically it's been an impossibility. But my wife says
I'll never quit until I keel over. So I just seem to keep at it.''
 &HT;    There were undoubtedly more great performances in George C.
Scott which we will now never see. He leaves an extraordinary
legacy _ if he'd been British, they'd have made him a knight.
 &HT;    He would probably have turned that down, too.

`GUINEVERE': YOUNG WOMAN, OLDER MAN (BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT) 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audrey Wells' ``Guinevere'' is the affectionately told story of
an impressionable 21-year-old who grows up under the sexual and
intellectual tutelage of an older man.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wells, who wrote the barbed screenplay for ``The Truth About
Cats and Dogs,'' may well have only the most impersonal interest in
this subject. But her beguiling film has a persuasive been-there,
done-that knowingness. And it has the luminous young actress Sarah
Polley in its central role, with Stephen Rea as the seasoned flirt
who takes her into the well-populated space under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Polley plays Harper Sloane, sullen daughter of a stiffly
pretentious bourgeois family that loves to discuss legal affairs at
dinner. As the only member of the family who slumps and cowers,
Harper is noticeably disaffected.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she is wandering disenchantedly through the wedding of
her sparklier sister when she finds a kindred spirit: Connie
Fitzpatrick (Rea), the man hired to take wedding photographs.
Connie has the air of an artist. Harper has the desperation of
someone in need of a change.
</P>
<P>
   Connie impresses Harper with his artist's eye and bohemian
affectations, i.e., the kind of friends who give parties where
someone plays the saxophone. But Harper should see a telltale sign
when she visits Connie's loft and finds an embittered ex-girlfriend
screaming at him. It turns out that he uses the nickname Guinevere
indiscriminately, and that Harper is the latest in a long string of
Guineveres.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wells' film is attuned to the dynamics of how Harper and
Connie use each other so cooperatively. While he flatters Harper by
insisting that she is an artist, and encouraging her in that
direction, she fulfills his need for both a disciple and a lover.
It's a delicate balance that satisfies both at first, especially
when it gives Harper the strength to defy her snobbish mother (Jean
Smart).
</P>
<P>
   But ``Guinevere'' also understands the impermanence of such
arrangements, and the likelihood that Harper will change more than
Connie wants her to. Ms. Wells makes this story engaging and
touching, but those who like a good car chase or jewel heist may
find this a somewhat ladylike cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   Except when the film forces them to be whimsical, Rea and Ms.
Polley show a lovely rapport, and a bantering kinship that makes
the relationship credible. Ms. Polley in particular captures the
full emotional range of a young woman trying on the mantle of a
Guinevere, and ultimately using it to her own advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes nudity and sexual situations.

MONTGOMERIE, THE GENTLE MONSTER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ This wasn't peak season at Disney World, so
the lines were shorter than usual; they were merely endless. The
Orlando sun didn't cast a hellish glare; it was merely equatorial.
And the young family from England didn't have to bother with even
the slightest inconvenience, anyway; in Walt's world, they rated as
bona fide VIPs, the father being an international celebrity and
all.
</P>
<P>
   Go right to the head of the lines, the mother, father, and two
young children were told. No waiting to be jolted at the Tower of
Terror, drenched on Splash Mountain, serenaded by the bears'
jamboree. Let the hoi polloi get parboiled and deal with the clamor
of impatient children; these honored guests were entitled to
instant fantasy gratification with all the valet trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No thank you,'' said the father, Colin Montgomerie, politely
but firmly. ``No special treatment. We'll wait our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was scuffling during the second round of the British Open at
Carnoustie two months ago. No scorecard was necessary for evidence;
as usual under such circumstances, Colin Montgomerie's demeanor was
a deadly giveaway. He was acting as if a plague of locusts
inhabited his golf bag.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful golfer in the history of the European PGA
Tour was in the process of shooting himself out of contention in
his latest quest to fill the one gaping blank on his resume _ win a
major championship. Worse, he was doing it on his home soil,
Scotland, and even though he became an expatriate at an early age,
these were still his people and he was overwhelmingly their man. He
had prevailed for the first time ever in his birthplace, at the
Loch Lomond Open in Glasgow, just a week before. And while he had
discounted the momentum that might be provided by that victory or
playing before a wildly partisan crowd _ ``It will be a dream
scenario to win a major, never mind in Scotland,'' he had said
earlier in the week _ it was obvious he had grand designs here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Carnoustie monster gobbled him up, as he found his
shots being devoured by the voracious heather rough and the
sinister burn _ the channel of canals crossing the course _
Montgomerie went into his classic wounded diva repertoire. His face
became frozen in a malevolent glower. He berated photographers for
impeding his sight lines and concentration. His caddie often
admonished fans to abandon obtrusive positions around the greens;
in fact, the slightest movement among the gallery, including
breathing, seemed to strike Montgomerie as a major nuisance. By the
time he polished off his 5-over-par 76 in the shadow of the new
luxury hotel that is the backdrop to the 18th green, he stared
lasers through the revelers on the veranda witnessing his plight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wonder that the building and the patrons were still
standing when he finished.
</P>
<P>
   ( &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the dichotomy of Colin Montgomerie, the No. 1 player on
the European team that will try to capture its third straight Ryder
Cup from the United States, beginning Friday at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-nine percent of the time, he is the sportsman's ideal:
charming, deferential, gracious, a quintessential gentleman. But
that tends to be obscured _ along with his stature as Europe's most
decorated golfer, winner of the continent's Order of Merit money
title for an unparalleled seventh straight year _ by his actions
the other 1 percent. When he is struggling around the course,
admittedly a rare occurrence, he becomes the Grate Scot,
cantankerous and churlish and rude, like a whiny kid at the end of
a Disney amusement line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the course, he is a lovely man,'' says his Ryder teammate,
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal. ``He's like _ what's the name
of that movie about the doctor? Yes, `Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.' On
the course, he's very intense. I don't even think he realizes he's
doing it. He's got to learn to control that side of his
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie does realize the problem, at least in terms of
public perception, and he is trying to fix it, though he offers a
mild self-defense: ``If I went into an office and watched people at
work, I don't think they'd be smiling all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Montgomerie emphasizes, his operatic reactions to
misfortune on the course are nothing personal _ except against
himself. ``I'm very ambitious out there,'' he says. ``I want to do
my best. I'm very demanding of myself. When I'm not doing well,
it's myself I'm upset with. But I think you get a press label and
people come to the course with their minds made up about you.''
</P>
<P>
   European captain Mark James, who will be banking on
Montgomerie's 9-6-3 record in four Ryder Cups to steady an
inexperienced team this weekend, agrees that some crowds are
predisposed against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wears his heart on his sleeve,'' says James. ``He can rub
people the wrong way on the course. I don't know why. Some people
have a knack for it. He gets upset, but a lot of people do and they
don't get criticized. One player can ask for quiet and there's
titters in the gallery. Others do it and it's a big deal. I think
he's gotten a raw deal.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``It's something I've worked on,'' says
Montgomerie. ``I find that the more relaxed I am, the better I
play. And that would take care of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a flawed Montgomerie is dominant. In 11 seasons on the
European Tour, he has won 22 tournaments, including five this year,
when he became the first man to ring up at least 1 million pounds
in earnings _ some $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever had a player here in the States win six or seven
(money titles) in a row,'' says Olazabal, ``it would be like God in
person. You're not going to find anyone do that for many, many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, self-effacing to a fault, is reluctant to exalt his
own achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say, because I'm doing it myself,'' he says.
``I don't see how others see it. To break a record and keep
breaking your own record is something. I don't think I'll fully
appreciate it until I'm not winning anymore. Then I'll look back on
what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   At 36, he is more than willing to consider what he hasn't done _
win a major or a US PGA event _ and unwilling to give himself a
break even when others offer it. It seems a rather petty knock, he
is told. He hasn't exactly disappeared when he's crossed the
Atlantic. He's been runner-up three times in the US Open and he has
advanced to _ and lost _ playoffs in two majors, the US Open and
PGA Championship. Doesn't that smack of a lack of appreciation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he says. ``I haven't won over here, have I?
Until I win in the States, I can see why (he would be criticized).
It's something I'd like to do in the States, win a major or a
regular Tour event.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning a major would be the crowning glory, and while
Montgomerie says, ``It's something I'd very much like to do and
haven't done,'' he adds, ``At the same time, it's nice to be
mentioned in the same breath with David Duval and Phil Mickelson as
`the best players never to win a major.' It's better than if I won
a major and they said, `What a shocker.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At least he must acknowledge that he is without peer on the
Continent. But even that surprises him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodness no,'' he says when asked if he expected to make such
a splash after turning pro upon graduation from Houston Baptist
College in 1987. ``In 1990-94, there was an absolute wealth of
European talent _ Sandy Lyle and (Nick) Faldo and (Bernhard) Langer
and Jose and Seve (Ballesteros). They were all well ahead of me,
and some of them always will be. I mean, six majors (as Faldo has
won) _ I'm not going to do that now, am I?''
</P>
<P>
   His father, James, a retired biscuit factory manager and former
secretary of the prestigious Royal Troon Golf Club, is accustomed
to such remarks by his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin is that way, very hard on himself,'' says James.
``Sometimes too harsh, I'd say.''

TIGER WOODS: GOLF MAGICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ There is sweet irony to this: Tiger Woods the
golfer seemingly was planned from birth, molded and fashioned and
fine-tuned every year by his father, himself, and his coaches; but
the Tiger Woods now known to most Americans _ the golf magician in
the Nike commercial _ has leaped virtually free-form and
spontaneous from that static world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you've ever been to a photo shoot, but there
is a lot of time waiting,'' Woods said. ``I was doing a sequence
commercial, a sequence of shots, and that was what was originally
planned. But there was time between takes. It was a hot day in
Florida and I just started to entertain the people at the photo
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he often does, entertaining himself and friends by doing
tricks with golf balls and clubs. No hidden wires, no trick camera
shots, no computer-generated images, no grand and detailed planning
or sequencing over days and weeks. Just Tiger Woods having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I just started to do all my different tricks, all my
different shots, my popups, all of them,'' Woods said of his now
famous commercial. ``And I hadn't planned any of that. I was just
trying to pass the time. And the camera just proceeded to keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was such a magician with his club that now he has a new,
bug-eyed following. Typical was the scene Tuesday at The Country
Club when Lawyer Milloy, a safety with the Patriots, spent his day
off following Woods through much of a practice round for the Ryder
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes spending their days off to watch other athletes is
uncommon, but there was Milloy and teammates Drew Bledsoe and Ted
Johnson and the Celtics' Dana Barros, watching Woods, too. That
sight of athletes out to see the sensation is common with Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy was impressed by what he saw. And what was most
impressive? ``Tiger did those tricks of his down there in the
practice area,'' said Milloy. ``You know, like the tricks he does
in his commerical. Very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The same day, another follower of Woods was impressed. US Ryder
Cup captain Ben Crenshaw followed Woods's group through part of
another practice round. Crenshaw was in as much awe with Woods the
golfer as the crowd at the practice green was with Woods the
trickster.

<P>
   ``Tiger's doing things that I . . .'' Crenshaw began to stammer.
``I mean, he used a 6-iron on No. 7, a par 3 (of 197 yards), a very
difficult par 3, where 20 years ago when I played here it was a
3-iron. And what does he do on the hole? He takes out a 6-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   The weight of the golfing world, not to mention the universe,
seems planted on Crenshaw's shoulders this week. The US captain,
who appears obsessed with winning back the Ryder Cup, seemingly has
not enjoyed any golf shot he has seen except in how it fits into
his grand scheme of defeating the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is watching Tiger because we haven't seen anybody
that good in a long time,'' said Crenshaw, a noted golf historian.
``I mean, ever. It's very difficult to transport your mind back to
when Jack Nicklaus started out but (Woods) is that good.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantages of being Tiger Woods are obvious: He can do
little that any man in his early 20s can do, from going out to a
movie, for a beer or to a restaurant without a public frenzy
erupting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when asked what is the best thing about being Tiger Woods,
he gave an immediate answer. ``It's getting up every morning and
enjoying what I'm doing,'' he said. ``I can't wait to get out (to a
golf course) and I can't wait to practice and I can't wait to swing
the clubs. I'm putting or I'm chipping around the house. I'm always
doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   The two, the good and bad, will blend this weekend. Woods will
be at the center of attention _ frenzied crowds following him from
tee to green _ but he also will be where he seemed destined to be _
on a golf course carrying the hopes of his country on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw is counting on Woods to step to the first tee five
times, starting Friday. The US captain, in fact, has tailored The
Country Club course in several spots just so Woods _ and other long
US hitters _ can attempt aggressive shots that might lead to
birdies.
</P>
<P>
   US fans do not need the fingers on their hands to count the
points they're expecting from Woods. After all, he has been the
best player in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   At Valderrama, Spain, two years ago, Woods's debut in Ryder Cup
play was widely anticipated, but he was ineffective, going 1-3-1
and even losing his singles match to Constantino Rocca. Woods
blamed his poor record on too many social obligations (``I didn't
get enough rest'') and that he was not playing well going into the
Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience in 1997, from the Western (Open) on, I wasn't
playing that well,'' said Woods. ``Unfortunately it carried over to
the Ryder Cup. And I just didn't hit the shots at the right time.
And I didn't make the putts. But this year, I'm coming into this
tournament with more of a positive attitude and rightfully so. I've
played well this summer. The Ryder Cup suits my game because it's
match play and I absolutely love it.''
</P>
<P>
   So well that the Europeans are aware that Woods alone could give
the US team a huge boost toward retaking the Cup. In fact, European
captain Mark James called on 1997 captain Seve Ballesteros to give
pointers to the team during a dinner last week in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Rocca, for his part, has said he was able to beat Woods by
ignoring the American's huge drives. As with most golfers who play
Woods, Rocca was usually the first to hit his second shot and the
Italian knew he couldn't outdrive Woods. ``So I made sure my second
shot was better than his,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, for his part, said he feels more a part of the US team
this year than he did two years ago, when he was still a new face
on the tour. At Valderrama, said Woods, ``I really didn't know all
the guys on the team that well. I didn't know their wives, their
girlfriends, their kids. This year it's different. I know everybody
on the team and I know all the wives and girlfriends and kids. It's
a big difference. It makes you feel more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings, presidents, princes, Michael Jordans, Wayne Gretzkys, and
John Elways all will be out to see this passion play, but also to
see Tiger Woods. Woods said he does not to notice who is following
him ``and I don't care who's out there following me. I still have
to hit the shot. It's nice to have people out there supporting you
who have accomplished something in their lives But regardless of
who is out there, you have to focus on the shot at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Tiger Woods was a comet across the sky. In 1998, he was
merely another golfer, albeit a very good one. The two are
connected because Woods realized more than a year ago that if that
comet was to keep from sputtering out, he would need to refine his
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Like a master craftsman who realized his handiwork was good, but
not the best, Woods stepped back into the shadows and worked on his
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think where I am now is a product of a lot of hard work,''
said Woods. ``All the things that I've done over the last two years
to get myself to this position are starting to pay off now. And I
think that's what everybody is starting to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Many felt Woods had reached a plateau last year, that he was a
very good golfer but his progress was not the progress of Nicklaus,
two golf generations earlier, a progression that seemed
uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered your questions last year and I told you I was a
better player,'' said Woods. ``And you go, `How could you be a
better player?' Well, I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Harmon reworked the golf swing, refined it, seeking to
eliminate any wayward tendencies that led to bogeys and double
bogeys that had bedeviled him. The results were not evident last
year, but Woods was confident he was on the right road.
</P>
<P>
   But those who remembered the four tournaments Woods won in 1997,
including the Masters, were skeptical, sauing he had virtually
disappeared in the 1998 majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling everybody all along that my game was getting
better (in 1998) and that it was better than it was in '97 even
though I didn't win,'' he said. ``I said my game was on its way and
that it was headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of Woods and Harmon was to construct a solid swing, one
that would not wither under pressure. But it was not until this
year that the work paid off in tournaments won, especially events
deep in talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' said Woods, ``I've driven the ball beautifully all
year. It's just now that my swing is starting to feel more
comfortable. All the changes I've made have really come together
now. I have stayed patient. I understood the changes I was making
were going to take time. And now they are starting to come to
fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   An understatement. For Woods clearly is the best golfer in the
world now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy for all golf fans is that the Ryder Cup is close
heading into the singles matches Sunday. And that James does not go
down the predictable road and list Colin Montgomerie as his No. 1
to compete against Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Montgomerie said at Augusta two years ago that there
is more to golf than driving, only to have Woods vault away from
Montgomerie and the field, it seems that Woods could intimidate the
Scot. But there is a fearless 19-year-old on the European squad,
Sergio Garcia, a Spaniard with charisma and the golf fans dream on.
Tiger Woods against Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   It could be magic. Spontaneous, too, just like Tiger Woods the
golf magician in the television commercial.

 &HT;    BAUER OFFERS PLAN FOR FLAT TAX ON INCOME
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer called
Thursday for
</P>
<P>
   a flat 16 percent tax rate on income and a 20 percent cut in the
Social Security payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, struggling with several other GOP candidates to emerge as
the conservative alternative to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, said
his plan differed from those of his closest challengers,
particularly those of publisher Steve Forbes, who popularized the
notion of a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Press Club, Bauer criticized
Forbes's plan for giving businesses tax breaks for capital
investments. Bauer said his tax plan would reward families, not
corporations. He would allow deductions only for home mortgage
payments and charitable contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In another move toward simpler taxes, Bauer also would create a
tax credit of $1,400 a person that would replace the personal
exemption, the child care tax credit and other credits. He would
also eliminate the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also slammed Bush for offering a tax package in Texas
which, he said, originally included more tax increases than it did
tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining his Social Security plan, Bauer distanced himself
from most other GOP presidential candidates, who have embraced some
degree of private investment to shore up individual Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring people to invest their payroll taxes in the stock
market would be ``an unholy alliance between big government and
Wall Street,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   While current benefits would be retained for those already
retired, Bauer said he would reduce benefits by a proportional
amount based on how many years a worker received the payroll tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he would trust individuals to make wise choices with
that portion of their money and would not provide government
assistance to anyone who lost the money through unwise or unlucky
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two tax cuts, a 16 percent family-friendly flat tax and a
20 percent tax cut in the payroll tax, not only would deliver the
lowest overall tax rate of any reform, it would also finally align
the tax code back with our values. I think this is a true
conservative vision for America, and I'm willing to debate it
anywhere in the
</P>
<P>
   country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's tax plan drew fire from Karen Kerrigan, chairman of the
Small Business Survival Committee, an advocacy group with more than
50,000 small business members, for failing to reward business
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax plan outlined today by Gary Bauer is an attempt to
appear as an economic populist, but his plan will knee-cap small
businesses and economic opportunities,'' Kerrigan said.

   Much of television is one giant recycling bin; a glance at Nick
at Nite, TV Land or half a dozen other cable channels with shows
older than their viewers is enough to tell you that. And as the
first week of this new season comes to an end, it is obvious that
recycling has gone far beyond cable's endless loop of ``Happy
Days.'' Repurposing (the latest code word for recycling) is the
story of the season's supposedly fresh network shows, too. Several
series that begin this weekend test the theory that what works for
old Coke cans and milk cartons may also work for ``Charlie's
Angels'' and ``The Wonder Years.''
</P>
<P>
   In CBS's ``Now and Again,'' the brain of a middle-aged husband
is put into the scientifically enhanced, superpowerful body of a
young man. Unlike the body in the '70s hit ``The Six Million Dollar
Man,'' this one cost $3 billion, which at least adjusts the idea
for inflation. Despite the echo of a hokey past, the quirky ``Now
and Again'' is one of the season's most appealing shows, largely
because it grafts its Frankenstein plot onto a romance: The
hard-bodied hero has a mind that still yearns for his middle-aged
wife. A stolen idea, after all, can work if it is transformed, not
simply pilfered with a gloat.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Freaks and Geeks,'' about high school insiders and
misfits in the '80s, has a combination of wryness and nostalgia
that evokes ``The Wonder Years,'' itself an '80s show looking back
at the '60s. (That series has taken on a second life on Nick at
Nite.) Though it has a winning, low-keyed charm, ``Freaks and
Geeks'' can't escape its sense of borrowed wonder. But at least it
has some.
</P>
<P>
   Other series arrive looking as limp and obvious as a reused gift
bow. NBC's ``Cold Feet'' is ``Thirtysomething Lite,'' borrowing
that show's offputting earnestness without its redeeming realism.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's oddest transition comes when David E. Kelley
morphs between Jekyll and Hyde. He has created the worst and the
best dramas of the week, running back-to-back on Sunday on ABC: His
new, unwatchable detective series, ``Snoops,'' leads into his
first-rate returning legal series, ``The Practice.'' Of course,
Kelley is also responsible for the season's most blatant
repurposing: ``Ally'' (coming Tuesday), a half-hour show that puts
chopped-up pieces of ``Ally McBeal'' together again.
</P>
<P>
   Even the reason behind all this repackaging is getting old.
Losing viewers, the networks timidly try to protect the turf they
have left. The best that can be expected is a safe idea, highly
polished. ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' is a sterling
spinoff of ``Law and Order,'' and Kelley's revamped, recast
``Chicago Hope'' is better than last season's version. But this is
not a trend that points toward a creative future.
</P>
<P>
   And the many variations on ``Dawson's Creek'' haven't even
arrived yet. Most will trickle in during the next few weeks,
including ``Roswell,'' once called ``Roswell High,'' in which
extraterrestrials repurpose themselves as high school students and
hope no one will notice the difference.

`MINUS MAN' ADDS UP TO UNEXCEPTIONAL
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Repeating story of Sep. 22 to delete reference to Dwight
Yoakam) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Don't bring a dumb date'' is a cocky (not to mention
condescending) tag line for a movie, and ``The Minus Man'' doesn't
entirely live up to the boast. It's an intriguing enough study of
an ingratiating young man who happens to be a serial killer, but
your smart date is just as likely to find it dry and empty as to
find it perceptive and thought-provoking.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Hampton Fancher, who wrote the screenplays for
1982's ``Blade Runner'' and 1989's ``The Mighty Quinn,'' isn't
interested in exploitation _ or even chills (this is probably the
least violent serial-killer movie you'll ever see). He's primarily
interested in getting inside the head of Vann (Dallas' Owen
Wilson), a sweet, attractive, low-key guy who has a nasty habit of
poisoning people (even this is seen as part of Vann's ``niceness,''
because he picks the most humane way he can think of to dispatch
his victims).
</P>
<P>
   The movie sees things through Vann's eyes, and because even he
doesn't know why he indulges in his fatal hobby, it's up to us to
try to figure out his motives.
</P>
<P>
   Vann drifts into an oceanside town, where he boards with Jane
and Doug (Mercedes Ruehl and Brian Cox), a couple who are also more
troubled than they appear on the surface. Doug gets Vann a job at
the post office, where Vann attracts the attentions of a shy
co-worker (a more-vulnerable-than-usual Janeane Garofalo). And he
continues to practice his pastime, getting more bold and sloppy as
he goes along.
</P>
<P>
   Another tag line for the movie is ``Conversation usually
follows,'' and that seems like a better boast, as the movie is
almost guaranteed to get you talking about what makes Vann and the
others tick (of course, the conversation might start with ``What
the $%&AMP;! was that all about?''). The movie's press notes
breathlessly brag about how it's a look behind the ``surface of
normality,'' as if that were an original concept. It wasn't even
original when Alfred Hitchcock, whom Fancher clearly admires,
addressed it decades ago in ``Suspicion'' and ``Shadow of a
Doubt.'' You can even catch variations on the theme in two other
movies this week, ``American Beauty'' and ``Mumford.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fancher does give ``The Minus Man'' a sustained moodiness,
marked by dark humor, and he gets good performances out of his
cast, especially Wilson and Cox. Singer Sheryl Crow is impressive
in a brief, booze-soaked prologue.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to be comfortable with a movie about a sympathetic
serial killer when real-life mass violence has recently hit so
close to home. Comfort isn't the point here, though; the point is
to get you talking. ``The Minus Man'' succeeds at that, but despite
the movie's pride in itself, it's unlikely that the conversation
will last the entire post-movie meal or long drive home.

 UNDATED: the difference.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `NOW AND AGAIN'
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely opening scene, an old man carrying a carton of
eggs leaves a few on the seat of a Tokyo subway. This is not some
ritual offering; soon the passengers have blood dripping from their
eyes and noses. The hauntingly effective scene soon gives way to a
New York setting. John Goodman plays Michael Wiseman, an insurance
executive in Manhattan, with a beloved wife (Margaret Colin) and
teen-age daughter (Heather Matarazzo of ``Welcome to the
Dollhouse'') in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot that ``Now and Again'' moves so smoothly between
these scenes. The series, created by Glenn Gordon Caron
(``Moonlighting''), relies on the juxtaposition of the weird and
the ordinary. In the first episode, it works with surprising ease.
It may be stitched together from the parts of other shows, but
``Now and Again'' is unlike anything you've seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman is as engaging as always, so it's too bad he is pushed
in front of a subway (and out of the show) so soon. When he awakes,
he is merely a brain on a bed. Thankfully, we do not see the
disembodied brain. We do see, as he does, Dr. Theodore Morris
(Dennis Haysbert), the scientist who constructed his spiffy new
body for the government. When Michael (now engagingly played by
Eric Close) asks, ``Can I fly?,'' the doctor gives him a
smart-alecky response.
</P>
<P>
   As the series develops, Michael will be used as a government
agent. The eggman will return and presumably cross his path. But
Michael, already chafing at the way his every move is monitored,
feels as if he is in the worst Witness Protection Program on earth.
Forbidden to contact his wife and daughter, he is constantly trying
to slip away to see them. By turns eerie, funny and touching, ``Now
and Again'' may turn out to be the season's best (or maybe its
only) surprise.
</P>
<P>
   `FREAKS AND GEEKS'
</P>
<P>
   It seems a cruel joke that this is scheduled for Saturday night,
as if betting that loners will be home waiting for a show that
turns geekdom into heroism. The nerds are represented here by Sam
Weir (John Daley), a high school freshman who could pass for age
10. His friends are Neal (Samm Levine), who looks and talks like a
pint-size Catskills comedian, and the gangly Bill (Martin Starr).
</P>
<P>
   The would-be freak is Sam's intelligent, sensitive sister,
Lindsay (Linda Cardellini), a sophomore who wears an old Army
jacket and doesn't really fit in with any crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is taunted by a bully, and Lindsay tries to befriend a
mentally retarded classmate with results that backfire. But the
show's appeal does not come from its plots. It is based on sharp
moments of recognition built in by Paul Feig, the show's creator
and writer: the matter-of-fact way a geeky friend protests
Lindsay's decision not to join the ``academic decathalon,'' saying,
``But you're our best mathlete''; the hilarious manner in which a
bearded, long-haired guidance counselor, desperate to be hip, says,
``Let's rap.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also, as anyone who has seen an NBC promo knows,
priceless dinner conversations in which Sam and Lindsay's father
(Joe Flaherty) reminds them that ordinary teen-age behavior leads
to death. ``You know who used to cut class?'' he asks. ``Jimi
Hendrix. You know what happened to him? He died.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all very deft, but who is it for? With its gentle humor,
``Freaks and Geeks'' is decidedly not for savvy '90s teens, but for
their baby boomer parents, looking back and wondering how they made
it out alive.
</P>
<P>
   `SNOOPS' and `THE PRACTICE'
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's latest creation features high-tech surveillance
equipment, colorful retro-style furniture that signals the show is
a step behind last year's Rat Pack trend, and two female private
investigators whose $5,000 fee will just about keep them in lip
gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Gershon is Glenn Hall, who owns the agency. She hires Dana
Plant (Paula Marshall of last year's equally unwatchable
``Cupid''), a former police detective with close ties to a
colleague and former lover (Edward Kerr).
</P>
<P>
   These private investigators hack into computer records, tap
phones and otherwise operate outside the law, but mostly they pose.
Their antics are not roguish, just boring. In the opening episode,
they are hired by a woman who says her nephew-in-law (played by the
all-purpose villain John Glover) murdered his wife by scaring her
into having a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Just because it is knowing enough to drop in a reference to
``Charlie's Angels'' next week doesn't mean this tedious series is
any improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snoops'' is a terrible lead-in to ``The Practice,'' which
begins its new season with a surprisingly convincing guest turn by
Henry Winkler as a meek dentist accused of murdering a patient with
a fetish for having her teeth cleaned; it turns out he has an
unusual fetish of his own. And George Vogelman (Michael Monks), who
found a severed head in his medical bag, is back with his eye on
Ellenor (Camryn Manheim). In ``The Practice,'' even the most
bizarre Kelley twists seem to work, mostly because of the ballast
provided by the sane Bobby Donnell (Dylan McDermott). Any season
now, ``The Practice'' could go all goofy and ``Ally McBeal'' on us,
but so far it remains amazingly good.
</P>
<P>
   `COLD FEET'
</P>
<P>
   This series about three couples, all friends, in different
stages of relationships, is fine if you think one out of three is
enough. The enjoyable couple is the least credible. Adam (David
Sutcliffe) and Shelley (Jean Louisa Kelly) are single, the ones
with the actual cold feet. They meet when he bumps into her with
his car, get together, then break up in mutual fear of commitment,
only to reconcile when he stands naked outside her window singing
``Fly Me to the Moon.'' Isn't that always the way? The actors bring
a light touch, and their story has a whimsy that at least makes it
entertaining fluff.
</P>
<P>
   The other couples are painfully earnest, even though their
stories are just as implausible. David (Anthony Starke) and Karen
(Alicia Coppola) have a baby. She wants a nanny and disrupts his
big business business meeting, baby on hip, refusing to leave until
he agrees. Most people would consider that grounds for divorce, but
here he just gives in. Jenny (Dina Spybey, with a whiny little girl
voice) is seven months pregnant with her first child; her
insatiable appetite for sex is wearing down her husband, Pete
(William Keane), who complains about this to his friend, Adam,
completing this useless circle.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Cold Feet'' is not unwatchable, but at times it seems that
watchable is all the networks aspire to.

<P>
   Moderate to locally heavy rains will douse parts of southern and
central Florida as a cool front, which stalled near the Keys
earlier in the week, reverses its field and presses northward as a
warm front.
</P>
<P>
   With tropical air from the southeast Gulf of Mexico streaming
northward over the front and with an upper-air disturbance arriving
from the Gulf of Mexico, the stage will be set for rainfalls of an
inch or more in some spots.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture from the remnants of Hurricane Hillary, which Thursday
fueled heavy rains in parts of the southern Rockies, will dwindle
Friday as it spreads eastward. Thus, though showers and
thunderstorms are possible over eastern New Mexico and west Texas,
most of the Southwest region will stay mainly dry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers will develop over parts of the eastern Great
Lakes, western New York and northwest New England as a cold front
and a trailing jet stream disturbance move over the region.
However, owing to a lack of moisture, showers will be generally
light and limited, though a few spots could receive a brief period
of moderate rain. East of the front, afternoon temperatures will
rebound along the Northeast Seaboard after a cool morning.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather will build across the Plains on Friday from Texas
to the Dakotas, although cooler air arriving from Canada and the
northern Rockies will keep temperatures down in North Dakota.
Farther west, a cold front will approach the Pacific Northwest
Coast, paving the way for rain to return to parts of western
Washington and northwest Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SEASONAL SWITCH
</P>
<P>
   The temperature fell to 49 degrees at Bush Intercontinental
Airport in Houston early Thursday, eclipsing the city's previous
record low for the date. Just 62 hours earlier, on Monday, the
mercury soared to 99 degrees, marking the latest date on record
that 99 degrees had been observed in Houston. The abrupt switch
from summer to autumn was orchestrated by a dry high pressure
system that arrived from the north on Tuesday. With little water
vapor in the atmosphere to radiate infrared energy to the surface,
a layer of still air in contact with the cooling ground chilled to
record levels.

FAMILY FOOTBALL TRADITION GROWS INTO INTERNET VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUZZ GRAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Four years ago, while sitting in his living room
watching pro football on television, Dave Dobert got an idea that
changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife cooking fun food and most of their five children
showing up in the war paint of their favorite NFL teams on Sundays,
Dobert realized how games on the small screen had acted as a magnet
for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Amid those surroundings, Dobert created Pigskin Parlor Inc., a
nonprofit group that focuses on fans and the positive images of
players, publishes a free NFL newspaper, and has a pioneering
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Dobert, 38, said Pigskin Parlor _ a Troy-based organization that
uses volunteers nationwide to help promote ``football through
families and families through football'' _ has become a large part
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week commitment now,''
Dobert said. ``But I believe you never gain anything valuable in
life without a sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigskin Parlor broke new ground on Sunday when fans with
Internet access through America Online asked questions of a New
York Giants player in a post-game chat room at
www.pigskinparlor.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely unprecedented,'' Greg Aiello, vice president
of public relations for the NFL, said about Pigskin Parlor's
ventures. ``In certain NFL cities, there are fan-based
organizations with similar services, but nothing approaches the
scope of this (Pigskin Parlor).''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Pat Hanlon, the Giants' director of public relations,
arranged for running back Gary Brown to be interviewed after New
York's game against the Washington Redskins. The interviewer, a
volunteer from Pigskin Parlor who was in the locker room at Giants
Stadium, was read the fans' on-line questions via telephone by
Dobert's wife, Joan, who was sitting at their computer in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's answers were relayed by phone from the volunteer back to
Dobert, who typed them into the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little unusual,'' Brown said of the process. ``But
the questions were similar to those I get from the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody mistook the proceedings for a high-level news conference
at the White House, but the on-line questions set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was well worth the effort on our end,'' Hanlon said.
``Their (Doberts') interest of combining a love of football within
the family framework is unique. I was impressed with their
dedication and enthusiasm from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobert said the Giants would provide one team member for the
chat-room service for each remaining home game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Czark, a public-relations employee for the New York Jets,
said she was attempting to arrange Internet interviews via Pigskin
Parlor for Jets home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I believe will bring the fans and players
closer together,'' Czark said.
</P>
<P>
   As the venture grows, Dobert said the only restrictions put on
chat-room use will be for participants to avoid foul language.
</P>
<P>
   Dobert said most of his free time has been devoted to Pigskin
Parlor Inc., which has 16 employees and produces a 24-page
newspaper (it was a magazine last year) that comes out five times
during the NFL season and has a press run of 5,000 to 8,000 copies
per issue. It is distributed mainly in this upstate New York city,
but Dobert dreams of national distribution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to overseeing the editing and production of the
Pigskin Parlor newspaper, Dobert holds two other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder if I'm a little crazy,'' Dobert said.
``Joan and I only sleep about four hours a night. We don't have
time for any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobert, however, said the family time makes it all worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three teen-agers who make sure they are available to
watch the 1 o'clock game with Dad every Sunday,'' Dobert said. ``I
treasure that. I love this game because it has a capacity for
building family traditions like nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobert said that even though Pigskin Parlor has been a financial
drain, he hopes for better days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've paid for much of it out of my own pocket,'' Dobert said.
``(But) we have received a few small grants and are planning a
fund-raising banquet later this season. Eventually, I would like to
attract major advertisers. ... I'm hoping a lot of the financial
worry will be gone within a year.''

AT WIMPOLE, KEEPING UP APPEARANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You no longer need to be to the manner born to be
lord of a manor, at least in England.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Damant, property manager of the 350-year-old Wimpole Hall
in Cambridgeshire, England, and his wife, Olga, have reared their
family in a second-floor suite of the 77-room red brick manor house
over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   They are employees of the National Trust fulfilling
responsibilities not so different from the lords of yore.
</P>
<P>
   The view from their bedroom is of a two-mile-long avenue of lime
trees to the south. To the north, at the ridge of a faraway hill,
is a Gothic folly known as an eye-catcher, which was built to look
like a castle in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Their vista may not be as arresting as the one at Versailles,
but it's a lot more bucolic, thanks to the talents of Lancelot
Capability Brown, the 18th-century English gardener who landscaped
the parkland.
</P>
<P>
   Today, sheep and miniature Dexter cattle roam the grounds, as
gardeners tend to the ever-growing formal gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The red brick stables and original thatched farm buildings have
been restored, and rare cattle are now bred and sold for profit at
the home farm. Two very large lakes were dug up and restored.
</P>
<P>
   Damant supervises the health, safety and work habits of 50
full-time employees and 150 volunteers who serve the 2,500-acre
estate. He and his staff plant trees by the hundreds, replace the
leaky lead roofs, even buy antiques at auction, when possible, in
an effort to restore the house to its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think of it as yours in order to take the detailed
care of it that it requires,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Damant said she was responsible for the contents of the
house. That includes the sections of the manor that are Baroque,
Neo-Classical and Victorian; paintings by Gainsborough, Tissot, Sir
Joshua Reynolds, Angelica Kauffmann and John Wootton, and hundreds
of 18th- and 19th-century antiques, including a circa 1774 rosewood
writing table with a trompe l'oeil painting of cards, coins and
documents that is signed by L. Boilly, and furnishings supplied by
Thomas Chippendale.
</P>
<P>
   She even makes the flower arrangements, including those for the
church on the grounds, which is owned by the local village.
</P>
<P>
   She is also in charge of upkeep. Wimpole is 50 miles north of
London and receives 150,000 visitors a year; it suffers a lot of
wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   How did Damant prepare for this post? He didn't. ``The only way
to do it is to grab hold of the job and get on with it,'' he said.
``It's all on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not hurt, of course, that he had been an officer in the
army for 18 years. It is the best training for a job like this
because you have to be able to turn your hand to anything.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago, a fuel tank on the property began leaking
oil into the River Rhee, a river on the estate that runs into the
River Cam, the famous punting river of Cambridge University. It was
a fairly major oil spill, Damant recalled. ``First, I called an oil
pollution clean-up company and the town warden. Then I decided we
better get on with it at top speed. We rushed out to dam the
ditches. We put down straw bales and broke them apart. Luckily,
they soaked up the oil and we managed to contain the spill on
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any landowner, he must deal with fire and theft. Though the
house is fully wired with alarms, burglars keep trying to get in,
waking up the Damants in the middle of the night. ``We're on
24-hour duty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far he has been able to scare the burglars away, even when
they have been armed. He has been less successful in keeping out
the bats.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is a much scarier proposition. There was a fire in one of
the chimneys six months after he installed an alarm system, so it
was caught nearly immediately. Damant considered that almost too
close a call.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the natural disasters. In the 1970s, before
the Damants took up residence, Dutch Elm disease decimated
Wimpole's two-mile-long allee of elms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still planting trees like maniacs to get it back to
what it was before,'' he said. To reinstate the woodland, the
Damants have organized a way for people to donate trees. They have
sold 886 lime, oak and ash trees, so far. For 100 pounds (about
$163), a person can buy a tree and it will be named after him.
</P>
<P>
   (Damant pointed out that Americans help by becoming members of
the Royal Oak Foundation, the United States membership affiliate of
the National Trust. There are currently more than 40,000 members in
America, according to John Young, president of Royal Oak.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Damant, who as assistant custodian of the house actually
works for her husband, said that Wimpole came to the trust in 1976,
when it was bequeathed by Elsie Bambridge, the only surviving child
of Rudyard Kipling.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the last houses accepted into the trust.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the 2,000-odd properties that belong to the
trust, Wimpole does not get money from it, only advice and
professional expertise when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Kipling's royalties, Mrs. Bambridge left a substantial
endowment for the estate, which is not shared with other trust
properties, and Wimpole is allowed to raise money for its own
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Damants have taken up the challenge to raise private money
with enthusiasm and imagination. Mrs. Damant started a second-hand
bookstore on the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began by emptying out our own bookcases,'' she said. ``Then
others began bringing in books and now it's a real business.''
</P>
<P>
   Damant said the trust hired a consultant to get royalties from
Disney for ``The Jungle Book,'' the animated film based on
Kipling's stories. They settled on 150,000 pounds (about $244,905),
which will be used to rebuild the greenhouses designed for the
estate by Sir John Soane in the 1790s.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Damant's next project is the formal dining room. Having
raised private monies at Wimpole to buy back an elaborate original
antique sideboard at auction, she is now working with trust
advisers on creating proper draperies for the room, even though she
is still missing half the furniture required.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell raffle tickets,'' she said. ``We give private tours of
the house, we welcome children's groups, we allow businessmen to
have their meetings here. We'll get the funds eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a bit like a proud homeowner, no?

`THE GREAT SHAME': IRISH REBELS WHO FOUND GLORY IN EXILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing leads unexpectedly to another. Some years ago, for
example, a serendipitous stop at a Beverly Hills luggage store led
the Australian novelist Thomas Keneally to discover the story that
became his novel ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, having told, through the life of Oskar Schindler, the
story of the Jewish tragedy, Keneally began to wonder: ``What of my
own past?''
</P>
<P>
   The result of that wondering, and of a prodigious piece of
research, is ``The Great Shame,'' Keneally's account of some 80
years of both sweeping and highly individuated Irish history,
especially the history of the Irish diaspora in the
English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Keneally's early chapters tell the complicated and piquant tale
of his wife's ancestors, one of whom, a certain Hugh Larkin of East
Galway, parish of Clontuskert, participated in a threatening
protest against his landlord in 1832 and was sentenced to life
exile in Australia as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 400 pages later, we first read of John Keneally, one of
Keneally's forebears who was a Fenian, a member of the brotherhood
of Irish nationalists, and spent time as a political prisoner in
Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But if a yearning to restore his own ancestors to full memory
prompted Keneally to embark on this new book, he rapidly expanded
it to include the interlaced stories of half a dozen major actors
in the rich Irish passion and a larger number of minor ones.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the stories of ``The Great Shame'' make up a
sturdy panorama of the Irish 19th century. It is a group portrait
of the political agitators, poets, journalists, revolutionaries and
left-behind wives who struggled with poverty, with the devastating
potato blight of mid-century and with forced exile to forge an
Irish consciousness through the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Keneally has in this sense made a magnificent effort at
transgenerational history, his own ancestors serving as
illustrations of the larger encompassing picture of Irish politics.
</P>
<P>
   There are times in this when Keneally's very ambition, the sheer
number of the stories he closely follows, slows down the narrative
pace. And yet, despite that, ``The Great Shame'' is an event, a
broad-shouldered integration of personal and national history.
</P>
<P>
   As one would expect from this author, the writing is both
flavorful and straightforward. Keneally never brandishes his
accounts for their dramatic or cinematic effect. In the style of
the best historians, he allows the intrinsic power of the tales he
tells and the people who populate his pages to draw the reader into
a fully elaborated universe.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Hugh Larkin and John Keneally and those they married,
procreated and were forced to leave behind, most of Keneally's
other main characters were members of ``the loose alliance of
writers, orators and activists'' who came to be known as Young
Ireland _ to distinguish them from the older, more cautious
politicians who militated for repeal of the 1800 Act of Union
between Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The more radical and impetuous Young Ireland movement was
represented by lawyer-journalists, both Roman Catholic and
Protestant, like John Mitchel, Thomas Francis Meagher and William
Smith O'Brien. Keneally follows the political acts, the factional
quarrels, the writings and the amours of these and other figures of
the failed Irish independence movement, catching each of them in a
novelist's vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitchel possessed blazing eyes, had great charm and was
intense in a more absolute way than the playful Meagher ... He was
an asthmatic, and had the toughness and fixity of purpose that
often characterizes those who habitually struggle for breath.''
</P>
<P>
   This whole cast of characters, including John Martin, Kevin Izod
``Saint Kevin'' O'Doherty and, a generation later, the writer John
Boyle O'Reilly, were eventually arrested for their writings or
activities in Ireland, tried and convicted and transported to
Australia. Many of them also made later, often remarkable careers,
mostly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It is in that sense that they represent both the ``shame'' of
Keneally's title _ the shame of poverty, of foreign domination and
of failing to achieve the goals of Irish nationalism _ and the
``triumph'' that took place elsewhere in the English-speaking
world.
</P>
<P>
   Keneally, for example, recounts the contrasting American careers
of Mitchel and Meagher, one becoming a Confederate newspaper
reporter and Meagher a general on the Union side during the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   What is essential in Keneally's accounts of these lives, aside
from their overall trajectory, is their depth and articulation.
Keneally evokes in rich detail the early lives and conditions of
his several main characters.
</P>
<P>
   He follows their political engagements in Ireland (most
important, perhaps, the failed armed uprising in Ballingarry, in
July 1848), their trials, their exile in Australia, their escapes
or pardons, their travels to America and their relations with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Informing these portraits is a personal moral struggle waged
inside the soul of each person. Unlike many of their 20th-century
counterparts in nationalist or revolutionary politics, whether in
Ireland or elsewhere, these were figures who, whatever their
passions, respected limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If O'Brien had authorized a famished and deprived people to
attack the property of landlords and to commandeer resources, would
clerical appeals to conscience and virtue have still worked to
temper events?,'' Keneally asks in a pithy evaluation of the events
at Ballingarry, which was the closest Young Ireland came to armed
uprising. The ``abiding symbol'' of that episode was the effort of
its leader, O'Brien, to shake the hands of the policemen who were
barricaded inside a besieged house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could never quite forget, as Mirabeau and Lafayette
forgot,'' wrote Charles Gavin Duffy, another Young Irelander,
``that he belonged to the caste of gentlemen.'' If he had been ``a
vicious man,'' Patrick O'Donohoe declared in prison years later, he
``would have overthrown English dominion in Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with these figures of historical import, the stories of
Keneally's ancestors have a complementary flavor of common events,
but they are common events with a rich and pungent quality to them
_ like Irish history itself.
</P>
<P>
   People like Hugh Larkin and John Keneally had, like Mitchel,
Meagher, O'Reilly and the others of Young Ireland, nationalist
sympathies, but mainly they struggled to survive and prosper in the
displaced conditions of their exile.
</P>
<P>
   Keneally's elaborate reconstruction of their private lives in
all their glory and humility puts a fully composed human face on
political events and in doing so rises to a high level of
humanistic achievement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Finley and Thora Burch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Though the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOWFINGER,' starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Heather
Graham. Written by Martin. Directed by Frank Oz (PG-13, 97
minutes). This hilarious, good-hearted spiritual descendant of
``The Producers'' is a comic coup for Martin. And it's directed by
Oz every bit as winningly as his ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' and
``In and Out.'' Murphy is razor sharp in a dual role as both a
grinning fall guy and the kind of hotshot action star whose very
presence is enough to get a movie made. Martin, sublimely funny,
runs circles around him as an unscrupulous filmmaker trying to
trick the star into appearing in his movie. ``Did you know that Tom
Cruise had no idea he was in that vampire movie until two years
later?'' this filmmaker inquires. Made fondly and knowingly, with
nonstop good humor (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS,' starring Bruce Willis and Nick Nolte.
Directed by Alan Rudolph (R, 110 minutes). Stuffed with visual gags
and acted with the cartoonish exaggeration of a John Waters film
divested of camp, Rudolph's screen adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut
Jr.'s 1973 novel is a psychedelic fun house of a movie. The movie's
style is so hyperventilated that it is exhausting to watch. And if
the satire on such easy targets as middle-class conformity,
American kitsch culture and Puritanism 1950s-style is relentless,
it also seems old hat. Still, you've got to admire the director's
courage in making a movie this uncompromisingly weird and
noncommercial (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (Not rated, 99 minutes). It is
1947, and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FOR LOVE OF THE GAME,' starring Kevin Costner and Kelly
Preston. Directed by Sam Raimi (PG-13, 140 minutes). This film,
starring Costner as an aging Detroit Tigers pitcher, is a baseball
movie the way ``You've Got Mail'' was a movie about the retail book
business. Deep down, the film is really about the love of a
difficult man for a good woman, played by Ms. Preston. The baseball
story, thanks to Costner's athletic credibility (see ``Bull
Durham'' and ``Field of Dreams'') and a complement of real
ballplayers, works better than the romance. Taken together, they
add up to routine entertainment, because the overloaded love story
doesn't really tug the heartstrings. Underlying the story of Billy
Chapel's crucial game is the story of his five-year romance with
Jane (Ms. Preston), seen in flashbacks, as the star pitcher tries
to coax one more win out of a worn-out arm. Is it time for Chapel
to quit? Filmmaking, like baseball, is a team game, and sometimes
even a talented lineup produces unexceptional results (Lawrence Van
Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `LUCIE AUBRAC,' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel Auteuil.
Produced, written and directed by Claude Berri (R, 116 minutes).
What lifts this taut World War II thriller based on a true story
above the ordinary are the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet
and Auteuil as Lucie and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters
in the French Resistance. When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and
convicted of war crimes, Lucie conceives an outrageously audacious
plan for his escape. Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically
intense as Bogey and Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' but here the woman
is the one who ends up doing the thinking for both of them
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MUSE,' starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie
MacDowell and Jeff Bridges. Directed by Brooks (PG-13, 97 minutes).
In his latest mordantly hilarious cri de coeur about contemporary
life, the ever grousing Brooks takes on the capriciousness of
success in a world of show-business ethics. And in coming up with
the title character, played by Ms. Stone in a delectable comic
performance, he gives that world exactly the kind of divinity it
deserves. This muse is quite a piece of work, but she seems to get
results, on the evidence of a couple of inspired cameos here. The
joke of a premise winds down before it reaches a punch line. But
Brooks again manages to be funny and bleak with equal ease
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE,' starring Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin, Amy
Smart and George Wendt. Written by Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly
and Michael Corrente. Directed by Corrente (R, 95 minutes). Three
of Rhode Island's finest, the director of ``Federal Hill'' and the
brothers behind ``There's Something About Mary,'' collaborate on a
rowdily funny yet also unexpectedly tender coming-of-age tale. This
rueful and very likable comedy tells of a Pawtucket teen-ager who
is abruptly separated from his druggy old cronies and packed off to
a Connecticut prep school, where he is a sharp-eyed observer of the
characters around him. Loosely knit, sometimes uproarious, the film
benefits enormously from Baldwin's deft performance as the boy's
small-minded, memorably impossible father (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ROMANCE,' starring Caroline Ducey, Sagamore Stevenin, Francois
Berleand and Rocco Siffredi. Written and directed by Catherine
Breillat (not rated, 93 minutes). A solemn, sexually graphic
exploration of the nature of a woman's need for male attention and
erotic love, even if its insights are already familiar to readers
of Cosmopolitan and the Marquis de Sade. And it's doubtful that the
film's intellectual aspects would command the same attention if its
camera did not make the actors' genitals as familiar as their
faces. The carnal and cerebral erotica here have already achieved
the considerable feat of shocking France, but the film is often
stilted and methodical to the point of tediousness. It hovers
between passion and philosophical argument without often achieving
Ms. Breillat's ambition to fuse the two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
( Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age
mush (think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIGMATA,' starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne and
Jonathan Pryce. Directed by Rupert Wainwright (R, 102 minutes).
When Frankie Paige (Ms. Arquette), a vapid Pittsburgh hairdresser,
receives the present of a rosary lifted from the dead body of a
Brazilian priest, her life becomes a supernatural horror show.
Byrne is the Vatican cleric who investigates the case and Pryce the
evil cardinal who wants to cover up evidence that could damage the
church. The seizures in this poorly acted melange of shock effects
and religious imagery are bargain-basement ``Exorcist.'' Instead of
pea soup and spinning heads, we get breaking glass, dripping blood
and flurries of feathers from agitated doves (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIR OF ECHOES,' starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
Directed by David Koepp (R, 99 minutes). Another little boy talks
to a ghost at the start of this thriller, but it isn't an instant
``Sixth Sense'' sequel. Instead it shows what happens when the
boy's closed-minded father lets himself be hypnotized and awakens
to find himself receiving otherworldly stimuli. Bacon gives a
grippingly intense performance as a man terrified by his new
extrasensory powers. And Koepp conveys a potent sense of what it
means to unravel. Despite its strong, spooky start and early
momentum, the film winds up with too earthbound an explanation for
the havoc it unleashes (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SUGAR TOWN,' starring Rosanna Arquette, Ally Sheedy, Beverly
D'Angelo, Jade Gordon, John Taylor and John Doe. Directed by
Allison Anders and Kurt Voss (R, 92 minutes). An Altmanesque
cross-section of California show-biz strivers, and a film with an
inordinate supply of strong, funny female characters. Made so
quickly that its actors' obvious enthusiasm never has a chance to
flag, it illuminates such subjects as power dating and the travails
of a has-been rock band. Ms. Sheedy is especially memorable as the
walking embodiment of every self-help fad and Type A trait. But
it's not easy to pick a favorite character in this warm, knowing
ensemble comedy (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE 13TH WARRIOR,' starring Antonio Banderas and Omar Sharif.
Directed by John McTiernan (R, 103 minutes). Set in the 10th
century and adapted from a novel by Michael Crichton, this
grunting, sweating, blood-gushing medieval answer to professional
wrestling is inspired by Ahmed Ibn Fadhlan's historical account of
his adventures in Central Asia. Banderas plays an exiled Persian
poet who hooks up with a group of Norse warriors to do battle with
an evil tribe of flesh eaters. The screenplay is monosyllabic, but
the action scenes, which take you into the thick of battle, are
excitingly photographed. A charging score by Jerry Goldsmith helps
ennoble the grisly derring-do (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CHAOS AND COMEDY: THE FILMS OF BLAKE EDWARDS.' A 12-film
retrospective devoted to Blake Edwards winds up this weekend at the
American Museum of the Moving Image with a four-film outburst of
comedy, romance, satire and farce highlighted by a dialogue with
the filmmaker himself at 2 p.m. Saturday. The appearance by
Edwards, the director of more than 50 films and the creator of the
Pink Panther series, follows a 2 p.m. screening of his 1979 hit,
``10,'' which starred Dudley Moore and Bo Derek as the object of
his midlife desires. At 5:30 p.m., the attraction is ``S.O.B.,''
the 1981 satire in which Edwards vented his spleen on Hollywood.
Sunday's attractions include a 2 p.m. screening of ``Darling Lili''
(1970), with Julie Andrews (Mrs. Edwards) as a World War I German
spy, and a 5 p.m. screening of ``Victor/Victoria'' (1982), the
musical farce starring Ms. Andrews that later became a Broadway
musical (Van Gelder).

   Revisiting Monty Python
</P>
<P>
   As he did regularly on the BBC and later on PBS, the wild-eyed
old fellow with the scraggly beard staggers up to the camera
seemingly ready to expire. ``It's,'' he gasps. ``It's ... It's ...'
Actually it's ``Monty Python's Flying Circus,'' available from A&AMP;E
on Tuesday in an extensive recycling of material from a show that,
along with ``Saturday Night Live,'' took over television comedy for
a time in the '70s and still lingers in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1969, the show seems to pop up for a good remarketing
at every 10th anniversary or other significant occasion. To pave
the way for home video, A&AMP;E began its 30th-birthday revival on
television in July. Now 13 episodes are on two sets of six
videocassettes each and two sets of DVD's with two disks each.
</P>
<P>
   For the Python crew _ Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle,
Terry Gilliam (the one American), Terry Jones and Michael Palin _
tape is fine, but for their style of humor and delivery disk is
better because one can skip about at random in a sea of comedy that
caroms here and there totally at whim.
</P>
<P>
   The Pythons could be with a maniac from Guatemala one second and
a man who puts bricks to sleep the next. Today as then, the humor
ranges from sharp to the excruciatingly humdrum, but the
helter-skelter style is always a treat, as are the personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese is a marvel in drag or at delivering verbal convolutions.
``Introduce me to allow myself,'' he announces in the role of
Inspector Tiger, who has just arrived on a murder scene. ``I must
not ask anyone to leave the room.'' Jones makes a superb stripper
as a man who keeps trying to change into his bathing suit at the
beach and finally ends up onstage at a vaudeville house.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of half the world, Queen Victoria hikes her skirts and
races around the lawn in pursuit of William Gladstone. Python humor
always had an academic tinge, especially when it came to historical
matters. Was Trafalgar fought at sea or was it really on land?
Cardinal Richelieu could appear at any second on British soil (``I
love your country,'' he says).
</P>
<P>
   The dead could play a hand. During a trial, testimony is taken
from a body in a coffin. One knock means yes, two mean no.
Restaurants were scenes of little dramas that could rise to
operatic heights, with aggrieved diners and hysterical waiters
getting increasingly out of hand. At one point a maitre d' commits
suicide by falling on a fork.
</P>
<P>

   In pursuit of the golden trove of Hamunaptra, a legendary
Egyptian crypt under Saharan sands, some pushy young scholars and
grave robbers get themselves into serious difficulties with the
army of zombies who guard the place. Blame Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo,
above), an ancient priest who, having misbehaved with the Pharaoh's
mistress, was put to a horrible death. Now his vengeful spirit is
unwisely loosed by the modern-day (1923) interlopers, who are
defended by a Harrison Ford knockoff named Rick (Brendan Fraser).
Stephen Sommers' film may bill itself as a ``reimagining'' of the
1932 horror classic, but, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times, it really ``has no pretenses to be anything other than a
gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen.''

   Tony Bui, a 26-year-old director who escaped Vietnam as a child,
creates a rain-soaked elegy for a culture that is being swept away
by hard-edged modernism. As if in a dream, washed in warm rains,
four innocent victims _ a peddler of lotus blossoms, an embittered
poet dying of leprosy, a cyclo driver infatuated with a scornful
prostitute, and a street boy who sells trinkets before losing his
sample case _ float in a cinematic poem ``so languidly paced that
it occasionally turns vague and meandering'' (Holden).

   None of the appeal and energy of Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn

comedy. With their children grown and gone from their Ohio nest,
Nancy Clark (Ms. Hawn) and her husband, Henry ( Martin), come to
New York, where he is to have a job inerview. Of course, the Big
Apple bites back in a story that can't decide whether it's more
about it or them. ``Accordingly, they are sometimes characters,
sometimes cartoons and never credible comic creations'' (Lawrence
Van Gelder).

   A cyberthriller sets up parallel worlds in 1937 and 1990's Los
Angeles. Characters lead different lives, starting with the
visionary contemporary magnate (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who has
fashioned a chip that recreates the '30s. Returning to that scene,
he is murdered. Back in the present, his heir apparent (Craig
Bierko) wakes up to find the boss' blood-soaked shirt and himself
the prime suspect. Strong performances help a film that begins
promisingly, but then unravels in an ``overplotted and ultimately
illogical combination of science fiction, mystery and romance''
(Van Gelder).

`WANNABE: LIFE AND DEATH IN A SMALL-TOWN GANG': ADMIRING THE YOUNG
KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   An investigation of killings that shocked Appleton, Wis., in
1995 opens a new season of PBS documentaries, ``Independent Lens.''
John Whitehead, the producer of ``Wannabe: Life and Death in a
Small-Town Gang,'' returns to his hometown in search of what led to
a murder of a teen-ager and the deaths of his three killers in a
murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He produces no revelations but confirms that middle America is
not immune to the violence usually associated with big cities.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble seems to have started with the arrival in Appleton
of a 17-year-old black youth from the slums of Milwaukee. He took
to hanging around with the mostly white D-Mac Crew, a few
teen-agers given to pot and rap and dreams of the gang life.
</P>
<P>
   Whether because of the newcomer's put-downs of his new friends
or a disagreement over drugs or sexual competition, the D-Mac Crew
took revenge. He was lured to a remote cabin where he was beaten,
strangled and stabbed. It does not seem to have been a race crime,
investigators say. With arrest threatening, one of the murderers
killed the other two and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with parents, teachers and friends, Whitehead
finds some familiar symptoms of troubled youth: broken homes,
parents incapable of coping, school difficulties, petty crimes,
emotional confusions, loneliness, a need to be accepted somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The gang appears to have served as a surrogate family. Surviving
hangers-on speak admiringly to the camera of the solidarity of the
departed.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead suggests that the main change in Appleton since his
own teen-age years is the absence of mothers who kept families
intact even while fathers went wandering. But as his own program
points out, Appleton has been growing and changing in many ways,
and there are as many explanations for the D-Mac phenomenon as
there are people doing the explaining.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GONZALO RUBALCABA: ``Inner Voyage'' (Blue Note/Capitol). The
pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba has worked in several different idioms
over the last decade, including straight-ahead jazz, Latin jazz and
fusion, but the one quality most associated with him is muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of other trained Cuban musicians, he puts a premium
on technique, and his ability to improvise on harmony with clear
articulation at high speed and with dramatic flourishes is both his
strength and his downfall; there's often something interior missing
amid the formidable skill.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the challenge for him, then, to make a slow album.
Not just a ballad album; he's done his share of playing ballads and
displaying superheroic sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   But a slow album, slow as in molasses, slow as in slow-motion.
Playing effectively this way can be just as technically impressive;
the expanse of time in which to place just one note becomes
enormous, and pulling a feeling of tension across all that space
separates the glib from the gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inner Voyage'' ends up being perverse at times, almost as if
Rubalcaba were turning his back to the audience or looking for a
way to disappear. But perversity is exactly what one desires from
him, and in any case it's a particularly beautiful form of
perversity.
</P>
<P>
   With the bassist Jeff Chambers and drummer Ignacio Berroa,
Rubalcaba seldom rises louder than the sound of a drum stick
clicking a rim; he melts into his rhythm section in tracks like
``Joan'' and ``Promenade,'' and the tunes float as if they were not
actually moving.
</P>
<P>
   Only two tracks raise the tempo and break the spell: a version
of Juan Tizol and Duke Ellington's ``Caravan,'' which sticks too
close to the standard's frame, and an original called ``Blues
Lundvall,'' which contains some of the most death-defying piano
playing since Art Tatum.

`ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER': BUOYED BY THE STRANGENESS OF KINSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Pedro Almodovar gleefully established himself as ``Spain's
most reputable disreputable young filmmaker'' (in Vincent Canby's
words), it was the dizzy hilarity of ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown'' that marked him as an avatar of outrageous,
sexy humor. Eleven years later he is back at the New York Film
Festival in a ravishingly different mode. The antic fizz and bold,
theatrical exaggeration of his earlier work have blossomed (as was
clear in the haunting 1997 ``Live Flesh'') into a newly
sophisticated style that is far more passionate, wise and deeply
felt.
</P>
<P>
   This year's New York Film Festival opens Friday night with the
marvelous ``All About My Mother,'' a whole new order of Almodovar
extravaganza. It depends, as so many things do, upon the kindness
of strangers. Starting at that place in Almodovar's great big heart
where womanhood, artifice, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote and
``All About Eve'' collide, it weaves life and art into a rich
tapestry of love, loss and compassion. This film's assorted females
_ real, theatrical or would-be _ move past the nervous breakdown
stage and on to something much more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' plays a crucial role in the life of
the film's heroine, a nurse named Manuela (Cecilia Roth). It is
central to the film, too. Stellas and Stanleys abound throughout
the story, beginning on the evening when Manuela celebrates the
17th birthday of her son, Esteban (Eloy Azarin), by accompanying
him to a performance of the play in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban is so captivated by the evening's Blanche Dubois, the
diva Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes), that he waits for her in the
street in hopes of an autograph. In a devastating sequence, filmed
by Almodovar with the sweeping visual assurance that binds this
film together so firmly, Manuela's beloved son is mowed down in the
street. The camera stays wrenchingly with an Esteban's-eye view of
the scene until Esteban is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``All About My Mother'' is about splendidly resilient
women rather than wounded ones, it has already begun to entwine
Manuela's shocking experience with a sense of drama. Manuela
oversees donor organ transplants, and before the accident she has
played the role of a widow in a hospital simulation. Now the moment
is real, and the same two doctors who staged it with Manuela are
really helping her to decide the fate of her son's heart. On the
stage Blanche Dubois searches pitifully for her red heart-shaped
jewelry box; in life Manuela leaves Esteban's heart beating in
another man's body and goes on to fulfill her son's last wishes.
And Almodovar, being to the weepie born, presents this womanly
melodrama with an empathy to recall George Cukor's and an
eye-dampening intensity to out-Sirk Douglas Sirk.
</P>
<P>
   But when Manuela travels to Barcelona for her son's sake, the
film enters a buoyant and generous new world. It was here, 20 years
ago, that she and a senior Esteban first met, when they starred in
``Streetcar.'' And even though her husband has since become a
larcenous femme fatale named Lola, Manuela wants to find him and
tell him of her son's life and death.
</P>
<P>
   She goes looking in a nefarious outdoor hangout called the
Field, where prostitutes and their clients move in circles as if
this were a merry-go-round, or a Fellini vision. What passes for
vice in other contexts remains a source of wit and sweetness in
Almodovar's work.
</P>
<P>
   Charging into the story at this point, and bursting into the
film like a drag supernova, is the irrepressible Agrado, played by
a Spanish nightclub performer named Antonia San Juan. Algrado and
Manuela turn out to be old friends from the days before Algrado had
breasts, and soon she has taken Manuela under her wing. One by one,
the women adrift through this story begin to help and restore one
another, as when Agrado (in a pink Chanel suit) brings Manuela to
the prostitutes' shelter where beautiful Sister Rosa (Penelope
Cruz) ministers to the needy. The nun looks meek and devout, but it
turns out that she knows Lola, too.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Working in a style he has called ``screwball drama,'' Almodovar
also brings in the two ``Streetcar'' actresses (who are stormy
lovers) and lets the group of women gain sustenance as it grows.
This film is lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played
actresses (Gena Rowlands, Bette Davis, Romy Schneider), and it
celebrates the self-preservative instincts that can make an actress
of anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Huma and Nina (Candela Pena) have such a Kowalski-like battling
relationship that Manuela is even called upon to play Stella
onstage one night, which is something she can do by heart. There's
a stroke of ``All About Eve'' here, but it comes without malice.
Almodovar would rather show the power of artifice and impersonation
to transcend ordinary truth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. San Juan's Agrado supplies a large share of comic
relief, her most important moment in the film comes after a
``Streetcar'' performance is abruptly canceled. Agrado takes the
stage and offers to tell the story of her life, which nearly clears
the room. Then, in a funny yet prideful monologue, she recites
chapter and verse on all the costly surgery and silicone that made
her what she now appears to be. ``It cost me a lot to be
authentic,'' she says. And: ``A woman is more authentic the more
she looks like what she has dreamed for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In ``All About My Mother'' the world of acting becomes a source
of inspiration to women as they improvise their way through their
own lives, with the kind of strength, passion and humor this
filmmaker has always celebrated. Almodovar has expressed the idea
of life as a divine form of acting before, but never with the kind
of clarity and beauty that glitter here.
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother,'' his best film by far, is all about how
tragedies of the flesh can yield renewal and hope despite the pain
they leave behind, which is as clear an understanding of what makes
movies tick as Almodovar will ever need. It's the crossover moment
in the career of a born four-hankie storyteller of ever increasing
stature. Look out, Hollywood, here he comes.

 &HT;    DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, MEETING IN WASHINGTON, ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT
GORE CANDIDACY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The aura of invincibility with which Vice President
Al Gore began his campaign for the presidency is gone, and the
Democratic Party establishment that has lined up behind him is
anxious to figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of theories afloat in Democratic circles to
explain why Gore finds himself waging a two-front campaign: one
against the GOP favorite, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the
other against his only rival for the Democratic nomination, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But all the explanations are rooted in two very basic notions _
that Americans are simply tired of President Clinton and anyone
associated with him, and that Gore's public image of stiff
formality makes him incapable of mass-marketing the human touch, a
prerequisite of post-Clinton presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, as members of the Democratic National Committee
convened here Thursday for their three-day fall meeting, the
question on nearly everyone's mind was: Is Al Gore electable?
</P>
<P>
   Polling data from a variety of sources suggest that Gore faces a
major challenge, not only to succeed Clinton in the White House but
simply to win his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls have an influence on elections, and they become a
self-fulfilling prophecy to an extent,'' said House Democratic
leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who endorsed Gore months ago
after forgoing a presidential campaign of his own. ``But I think
the polls are in a way not very reflective of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   What is going on?
</P>
<P>
   Gore has enlisted much of the party establishment in the early
primary states and California, the jewel in the 12-state ``Super
Tuesday'' primary in early March. He has raised more money than any
Democratic presidential primary candidate in history. And, unlike
any modern vice president, he has the strong backing of his
president in the primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   But he has consistently trailed Bush by wide margins in
hypothetical head-to-head match-ups in public opinion polls, adding
to the anxiety of a party that has lost its majority control in
Congress during the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   And more ominously, at least to the Democrats backing Gore, the
16-point lead the vice president had over Bradley in the
first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, recent polls indicate Gore and Bradley are tied in
New York, another of the 12 ``Super Tuesday'' primaries. Last
spring, Gore led by 17 points in the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised that it's close because it's only a
two-person race,'' said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman
Kathy Sullivan, who is prohibited by party rules from supporting
any candidate in the primary. ``What is surprising is that it is so
close this early.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any silver lining in this cloud for Gore, she added,
it is that the vice president no longer has to play the game of
expectations and defeat Bradley by a wide margin in the New
Hampshire primary. ``Now, with the two candidates running even, a
win is a win,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Appel, who heads the party in New Hampshire's Strafford
County, said Bradley's rise in the polls is also due to favorable
news coverage of his visits to the Granite State, in contrast to
consistently critical reports on Gore. ``What I read in the
newspapers and see on TV about Gore is disjointed from my
reality,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of
Virginia who is an expert on the influence of media on politics,
echoed Appel's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could write a memo to Gore, it would begin, 'Mr. Vice
President, the bad news is that the news media have chosen your
opponent, Bill Bradley, to be the Democratic nominee for president.
The good news is that the media nominees usually lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters argue that the former senator would be
``more electable'' than Gore in a general election contest against
Bush, the presumed GOP nominee. They base their argument on the
former senator's current popularity with independent voters and
Republicans as well as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an Internet-based poll of 16,837 respondents in late
August by the Harris Poll found that Gore is the ``most disliked''
major candidate for president. Sixty-six percent of Republicans and
40 percent of independents said they disliked the vice president,
while only 16 percent of Republicans and 8 percent of independents
disliked Bradley. (Bush was disliked by 33 percent of Democrats and
16 percent of independents.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is surrounded by a partisan screen that he is going to
have trouble breaking through to reach voters outside the
Democratic Party,'' said Jonathan Siegel, who directed the Harris
poll. ``You have Clinton fatigue as a drag on Gore, but you also
have the people who hate Clinton also hating Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Republicans worry that Bradley's cross-party appeal
could hurt the GOP next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bradley gets the Democratic nomination, God help us as
Republicans,'' said Frank Luntz, the GOP pollster who shaped the
``Contract With America'' that propelled Republicans to a majority
in Congress in 1994. ``No other candidate has that kind of reach
across the political spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz acknowledged, however, that at this stage, presidential
primaries are ``more a matter of style than issues'' and that
voters who like Bradley are ``seeing what they want to see and
hearing what they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, after a Hall of Fame career in the National Basketball
Association, served 18 years in the Senate, producing a record that
the Gore campaign is now mining for political ammunition. Already,
Gore surrogates have caused Bradley to backtrack a bit from one of
his Senate votes supporting school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, running to the left of Gore, a ``New Democrat''
pioneer, has also taken positions that are not likely to appeal to
the moderate and conservative Democratic voters in the Southern
states, most notably Georgia, the only part of the old Confederacy
voting on ``Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed extending civil rights protections to
homosexuals and allowing gays to serve in the military. He also has
advocated registration of handguns. And next week, he is expected
to outline a health care policy that would expand the role of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should Bradley win the nomination, his leftish (CQ) positions
will present far more problems for Democrats than many think
today,'' said Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``if Bradley is a serious alternative to Gore, you have
to ask then, what is your Southern strategy?'' said David Bositis,
a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, a Washington research group that specializes in
civil rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's poll numbers are dampening the enthusiasm of
Democrats who might otherwise be ready to jump on his bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   And any early primary victories by Bradley strengthen the
argument that he is an electable alternative to Gore, one who does
not have to carry the ethical baggage of the Clinton administration
into a general election contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of an oxymoron to be talking about a tight spot in
1999 for a 2000 election,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
at a breakfast with reporters Thursday. ``If you look at a campaign
as a life span we're in the adolescent phase now, and you guys fall
in and out of love with candidates very, very quickly. ... So do
party activists, so do commentators.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has run for president once before, in 1988. And he has
been preparing for this run at least since the Clinton reelection
in 1996. And yet, he continues to perform below expectations. And
as a result, some Democrats ``are having a hard time making up
their mind,'' said New York-based political consultant Peter Dynum.

   NEW YORK _ As the years go by you fall into the habit of
believing that apples do not taste as sharp as they used to and
that candy bars are not as big. They do not, in fact, and they are
not; thanks respectively to fruit genetics and marketing margins.
</P>
<P>
   But why have my books lost their smell? The smell, when I was 5,
of a nubby ``Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens'' in the solid and
likewise whiffy oak shelves of the Little Neck branch of the public
library, circa 1937. The smell of the cracking new textbooks, cool
to the touch, at the start of each school year; and of gray, green,
red or blue Modern Library volumes at $1.25 apiece: a weekly ticket
(what my allowance allowed) to a wind-in-the-face journey more
displacing than any roller coaster; one that linked the great
world, past and present, to one 15-year-old's future.
</P>
<P>
   Offset print instead of hot type? Different glues and binding?
Less redolent paper formulas? Or simply, after many years and
thousands of journeys with thousands of books, a dimness of the
senses, not the mind; a dulling of the uncontainable excitement at
embarkation even if the journey once begun begins to recover it.
The idea gradually takes hold that it will be round trip and no
longer one way; that no longer will life change utterly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what does a computer smell of even when you are young?
Perhaps _ that perpetual snuffling hum _ it is smelling you. What
does a printout smell of, other than chemical air?
</P>
<P>
   ``New York Is Book Country'' makes its annual festive return
this weekend. The slogan may annoy a resident of Somewhere Else:
once again the city is proclaiming itself a metonym for the
universal. To be a great city, of course, it is necessary in some
respect to be greatly provincial. Look at London until it lost its
nerve and Paris anytime. In any case, ``Book Country'' is
wonderful. This is what books are: a country, and in a way the
computer screen and the misnamed electronic book never can be.
</P>
<P>
   A book is a made thing, first of all. (``Of the making of many
books there is no end,'' one UPS man scripturally intoned as he
carried in a load.) It displaces space instead of haunting it like
the text on a screen. As a book reviewer in a cubbyhole I know a
lot about such displacement, occasionally falling over a stack and
once, like the pedant in Anatole France's ``Penguin Island,''
up-ended when a whole bookcase-full rained down on me.
</P>
<P>
   Books begin as concrete tribal magic: objects held by the parent
to provide a small bedtime wall and draw out of it the spell of a
story. They are not static objects; they reassert themselves as
spell-givers with each pause to turn a page. Hard to imagine a
bedtime computer; still less one capable of that repeated
incantatory page turning. For the child, books are concrete before
they are abstract: sensuality before sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Just about the first material encounter with a book I can recall
took place very early one Sunday morning when I was 5 and tiptoed
``The Little Engine That Could'' into the bathroom to see if I
could work my mother's magic with it. A dark blue razor blade lay
on the basin and suggested a darker magic. What great villainous
fun to try slashing the pages. Fun it was _ the pages were stiff
and shiny and the blade ribboned creamily through them _ until
something slipped and an impressive quantity of blood spurted out,
followed by dawn rescue and rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   Book as magic spell, book as magic object, book as danger and
transgression: an iMac could hardly ignite the same mind-body
extravaganza or forge the same mind-body links. That the links are
essential seems unquestionable.

 &HT;    DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, MEETING IN WASHINGTON, ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT
GORE CANDIDACY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The aura of invincibility with which Vice President
Al Gore began his campaign for the presidency is gone, and the
Democratic Party establishment that has lined up behind him is
anxious to figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of theories afloat in Democratic circles to
explain why Gore finds himself waging a two-front campaign: one
against the GOP favorite, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the
other against his only rival for the Democratic nomination, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But all the explanations are rooted in two very basic notions _
that Americans are simply tired of President Clinton and anyone
associated with him, and that Gore's public image of stiff
formality makes him incapable of mass-marketing the human touch, a
prerequisite of post-Clinton presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, as members of the Democratic National Committee
convened here Thursday for their three-day fall meeting, the
question on nearly everyone's mind was: Is Al Gore electable?
</P>
<P>
   Polling data from a variety of sources suggest that Gore faces a
major challenge, not only to succeed Clinton in the White House but
simply to win his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls have an influence on elections, and they become a
self-fulfilling prophecy to an extent,'' said House Democratic
leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who endorsed Gore months ago
after forgoing a presidential campaign of his own. ``But I think
the polls are in a way not very reflective of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   What is going on?
</P>
<P>
   Gore has enlisted much of the party establishment in the early
primary states and California, the jewel in the 12-state ``Super
Tuesday'' primary in early March. He has raised more money than any
Democratic presidential primary candidate in history. And, unlike
any modern vice president, he has the strong backing of his
president in the primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   But he has consistently trailed Bush by wide margins in
hypothetical head-to-head match-ups in public opinion polls, adding
to the anxiety of a party that has lost its majority control in
Congress during the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   And more ominously, at least to the Democrats backing Gore, the
16-point lead the vice president had over Bradley in the
first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, recent polls indicate Gore and Bradley are tied in
New York, another of the 12 ``Super Tuesday'' primaries. Last
spring, Gore led by 17 points in the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised that it's close because it's only a
two-person race,'' said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman
Kathy Sullivan, who is prohibited by party rules from supporting
any candidate in the primary. ``What is surprising is that it is so
close this early.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any silver lining in this cloud for Gore, she added,
it is that the vice president no longer has to play the game of
expectations and defeat Bradley by a wide margin in the New
Hampshire primary. ``Now, with the two candidates running even, a
win is a win,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Appel, who heads the party in New Hampshire's Strafford
County, said Bradley's rise in the polls is also due to favorable
news coverage of his visits to the Granite State, in contrast to
consistently critical reports on Gore. ``What I read in the
newspapers and see on TV about Gore is disjointed from my
reality,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of
Virginia who is an expert on the influence of media on politics,
echoed Appel's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could write a memo to Gore, it would begin, 'Mr. Vice
President, the bad news is that the news media have chosen your
opponent, Bill Bradley, to be the Democratic nominee for president.
The good news is that the media nominees usually lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's supporters argue that the former senator would be
``more electable'' than Gore in a general election contest against
Bush, the presumed GOP nominee. They base their argument on the
former senator's current popularity with independent voters and
Republicans as well as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an Internet-based poll of 16,837 respondents in late
August by the Harris Poll found that Gore is the ``most disliked''
major candidate for president. Sixty-six percent of Republicans and
40 percent of independents said they disliked the vice president,
while only 16 percent of Republicans and 8 percent of independents
disliked Bradley. (Bush was disliked by 33 percent of Democrats and
16 percent of independents.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is surrounded by a partisan screen that he is going to
have trouble breaking through to reach voters outside the
Democratic Party,'' said Jonathan Siegel, who directed the Harris
poll. ``You have Clinton fatigue as a drag on Gore, but you also
have the people who hate Clinton also hating Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Republicans worry that Bradley's cross-party appeal
could hurt the GOP next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bradley gets the Democratic nomination, God help us as
Republicans,'' said Frank Luntz, the GOP pollster who shaped the
``Contract With America'' that propelled Republicans to a majority
in Congress in 1994. ``No other candidate has that kind of reach
across the political spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz acknowledged, however, that at this stage, presidential
primaries are ``more a matter of style than issues'' and that
voters who like Bradley are ``seeing what they want to see and
hearing what they want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, after a Hall of Fame career in the National Basketball
Association, served 18 years in the Senate, producing a record that
the Gore campaign is now mining for political ammunition. Already,
Gore surrogates have caused Bradley to backtrack a bit from one of
his Senate votes supporting school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, running to the left of Gore, a ``New Democrat''
pioneer, has also taken positions that are not likely to appeal to
the moderate and conservative Democratic voters in the Southern
states, most notably Georgia, the only part of the old Confederacy
voting on ``Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed extending civil rights protections to
homosexuals and allowing gays to serve in the military. He also has
advocated registration of handguns. And next week, he is expected
to outline a health care policy that would expand the role of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should Bradley win the nomination, his leftish (CQ) positions
will present far more problems for Democrats than many think
today,'' said Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``if Bradley is a serious alternative to Gore, you have
to ask then, what is your Southern strategy?'' said David Bositis,
a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, a Washington research group that specializes in
civil rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's poll numbers are dampening the enthusiasm of
Democrats who might otherwise be ready to jump on his bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   And any early primary victories by Bradley strengthen the
argument that he is an electable alternative to Gore, one who does
not have to carry the ethical baggage of the Clinton administration
into a general election contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of an oxymoron to be talking about a tight spot in
1999 for a 2000 election,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
at a breakfast with reporters Thursday. ``If you look at a campaign
as a life span we're in the adolescent phase now, and you guys fall
in and out of love with candidates very, very quickly. ... So do
party activists, so do commentators.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has run for president once before, in 1988. And he has
been preparing for this run at least since the Clinton reelection
in 1996. And yet, he continues to perform below expectations. And
as a result, some Democrats ``are having a hard time making up
their mind,'' said New York-based political consultant Peter Dynum.

 NEW YORK: seems unquestionable.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   I don't need Tolstoy or Sappho to appear on ``Charlie Rose'' or
be profiled in The New York Times Magazine, but I can't eliminate
the notion of the writer from the writing. The poem ``London'' is a
treasure to me but so, differently, is William Blake. I don't mean
as biographical figure, though I would like to know, or as
identifying denominator beneath a collection of poetic numerators.
It is the very essence of the country that art creates for us that
it consists of patches, each with its own name, gravel and slope
like the tiny domaines of fine Burgundy, and not just particular
novels or poems or paintings (or bottles). There is something
besides price at stake when a painting is identified as a Masaccio
or a Chardin. It is no more beautiful than it was before, but the
country is larger. We need landmarks as well as land: we require to
think of Donne, Marvell, Keats and Seamus Heaney and not just six
or seven dozen beautiful poems.
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point, surely, the computer manages. On its screen it
spells both Keats and La Belle Dame Sans Merci just as well as I
and the Oxford University Press do. What fails is the corporal
link. We don't literally hold the writer when we hold the book;
nevertheless it is a thing we hold. We don't hold the baker, but we
hold _ not taste, not chewiness, not nourishment _ a loaf of bread.
Religious creed apart, there is a living metaphor in the words,
``This is my body.''
</P>
<P>
   What are the powers of this body: new or worn, hard-bound or
paperback or, back through the ages, parchment, papyrus, clay
tablet? I am sunk in a wicker armchair in a somnolent afternoon.
Resting (mark the word) upon my belly, too horizontal to provide a
proper lap, is a copy of the third, soon-to-appear version of the
Oxford Book of English Verse: child of Helen Gardner's edition of
30 years ago, grandchild of Arthur Quiller-Couch's centenary
version. Arbitrary and presumptuous grandfather, respectful but
nonetheless arbitrary mother, arbitrary and playful grandson _ the
gnome-savant Christopher Ricks. And in the truest sense _ you
cannot swim without kicking _ all three of them are reverent.
</P>
<P>
   To repeat, ``resting.'' What book of real value can be had
except by spaces of inattention woven through the attention? There
is no music without room for an echo; no poetry without a silence
to repeat itself. There is no novel without pauses for chewing on
the characters, for the aftertaste of a phrase, for irrelevant
speculation. What if Moby Dick were blue?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The computer screen can't understand inattention: ``Look at
me,'' it buzzes and glows, ``I am important.'' Much harder to
interrupt someone working on the computer than simply typing or
reading. It is to interrupt a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are important,'' the book says. It sits, docile, patient,
available; accompanies you to lunch or the bathroom, or on a train
where it will be left behind. It is companion in a conversation as
precious for its silences as for its speech. Also, with the poetry
anthology, it is capable of resting side by side for comparing with
its two predecessors _ if you own them and a belly big enough. You
would not park three screens in your mid-section; three electronic
books possibly, though unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   More essential: paper books possess a permanent thereness; they
need not be switched on to exist. When a page is turned the
preceding pages do not vanish; they are simply obscured as one tree
obscures another on a woods walk.
</P>
<P>
   You may go to the library, the bookstore or the next room to
collect it; once collected, it is with you; you are not with it.
You do not visit it; it visits you.
</P>
<P>
   Once again: the book is the link between writing's mind and
body. It is true that this and everything before it was written on
a computer. (Having written it that way, I have trouble reading
it.) But it will be mainly read in a newspaper, a thing flimsier
than a book, perhaps, but a thing still. If the point seems
far-fetched it is not really that far: no more than the 30 inches
or so that separate typing fingers from heartfelt conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Readings, lectures, panel discussions and storytelling are among
the events to be offered over the next three days during the 21st
New York Is Book Country festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2Read'' is the theme of the festival's centerpiece, the
annual New York Is Book Country fair, which takes place on Sunday
along Fifth Avenue from 48th to 57th Streets in Manhattan. Rosie
O'Donnell, the talk show host and children's book author, will
serve as grand marshal and will participate in various activities.
Authors will make appearances at the booths where literary material
from more than 180 exhibitors, from major publishers to small
presses, will be available from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., weather
permitting; the fair, which is free, may be canceled if it rains
heavily; for information, call (212) 207-7376).
</P>
<P>
   Free maps of the booth sites will be available at an information
booth set up on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd
Street. There will also be free bookmarks and an entry form for a
special game called ``The Hunt for Red September.'' Using clues at
booths marked by red balloons, players will fill out a
crosswordlike puzzle that will be entered into a drawing for free
books and audio tapes. Special activities will take place at two
stages. One, at 53rd Street east of Fifth Avenue, will feature
entertainment for children, including storytelling, readings and
music. The second stage, at 48th Street, will offer readings by
authors including the biographer A. Scott Berg (noon); the chefs
Julia Child and Jacques Pepin (1:30 p.m.) and the novelist Eric
Idle (3 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Several social events with literary ties, one especially for
children, are planned in Manhattan. Sunday from 10 a.m. to noon, a
``Book and Author Breakfast for Kids'' will be held at the Plaza
Hotel, Fifth Avenue and Central Park South. Taking part in the
event, sponsored by the Books for Kids Foundation, are the
``Goosebumps'' author R.L. Stine, the actress and writer Barbara
Dana and the cartoonist and author Jules Feiffer. Admission is $50,
or $125 for a family of three. Reservations are required: (212)
252-9168.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at noon, a brunch sponsored by New York Is Book
Country and The New York Times will be held at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, Park Avenue at 50th Street. Scheduled to appear are the
feminist author Susan Faludi, the memoirist Frank McCourt, the
novelist Richard North Patterson and the playwright Neil Simon. The
brunch is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the Waldorf-Astoria on Sunday will be an afternoon tea
sponsored by New York Is Book Country and The New York Times,
featuring the television writer and producer Stephen J. Cannell,
the mystery writer Dennis Lehane and the crime writer John Ridley.
It, too, is sold out.

A MAN, A PLAN, A FILM  
 MARRIAGE PROBLEMS 
AFTER THE KIDS

(ATTN: Canada, Calif.)  (rk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For Mark Illsley, the low point of his career came
less than three years ago when he was writing ``Happy, Texas'' with
Ed Stone, a neighbor in an apartment house in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we started writing it, I was working as a
telemarketer for a hair replacement company, which means I was
selling toupees over the phone,'' Illsley said. ``Like, man, I
thought this was the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   Illsley, 41, is no longer in the toupee business.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy, which stars Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam and
received a Sundance Film Festival jury prize, opens on Oct. 1. For
Illsley, who also directed and produced the movie, the opening of
``Happy, Texas'' represents the end of what he termed an obsession
for years to make a movie _ any movie _ that he could call his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I was asleep at the wheel of my own life,'' Illsley
said. ``Making a film was the one thing I dreamed about, and I knew
I had to take risks to do it. I just didn't want to be a
70-year-old man who looks in the mirror and sees the reflection of
a coward, someone who didn't take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illsley's case, it helped to have a wealthy family. Illsley's
father, Rolf Illsley, is an entrepreneur who started Optical
Coating Laboratories, a high-tech company in Santa Rosa, Calif.
When the younger Illsley and his team had their cast and crew but
not the money to start the film, his father, two sisters and
brother pooled their resources and put up $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my family take a huge risk,'' Illsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas,'' which was bought by Miramax at Sundance, is a
gentle comedy about two escaped prisoners, played by Zahn and
Northam, who evade the law in a beat-up Winnebago. They assume the
identity of the RV's owners: two gay beauty-pageant producers about
to arrive in Happy, Tex., which is a real town, for the Little Miss
Squeezed Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the town's eligible women are Illeana Douglas as a
schoolteacher and Ally Walker as a banker. William H. Macy plays
the town's lone lawman.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Happy, Texas,'' Illsley worked for years as a
second-unit director for Kevin Reynolds, his college classmate at
the University of Southern California School of Cinema and
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways I was lucky,'' Illsley said. ``But in other ways,
I wasn't doing what I really wanted to do. I was letting life go
along. I was too much of a coward to risk failure.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to Stone, a screenwriter who once worked as a disk
jockey near Happy, Tex., and suggested teaming up. Stone proposed
several film ideas, among them this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like fun,'' Illsley said.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote the script in eight weeks; Phil Reeves, another
writer, is also credited with the screenplay. But it took more than
two years to come up with financing, which repeatedly fell apart
until Illsley's family stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sundance, the film has been shortened by 15 minutes and 17
minutes of the original movie have been rewritten and refilmed.
</P>
<P>
   Illsley and Stone now have several films under way, notably
``Guam Goes to the Moon,'' a comedy about three astronauts
dismissed from the NASA shuttle program and hired by the
authorities in Guam to launch a manned moon mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right stuff, but the wrong guys,'' Illsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Illsley said he was nervous about the critical and box office
reaction to ``Happy, Texas.'' But he said that simply completing
the film and having it distributed was, in some ways, as
significant as how it was received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that I did it is enough,'' he said. ``I have
real pride that I made the movie and had the courage to completely
fail in a big way. At least I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Marriage Problems
</P>
<P>
   Rob Reiner has been married for 10 years and has three young
children. But this 52-year-old filmmaker knows many couples who
have endured marital problems, some working out the issues and some
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do a film that re-examines and re-explores
what it really means to be married, what goes on in a marriage,''
Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this yearning, Reiner, with screenwriters Alan Zweibel
and Jessie Nelson, has made ``The Story of Us,'' a romantic
comedy-drama about an upper-class couple in Los Angeles whose 15
years of marriage have left them emotionally drained and who try a
trial separation while their two children are away at summer camp.
The film, which opens on Oct. 15, stars Bruce Willis and Michelle
Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner, who was once married to director Penny Marshall, said
the idea for the film began with a conversation with Zweibel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about four to five years ago,'' Reiner said. ``There
are a lot of films about people falling in love; I've made some of
them. There are films about divorce. But there aren't too many
films about the day-to-day wear and tear and ins and outs of a
marriage. I thought we'd explore it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part about creating the film, Reiner said,
was that no cataclysmic event drove the plot forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had cancer, no one was involved in a car wreck, no one
was having an affair with another person,'' he said. ``We knew the
picture would rise and fall on how identifiable the situations and
characters were. We intentionally didn't put any monumental
dramatic element to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, in which Reiner plays a secondary role, the
characters portrayed by Willis and Ms. Pfeiffer initially appeal to
each other because each has traits the other lacks. Willis plays a
writer who is boyish, romantic and pays few attention to life's
details. Ms. Pfeiffer plays a woman who likes order in her life as
well as answers to every question. The years together have left
them emotionally strangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very thing that draws you to another person can wind up
being something that repels you,'' Reiner said. ``And then there's
children. Children are a source of tremendous joy but also a source
of tremendous strain. You can lose sight of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said the film had a personal dimension.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way of revisiting male-female relationships through
the prism of being married with children,'' said Reiner, whose
wife, Michelle, is a photographer. He said the team making the film
kept the story as light as possible because otherwise it could get
too harrowing, especially when the couple argues and screams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those arguments are, quite frankly, hard for people to
take,'' he said. ``I know the movie makes people a little
uncomfortable. But I think there are enough laughs to make it
accessible and palatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner paused, and said, almost as an afterthought, ``I know a
lot of people who are dealing with these same issues.''

 HOLLYWOOD: these same issues.''

   After the Kids
</P>
<P>
   Bruce McCulloch, a founder of Canadian comedy troupe Kids in the
Hall, whose show ran on HBO and CBS earlier this decade, has found
a new calling. McCulloch, 38, is awaiting the release of not one
but two comedies he has directed.
</P>
<P>
   One is Paramount's ``Superstar,'' produced by Lorne Michaels,
creator and executive producer of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live.''
Opening on Oct. 8, the comedy is about a schoolgirl, played by
Molly Shannon, who comes to Hollywood to be a star. The character
is based on Ms. Shannon's ``Saturday Night Live'' character Mary
Katherine Gallagher, a schoolgirl whose energy seems boundless and
often misdirected.
</P>
<P>
   The second film directed by McCulloch is New Line's ``Dog
Park,'' which follows the relationships among a group of young
people who meet in, yes, a dog park. That film opens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not cute dogs and things they do,'' McCulloch said.
``It's about how people practice having families with their dogs
while they're waiting for someone to come along. It's about how
dogs have almost become like modern-day children. Some people share
custody of their dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Superstar,'' he said the story delighted him for one
reason: ``It's about an outsider trying to fit into the world and
not exactly understanding the rules. This is what most of my comedy
has been about.''
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch, who grew up in Edmonton, Canada, said directing film
was almost a natural personal response after the success of the
cutting-edge troupe Kids in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ended up writing, you ended up suggesting music and
casting extras and directing shorts,'' he said. A trip to Los
Angeles from his home in Toronto about two years ago led him to
write and direct ``Dog Park,'' in which he also stars along with
Natasha Henstridge, Luke Wilson and Janeane Garofalo. McCulloch
said he got the idea after visiting several dog parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They attract singles, are anonymous and much friendlier than
the bar or gym scene,'' he said. ``They are, in many ways, the
singles bars of the late 1990s.''

pressure on regional Internet Service Providers such as MindSpring
which developed in era when analog dialup modems were king. The
growth of Internet has pushed the development of ever faster

in an era when being very good at you do was no longer enough. With
the move to merge with Earthlink, Mindspring has moved to the

BUY TWO, STASH ONE, GET MOVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Sept. 30)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You just know, don't you, that after an earthquake, the ones who
have emergency supplies will be the same people who always have
stamps. They'll be ready with three days of drinking water, a
manual can opener and change for the phone. The rest will be having
flashbacks about the time they almost loaded up on tuna but didn't
want to give up their place in the express line.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is not to condemn those who have yet to fill out
their earthquake preparedness box. I started an emergency supplies
list a month ago when Northern California had that little twinge.
I've acquired one six-pack of seltzer water and 12 rolls of toilet
paper. They'll go in my emergency box when I get the box. This is
merely a friendly reminder to myself and others that it is just
plain brainless to not have an emergency stash.
</P>
<P>
   It's so easy. The next time you're in the store and they have a
two-for-one on anything you can't imagine being without, such as
aspirin or diet cola, buy it. Put it in a box or a big garbage pail
with a tight lid and don't touch it until...unless...hopefully
never, there's an earthquake. Or a hurricane, tornado or a
technological meltdown, for those of the Y2K persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   I'm focused on earthquakes because it's been so jumpy around the
world lately and every time we go through what might be a spate of
voodoo weather, nervous natives look to the sky and softly say
``earthquake.'' They are not consistent on what earthquake weather
is, except that it's time to pay attention and step lightly. They
call it earthquake weather when it's hot and still, but also when
it's windy. The morning after strange lightning and thunder, they
said it again.
</P>
<P>
   Some people call that bunk but otherwise caution that when the
dogs start howling and the birds lift off from the trees, it is
time to roll off the couch and hug the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But do all of them have extra applesauce, crackers and a
portable radio gathered and stored in a safe place?
</P>
<P>
   You would think the proliferation of big box stores, where it's
almost impossible to buy anything in lots of fewer than a dozen,
would lead to quake-kit building.
</P>
<P>
   But most people, if you ask, explain that they are sincerely
planning to prepare. Really, they're thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   The office of emergency services gives out a list of quake
supplies that includes non-perishable food, blankets or sleeping
bags, fire extinguisher, wrench for shutting off the gas. There are
about 20 items that probably could be purchased in a lot less time
than it takes to round up food for Thanksgiving. We have no
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   The prepared ones, who boast of an earthquake box by the bed or
cupboard near the front door or garbage pail in the back yard, have
come up with some pretty good specialty items.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest:
</P>
<P>
   Chewing gum for those bound-to-be dry mouth moments. Brandy.
Notebooks, pens, extra reading glasses. For families with small
kids, a favorite but forgotten toy to put in someone's arms after
an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   A list of phone numbers. In August, when the dining room hutch
started twitching, I ran for a sturdy door frame and doubled back
for my portable phone only to blank on my husband's work number,
which is pretty bad because we work at the same place.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also thinking of packing:
</P>
<P>
   ``One Hundred Years of Solitude'' or some book there's never
been time for.
</P>
<P>
   Pet food. There will be no peace in the bunker if Ethel the cat
can't get to her whitefish with gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Think of what you forgot to pack on your last camping trip that
you couldn't face the next day without. Lip gloss, toothbrush,
change of underwear, St. John's Wort.
</P>
<P>
   Start small. But start.

   RSVP's For a `Party' ...
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Public Theater's Broadway-bound production of
``The Wild Party'' suffered a hiccup this week with news that one
of the its likely stars, Vanessa Williams, would not be available.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cast has not been announced, Ms. Williams'
appearance was widely anticipated. But several members of the
production staff said they were told at a meeting this week that
Ms. Williams was pregnant and due to give birth in April, the same
month ``The Wild Party'' is scheduled to open at the Virginia
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Cafarelli, Ms. Williams' spokesman, said he would not
comment on her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wild Party'' is based on a 1928 poem by Joseph Moncure
March about a boozy, jazz-era fete populated by all manner of
lovers and louts. Manhattan Theater Club is also preparing a
version of the piece, which centers around a love rectangle, with
the affections of two women, Kate and Queenie, entwined with those
of Black, a sporting man about town, and Burrs, a jealous rough.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams played Queenie in a February reading of ``The Wild
Party,'' at the Public. George C. Wolfe, the theater's artistic
director and the director of the musical, said through a spokesman
that he had not settled on his cast, but that it should be complete
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams, a former Miss America and current film star and
pop performer, had her Broadway debut in 1994 playing Aurora in
``Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' The role displayed Ms. Williams' sexy
stage presence and potent box office appeal, elements any producer
loves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, confidence is running high over this ``Wild Party,''
which was composed by Michael John LaChiusa and is going directly
to Broadway without an out-of-town tryout. Eartha Kitt and Mandy
Patinkin have been mentioned for the Broadway run. ... And Another
</P>
<P>
   At the Manhattan Theater Club, meanwhile, producers were adding
some star power of their own to their ``The Wild Party,'' composed
by Andrew Lippa and scheduled to open in February at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble will be headlined by Taye Diggs, who will play
Black, with Idina Menzel as Kate and Julia K. Murney as Queenie.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs and Ms. Menzel were original members of the cast of
``Rent,'' and Diggs has been on a roll of late, with memorable
turns in the films ``Go'' and ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
But the idea of returning to a New York stage was too tempting to
pass up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my agents the only type of theater I wanted to do was
New York,'' he said. ``I find something completely separate and
energizing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs said he was first drawn to the show by a song, ``A Poor
Child.'' But the deeper he looked, the more he found. ``It's a
complete musical in all aspects,'' he said.``It's got song and
dance and theater in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The return to the New York stage for Diggs and Ms. Menzel, who
are a real-life couple, complements what seems to be a citywide
return of original ``Rent'' alumni.

   Wilson Jermaine Heredia is back in ``Rent''; Daphne Rubin-Vega
appears next month in ``Gum'' at the WPP Theater, and Adam Pascal
is due in Disney's ``Aida'' in the spring. Mark Setlock, who was a
``Rent'' replacement, is appearing in the one-man show ``Fully
Committed'' at the Vineyard Theater. Is That All There Is?
</P>
<P>
   When ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' opened at the Virginia Theater in
March 1995, the reception wasn't exactly warm. Many critics derided
the revue of rock-and-roll standards by Jerry Leiber and Mike
Stoller as too sterile or too hokey to make it on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But the public apparently didn't see it that way. With the
national broadcast of a sizzling routine on the 1995 Tony Awards,
the show began to build good word of mouth. That momentum was
maintained by an aggressive marketing campaign, frequent radio
plugs by Don Imus and short stints by Motown performers, including
Gladys Knight and Ben E. King. ``Smokey'' ran through the 1995
season. And the 1996 season. And the 1997 season. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   That run will end on Jan. 16, the producers said this week,
completing a stretch of some 2,036 performances, which makes
``Smokey'' the longest running revue in Broadway history. More than
that, though, ``Smokey'' may be best remembered as a test case for
the theory that savvy marketing can overcome bad reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all immensely proud of its success,'' said Tom Viertel,
a producer. ``And of all the people who helped make our dreams,
artistic and commercial, come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _Add another entry to the season o' Sondheim: ``Saturday
Night,'' his earliest effort at a full-blown Broadway-style
musical. Second Stage will present the show in January, with
Kathleen Marshall, the artistic director of the Encores
musicals-in-concent series, as the director and choreographer. Rob
Fisher, the longtime musical director of Encores, will handle the
musical direction for ``Saturday Night.'' The season's other
Sondheim entries include ``Wise Guys,'' ``Putting It Together'' and
``Do I Hear a Waltz?''
</P>
<P>
   _Donna Murphy, a two-time Tony winner in musicals, will appear
in ``Trudy Blue,'' a play by Marsha Norman, at the MCC Theater on
West 28th Street in Chelsea. It opens on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   _There will be no London production of ``Death of a Salesman.''
Talks had been under way to export the New York company, headed by
Brian Dennehy and Elizabeth Franz. But the show's lead producer,
David Richenthal, said negotiations had not produced a deal.
</P>
<P>
   _Expect some unexpected giggles at Monday's performance of
``Fully Committed'' at the Vineyard Theater. The play, about the
tribulations of a restaurant reservation clerk, includes several
references to Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln
Center Theater, and Gersten is scheduled to attend on Monday. ``I'm
amused at the idea that my name would have enough recognition to
get a table,'' he said. ``Never worked for me.''

   FBC-AUBURN-ADVANCE _ Advancing Auburn-Mississippi: This time
last year, Ben Leard's career as Auburn's quarterback appeared to
be over. After a couple of bad starts, the Hartwell native was
yanked from the lineup in favor of Gabe Gross, who started the rest
of the year. His mother, who had attended every game he had played
since he was little, stopped going because she couldnt' take the
abuse the crowed heaped on her son. But when Tommy Tuberville
became head coach, Leard got another chance. On Sept. 4 against
Appalachian State, Leard came off the bench and led the Tigers to a
pair of touchdowns, including the winning one with 38 seconds left.
He started Auburn's win over LSU on Saturday. And his mother has
returned to attending games after Leard called her before the
opener and said he thought things were going to be better for him
under Tuberville. (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

Saturday against Central Florida in place of junior Reggie
Stargill. Redshirt freshman Jon Stinchcomb is starting at right

Crenshaw to bend tradition when the event begins today. Whatever
the singles story, there are questions to be answered about both
youngsters. Can Woods, who has dominated the PGA Tour since the
spring and a renowned match-play competitor, be the dominant force
he wasn't in Spain two years ago? Is Garcia mature enough at 19 to
handle the most intense pressure of his golfing life with the whole

NEMECHEK IS FINALLY A NASCAR WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Joe Nemechek, the road to victory has been long and hard and
full of pot holes.
</P>
<P>
   To win in Winston Cup, you must have both cars and chemistry.
Many drivers spend their entire career trying to find the right
combination and never do.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, persistence pays off, and if Nemechek is
nothing else, he is persistent.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, it all broke right for Nemechek. He had a good car.
He got some good breaks.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he got his first Winston Cup win, taking New
Hampshire's Dura Lube 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I get in a race car, I'm there for one reason and
that's to win,'' said Nemechek, who will celebrate his 36th
birthday on Sunday. ``I'm a competitive person and that shows in
everything I do. At the track I'm focused on what we need to do to
make the car the best it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, what needed to be done couldn't be done, or
should have been done before the car ever left the shop.
</P>
<P>
   And in Winston Cup now, if you come to the track behind, you
finish the race behind, because there will be cars there that get
it right.
</P>
<P>
   In the final practice before Sunday's race, Nemechek tried
several different chassis setups trying to make the car better. The
alterations included ``wedge,'' which increases or decreases the
weight over each wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some changes to the car and went out and ran. We put
wedge in and did all kinds of stuff, went out and didn't like it,''
Nemechek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took part of that stuff back out and ran four more laps,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the end of practice approached, Nemechek liked how the car
performed. ``It was awesome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the race, Nemechek showed he could contend, consistently
running in the top 10 and taking the lead for the first time on lap
93.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the race began to wind down, it became apparent that
Dale Jarrett had the dominant car.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with less than 100 laps to go, Nemechek and the rest got a
big break. Trying to squeeze into his pit between two other cars,
Jarrett left his car partially on pit road, and was penalized a
lap.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven laps later, Nemechek took the lead with 70 laps to go and
never lost it.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped to the front when, on his last pit stop, he and team
manager Tony Glover decided to change just two tires instead of
four, gaining an edge on the competition by minimizing his time in
the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough call, and I left it up to Tony to make it,''
Nemechek said. ``He asked me, `Two or four?' and I told him
whatever he wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we turned in pit road we had already run 50 laps,''
Nemechek said. ``Fifty laps is a long time on tires and we still
had 80 laps to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we took two and it paid off for us. If your car drives
good and you hit the setup perfect, you can go, no matter if you
have two or four. This race track is not really abrasive on
tires,'' Nemechek said. ``They slow down to a point and then they
kind of stay there. Tony made a good call.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was anything missing from the victory celebration, it
was Nemechek's parents, Joe Sr. and Martha, who were attending a
wedding in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Nemechek's mother, Martha, is particularly popular at most
races, while his father is more in the background. They have
supported their son's racing career financially and emotionally,
even though the death of Nemechek's younger brother, John, in a
truck race in 1997 took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked so hard and have been through so much as a
family,'' Joe Nemechek Sr. said.
</P>

NOW STARRING: A PICASSO NUDE  
 THAT MYSTERY MAN  
 A CLASSICAL SLANT? 
</HEADLINE>

   The art collection most intensely sought after by both
Christie's and Sotheby's this season was that of Madeleine Haas
Russell, one of San Francisco's most important philanthropists who
died at 84 in April. After months of discussions with both auction
houses, the executors chose Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Since the resolution was made just as the catalog for Christie's
important 20th-century sale on Nov. 9 was going to press,
Christie's decided to present the collection in its own special
catalog which features a group of 12 paintings, sculptures and
drawings by such artists as Picasso and Matisse. Experts at the
auction house estimate that the collection _ which will be sold
with other works of 20th-century art _ should fetch $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her life Mrs. Russell, a great-grandniece of Levi
Strauss, was a passionate and discerning collector. ``She was
selective, which accounts for the small number of works,'' said
Franck Giraud, Christie's director of 19th- and 20th-century art
worldwide. ``Dealers were constantly offering her things, but she
turned most of them down. She only fell in love with the very
best.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the star of the sale _ and perhaps of the entire fall
auction season _ will be Picasso's ``Nude on a Black Armchair,''
which he painted on March 9, 1932. It is a portrait of Picasso's
mistress, Marie-Therese Walter, asleep with her arms raised over
her head. The painting was the first of a series Picasso created of
her that year while he was living in Boisgeloup, outside Paris. The
painting is the largest (it measures 65 inches by 53 inches) and
the most sensual of these works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also one of the few of the series left in private
hands,'' said Giraud. ``Not only are the colors extraordinary, but
the scale is amazing. It is life-size.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's doesn't want to say publicly what the work is
expected to sell for, but experts there believe it could well bring
around $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, Christie's has sold two other
Picassos, both portraits of Marie-Therese Walter, both painted the
same year. ``Mirror,'' which was sold in 1995, fetched $20 million.
``Dream,'' which was sold from the estate of New York collectors
Sally and Victor Ganz in 1997, brought $48.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's and Sotheby's weren't the only ones trying to sell
``Nude on a Black Armchair.'' For months now, art experts said,
dealers have been making offers to the estate on behalf of clients
who heard the painting was being sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Picasso isn't the only reclining nude in Mrs. Russell's
collection. Also up for sale on Nov. 9 is a rare sculpture by
Matisse, ``Reclining Nude I (Dawn)'' conceived in 1907 and cast
around 1912. The bronze, like the Picasso, is of a woman resting
with her arm over her head. It is estimated to sell for $2 million
to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture, which was placed in front of the painting at Mrs.
Russell's house in San Francisco, not only has a similar theme but
also an important art-historical connection. The Picasso, with its
odalisquelike sitter, open window and large leafy plant, had
obvious influences on many of Matisse's later paintings.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-generation San Franciscan, Mrs. Russell also collected
local artists. A Diebenkorn, ``Interior: With Flowers'' (1961), is
also up for sale. Diebenkorn was himself influenced by Matisse. It
is thought to sell for $1.2 million to $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her taste was so consistent,'' said Giraud. ``All the art fit
well together.''
</P>
<P>
   That Mystery Man
</P>
<P>
   The lobby of the French Embassy on Fifth Avenue between 78th and
79th streets is an empty space, but only temporarily. The statue of
the curly-haired youth that was first placed there in 1906 when
Stanford White designed the building, has been the center of an
art-historical debate for several years now.
</P>
<P>
   When several experts suggested the sculpture might be by
Michelangelo, it was moved to the Metropolitan Museum for extensive
restoration and examination. While nothing definitive was
announced, the consensus seems to be that the three-foot-tall
sculpture is a Michelangelo.
</P>
<P>
   It is now on its way to Florence, where it will be included in
an exhibition on the early work of Michelangelo, ``Giovinazza di
Michelangelo,'' that is to run from Oct. 6 through Jan. 9 at the
Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. It will then travel to France, where
it will be shown by itself in a mini-installation, `Michel-Ange
Retrouve?'' in the Hall Napoleon of the Louvre in Paris from Feb.
10 through April 3. It will be the first time the statue has ever
been displayed in a museum, Pierre Buhler, cultural counselor of
the French Embassy, said.
</P>
<P>
   While Buhler said the embassy and New York City will miss having
the sculpture (about 10 people a day come especially to see it at
the embassy) he believes it is important to have it seen by the
public and other experts in Europe. ``These exhibitions will offer
the opportunity to a number of experts who have not yet seen the
statue,'' he said. ``And their opinions as to whether it is or is
not a Michelangelo will be of great interest to everyone who has
followed the story of its reappearance.''
</P>
<P>
   The statue will return to the Embassy in April.
</P>
<P>
   A Classical Slant?
</P>
<P>
   Days before Mayor Rudolph Giuliani threatened to cut off all
city subsidies to the Brooklyn Museum of Art unless it cancels
``Sensation: Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection,'' a
show of cutting-edge art that features works that are both
disturbing and shocking, the museum had chosen a scholar in
classical art to be the institution's deputy director for art.
</P>
<P>
   The newly created position will be filled by Ellen Reeder,
curator of ancient art at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore
since 1986. (Arnold L. Lehman, the museum's director, is familiar
with curators at the Baltimore museums. Before coming to Brooklyn
in 1997, he was the director of the Baltimore Museum of Art.)
</P>
<P>
   The job includes supervising all curatorial activities and
programming as well as collections management, exhibition
development and conservation. She will begin at Brooklyn at year's
end.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WORLD OF COUNTRY MUSIC IS CONFRONTED BY
CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ More than performers of any other style of popular
music, country musicians see themselves as part of a unified
community. Unlike their rock-and-roll counterparts, they accept
their music's past and understand that if the roots are destroyed,
so is the tree. Unlike rappers, their center is undisputably one
city, Nashville, thus avoiding territorial rivalries. And while
recent years have seen the rise of national superstars like Garth
Brooks and Shania Twain, selling more than 10 million copies of
their albums, for the most part country musicians have maintained
the illusion that they are the men and women next door.
</P>
<P>
   But at the 33d annual Country Music Association awards ceremony,
held on Wednesday night at the Grand Ole Opry here and broadcast on
CBS, a crack suddenly appeared on country's smooth facade. Before
the broadcast George Jones, one of the most important country
singers of this half-century, was asked to shorten his performance
of the song ``Choices,'' which was nominated, but lost, as single
of the year. Jones, 68, living up to his nickname No-Show Jones,
replied that he would not perform unless he could sing the entire
song. The ceremony went on without him.
</P>
<P>
   One of country's more current stars, Faith Hill, was having a
similar problem. The association wanted her to sing her recent
single, ``The Secret of Life,'' but she said she refused to perform
anything but ``Breathe,'' a new, unreleased song. In Ms. Hill's
case CBS executives intervened and told the association that the
show could not go on without her, and that she could perform
whatever she wanted. So she did.
</P>
<P>
   These events were not the crack, but they contributed to the
weakness in the system that led to it. The crack suddenly appeared
when Alan Jackson, 40, who is more of a traditionalist than some of
his fellow country stars, deviated from his performance of Jim Ed
Brown's 1967 hit ``Pop a Top'' to sing a chunk of ``Choices'' in
honor of No-Show Jones, surprising Jackson's record label, Arista,
and the show's producers, who did not seem too pleased. In a
statement delivered backstage, Jackson complained that the show
would not give Jones an extra couple of minutes to perform while he
was alive, but if he had died in his near-fatal car crash last
March, it would have included a 10-minute tribute to him.
</P>
<P>
   The crack widened backstage in the press room, where Jackson's
contemporaries offered little support for his actions. When asked
what he thought about Jackson's performance, Tim McGraw, who won
awards for album and male vocalist of the year, mumbled vaguely,
``It's a nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Gill, who was host of the show for the eighth year and won
an award for best vocal collaboration, was also noncommittal,
saying, ``Everybody doesn't know the whole story,'' and ``It's sad
to see everybody take sides.'' The audience, however, chose its
side, giving Jackson a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Widening the crack between the traditional and the new in
country music was the fact that the two biggest winners of the
night were Ms. Twain and the Dixie Chicks: immensely successful and
image-savvy performers, but with some fundamental differences.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Ms. Twain, a Canadian, received seven nominations,
but never won an award, in large part because she was viewed by
many in Nashville as an outsider and a performer more entrenched in
pop music than country. But in the last year Ms. Twain, who never
used to tour, has been doing so heavily, making great gains for
country music internationally and influencing record labels, for
better or worse, to market new acts in her image.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after losing in two categories, Ms. Twain finally won
her first award, the night's top honor as Entertainer of the Year.
She was the first woman to win this award in 13 years and the first
from outside the United States to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks, who won the most awards of the night _ three,
for single, group and video of the year _ are newcomers from Texas
who have quickly been embraced by Nashville. Although their look
becomes more stylized each day, and they have a penchant for
contrived mischief, their western swing and bluegrass-inflected
music is bringing back to country radio elements it has long lost:
a hit single with banjo in it, a popular group that can play its
own instruments, an Appalachian-style ballad and genuine musical
talent.
</P>
<P>
   This group has managed to achieve a delicate balance.
Simultaneously fresh and traditional, its members are able to look
and sound like pop stars but can still play like hillbillies.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Twain is caught in an undefined space between
identities _ with roots or residences in Canada, Europe and the
United States and as a rock, pop and country singer _ the Dixie
Chicks are able to seem like a return to tradition and still come
in a package that makes country music seem progressive.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of lip service was paid on Wednesday night to the
importance of tradition and to the great honor that Dolly Parton,
one of the year's new members of the Country Music Hall of Fame,
was bestowing by performing. But most of the time that rang hollow
on an overly ratings-conscious show that would put Merle Haggard on
the air only in a duet with the pop star Jewel, thus triggering
more debate.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other popular genre, country music should celebrate the
new at an annual awards show, and the differences between Ms. Twain
and the Dixie Chicks are fairly emblematic of the crossroads where
the genre finds itself. But cracks begin to appear when the new and
the old are placed in the context of competition instead of
continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gill was right when, instead of supporting Jackson, he
urged country listeners not to take sides. After all, when people
run to different sides of an issue, a giant crack appears in the
middle.

 &HT;    TEACHERS LACK PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOL COMPUTERS
 &HT;    With EDUCATION-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Public school classrooms have more computers than
ever before, but teachers haven't found enough useful software or
Web sites to run on them, a according to a huge survey released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers say it is hard to find software to suit their
specific classroom's needs,'' said Craig Gerald, director of the
``Technology Counts'' survey of more than 40,000 public schools,
1,407 teachers and 32 state technology directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many are not receiving training to use technology in their
lessons, and many don't have enough of the latest, more powerful
computers in their classroom to take full advantage of modern
software or the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation-funded project, co-sponsored by Education Week
magazine and the Milken Exchange on Education Technology, found
that students are getting more computer time.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, U.S. schools had 19.2 students per
instructional computer. That fell gradually to 6.3 students per
computer by 1998, when the ``e-rate'' tax on phone bills began to
underwrite technology costs in libraries and schools, and slid
further to 5.7 students per computer this year.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that more sophisticated computers are
starting to replace the old and slow Apple II and IBM-compatible
386 computers used just a few years ago in most schools.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1998 and 1999:
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of students per multimedia instructional computer
(one equipped with a sound card and CD-ROM drive that lets it run
educational software with voice and visual content) fell from 13.5
to 9.8.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of students per Internet-connected instructional
computer, which could access educational pages and research
material on the Web, fell from 19.7 to 13.6.
</P>
<P>
   About 37 percent of teachers who said they had been trained on
``integrating technology into the curriculum'' reported relying on
digital content in classes to a ``moderate'' or ``very great''
extent. But among the much larger number who reported having no
training or ``basic'' training on computers, only 25 percent said
they rely that much on digital content.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be all bad. There hasn't been much reliable,
large-scale research into how and when programs on CD-ROM disks or
Web pages help a student learn reading, writing and mathematics any
better than old-fashioned methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is anecdotal evidence and there are small-scale studies
that suggest technology can be helpful in certain ways, under
certain circumstances,'' said Virginia Edwards, editor of Education
Week, a national weekly newspaper for elementary and secondary
educators.
</P>
<P>
   In picking technology, teachers rely mostly on sales pitches
from software companies, word of mouth and impressionistic reviews
of Web sites or software programs by teachers and freelance writers
in a bewildering array of print and electronic publications.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reported:
</P>
<P>
   _ While 17 states evaluate software and online material, only
four _ Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and California _ release
public reviews that show how well the material lines up with their
state's curriculum standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only four states _ Florida, Ohio, Iowa and California _ have
developed their own educational software.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only eight states _ Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Hawaii,
Indiana, Iowa, South Dakota and Utah' _ have developed their own
online educational material.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges we've had is there isn't a lot of money
for research and development,'' said Cheryl Lemke, executive
director of the Milken Exchange. ``This isn't just about boxes and
wires and how you use them with children; it's about how we
re-engineer our educational system (to match) the definition of
what an educated person should be in the digital age.''
</P>
<P>
   The national and state Technology Counts reports are available
on the Internet (http://www.edweek.org/sreports/tc99/index.htm).

SENATE PROPOSES NEW AGENCY TO HANDLE IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Spencer Abraham unveiled legislation Thursday
that would abolish the Immigration and Naturalization Service and
replace it with a new agency that has separate departments, one to
provide services for immigrants and the other to enforce laws
against illicit immigration and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, on the enforcement side, illegal immigration is
too high, and the INS is not now equipped adequately to handle this
serious problem,'' Abraham, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on
Immigration, said a hearing on his bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, co-sponsored by the Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and Charles Hagel, R-Neb., would create the separate enforcement
and immigration branches in the Department of Justice _ the INS'
parent department _ under the umbrella of a new Immigration Affairs
Agency (IAA).
</P>
<P>
   The branches would be called the Bureau of Immigration Service
and Adjudication and the Bureau of Enforcement and Border Affairs.
The head of the IAA and the directors of its two bureaus would be
nominated by the president and would require Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that no structure is going to result in perfect
enforcement or service, but the current problems are too large to
ignore, and I believe that fundamental structural changes must be
made,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has a backlog of 1.8 million legal immigrants waiting
for their citizenship applications to be processed. The average
processing time is more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would give the Border Patrol 1,000 more agents for
each year from 2002-2004. It now has nearly 9,000 agents.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner told the Senate subcommittee she
agrees that her agency, which has 31,000 employees, needs
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS must change and will change ... but it must be given
the tools necessary to achieve comprehensive change across the
board,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has proposed a restructuring plan similar to Abraham's.
The INS plan would establish separate structures to administer
benefits and enforcement but keep them as part of the INS. In
addition, under the INS plan, the heads of the two new bureaus
would not be confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said she opposes a House bill that would abolish the
INS and replace it with two independent bureaus within the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the issues between enforcement and service are
so intertwined that it will be important to have a single head of
the agency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the House bill's sponsor, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said
Thursday that the INS has shown it is unwilling to change and that
it must be broken into two new agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release of criminal aliens into our communities and the
agony faced by legal immigrants waiting for green cards and
citizenship must end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, several immigration groups said they oppose breaking up
the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the American
Immigration Lawyers Association, a Washington-based group that
provides legal and social services to immigrants, said that while
the INS needs to change, Smith's bill would do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sharry, director of the National Immigration Forum, a
Washington-based immigration advocacy group, said Smith's bill
would create ``dueling bureaucracies'' that would cripple
immigration services and weaken enforcement.

`THE AMERICAN CENTURY': A COMPLICATED AND CONFLICTED SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``AMERICA TAKES COMMAND.'' These jarring, jingoistic
words, redolent of a Marshall Plan approach to cultural influence,
appear on a large sign in the first gallery of ``The American
Century: Art and Culture, 1950-2000'' at the Whitney Museum of
American Art. They float above paintings by Jackson Pollock and
Willem de Kooning and sculptures by David Smith, and they refer of
course to what is often called the triumph of American art,
specifically of Abstract Expressionism, after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Today the phrase seems quaint. Since the 1960s, curators, art
historians and critics have progressively dismantled or at least
de-emphasized the notion of a national esthetic and cultural
dominance. Recent exhibitions have strongly suggested that Abstract
Expressionism was only one strand of gestural painting that emerged
around the globe in the late 1940s and early '50s in Japan, France,
Austria and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily these words aren't the whole story of this complicated
and conflicted show, which has been organized by Lisa Phillips, a
former Whitney curator who is now director of the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in SoHo, and designed by the architect Christian
Hubert. Like its tamer, less historically freighted predecessor,
this second part sums up 50 years of American art and culture, the
century's better half this time, and fills the entire museum. Over
the range of six floors and five decades and hundreds of artworks
in dozens of media, it alternately dazzles and frustrates,
illuminates and disappoints, demonstrates terrific imagination and
the yawning lack of it and ultimately confirms that an exclusive
focus on American art has outlived whatever usefulness it once had.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which opens on Sunday, is best and most surprising
around the edges. In keeping with the current fashion for context,
it surrounds the art with a tremendous amount of engaging
supporting material. Even more than the first part, this
installment is festooned with so many expertly organized bits of
popular culture and historical background that a kind of
centrifugal force builds. One's attention is constantly pulled
outward toward the show's flickering margins _ toward landmark
events, famous personalities, banned or controversial books,
emblematic snippets of film, song and television and even
occasionally the wild and crazy carrying on of the artistic
avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   Every square foot of the museum has been used to convey some
nodule of information or activity. In the garden level ladies'
room, for example, well-known authors like Frank McCourt and
Kathryn Harrison read excerpts from their books on tape. The
museum's stairwell has audio works by John Cage, Yoko Ono and Terry
Fox and a segment of ``The Simpsons'' playing on a tiny television
set. And just as you reach the lobby, home free you think, there
are three Gap commercials on an even tinier set.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the show itself, there are constant tugs of war
between high and low and between art and history. On the fifth
floor while looking at Jasper Johns' ``White Target'' or Ray
Johnson's burnished collages of Elvis Presley, both from the late
1950s, you may hear Presley singing ``Jailhouse Rock'' or equally
famous songs by Ray Charles, Little Richard and Patsy Cline.
</P>
<P>
   These emanate from one of the show's six ``cultural sites,''
which provide historical context with a minimum of disruption and a
refreshing lack of text panels. At other sites you can sit in a
beanbag chair beneath a giant peace symbol while listening to Jimi
Hendrix's ``All Along the Watchtower'' in front of a wall-size
image of the 1963 March on Washington. And toward the end of the
show you can read a chronology tracing the National Endowment for
the Arts' near-death experience in the early 1990s beside two of
the most notorious artworks, by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres
Serrano, that started the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the show's interstices evoke the ephemeral fringe of
artistic practice that tends to be edited out of official
histories. A gantlet of video monitors after the gallery devoted to
Minimalism includes dance and performance pieces by Trisha Brown,
Steve Paxton and Carolee Schneemann, emphasizing that there was
more to the late 1960s and early '70s than industrial fabricated
geometry. You can also watch films of happenings; signal works by
experimental filmmakers like Stan Brakhage, Jack Smith and Jonas
Mekas; early videos of Joan Jonas and Meredith Monk, and
performances of Robert Wilson's ``Einstein on the Beach'' and
Laurie Anderson's ``O Superman.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the addition of so much context is that when
art is pitted against life, life tends to win. In the exhibition
context, souvenirs of the outside world function as a form of
visual comfort food: immediately comprehensible and easier to
digest. One responds to them with warm nostalgia (duck-and-cover
air raid drills! Sonny and Cher!), or when the details concern
figures like Sens. Joseph McCarthy or Jesse Helms, with a knee-jerk
sense of indignation and superiority.
</P>
<P>
   But once past the feel-good moments, the context can't disguise
the show's conventional core, the predictable, severely truncated
story told by the art objects on view. As smooth as the periphery
is textured and as shallow as the edges are deep, the central
narrative moves with the efficiency of a Monarch Notes time line
from Jackson Pollock's drip paintings and Johns' flags and targets
to ``Drawing Restraint 7,'' a Matthew Barney video installation
featuring bare-chested satyrs. In between, brief note is taken of
Color Field painting, Fluxus, Pop, Minimalism, Photo Realism,
Conceptual Art, Process Art, Earthworks, Pictures Art, Neo-Geo and
looser categories the Whitney calls ``A Resurgence of Painting''
and ``The Return of the Subject.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, this show once again underscores the difficulty of
mounting broad-scope, inclusively titled historical surveys
unlimited by a discernible point of view that might provide a
modicum of shape or logic. Mainly one has the sense that a large,
familiar list of artists was drawn up, all of whom appear in the
show's textbooklike catalog. After that it was simply a matter of
shoe-horning as many of the uppermost layer as possible into the
available gallery space.
</P>

<P>
   Thus there was room for Ellsworth Kelly and Alex Katz but not
for Myron Stout or Al Held, for Jay DeFeo but not Joan Brown, for
Ed Ruscha but not Peter Saul, for Jim Nutt but not Roger Brown, for
Donald Judd but not Larry Bell, for Susan Rothenberg but not
Jennifer Bartlett. Other artists present in the catalog but not in
the galleries include Robert Longo, Douglas Huebler, Judy Chicago,
Kerry James Marshall, Zoe Leonard and Ann Hamilton. Artists who
don't even qualify for the book include Dorothea Rockburne, James
Welling and James Casebere.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect has the ``one artist, one work'' briskness
and superficiality of a Whitney Biennial. Like the museum's
signature overviews, it mixes usual suspects and fashionable
unusual suspects, and it seems aimed primarily at a general
audience with only a passing knowledge of art. But it will initiate
many into the incalculable range of form and subject that
characterizes the postwar art not just of the United Sates but also
of most Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   One glimpses the opening of the art world to women and artists
of different races that Conceptual Art made possible and the
acceptance of different forms of craft initiated by Process Art and
Pattern and Decoration. The main drama, though, is the widespread,
polymorphous infiltration of popular culture and everyday life
signaled by Pop Art but instigated by a broad swath of artists,
including the composer John Cage, the Fluxus group and Californians
like Wallace Berman and Jess.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of art toward accessibility and beyond, toward
entertainment, is everywhere apparent. It is symbolic that at the
beginning of the show rock 'n' roll music is present in the
cultural sites; by the end it has segued the art, providing
accompaniment, for example, to ``The Ballad of Sexual Dependency,''
Nan Goldin's slide presentation of photographs of the East Village
demimonde.
</P>
<P>
   Equally telling is a comparison of the show's two walk-in
corridor installation pieces. In ``Live/Taped Video Corridor,''
Bruce Nauman's early 1970s work, one arrives at a tiny black and
white monitor on which one can see only a live image of the back of
one's own head. In Bill Viola's 1999 ``Tree of Knowledge,'' the
viewer's movement down the corridor triggers an entire life cycle
in splendid color, from green sapling to a life-size tree going
through the four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But old habits persist. Count on the Whitney to work Edward
Hopper into the exhibition; more pertinent would have been Stuart
Davis, whose work underwent tremendous growth between 1950 and his
death in 1964. And you would never know about folk artists from
this show; even the achievements of two of the country's greatest,
Martin Ramirez and Henry Darger, both active well past 1950, are
missing.
</P>
<P>
   After 1970 it is not the absence of individual artists that
plagues the show so much as the sense that the American ``command''
phase, if you want to call it that, was over, that the action was
increasingly elsewhere, or more accurately, everywhere, in South
America, Europe and beyond. In the end one senses a very quick rise
and fall. Not only was there no ``American Century'' in terms of
fine art, there wasn't even an American half-century. There were
two decades, the 1950s and '60s, during which American Art seen in
isolation held its ground.

 &HT;    Decisions, decisions: Wait's over for `Felicity'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For fans of ``Felicity,'' there is only one question: Ben or
Noel?
</P>
<P>
   You'll find out tonight that the answer is ...
</P>
<P>
   Before we get to that, a quick reprise. Felicity is this
gorgeous, brilliant, sweet girl we followed last season as she more
or less laid waste to New York University during her freshman year.
She stalked one guy (hunky but verbally challenged Ben), broke this
other guy's heart (noble but too-nice Noel), lost her virginity to
a third guy she barely knew, betrayed a friend, almost got Ben
expelled, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' isn't just for kids; fully mature grown-ups, with
401(k)s and mortgage payments and all, watch this show every week
and absolutely hang on it. In the season finale, she had to choose
which boy, Ben or Noel, to spend the summer with.
</P>
<P>
   And it's ...
</P>
<P>
   A hoot to find out that Felicity is stuck once again with Megan,
her psychotic roommate, who went to ``Wicca camp'' over the summer
while Felicity was ...
</P>
<P>
   Making news with her radical haircut. Actually, that was star
Keri Russell, who got her gorgeous frizzy mane all cut off after
the series went back into production. In Sunday's premiere, she
still has her hair; the big snip is featured in an upcoming
episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' isn't easy to categorize (like the character
herself). Sometimes it achieves pop-culture epiphany, combining
acute writing, solid acting and painful insights into the
coming-of-age process. Other times it's little more than a soap,
``90210'' with better lighting and pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   The whole Ben-or-Noel thing was, and is, pure soap, and yet
that's what the fans have glommed onto. It's interesting that
``Felicity's'' creators gave viewers a young woman who's torn
between pre-med and her talent at art and who is in honors classes
at brutally selective NYU, and what do they chatter about? Her hair
and her boyfriends!
</P>
<P>
   As for Ben vs. Noel, it's ...
</P>
<P>
   A doozy of a decision. But you'd hate it if it was spoiled here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity''

 &HT;    Memorably weird, paranoid, series excites `Now and Again'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most striking, rub-your-eyeballs TV scene of the fall starts
with a calm, elderly Japanese man getting on the Tokyo subway with
a bag of groceries. When he gets off, he leaves four eggs on a
seat, while John Lennon sings, ``I am the eggman ...
koo-koo-ca-choo.''
</P>
<P>
   The eggs fall and break, and a boy gets a nosebleed. A woman
screams. Ominous drums are pounding. Other passengers begin to
bleed. When the subway pulls into the next station, the windows are
coated with crimson.
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Now and Again'' gets weird.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran actor John Goodman plays a middle-aged, middle-class
insurance executive, Michael Wiseman, who's taking the subway home
(in New York) when he's accidentally pushed onto the platform and
creamed by a train. When he wakes up, a cheery black scientist is
crooning the Carpenters ballad ``Close to You'' to him and telling
him that he had a beautiful funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Now and Again'' gets weird.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the government has gotten back into the bionic
man-building business. They've built a super-duper body, and only
needed a brain to transplant into it. Wiseman, whose brain survived
but whose body didn't, has been volunteered. So instead of jowly
old Goodman (who won't be appearing much, if at all, after
tonight's pilot), Wiseman is now played by hunky young Eric Close.
</P>
<P>
   But as the scientist, Dr. Theodore Morris (Dennis Haysbert),
tells him, there's a catch. He has to work for the feds on special
projects and can never contact his wife and daughter again, or he
and they will be killed. ``There is no `you,''' he's told.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like some perverse update of ``The Six Million Dollar
Man,'' but creator Glenn Gordon Caron says not to be misled by the
slightly similar premise. He was inspired by the musical ``Damn
Yankees,'' in which an aging schlub sells his soul to the devil to
become a baseball star, then finds out what he really wants is his
comfortable old wife, and life.
</P>
<P>
   Caron was the man behind ``Moonlighting,'' another show that
kept viewers off balance; just when you thought it was a frantic
screwball comedy, it would become achingly romantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' is the strangest TV pilot of this or any
recent season, as paranoid as a Fox Mulder fever dream, but with an
undercurrent of yearning. But it's incomplete, a big tease, ending
with ``To Be Continued.'' Even the eggman remains a cipher;
presumably Wiseman will go after him next week, but it's risky to
presume anything about this show. It could go on to be quite
memorable, or chase its own tail till it disappears in a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again''
</P>
<P>
   9 tonight on CBS
</P>
<P>
   Grade: Who knows?

BAUER UNVEILS 16% FLAT TAX PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Slamming his own party leaders for their timidity
in dealing with taxes, Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer
unveiled a flat tax plan Thursday that would also eliminate
write-offs for big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My party must stand for working Americans, blue collar and
white collar, not just for big corporate interests,'' Bauer said at
a National Press Club luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer would replace the current tax code with a 16 percent flat
tax for individuals and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the conservative Family Research Council also
said he would slash the payroll tax that funds Social Security by
20 percent and let individuals invest the money on their own for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   While another Republican contender Steve Forbes has long
advocated a 17 percent flat tax, Bauer said his plan offered a
lower rate because he would also bring $800 billion in currently
exempt corporate property back into the tax base.
</P>
<P>
   While Bauer chided President Clinton for vetoing what he termed
a ``relatively modest'' GOP tax cut package, he was equally
critical of Republicans for loading their plans with favors to
corporate lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also said that in his travels around the country, ``I
couldn't find anyone would could tell me how much they would
benefit from the congressional tax cut, because it was so
complicated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed that $792 billion tax cut plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's plan was immediately criticized by a business group that
opposed his elimination of corporate write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``His plan will knee-cap small businesses and economic
opportunities,'' said Karen Kerrigan, chairman of the Small
Business Survival Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's speech appeared to be an effort to broaden his appeal
beyond his base of social conservatives, who have been drawn to his
opposition to abortion and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate said he hoped his plan would stimulate more debate
on taxes among the presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that while he is still waiting for GOP front-runner
George W. Bush to release his tax plan, he did not expect it to
differ much from conventional Republican approach.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that many of the corporations that now benefit from the
tax code are headed by executives who ``have been very generous to
the Bush campaign so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has endorsed the congressional Republican tax cut but has
not released a complete tax plan of his own. Bush has proposed
allowing taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions even if they
do not earn enough to itemize their other deductions, and has
proposed a few other small specific tax changes for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the Texas governor ``will
lay out a detailed plan that cuts taxes at the federal level.``
</P>
<P>
   While Bauer's plan would eliminate most deductions it would give
families the option to keep the popular home mortgage interest and
charitable giving deductions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also tax capital gains at 16 percent and
eliminate the inheritance tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's Social Security proposal differs from other plans to
extend the life of the retirement program in that it would not
force individuals to put savings from the payroll tax cut into
private retirement investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that individuals, not Wall Street brokerage firms,
should benefit from the payroll tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Bauer plan also called for cutting benefits for all
but current retirees. Those individuals who spent their tax cut
instead of investing for retirement would be out of luck when they
got older, Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will have to deal with the consequences of choices they
make,'' he said.

 &HT;    Sharp and funny, `Freaks' rules
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title, ``Freaks and Geeks,'' is not exactly a viewer magnet.
The time slot, on Saturday night, is as bad as it gets, the Death
Valley of network television. The timing _ a show about teenagers
coming in the midst of a fall crush of high school angst _ couldn't
be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and you'd better catch ``Freaks and Geeks'' while
you can, cause its one of the very best new series of the season.
Funny, sharp, poignant, painfully realistic and detailed, this teen
comedy-drama doesn't run with the pack of clear-skinned beauty
girls and moussed-up pretty boys of the WB and its wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   While those other shows are primping for the big prime-time
dance, ``Freaks and Geeks'' is slouched under the bleachers,
bumming a smoke.
</P>
<P>
   High school is universal, so it doesn't matter that ``F&AMP;G'' is
set in 1980; just as ``The Wonder Years'' once did, it will speak
to you whether you're dreading gym class tomorrow or headed for
your 25th reunion. Our heroine is Lindsay (Linda Cardellini), a
brainy high school sophomore who's not a conventional babe, so she
doesn't realize how pretty she really is; when she flashes that
hesitant smile for a millisecond, it's heartbreaking. Lindsay's a
good kid, but she's trying on a new identity, hanging out with the
school's freaks (Led Zeppelin, army jackets, carefully cultivated
apathy), to the dismay of her friends and teachers. Ostensibly,
she's reacting to being alone with her grandmother when she died,
but one gets the feeling Lindsay's indecision is more the result of
being 15 than of any crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Her freshman brother, Sam (John Daley), is a squirrelly little
guy who might as well be wearing a sign saying, ``Take my lunch
money, please.'' He and his band of ``Star Wars''-watching,
mouth-breathing, polyester-shirted geek-buds are to the school's
bullies what British infantrymen were to German machine gunners
during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   As if high school weren't cruel enough for these two, they go
home to dad's dinner-table lectures, a hilarious series of non
sequitur fulminations by comic pro Joe Flaherty: ``There was a girl
at our school, and she experimented with premarital sex. Know what
she did on graduation day? Died of an overdose!!''
</P>
<P>
   Funnier than most sitcoms and more serious than most dramas, the
first hour of ``F&AMP;G'' creates its own wonderful world, with Styx on
the stereo and a Carter-Mondale poster inconspicuously on a
bulletin board. There's also:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lindsay's hipster guidance counselor, Mr. Rosso _ ``I'm just
Jeff. Your friend who cares'' _ who ends up trying to blackmail
Lindsay into returning to the school's academic decathlon team.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A subplot with a retarded student, Eli, that never quite goes
where you think it's going.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A dodgeball showdown in gym class between Sam and his friends
and their bulky tormentors that will make every guy watching cross
his legs tightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' is based on the Michigan adolescence of
creator Paul Feig, as filtered through the sensibility of comic
writer Judd Apatow (``The Larry Sanders Show'') and director Jake
Kasdan (``The Zero Effect,'' and, yes, Lawrence's son).
</P>
<P>
   But it's one of those shows that doesn't really seem written; it
just seems to unfold, as if these talented actors are these kids
they're playing. Or, possibly, just us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks.''

 &HT;    Twists keep coming on `Practice'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Murder victims on David E. Kelley's ``The Practice'' do not go
gentle into that good Sunday night. Last season, a woman's severed
head turned up in her date's medical bag, and the obvious suspect,
podiatrist and uber-nerd George Vogelman, fought all season long to
get off.
</P>
<P>
   In tonight's season premiere, the corpse of a woman is found in
a dentist's chair, strangled, her mouth filled with grape jelly.
That isn't even the kinky part.
</P>
<P>
   And Kelley's ``Ally McBeal'' is the show with the reputation for
being weird?
</P>
<P>
   The two cases _ Vogelman and the jelly-woman _ alternate in
tonight's fourth season premiere. For those who missed it, last
season's finale was probably the most talked about of any series,
as ``Practice'' law partner Lindsay Dole (Kelli Williams) was
stabbed by a nun, who turned out to be Vogelman in drag. We know
that, but the lawyers at the firm that defended Vogelman don't, so
when he shows up tonight wanting representation because he's
getting evicted by his tenants' association, we desperately want
them to tell him to bag it. And when he asks his lawyer, Ellenor,
(Camryn Manheim) to come over for dinner, you can almost hear
Anthony Perkins in ``Psycho II'' talking about the ``c-c-cutlery.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, ``Practice'' ``re-habbed'' Tony Danza, taking an
actor who gets little respect and giving him a meaty recurring
dramatic role. This season, it's Henry Winkler, as the dentist
accused of killing his patient, although he doesn't have as much
rehab to go through as Danza. Winkler's defense, which is shot
through with ethical dilemmas and the opportunity for the lawyers
to slip into malpractice, looks as if it may play out over several
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Vogelman, meanwhile, looks like he might become the star of
``The Practice,'' although Dylan McDermott could ruefully tell
actor Michael Monks he'll never win an Emmy for best actor as long
as Dennis Franz is squeezin' shoes. And speaking of Emmys, no one
seemed more surprised than Kelley when two weeks ago ``The
Practice'' won best drama for the second straight year, beating
``The Sopranos.'' Good as ``Practice'' is, it pales in comparison
to ``Sopranos.'' Apparently David E. Kelley isn't the only one who
can come up with bizarre, unexpected twists.

 &HT;    `Snoops' frolics under, around the law
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Snoops'' defines end-of-the-millennium guilty pleasure. It's
that bad and it's that hard to resist. It kills you with its
high-tech kitschiness and its pretend-smarts brains. This is a show
that's as dumb as you want it to be, while being as defensible as
you care to make it. Hey, it's not just about Gina Gershon's lips _
it's about, you know, privacy issues and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Created, presumably on his morning off, by David E. Kelley
(``Ally McBeal,'' ``The Practice'' and virtually everything else on
TV), ``Snoops'' whisks by in a whirl of tacky camera gimmicks and
gumdrop colors. The '70s sheen that overlays its sleek
century-ending digs is clearly intentional, an unapologetic fashion
statement that lets the whole enterprise get away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Gershon (``Showgirls''), and her lip-glossed to-the-max lips, is
where your eyes head first. As Glenn Hall (named by Kelley to honor
the former St. Louis goaltender whom his beloved Boston Bruins beat
decades ago to win the Stanley Cup), she runs a Los Angeles private
investigation agency that's long on surveillance gizmos and short
on constitutional ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Marshall (``Cupid,'' ``Spin City'') is her newest recruit,
leggy former cop (``You're prettier than you sound on the phone'')
Dana Plant. Her instincts are to play by the same book that Hall
long ago threw out.
</P>
<P>
   Plant is aided in her descent into the agency's pseudo-legal
lawlessness by co-workers Manny Lott (Danny Nucci), an
oldies-crooning hidden-camera whiz, and Roberta Young (Paula Jai
Parker), who's never met a feather boa she couldn't tame around her
neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex,'' Manny comments on one of Roberta's outfits, in the
casual, no-biggie way that people in other offices might remark,
``Nice.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a whiff of ``Charlie's Angels'' in the way ``Snoops''
puts the jiggle in the jam. Ever since her turn as an ex-con who
falls in love with gangster moll Jennifer Tilly in 1996's
``Bound,'' Gershon brings whatever kind of heat you want to imagine
to every situation imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The cases that come the agency's way are earnestly absurd. They
let us suspend belief long enough to get sufficiently involved, yet
not so long that we're embarrassed for having played along. Story
lines are full of twists and turns and schools of red herrings;
it's ``Murder, She Wrote,'' with too much lip gloss and a lesbian
subtext.
</P>
<P>
   But just remember when anybody asks: ``Snoops'' is really about
privacy issues. And stuff.

 &HT;    `Cold Feet' cranks up the relationship angst
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I hate domestics,'' a cop sighs near the end of ``Cold Feet''
's first episode.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, he's referring to the romantic squabble he's been
called in to referee. Or maybe, like us, he's curiously bummed out
by this show about three couples caught in various stages of
domesticity.
</P>
<P>
   Caught is the operative word when it comes to ``Cold Feet,''
which NBC describes as an ``adult comedy.'' And it is funny. There
are good broad bits _ like when Shelley (Jean Louisa Kelly) says to
the guy who dumps her and then becomes miffed when she's not
sufficiently upset: ``Gee, I'm sorry I'm not more rewarding to
break up with.'' And some decent smaller ones, such as when new mom
Karen (Alicia Coppola) silently glares at her clueless spouse while
pressing ``Pulverize'' on the blender.
</P>
<P>
   So why is ``Cold Feet'' ultimately a downer? Well, maybe it's
how trapped all six of these individuals look, behave and
especially talk about their relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your life is not your own,'' young married Pete (William
Keane) darkly warns his pal Adam (David Sutcliffe), who's
contemplating getting serious with Shelley.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so bad about being alone?'' Shelley wonders a bit
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' responds Karen, who's one of the best things in a
show that asks her to play a '90s version of Lucy Ricardo (instead
of a job in show business, Karen wants her husband to let her get a
nanny). ``I do it all the time, and I'm married.''
</P>
<P>
   When Adam and Shelley do profess their love at the end of this
episode, the camera catches each one looking, oh, what's the word?
Doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, it's commitment that's got them so terrified. Or
maybe it's this show, that, funny as it frequently is, ultimately
makes falling in love seem akin to serving a jail sentence.

 &HT;    Improved `Jack' still has hill to climb
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time there was a pilot for ``Jack &AMP; Jill,'' and it
was pretty bad.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, that one's history. In its place comes another
premiere episode of a series boasting the exact same name, premise
and all but one of the same actors. And while its still not
fabulous (no completely happy ending here), it is much improved.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing they've done to this boy-meets-girl dramedy is to
tone down what's still its worst feature. Meaning: He's still
``Jill'' and she's still ``Jack,'' resulting in some of the most
stilted salutation scenes ever among actors who clearly wish they
could simply address everyone as ``hey, you!''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you producers: Drop this gimmick, fast!
</P>
<P>
   But except for the occasional, jaw-grindingly obvious voice-over
(Her: ``It started out like `Jack and Jill.' But we didn't go up a
hill'') most of the too-cute lines and other fairy tale-ish touches
are gone. What's left is another slightly unbelievable show about
six gorgeous 20-somethings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But TV is supposed to be unbelievable. And while ``Jack &AMP; Jill''
clearly aspires to the success of ``Friends''(right down to copying
that show's opening premise of a runaway bride who ends up in
Gotham), it hints at life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Much as ``Friends'' got better when it finally got off the first
few seasons' mopey Ross and Rachel story line, ``Jack &AMP; Jill''
improves whenever it's not focusing on the titular characters and
their sexual tension. Turns out their friends _ who include a
promiscuous off-Broadway dancer and a cadaver-skittish med student
_ are much more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   They also have some of the best lines, although Jack _ God love
him, er, her _ does get off a good Kathie Lee Gifford zinger.
</P>
<P>
   Give us more of this ``Jack &AMP; Jill'' and we'll all live happier
ever after.

 &HT;    `Futurama,' `Simpsons' open with film spoofs
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an immutable law of television _ at least for the time
being _ that whatever show is nestled between ``The Simpsons'' and
``The X-Files'' gets good ratings, while Fox comedies on other
nights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill,'' ``That '70s Show'' and ``Family Guy'' all
flourished there, but ``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening pulled
rank and got his ``Futurama'' slotted in. It's a good fit, both in
animation style (everybody has bug-eyes and overbites) and
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama,'' less than a year old, hasn't exploded the way
``The Simpsons'' did 10 years ago, but that's OK. It's still a work
in progress, showing promise as much as quick payoff. Set in 3000,
it's visually a takeoff on classic pulp sci-fi of the '40s and
'50s, all those paperback covers with flying finned cars and
bubble-topped space needles. Content-wise, it's as much a grab bag
as ``The Simpsons,'' as tonight's episode, a spoof of the movie
``Titanic,'' demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   By now, there should be serious, enforceable penalties against
another ``Titanic'' spoof, but ``Futurama'' is the only one where
the new luxurious space cruiser is christened by smashing Leonardo
DiCaprio's head, preserved in a glass jar, against the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Groening likes to joke that he always thinks ``The Simpsons''
has one more good year left in it, than a year of coasting and
living off good will, then cancellation. And those years never
come.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's season-opener has Mel Gibson goofing on his screen
image in one of the series' most extended guest-voice bits, when he
hires Homer to help him fix his new movie. It's a remake of ``Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington,'' which Homer feels is too talky. So they
change the ending, and Gibson/Smith ends his big Senate speech by
leveling the chamber with automatic gunfire. Sensitive types who
count the number of violent episodes per show should watch
``Touched by an Angel'' instead, or they'll get a nosebleed.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage of ``Simpsons'' caricaturing is also widespread,
ripping John Travolta, Jack Valenti, ``Jerry Maguire'' and Robert
Downey Jr. (see ``Titanic'' above: too easy to spoof).
</P>
<P>
   Next week's episode is even better; in fact, it will be one that
fans number as among the all-time best, as Bart gets heavily dosed
with a Ritalin-type drug and becomes a model student. This isn't
``eat my shorts'' and Apu's funny-accent stuff, it's savage satire
with a strong point of view. No coasting yet for ``The Simpsons.''

 &HT;    A river of misery rushes through eastern North Carolina
 &HT;    By Mary C. Schulken
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Death flowed brown and steady over the flat
land, covering trees and fields and bluffs that used to be
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Misery rode the current through rooms where children laughed and
spilled
</P>
<P>
   food and then were scolded. It swirled around beds where arms
locked on cold
</P>
<P>
   nights, and in back yards where, not so long ago, charcoal
flamed on sunny
</P>
<P>
   afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Those places are gone now, swept away.
</P>
<P>
   On land where tractors droned and peeled the earth, the water
rolled. It
</P>
<P>
   rolled in kitchens where late at night hands worn from work
juggled credit
</P>
<P>
   and debit and rubbed tired eyes. It rolled through crossroad
stores where
</P>
<P>
   loafers passed time on creaky benches, swapping stories they
knew by heart.
</P>
<P>
   It rolled through narrow college streets, where students trudged
to
</P>
<P>
   school with books in packs and hair under caps. It rolled
through first
</P>
<P>
   apartments where papers littered coffee tables and scribbled
notes on
</P>
<P>
   refrigerators reminded to call home.
</P>
<P>
   This couldn't happen here, they said. Not in a million years. In
makeshift
</P>
<P>
   shelters that used to be schools, pieces of families huddled,
waiting for
</P>
<P>
   word from others. Disbelief rose hard alongside fear.
</P>
<P>
   The luckier ones on higher ground saw the pictures and marked
them from
</P>
<P>
   another place, another time.
</P>
<P>
   That can't be our church, they said. That's not the power plant
is it?
</P>
<P>
   Later, confirmation came by the deadly gallon: Rosalie's house
lost, and
</P>
<P>
   John's. And thousands of others, too.
</P>
<P>
   A harmless trickle of a stream had become a murky ocean. And so
many places
</P>
<P>
   and things we know so well are swept away.
</P>
<P>
   A whole city without water. Power hanging by a drop cord.
Families who have
</P>
<P>
   lost everything. Some disastrous dream played out on a stage far
too close
</P>
<P>
   to home.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago there was football and the county fair and cool
September nights
</P>
<P>
   on the porch. Now there is muck and missing people and animals
floating.
</P>
<P>
   There is death and the suffering of those we know by name, and
we cannot
</P>
<P>
   turn it off and go home.
</P>
<P>
   This is our life, and a river runs through it.
</P>
<P>
   A half a year's worth of rain fell on eastern North Carolina in
a
</P>
<P>
   fortnight. The last time the water got that high, only the
Tuscarora and the
</P>
<P>
   brown-eyed deer could bear witness.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there were a quarter of a million people who felt the
river wash clean the features of the landscape they call home.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime soon, the water will go away.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of helicopter rotors overhead will give way again to
the songs of birds. Clean water rushing from a faucet will no
longer seem like such a miracle. And each day will not bring the
dread of another body in a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, fresh paint will cover stained walls and backyards will be
dry enough for picnics. Children will return to minding sums, and
yes, be scolded in new rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, peace of mind will seep back into lives.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there is the river, and misery. Everything else has
been swept
</P>
<P>
   away.

LAUNCH TO END AN ERA AT VANDENBERG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NORA K. WALLACE   
 Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ The final Athena 2 rocket to be launched
from Vandenberg Air Force Base is expected to take one of the
world's most powerful imaging satellites into orbit on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After this launch, rocket builder Lockheed Martin Co. will take
its business to Alaska, where it will use the $40 million Kodiak
Launch Complex. At Vandenberg, the company uses Space Launch
Complex-6, the former site of the West Coast space shuttle project.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, construction is set to be finished by November on the
only commercial spaceport in the United States that's not next to a
military or NASA facility. Alaska Aerospace Development Corp., a
state agency working with private corporations and universities,
has developed the site. The launch pad, on Kodiak Island's Narrow
Cape, is about 250 miles south of Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   The first launch from Kodiak is planned for September 2000, when
an Athena rocket is to carry a NASA satellite designed to study the
Earth's vegetation ``canopy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of the Alaska spaceport, Vandenberg will lose
the distinction of being the only place in the United States where
rockets are launched into polar orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Vandenberg, with its coastal location, had that role for
decades, since rockets could be launched without passing over
populated areas. Satellites put into space from Cape Canaveral go
into equatorial orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is moving operations because its lease agreement
with the Air Force expires Dec. 31, and use of the launch site has
been transferred to another company. Boeing Co., which is
developing an expendable launch vehicle, will modify SLC-6 for its
own rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That caused us to evaluate other launch sites,'' explained
Rick Malone, Lockheed Martin's director of small launch vehicles.
``We looked at three alternatives at Vandenberg and one in
Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he wouldn't discuss the financial details, Malone said
Alaska ``was significantly better from a financial point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees based at Vandenberg with the company will not move
permanently to Alaska, but will travel to Kodiak for launch times,
Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Friday's launch, the last will also be a first _ the
93-foot-tall, four-stage rocket will carry Ikonos 2, the most
capable imaging satellite ever launched by anyone but the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,600-pound Ikonos 2, built by the Denver-based Space
Imaging Co., can provide black-and-white images with a resolution
of about one meter, or a little more than three feet. Color images
with resolution of about four meters are also possible.
</P>
<P>
   That means Ikonos can create images that distinguish between a
car and a truck or show white stripes in parking lots and
crosswalks. It's not able to ``see'' individual people, but it can
distinguish groups of people.
</P>
<P>
   The information gleaned from the satellite can be used in a
variety of ways, like urban planning, environmental monitoring,
natural disaster assessment and oil and gas exploration. Images are
expected to be available for purchase about two to three months
after the launch.
</P>
<P>
   The company had planned to have such images already, but the
last Athena launch at Vandenberg, on April 27, ended up with the
Ikonos 1 dumped somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation revealed that the satellite and the rocket's
payload fairing did not separate properly, which kept the rocket
from getting enough velocity to place the spacecraft in orbit.

TENSE ENCOUNTERS AS INDONESIAN TROOPS BEGIN WITHDRAWAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ As the last elements of the Indonesian army
began their final pullout from East Timor on Thursday, smashing and
burning their barracks and headquarters behind them, international
peacekeepers engaged in their first tense encounters with armed men
in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   In one small incident after another, the peacekeepers responded
to gunshots, some of them coming from truckloads of Indonesian
soldiers, some apparently fired by irregular fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the Australian who commands the
peacekeeping operation, said that despite the increasingly tense
situation, his troops from the international force known as
Interfet had held their fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interfet has yet to engage an armed militia,'' he said,
referring to the irregular groups created and sometimes commanded
by the military. ``We are ready to do so, but at this stage the
discrimination, restraint and judgment of the troops has been
outstanding. We have been able to confiscate weapons rather than
take them off dead bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he hoped that the withdrawal of the Indonesian
troops could calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the territorial battalions _ those who are ethnic East
Timorese _ there are some very hard feelings about the referendum
outcome,'' he said, referring to the vote on Aug. 30 in which East
Timor overwhelmingly chose to break free of 24 years of Indonesian
control.
</P>
<P>
   Once these troops have left, he said, ``to a large degree some
of the complicating factors will have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, both Australian and Indonesian officers said the
next few days would be tense and crucial as the Indonesian military
hands over control of East Timor to the international forces.
</P>
<P>
   They said they expected a possible eruption of violence to mark
the moment, both as a parting gesture and possibly as an opening
salvo by defectors and irregular troops determined not to give up
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Indonesian force is scheduled to complete its
departure on Friday. Their commander is to evacuate his
headquarters on Sunday. On Thursday, President B.J. Habibie
declared an end to martial law here.
</P>
<P>
   Finally defeated in their long war to subdue East Timor and
humiliated by the arrival of foreign troops to clean up the mess
they have made, the Indonesian forces sent their parting message
through vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   With few large buildings left intact in this tiny seaside city,
soldiers loaded up their transport trucks with furniture and other
spoils, then set their buildings on fire. Columns of smoke rose
above the city.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. S. Ahmad, who commands one of the last units to leave,
said the prevailing attitude _ in effect, the policy, of the
departing troops was, ``We're not going to leave anything for those
idiots to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that ``all hell will break loose'' in the coming
days. Deserters who have decided to fight on here, he said, ``will
leave something for the people to remember.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Given their small numbers and given the scattered and dangerous
nature of the armed groups they faced, the 3,000 peacekeepers who
have arrived so far have moved carefully to secure a few key areas
and _ apart from helicopter reconnaissance _ have not yet ventured
beyond the city.
</P>
<P>
   An initial contingent of 120 troops has secured the airport in
the eastern town of Baucau because of its strategic location as an
entry port for supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, young men, some of them concealing weapons, roam the
mostly empty streets. Truck convoys of soldiers _ many wearing
bandanas as head scarves in the red and white colors of the
Indonesian flag _ also travel the city, staring coldly at the
Australian troops they pass.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Australian troopers they passed Thursday, who gave
his name only as Chris, sat with his rifle across his knees at his
post outside the fence at the eastern end of the port.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a fire fight and, I hate to admit it, but
I'm looking forward to it,'' he said. ``If any of them draws a
weapon on me, I'll warn them to put it down, and if they don't,
I'll just cap them.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a half dozen young men, one carrying a club,
lounged nearby on a couch that had found its way somehow to the
beach front beside the fence around the port. ``They seem
friendly,'' the trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   When the convoy of territorial troops drove slowly by, he waved
a greeting. They stared back at him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the sporadic shooting Thursday and the possibility
of attacks on the troops, the soldier answered: ``These guys
haven't got a chance. We've got APCs that can chase down a
motorbike; you should see how fast those things can go.''
</P>
<P>
   The APCs, or armored personnel carriers, swish through the
streets of the mostly empty city on their eight sets of rubber
tires, their cockpit machine guns swinging slowly from side to
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if anybody tries anything,'' the trooper said, with the
confidence of a newly arrived soldier, ``you just take a look at
those ships out there. They can blow away half the city.''
</P>
<P>
   His commanders were more circumspect in their assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Cosgrove said that his troops were moving in careful stages and
that they were not yet ready to support large-scale relief efforts
to the hundreds of thousands of people who are in urgent need of
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take months rather than weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials gave few details about the shooting incidents
Thursday. Most were in the general area of the port, Cosgrove said.
</P>
<P>
   One incident witnessed by reporters illustrated the tensions and
emotions of this moment of military transition.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a report that shots had been fired, two jeeploads
of British troops burst into an Indonesian military barracks, only
to find the soldiers smashing and looting their own living
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   As the British withdrew, the Indonesian soldiers followed them
angrily, leveling their guns at them. Driving away in their armored
jeeps, the British returned the gesture with their mounted machine
guns.

VALENTIS FILE SUIT VS. FELLOW PROMOTER ARUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bob Arum and the Valenti family have been in the fight
business for 20 years. Now they're just in a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Al Valenti, keepers of the flame of a family boxing
business that dates in New England fight circles to 1928, filed
suit Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court against one of boxing's
biggest promoters and his company, Top Rank, claiming Arum and his
associates bilked the Valentis out of thousands of dollars in fees
while refusing to share any profits or income from 17 fights
involving Malden middleweight Dana Rosenblatt between 1993 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Arum's involvement with Goodwin A.C. dates to 1979, when he
became partners with Rip Valenti, a legendary New England promoter,
to foster the career of Marvelous Marvin Hagler. Together Arum and
Valenti made millions as Hagler grew into one of the finest
middleweights in boxing history. That relationship culminated when
the Valentis earned well over a million dollars for Hagler's fights
with Roberto Duran, Thomas Hearns, and Ray Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Valentis allege, they ``introduced . . . Rosenblatt
to Top Rank and continued to develop his career in partnership with
Arum.'' However, the Valentis' suit claims they were never paid any
fee or promotional share even after Rosenblatt's fight with Vinny
Pazienza grossed more than $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arum claimed that fight not only made no profit but actually
took a $100,000 loss, a position the Valentis vigorously dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Arum of the '80s,'' said Fred Valenti, son of
Rip and father of Al. ``The suit is justified because Bob never
honored our agreement. We delivered Rosenblatt, and he ignored us
when it came time to settle business matters. It's a sad day when
we have to take legal action against a guy like Bob, who we trusted
and worked with for such a long period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valentis' attorney, Don Dimayo of Somerville, said Arum
would be served no later than Friday at his offices in Las Vegas.
The younger Valenti, who is executive director of USA Boxing New
England, an arm of amateur boxing's nationwide body, added that the
suit involves not only the long-standing dispute between his family
and Arum over the profitability of the Rosenblatt-Pazienza fight
but also 16 other Rosenblatt bouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not paid a nickel by our partner, Top Rank,'' Al
Valenti said. ``Before Dana fought Frank Savannah in the last
boxing show at the old Garden, Bob said in front of many witnesses,
`We're co-promoters. It's like the old days.' If we were
co-promoters, where's the money?
</P>
<P>
   ``We never received one check from Top Rank or Bob Arum to
Goodwin A.C., but there have been many written by us to Top Rank.
In 17 events, they cannot produce one Top Rank check that went to
us. We've asked for over 100 documents _ contracts for site fees,
ad deals, network deals, all things that involved fight cards Dana
was on. Not a nickel were we ever paid by Bob Arum or Top Rank. He
thought we'd go away. He was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the suit surpised Arum. ``I don't know what the hell
they're talking about,'' he said from Top Rank's offices in Las
Vegas. ``I haven't gotten one call, not one. Not one letter.
Usually if somebody sues somebody, they send a letter. I haven't
talked to these people in years. It's a really silly, silly, silly
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally absurd. I had a great score on a fight Sept. 18.
It's a wonder they're not asking for a piece of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been one letter, one phone call asking for
anything. Since when are they my co-promoters? Half those fights, I
lost money on. Maybe I should sue them. Yeah, that's an idea. I
agree, they're my co-promoters, let them pay me the money I lost on
the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a rematch of the 1996 fight between Rosenblatt
and Pazienza that spurred the suit was announced Wednesday at
Foxwoods for Nov. 5. Neither Goodwin A.C. or Top Rank is serving as
the promoter.

KASHMIR SEPARATISTS STOPPED BY INDIA ON WAY TO THE U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Indian immigration authorities Thursday
prevented leaders of an alliance of Kashmiri separatist groups from
leaving the airport here for New York, where they had planned to
seek support for their cause at the United Nations, alliance
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance, the All Parties Freedom Conference, is an umbrella
organization of 24 Kashmiri separatist groups.
</P>
<P>
   It has been advocating that the people of Kashmir, the lone
state in predominantly Hindu India that has a Muslim majority,
boycott the national elections that end on Oct. 3 as a protest
against the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   One leader who was stopped at the airport, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq,
has maintained that the status of Kashmir is not a territorial
dispute between India and Pakistan, but a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmiri people should have the right, by vote, to decide
whether to be independent, join India or join Muslim Pakistan, he
has said.
</P>
<P>
   Farooq has traveled before to the United States and met American
officials in the hope that the Washington would intervene in the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Farooq and Maulana Mohammad Abbas Ansari, executive council
members of the conference, had checked their luggage and received
their boarding passes when immigration authorities stopped them and
took their passports and tickets, conference officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They were planning to attend the annual meeting of the
Organization of Islamic Conference, as well as make their case at
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Authorities told them that the Home Ministry had given orders
that they not be allowed to leave the country,'' said A.M. Banday,
bureau chief of the Delhi office of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the government said she had not been informed
about the case. Officials in the Foreign and Interior Ministries
would not comment to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The last few weeks have been tumultuous in Kashmir. Militant
groups have been implicated in the assassination of a Hindu
nationalist parliamentary candidate, as well as in many attacks on
soldiers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmiri independence leaders and experts on the region say the
fear of violence, as well as the Kashmiri people's disillusionment
with Indian government have contributed to the low turnout in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout has been the lowest anywhere in India. In the summer
capital, Srinagar, 15 percent of the people voted. In another
parliamentary constituency, the turnout was 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the turnout has been 58 percent.

ALL EYES ARE ON _ TOM LEHMAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ladies and gentleman, on the first tee, by
popular demand, Sergio Garcia vs. Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Wild applause. Wild, wild applause. Teenagers are screaming and
everyone is yelling, ``You da man!'' Dreams of 400-yard drives
dance in the heads of those in the first 20 rows of the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   If this were the final round of the Masters, it would be great
theater. But it isn't. It's a Ryder Cup foursomes match, so may we
introduce the key man here? No disrespect to Woods, but his name is
Tom Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea about Lehman's makeup, consider that as a Ryder
Cup rookie in 1995 he was chosen to lead off, paired with Corey
Pavin. It was a decision made by none other than Lanny Wadkins, the
quintessential match-play, nerves-of-steel man. Lehman and Pavin
won.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman also went first in singles that fateful Sunday at Oak
Hill and was unflappable against everything Seve Ballesteros tossed
at him _ chip-ins, long putts, needle-threaders through trees, even
a stare-down over a minor rules issue. Lehman won, 4 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a leader,'' Ben Crenshaw was saying Tuesday. ``He is a
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a surprised leader. ``I hadn't played with Tiger at all
in the practice rounds,'' said Lehman. ``I thought I'd probably be
paired with Davis (Love) or Phil (Mickelson), and there, voila,
Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's complaining. ``It's a good pairing,'' said Lehman.
``I like it. Wouldn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA of America and television certainly are salivating.
Right off the bat, at 7:45 a.m. Friday, in the second foursomes
match of the 1999 Ryder Cup, the marquee matchup many had dreamed
of. Just keep in mind: The young stars will stand over only half
the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and Jesper Parnevik will also be part of what promises to
be an entertaining match. There is a delightful mix of power,
finesse, and personality to keep things lively.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the chance it could get one-sided in the
Americans' favor because in foursomes there is one cardinal rule:
Reach the green in regulation. That's something Woods (69.2 percent
of his holes, ranking fourth on the Tour) and Lehman (67.7, 10th)
do exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik is one of the game's great ball-strikers, though the
Swede ranks just 89th (63.6) in hitting greens. And while Garcia
has made headlines for hitting greens from behind trees and from
underneath branches, that makes for excitement but is a poor
foursomes strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Only Garcia has never played in a Ryder Cup, and the young
Spaniard has proven himself as a player who won't crack in the heat
of battle. (You have not forgotten that stirring finish at the PGA
Championship last month, have you?) Parnevik was involved in
foursomes matches against Lehman (with Mickelson) and Woods (with
Justin Leonard) at Valderrama in 1997. His side earned halves in
each.
</P>
<P>
   But in any match that involves Woods, the trump card is, well,
Woods. The talent is unquestioned, the drive to win intense. So
when it was announced that he was going right up against Garcia,
there was a feeling he would have elected to skip the Opening
Ceremonies and tee off right then, had he been given the choice.
</P>
<P>
   What did he think of the pairing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' said Woods, flashing a grin as he sat in a cart driven
by assistant captain Bruce Lietzke. They were off to the driving
range where Woods would probably put another coat of polish on a
game that takes center stage this morning. There's quite a cast of
supporting characters, too.

PRACTICE MAKES WESTWOOD-CLARK CHOICE EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ There is no truth to the theory that European
captain Mark James paired Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke in this
morning's final Ryder Cup foursomes match because it is impossible
to separate them.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a logical assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that if Westwood and Clarke aren't with their wives,
you'll find them with each other. Along the European PGA Tour
circuit, they travel together, practice together, just plain hang
out together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both like to have a laugh,'' said Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Clarke, of Northern Ireland, and Englishman Westwood will
be involved in deadly serious business when they take on Jeff
Maggert and Hal Sutton, a couple of dogged pluggers who basically
willed their way onto this year's US team.
</P>
<P>
   But James insisted Thursday that he wasn't employing the buddy
system in this match. ``It's not so much that they're best friends,
but they can play well together,'' said the captain. ``And they're
comfortable playing with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   They proved that during a practice round Tuesday in a nine-hole
foursomes match against Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie. Clarke
and Westwood racked up five birdies, four on the last five holes,
for a 3-up victory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, James was asked whether there was any long-term
significance to the practice partnership. ``You mean any more
significant than the fact that they actually were playing together
in foursomes?'' responded James with typical champagne-dry wit.
``No more than that, no. Do you think maybe I was pairing them
together to mislead you? Pull a complete pranker on the press? I'm
dealing with some devious people here.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing deceiving about Westwood's and Clarke's records.
Westwood won seven tournaments in five countries in 1998, including
the PGA Tour stop in New Orleans, and was named European Player of
the Year. He's added three wins this season and ranks second on the
European money list. He also has a salutary effect on Clarke, who
has chalked up a European win in each of the last two years but
recently has complained about his frame of mind, to which Westwood
claims to have the only key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren said he's just fine,'' said James. ``And Lee is
certianly a good partner for him. And they're feeling very
comfortable at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   They also may be eager to deliver a comeuppance. Maggert created
a bit of a stir in the European camp earlier this week when he
proclaimed the Americans the world's 12 best players, an opinion
belied by the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to discuss what burden being heavily favored might place
on the United States, Westwood _ who is ranked fifth, 11 spots
haead of Maggert _ said, ``Well, they must be under pressure, being
the world's 12 best players, mustn't they, according to
themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert generally doesn't make such an impact. He's a fringe
player who has eked his way onto the last three Ryder teams as
either the ninth or last of the 10 automatic qualifiers and has won
only twice in 10 years on the PGA Tour. But one of those wins was
at this year's Andersen Consulting World Match Play Championship,
which should bode well for him in this weekend's format. It earned
him $1 million and gave him enough of a cushion to hold off Bob
Estes for the last guaranteed spot.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton is a reborn _ or at least rededicated _ force, a onetime
prodigy who virtually vanished for a decade but has won three times
in the last two years, including the Canadian Open two weeks ago,
to earn his third Ryder berth after a 12-year hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks he's a good fit with Maggert, beyond the common
denominator of experience in struggling. ``We both drive the ball
fairly straight,'' said Sutton, echoing the sentiments of US
captain Ben Crenshaw in explaining the pairing, ``so we're going to
be in the game most of the time. The second thing is that we both
hit the same irons.''
</P>
<P>
   They hope that will drive a wedge through ClarkeWestwood, who
are so close that they even defy hyphenation.

`NOW AND AGAIN' IS TRIUMPH FROM CREATOR OF `MOONLIGHTING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a show described as an action-comedy-drama-romance, Glenn
Gordon Caron may be setting himself up for failure. But the
premiere of ``Now and Again'' is exactly as advertised: dramatic,
funny, poignant, stunning and bold.
</P>
<P>
   Caron, the creator of ``Moonlighting'' in the mid-'80s, knows
something about failing to meet expectations. Though an audience
favorite, ``Moonlighting'' folded after four seasons peppered with
missed deadlines and disagreements between Caron and co-star Cybill
Shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   Caron has spent most of the past decade doing films. He says Les
Moonves, president of CBS Television, invited him to give TV
another try, promising Caron that he could do whatever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   That turns out to be ``Now and Again,'' a brave attempt to make
a TV show that flouts TV convention. It truly is a little bit of
everything, centering on a government plan to manufacture
superhuman agents for tasks that mere mortals are loath to
undertake. The only thing the feds haven't mastered is the brain
thing. So, when a middle-aged insurance executive dies in a
horrible accident, the government preserves his brain and places it
in the strapping body of one of its new agents. The sole condition
placed on him is that he have no contact with people from his
previous life.
</P>
<P>
   With grace and power, John Goodman sets the tone beautifully
tonight as Michael Wiseman, loyal employee of a soulless insurance
monolith. All his life he worked within the system only to have his
family victimized by it upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's one-time-only performance is matched elegantly by
Margaret Colin as his widow, Lisa, who doesn't accept that her
husband is gone. She's right, of course. His brain is now in the
body of a hunky 26-year-old specimen played pleasantly by Eric
Close.
</P>
<P>
   While Michael Wiseman gets used to his new body and his new boss
_ the enigmatic Dr. Theodore Morris (Dennis Haysbert) _ his wife is
trying to collect Wiseman's life insurance and a terrorist is
causing widespread panic around the globe by placing deadly eggs in
public places.
</P>
<P>
   The disparate story lines don't quite merge in Friday's episode,
which is the way Caron wants it. He says the connection between
Wiseman and the Egg Man won't be completely known until the third
episode, because ``the predictability of television is one of the
things that makes it difficult to get passionate about some of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Now and Again,'' Caron seems to have concocted an effective
antidote.
</P>
<P>
   Now and Again. One-hour drama about a middle-aged man whose
brain is preserved after his death in the body of a superhuman
government agent. Starring Eric Close, Dennis Haysbert, Margaret
Colin, Heather Matarazzo and Gerrit Graham, with a special
appearance by John Goodman. Season premiere Friday night on CBS.
Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-

NFL MATCHUPS: WEEK 3 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (1-1) at Green Bay (1-1) (Sunday 4 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: There will be a lot of points in this
game. The two teams have averaged 52.5 in their last eight
meetings. There are stars at every turn: Moss, Cunningham, and
Favre. The only thing missing is defense. The scoreboards will need
a timeout to rest. Coach Denny Green, one of the smartest in the
business, will soon start to take complete control of the offense
if it continues to struggle. In fact, that could happen this week
against the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 37-30
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (0-2) at St. Louis (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Falcons got a taste of what life is like
without two of their stars, Jamal Anderson and Chris Chandler.
Anderson is done for the season with a knee injury and Chandler's
hamstring makes him questionable for this week. The Rams would
usually be considered an easy patsy, even for a rundown Falcons
squad. But St. Louis might be turning the corner this year, as
evidenced by the performance of the former NFL Europe quarterback
Kurt Warner, who passed for over 300 yards against Baltimore last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 30-23
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (0-2) at Carolina (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   The worst game of the week, featuring two teams with mediocre
offenses and terrible defenses. The Panthers get the advantage
because Coach George Seifert is 3-0 against the Bengals. The only
interesting aspect is the quarterback situation for Cincinnati. The
rookie Akili Smith gets the start.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 14-10
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (0-2) at Baltimore (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens made the smart move in benching Scott Mitchell.
Quarterback Stoney Case is not a bad player _ he passed for 130
yards and two touchdowns against Pittsburgh. One of these days the
Browns will win a game, just not this week. Cleveland gives up too
much on defense, and Tim Couch, their rookie starting quarterback,
is too inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 25-12
</P>
<P>
   Denver (0-2) at Tampa Bay (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Denver running back Terrell Davis denied this week he is
injured, but after the Miami game two weeks ago, he had a lump on
the back of his neck the size of a strawberry, caused after a nasty
hit by linebacker Zach Thomas. So Davis is at the very least
playing sore.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Broncos are having a nightmare year. It is
because teams are putting seven and eight men on the line of
scrimmage to stop Davis and Brian Griese has not been able to take
advantage of single-coverage in the secondary. The salvation for
Denver is two words: Trent Dilfer. He makes the game close.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 17-14
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (2-0) at Kansas City (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   The most overused phrase in Detroit is ``Barry Who?'' As in
Barry Sanders. And not being missed very much, apparently. The
reason is Coach Bobby Ross, free of trying to get Sanders the ball
every carry, has made Charlie Batch, the athletic quarterback, the
focal point of the offense. He has responded with 36.2 yards per
touchdown pass. Batch is the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 28-20
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (0-2) at Buffalo (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of meaningless stats floating around
football: Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb was 19-5 in his college
career when starting games in New York state. Yikes. If that is
what the Eagles are resorting to for motivation, no wonder they are
in for a long day against Buffalo. Well, Doug Flutie is 8-4 as a
starter, and he has a pretty good record in New York as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 16-9
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (1-1) at Pittsburgh (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Kordell Stewart seems to have found some sort of
groove. His 89.7 quarterback rating is one of his best in years,
and he has been able to reach that mark because the coaching staff
does not force him to become a drop-back passer on every play. The
result is the Steelers are averaging 367 yards a game of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 21-20
</P>
<P>
   Washington (1-1) at Jets (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   Last week Coach Bill Parcells gave the Jets a tongue-lashing.
While the Jets are 0-2 and quarterback Rick Mirer is struggling,
there is a feeling that Parcells has some trick up his sleeve to
turn the season around. He is too much of a fighter _ and schemer _
to let the season go up in smoke without a fight. And the Redskins
won't score 50 points again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 20-19
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (1-1) at San Diego (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis, by blowing a late game lead against New England
last week, showed that old habits are hard to break. It will take
time to turn the Colts franchise around. Still, quarterback Peyton
Manning, playing on a high level, is good enough to beat the
Chargers. But Indianapolis will have to do it through the air.
Against the Bengals last week, San Diego allowed only 47 yards on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 28-17
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (2-0) at Jacksonville (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   The visiting team has won 7 of the past 8 meetings, and all
eight games have been decided by eight points or less. The game
will indeed be close, but the visitors this time will lose. The
defensive coordinator Dom Capers will not let Neil O'Donnell beat
him, and O'Donnell, starting in place of the injured Steve McNair
(back), always has a difficult time putting together good
back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 25-10
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (1-1) at Oakland (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have still not allowed a rushing touchdown this
season. Their defense has two of the game's young stars in
defensive lineman Russell Maryland and cornerback Charles Woodson.
Oakland has an AFC-high 9 sacks and a big reason why is because
whichever player Woodson locks up on rarely gets open. Offensively
the Bears have no one on offense that will cause Woodson to break a
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-7
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Giants (1-1) at New England (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are hoping that the 50 points they gave up to
Washington last week was an isolated situation, nothing more than a
bad dream. Out of the nightmare emerges some help, because
cornerback Jason Sehorn should return this week even though his
hamstring is still sore. The secondary will need to play well
because wide receiver Terry Glenn is playing great, with 7 catches
for 122 yards last week against the Colts. New England is bound to
have one bad game in the early part of the season, and this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 24-23
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (1-1) at Arizona (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Last season Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer was being called
the next Joe Montana. Now he is struggling as teams adapt to his
style of play and he plays through an injured thumb. But Plummer
should rebound this week against a 49ers defense that barely has a
pulse.

   After a young couple brought their new baby home, the wife

</P>

   `I'm busy,' he said, `I'll do the next one.`
</P>
<P>
   The next time came around and she asked again.

PROTESTS GREET NEW INDONESIAN SECURITY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also TIMOR-RDP)  
(lh) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a hastily arranged vote just before it
was to go into recess, Indonesia's Parliament Thursday approved a
security law that opponents say could grant strong new powers to
the military.
</P>
<P>
   The approval, which was expected, unleashed a surge of protests
in Jakarta and other cities, some of which turned violent. More
than 5,000 students here tried to march to Parliament, clashing
with riot policemen and soldiers who fired plastic bullets and tear
gas to turn them back.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ``Reformasi!'' the rallying cry of Indonesia's
democracy movement, the students hurled stones and fire bombs as
the police advanced with truncheons and water-cannon trucks. About
30 people were wounded by plastic bullets and tear gas, witnesses
told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Protests also broke out in Indonesia's second-largest city,
Surabaya. Witnesses told Reuters that two students were seriously
wounded when 1,000 people clashed with policemen who were swinging
batons and firing tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   The battles continued well into the night, with students hurling
fire bombs at riot policemen on a major highway in front of the
University of Atma Jaya. The protest paralyzed traffic in the
central Jakarta for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will allow Indonesia's president to declare a state
of emergency in a province if it is requested by the local governor
or legislature. Such a decision requires ratification by
Parliament, but the president is not required to consult as many
parties as under the existing 1959 law.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's top military commander, Gen. Wiranto, defended the
new law as being ``in line with democracy and human rights.'' As
defense secretary, he introduced the legislation and helped push it
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is not for the need of government, the national
police or Indonesian soldiers,'' Wiranto said. ``It is for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends it was necessary to update the law,
particularly at a time when it is facing violent unrest in East
Timor and other provinces. In an odd bit of timing, the law was
approved on the same day that Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie,
lifted martial law in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The government noted that the bill had been diluted from its
original form. For instance, it no longer allows the military to
restrict the news media during a state of emergency. Indonesia's
press has regained its voice in the last 18 months, after years of
repression under the former president, Suharto, who was forced from
office last year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not so much the content of the law as the manner of its
passage that has angered people. Parliament is scheduled to go into
recess on Friday, and is to be replaced on Oct. 1 by a new
legislature elected in the country's first genuinely multiparty
ballot, last June.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Wiranto and Habibie rammed the bill through in an
effort to shore up the government as political change sweeps
through the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reflection of how weak the government is,'' said Salim
Said, a military expert. ``It shows how much the Habibie government
is like the Suharto government, always ready to use force.''
</P>
<P>
   Said said the new law was less severe in some respects than the
1959 law, which was drafted at a time when Indonesia was riven by
conflict. For instance, the old law did not require the president
to obtain the consent of the House of Representatives before
imposing a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Said questioned why the military would push for the law
now, when it is trying to redefine its role in Indonesian life. The
army has accepted a reduction in its number of seats in Parliament,
and Wiranto has been removing military officers from key political
posts in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you that our military is not politically well
advised,'' Said said. ``Whatever they do, the students won't trust
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the military had no allies on the streets Thursday.
Students goaded the riot police and soldiers by throwing stones and
bottles while chanting: ``We won our independence! now we must stay
independent!''
</P>
<P>
   Pamphlets scattered on the street warned: ``If this law is
approved, then the democracy we have struggled for is dead. The
military can take control of the country anytime it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, at least, the police and soldiers seemed generally
in control of the situation. At one point, a police commander could
be heard ordering his troops: ``Don't shoot. Don't throw back the
stones.''
</P>
<P>
   Street demonstrations are a daily ritual in Jakarta, but the
unrest has picked up markedly since an international military force
arrived in East Timor earlier this week. Now, on most days,
demonstrators can be found in front of Parliament, at the
Australian Embassy and at the offices of the United Nations.

`COLD FEET': SAPPY IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On first blush, ``Cold Feet'' looked like a sappy loser. After
recasting one of the roles, the producers reshot the pilot episode
and, on second blush, ``Cold Feet'' still looks like a sappy loser.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so did ``Providence,'' which promptly became a hit
for NBC last season after outpacing Vermont in sap production. So,
no predictions here. ``Cold Feet'' may be sappy, but it also may be
what America wants.
</P>
<P>
   Mannered, artificial and silly, like the second season of ``Ally
McBeal,'' ``Cold Feet'' zeroes in on three couples, two of them
married, the third just getting started in the relationship tango.
One of the married couples has a child, the other married couple is
expecting, the unmarried couple is just fooling around and not even
sure if they are a couple. But they do have the best chemistry.
That is, Jean Louisa Kelly and David Sutcliffe, as Shelley Sullivan
and Adam Williams, seem right for each other.
</P>
<P>
   The others _ Alicia Coppola with Anthony Starke, Dina Spybey
with William Keane _ don't quite fit. Maybe that's intentional. You
know, the old married-but-not-necessarily-compatible gambit. Or
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in Vancouver, B.C., but set in Seattle, ``Cold Feet'' is an
Americanization of a British series. Friday's premiere has only one
overt Seattle reference _ the Crocodile Cafe in Belltown _ but
future episodes will include scenes filmed during a recent shooting
foray into Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That may help give ``Cold Feet'' the sense of place that many
viewers find endearing in ``Providence.'' But without better
writing and more imaginative storytelling, ``Cold Feet'' will
continue to look like a lighthearted daytime soap opera lost on the
prime-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it's in the slot formerly occupied by ``Homicide: Life on
the Street.'' Anyone tuning to NBC for ``Homicide''-like quality at
that hour on Fridays is in for a real shock.
</P>
<P>
   Cold Feet. One-hour comedy about three couples in various stages
of commitment. Starring Jean Louisa Kelly, David Sutcliffe, Dina
Sypbey, William Keane, Alicia Coppola and Anthony Starke. Season
premiere Friday on NBC. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

IT'S STRENGTH VS. STRENGTH IN MATCH 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Call it captain's intuition. Ben Crenshaw
didn't know if Colin Montgomerie would be playing in this morning's
first pairing for the Europeans, but he felt that Euro captain Mark
James would want his best player on the course first.
</P>
<P>
   So Crenshaw countered with his strength _ maybe not his best
player but arguably his strongest team in David Duval and Phil
Mickelson, who will square off against Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie
in this morning's first foursome.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble by James is obvious. If Lawrie and Montgomerie, who
comes into these matches a touch off his game, lose, it could start
a downward spiral for the Europeans, who come into these matches as
decided underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   And even more importantly, will Montgomerie, who has had verbal
jousts with the sure-to-be jingoistic American fans, be distracted
from the task at hand?
</P>
<P>
   James says he understands those possibilities, which is a reason
he paired players who are highly comfortable with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like the first morning,'' he said. ``Someone
doesn't play well and things change and you get swept along in a
sort of unstoppable river. But these guys were happy playing
together at the start of the week and they've reacted well
together. They're feeling good, and I see no reason to split them
up for the first morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie says not being the favorite with the crowd or the
oddsmakers doesn't bother his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the underdogs, but we're used to that and it doesn't
worry us,'' said Montgomerie, who went through his final pre-match
preparations by playing several holes alternating shots with
Lawrie. ``We've had a great preparation, and I feel that Paul and I
will make a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   James, with his usual deadpan humor, downplayed any
pyschological motive in his selections. ``There's nothing
particularly deep involved,'' he said. ``Those guys were keen to
play with each other; simple as that. And I saw no reason to split
them up on the first morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw was more analytical. ``I thought that in the first
case, David Duval and Phil Mickelson had practiced quite a bit
together, play similar games lengthwise and playing shots to the
green,'' he said. ``I've watched them play quite a lot. And I think
they're playing well. They're eager just like everyone else. I
thought that might be a good spot for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the lure of a Mickelson-Duval team is that both players
are long off the tee, which might make a couple of holes on the
front nine driveable.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a worry from the American's standpoint (although
Crenshaw dismisses the aspect), it is Duval's admitted dislike of
match play and his inexperience in Ryder Cup competition. Also of
concern is the problems Duval has been having off the tee, which
could be a big detriment in an alternate-shot match.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw acknowledged the strength of Montgomerie and Lawrie,
who is coming off an improbable victory in the British Open.
``Colin is one of the straightest players in the world, Paul
Lawrie, a fantastic season,'' said Crenshaw. ``And winning that old
Claret Jug is a wonderful thing. That would give confidence to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, the first match will set the tone for the
morning, if not the day and the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With seven rookies on the European team, Montgomerie has emerged
as the leader in the clubhouse. How he and Lawrie handle the
course, the crowd, and the competition will likely be a true
indicator of how the Europeans handle defense of a title that has
largely been theirs over the past decade.

STRAYING FROM COUNTRY'S MAIN ROAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the long and proud tradition of songs that take a meat ax to
the music business (Van Morrison is a whole subgenre by himself), a
special citation should go to the alternative country loose cannon
Robbie Fulks.
</P>
<P>
   His ``South Mouth'' album a few years back included an
uproarious and unprintable rant, suggesting an anatomical
impossibility involving the city of Nashville, that spoke for every
aspiring musician who got bumped off the prim, narrow line that
distinguishes radio-friendly, officially approved country music
from the uncharted, and largely uncommercial, universe beyond.
</P>
<P>
   There's always been an official flavor of country radio, though
not necessarily a totally homogenous one. A form that takes in
people as diverse and talented as Alan Jackson, Patty Loveless,
Vince Gill and Trisha Yearwood can't be all bad.
</P>
<P>
   But country radio, the biggest format in America, is in the
throes of a particularly lame version of one of its cyclical
creative downdrafts, churning out ever paler, if sexier, would-be
Garths and Shanias with numbing regularity.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks, the only bit of fresh air to come out of the
mainstream Nashville industrial complex in two years, are fine, but
there has to be more out there that's new and interesting _ or old
and interesting, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is. And the really maddening thing about Nashville
is that it has blundered into a particularly auspicious creative
moment and does not have a clue what to do with it. A casual
listener to a station like WFUV, the noncommercial radio station
that presents one of the most eclectic music lineups in the New
York area, probably notices that much of what gets played comes
from the Americana/roots rock/alternative country nether reaches of
Nashville and its hipper planet in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Texas alone is spawning an amazing group of barroom troubadours
like Robert Earl Keen, Jack Ingram, Charlie Robison and Bruce
Robison, who are building a rabid word-of-mouth following largely
divorced from the commercial engines of Music Row.
</P>
<P>
   And for young listeners looking for rootsy worlds beyond hip-hop
and rap, as well as boomers whose ears were shaped by the folk of
Dylan and Phil Ochs and the rock of the Byrds, the Band and, later,
Tom Petty and R.E.M., much of the most appealing and familiar music
out there these days is music from the country universe that's not
certified as radio-approved.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of ways to get bumped off the designated
big-bucks, big-label path. You can turn left, throw out the pro
forma fiddles and Eagles harmonies and become too close to rock.
You can turn right and be too country for country. You can be too
old, too fat, too impassioned, too eccentric, too obscure or not
enough of a babe or hunk.
</P>
<P>
   As the following not even remotely comprehensive sampler
indicates, all those heresies have their exemplars, most of them
displayed on small independent labels or big-label subsidiaries
like Lucky Dog, Dead Reckoning, Arista Austin, Rounder, E-Squared,
HighTone, Doolittle or Bloodshot.
</P>
<P>
   For the left turn, consider Radney Foster, who specialized in
Everly Brothers-style melodies and harmonies and made his mark in
the early '90s with perfect little radio-friendly gems like
``Nobody Wins'' and ``Just Call Me Lonesome.''
</P>
<P>
   His newest album, ``See What You Want to See'' (Arista Austin
07822-18833-2), is a little Jackson Browne and a little hick-hop,
with musicians who have worked with John Fogerty, Mark Knopfler and
the Wallflowers. There's still twang in the voice, but most of the
album is about as country as a garlic bagel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is conventional pop singer-songwriter fare, but the
best of it is genuinely exhilarating. Foster howls and moans his
way through songs about love and betrayal like a man let out of
jail, and the songs range from ``Folding Money,'' an inspired
hybrid of country and hip-hop, to a lullaby reminiscent of Paul
Simon's ``St. Judy's Comet.''
</P>
<P>
   The move seems like professional suicide. If the Nashville
audience isn't going to buy or hear this, who will? But it has more
passion and pain than anything in the mainstream country canon, and
it's a vivid reminder how emotionally constricted radio-friendly
country has become.
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing left turn is ``Glimmer'' (Mercury
314-538-888-2), the new album by Kim Richey, who wrote ``Nobody
Wins'' with Foster and has become one of Nashville's songwriters of
choice. She has never sold many records on her own but for years
has been a cult favorite and one of the truly distinctive voices in
Nashville, creating a smart, tuneful amalgam of country and
Byrds-like guitars and harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   She's back with a third album that shows there is both an upside
and a downside to emerging from the country cocoon. ``Glimmer'' is
at turns lovely, sly and urgent, and it drifts so far from
Nashville as to be pretty much untethered _ more Lilith Fair
singer-songwriter material than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Ms. Richey's self-aware, elliptical lyrics, more Ann
Beattie or Joni Mitchell than Loretta Lynn, are a reminder that she
was always an odd fit even in her corner of the Nashville
landscape. But leaving the Nashville orbit isn't all good. At times
you wish for a little more of the ancestral jangly clatter that
made her earlier albums so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   If Foster and Ms. Richey turn left and leave the reservation,
Kevin Welch and Ray Wylie Hubbard were always far too eccentric to
ever get there to start with. Welch, part of the independent,
artist-owned Dead Reckoning label, has the air of outback menace of
the evil Scott Glenn character in ``Urban Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been one of Nashville's most accomplished songwriters for
years, and ``Beneath My Wheels'' (Dead Reckoning DEAR 0014), his
newest, is a bracing blend of undefinable American musics that is
what Nashville could have become but never really wanted to be. The
first song, ``Everybody's Got to Walk,'' alternates between slashes
of slide guitar and wails of gospel, and the rest of the album
slithers between various American genres, united by Welch's dark
vision and the ghosts of musics past that filter in and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneath My Wheels'' has a haunted, spiritual, 2
a.m.-on-a-dark-highway quality. But one of the oddest spiritual
quests out there can be found on Ray Wylie Hubbard's ``Crusades of
the Restless Knights'' (Philo/Rounder 11671-1218-2). Hubbard is
best known for the 1970s gonzo cosmic-cowboy anthem ``Up Against
the Wall, Redneck Mother,'' which launched God knows how many
flying beer bottles in Jerry Jeff Walker's heyday and was as iconic
in its own world as ``Louie Louie.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since then Hubbard has kicked about in obscurity, almost doing
himself in with the usual forms of excess. He reappears here like a
grizzled truth seeker mixing Rilke, Flannery O'Connor and the Old
Testament in a blizzard of finger-picking, mandolin and slide
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all pretty. The first song, ``Crows,'' was inspired,
Hubbard says, either by a talk the Dalai Lama gave on compassion or
by something his grandfather muttered when his wife found a pint of
whisky under the floorboard of his pickup. It's a droning,
dirgelike musical hangover that all but dares the fainthearted to
stop listening right there.
</P>
<P>
   But sticking around is worth the effort, and much of the rest
plays out like a woozy tour of a redneck version of hell. ``This
River Runs Red'' in particular, a song about Hubbard's own
experience of being baptized and ``the adventures of one of my
hoodlum friends who never came back from the lost highway,'' has a
truly spooky mix of dark and ecstatic energies.
</P>
<P>
   Another way off the Nashville highway is to take the first exit
and travel the allied two-lane blacktops instead. Steve Earle is
the godfather of this generation of off-the-reservation Nashville,
and his newest album, ``The Mountain'' (E Squared 1427), with the
bluegrass nonpareils the Del McCoury Band, is more proof why.
</P>
<P>
   From the first note it crackles, cackles and honks its way
along, nimbly pulling off the feat of being bluegrass and Earle at
the same time. There are songs about trains; a song inspired by
Michael Shaara's Civil War novel, ``The Killer Angels,'' and a
dazzling duet with Iris DeMent.
</P>
<P>
   The album ends with ``Pilgrim,'' an all-star sing-along that
sounds as if it's been sung for 100 years but was written for the
funeral of the bassist Roy Huskey. If the world cared about this
kind of stuff, this album would be considered a genuine event.
</P>
<P>
   Less of an event, but also worth a listen is ``Simple Gearle''
(Gearle Records 2801), by Earle's sister Stacey Earle. It's spare,
unadorned, acoustic music that's as intimate and personal as
waiting out a thunderstorm with a stranger at an abandoned shack.
</P>
<P>
   If Earle helped invent the non-Nashville Nashville game, Jim
Lauderdale isn't far behind him in playing it these days. One of
Nashville's most admired songwriters, he has also become a
wonderfully eclectic performer, careering between raucous
honky-tonk and soulful ballads, with bows to bluegrass and Western
swing along the way.
</P>
<P>
   He's out with two albums at once. The first, ``I Feel Like
Singing Today'' (Rebel Records 1755), with Ralph Stanley and the
Clinch Mountain Boys, takes ``The Mountain'' one step further in an
alternative-county-meets-bluegrass mix that's dominated more by
Stanley's hard-core Appalachian traditionalism than by Lauderdale's
contemporary sensibilities. Lauderdale's own record, ``Onward
Through It All'' (RCA 67822-2), features songwriting collaborations
with everyone from the longtime Grateful Dead lyricist Robert
Hunter to the ubiquitous Ms. Richey, impeccable playing by the
likes of the mandolin ace David Grisman, and Lauderdale's ragged,
soulful, hyper-twang vocals.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's the problem of being too country
for country.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Williams showed last year that you can make it without
country radio. Mandy Barnett may do the same thing. She is getting
at best a nibble from radio, but her ``I've Got a Right to Cry''
(Sire 31046-2) may be the most lush, elegant retrograde country
record in years.
</P>
<P>
   She may not quite be channeling Patsy Cline, but between the
album's pedigree as the last project of the legendary producer Owen
Bradley and Ms. Barnett's early days in the Nashville revue
``Always Patsy Cline,'' it does feel like something that's wafted
in from some torchy time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   It's both gorgeous music and a reminder of how many rich veins
there are in the various traditions Nashville has embraced at one
moment or another.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's George Jones. It's the ultimate comment on
Nashville that Jones had to come close to dying to get played on
radio again _ a notion as nutty as Sinatra being shut out from an
American standards format.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Nashville could one get quite the melodrama of Jones
barely surviving the crash of his Lexus SUV, pleading guilty to
drunken driving and then getting a Country Music Award nomination
for ``Choices,'' an eerily apt lament about the drinking life he
had allegedly left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Jones's new album, ``Cold Hard Truth'' (Asylum 62368-2),
harks back to his Billy Sherrill-era classics, and half is his
version of uptempo radio-friendly contemporary country. At times
(``Our Bed of Roses'') it reminds you how close to bathos even the
best of country can come.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones's voice is still a wonder, and at least two songs,
``Choices'' and ``Cold Hard Truth,'' are as affecting as country
ever gets. At 67, he's no hunk, but ``Cold Hard Truth'' is a
reminder that there's nothing like the real deal.

U.S. LAUNCHES GLOBAL INITIATIVE IN BID TO STOP MONEY LAUNDERING 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government launched a global initiative
Thursday to crack down on drug dealers, arms traders and corrupt
politicians who try to hide their gains in legitimate bank accounts
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury and Justice departments, in an attempt to stop
``money laundering,'' pledged to intensify efforts to uncover
financial deposits by criminals and to encourage foreign countries
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Treasury Department officials said the government
might use its leverage with international lending institutions to
raise rates for nations who fail to adopt and enforce
anti-laundering laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a money-laundering scheme, a person seeks to disguise illegal
proceeds by putting them into the stream of legitimate finance and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in announcing its National
Money-Laundering Strategy, did not say how much illegally received
money is funneled through legitimate businesses but said the
international total runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is cut out for us,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said of the government's effort. ``We will go forward with
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno called money laundering a ``very
sophisticated crime'' that undermines the integrity of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-laundering laws target primarily drug dealers and criminal
organizations. The Clinton administration said it will propose
legislation that would also target international arms dealers and
corrupt foreign officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa and a frequent administration
critic, hailed the government's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The federal initiative will ``hit the traffickers where it will
hurt the most'' by eliminating the ability of drug dealers to hide
their illegal revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to crack down on money laundering comes amid
allegations that Russian mobsters have channeled $10 billion
through the Bank of New York. But Justice and Treasury department
officials said their investigation of the United States' 15th
largest bank had nothing to do with their decision to release the
anti-money laundering strategy, which they said has been in the
works for many months.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today reported Thursday that as many as 10 banks might have
been involved in the alleged Russian laundering scheme. Federal
law-enforcement officials, however, declined to comment on what
they called a pending investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Under its initiative, the Clinton administration said it will
enlist the private sector's help by requiring casinos and brokerage
houses to report cash transactions from suspicious customers and
clients. The government also said it will focus its law-enforcement
efforts on geographic regions, banks and other industries it deems
vulnerable to money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials were not specific about what areas it now
believes are susceptible to laundering. But they said the
government would weigh heavily such factors as whether a region is
a key transportation hub with international ports, airports, banks
and other businesses easily accessible to both foreign and domestic
criminals.

MARS MISSIONS HAVE HISTORY OF FAILING _ AND SUCCEEDING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The temperature on its rocky surface is below zero. At its
farthest point in orbit, it is 249 million miles from Earth. And,
so far as anyone knows, there isn't a McDonalds restaurant on the
place.
</P>
<P>
   And yet we keep trying to get there. Thirty times in the past 40
years, man has sent a spacecraft to Mars and 19 of those missions
have failed, the latest Thursday when the $125 million Mars Climate
Orbiter was presumed lost while preparing for a landing on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   The casual observer could be forgiven for wondering why, if it
is so obviously difficult and there doesn't appear to be much there
anyway, we keep spending the money on missions to Mars that have a
63 percent chance of failing.
</P>
<P>
   To those who have a passion for the Red Planet, though, that
would be like questioning the wisdom of exploration that led to the
discovery of the New World 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The example I use is to imagine myself in 16th-century
England, or Spain or Portugal going out and exploring other
worlds,'' said Louis Friedman, executive director and co-founder
with the late astronomer Carl Sagan of The Planetary Society. ``The
ships they used had failures and major problems. The road of
oceanic and continental exploration on Earth is filled with
failures and setbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   For Friedman, it is the ``trying,'' the act of exploration
itself, that is most valuable, not necessarily the data that is
collected. The missions that have been successful _ the 1997 Mars
Pathfinder mission is a notable example _ have provided information
about Mars that will take years to digest, but the major lessons
were learned from the mission itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The payoff is what these missions do for the advancement of
civilization,'' Friedman said. ``Getting the data from Mars is the
gravy. But when it comes down to the advancement of civilization,
it is the process of getting there that advances our
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the planets, it is toward Mars that we have most often
aimed our space ships, and we have done so with a host of different
objectives, but only one reason. Of all the planets in our solar
system, Mars is the most like ours. If there is, or was, other life
in our solar system, Mars, scientists say, holds the clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relation to the evolution of our life and species makes
it special,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mars Climate Orbiter was the first of two spacecraft due on Mars
this year to study the planet's weather and to look for signs of
water. Preliminary indications are that the orbiter approached the
planet's surface about 50 miles closer than it should have and
either burned up in the atmosphere or broke into pieces. Not bad,
after a 10 month, remote-controlled journey through space; close
enough, in the minds of some, to be called a success, not a
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The returns for our efforts at this stage come through our
understanding of Mars, which has such a close relationship with out
planet,'' said David Black, director of the Houston-based Lunar and
Planetary Institute. ``We're getting far, far more information from
Mars than just data. The payoff is not in data bits, but in
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   How much is this knowledge worth? For perspective, Black said,
consider this: The Mars Climate Orbiter cost $125 million; five
Hollywood movies this year have so far each grossed more than that
at the box office.

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ The destruction from the earthquake on Tuesday
and its aftershocks will significantly reduce Taiwan's economic
growth for 1999, government officials said Thursday. And they
warned that repairing the many damaged buildings, highways, power
generators and other structures could take years.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still too early to determine the extent of the
damage, some officials have used figures as high as $5 billion to
$10 billion as the total cost of reconstruction and compensating
victims. If the preliminary estimates stand, the quake, with a
magnitude of 7.6, would be one of Asia's costliest natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government tally Thursday evening, more than
2,100 people were killed and at least 7,800 injured, and 360 were
listed as missing or thought to be trapped in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Finance officials said that the government had ample money to
rebuild the shattered public works and that the quake would have
few long-term effects on the economy, which had been rebounding
this year after a sharp slowdown in the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this year, the earthquake will have a negative effect on
the economy, and we will fall short of our growth targets,'' said
Chi Schive, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, which had forecast a 5.74 percent growth rate for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists are predicting that the quake, which caused
widespread water and power failures that disrupted semiconductor
production and temporarily shut down many businesses, will limit
economic expansion to a range from 5.3 to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is a leading manufacturer of semiconductors and maker of
personal computer equipment, with a combined annual production of
$40 billion. A protracted disruption in production could have major
effects on foreign markets, driving up the prices of computer chips
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Hsinchu Science Park, where 25 computer-chip factories
produce 90 percent of the semiconductors made on the island, has
been idle since the quake knocked out power generators and
substations. Industry analysts estimate that Taiwanese chip makers
are losing $60 million in revenues each day they are not producing.
Full power is not expected to return to Hsinchu until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Chi said any production slowdown caused by the quake would
probably be offset next year by the positive effects of the
government's spending on reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't count the loss of human life and social disorder,
we will come through this natural disaster in pretty decent
shape,'' Chi said. ``There will be a balancing out.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei, Richard Vuylsteke, expressed confidence that Taiwan would
recover quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This society is very resourceful, and people here are willing
to take the back roads if the major highways are closed,''
Vuylsteke said. ``I am optimistic that major businesses will not be
seriously effected by the earthquake and that in the moderate term
the real-cost outlays will come from major repairs to highways and
roads, which Taiwan has the resources to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the major industries were largely unscathed, as major
manufacturing cities like Taipei and Hsinchu, just south of the
capital, were spared significant damage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Peter Kurz, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in Taipei, said plans
to spend heavily on public works would be a boon to industries like
cement and steel, sectors that will be used in constructing roads,
bridges and housing.
</P>
<P>
   The quake has devastated public works, and officials said
rebuilding would be long and laborious, probably spanning years.
Engineers have to go back to the drawing board to determine how
best to reinforce structures, road and bridges to survive possibly
more powerful quakes.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of buildings have been damaged, along with
parts of 25 roads and highways, five so seriously that the
government is uncertain when they will reopen. Five major bridges
that link communities to main highways also collapsed and have to
be rebuilt. Road repairs in Taichung and Nantou Counties, near the
epicenter, are expected to take months, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   The port of Taichung, one of four international ports here, was
seriously damaged, with five wharfs inoperable. Officials estimate
that it will take at least two years to return to full operations.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, roads, bridges, and buildings will be relocated
away from fault lines or they will simply not be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   The quake and its continuing aftershocks caused huge cracks at
one of the nation's largest dams, at the Sun Moon Lake Reservoir,
where water was emptied as a precaution. Workers also found
structural damage at the Nantou County dam complex.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the damage estimates were likely to change
because they were still surveying the devastation and powerful
aftershocks were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   To assist earthquake victims and their families, the government
has said it will pay survivors $15,625 for each member killed by
the quake. Seriously injured individuals will receive $6,250, and
the government will pay $6,250 for each collapsed house and half
that for each partly collapsed house. The money will come from the
emergency budget for natural disasters, which is typically used to
help typhoon victims. Officials said the fund had $20 billion.

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again, Arizona Sen. John McCain has got it
right. This guy has guts.
</P>
<P>
   The more we see of the senator, the more we can understand how
he found the strength to stand up to his North Vietnamese
tormentors while he was a prisoner of war. He's got principles.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called on Republican leaders to stop begging Patrick
Buchanan to stay in the party and instead give the right-wing,
America First idiot the boot. Let the Reform Party have Pat, and
good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   As a GOP presidential candidate, McCain is not without a
conflict of interest in demanding that other Republicans wave his
presidential rival bye-bye and destroy the impression that he's a
desirable party leader. But there's a lot more going on here.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has just published a book, ``A Republic, Not an
Empire,'' in which he attempts to rewrite history. In his version,
America and Western Europe look bad. Adolf Hitler doesn't look
good, but he looks better than history demonstrates he was. World
War II was our fault.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan claims that Hitler was driven to madness and mayhem by
British and French opposition to his invasion of Poland. If the
allies had appeased him instead, all would have been well. (That
is, if we didn't mind living under a lawless military dictatorship)
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's nutty theory is that if we'd just left Hitler alone,
he would have mostly killed Russians and some folks in tiny
European countries like Poland, not 45 million people from all over
the place in the worst war in history. And certainly not Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan doesn't like communists. What he does like are tough
guys who take what they want, regardless of the suffering of
others.
</P>
<P>
   This is scary stuff. But it's not new. Buchanan has been airing
this weird revisionism for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It has only now become important because although he's never
going to get the GOP presidential nomination, he might have a
chance to get the Reform Party's nomination and the $12 million in
federal campaign funds it brings. We would have to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was properly horrified. ``Defeating Hitler's Germany and
Tojo's Japan was a very noble cause, and I wouldn't want any
Republican to ever think otherwise, or any American for that
matter,'' he said. He urged his party to stand on the democratic
principle of resisting fascist violence and find, as he does, that
Buchanan's views are ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Buchanan tried lamely Thursday on NBC's ``Today''
show to rewrite his rewrite of history. He insisted that he had
never suggested it was not a noble cause to oppose Germany and
Japan. ``Of course it was a noble cause,'' he said. ``The point
about Hitler is that in late 1940 he had lost the battle of
Britain. The English Royal Force had air superiority over the
(English) Channel. Hitler could not invade the United States if he
couldn't even invade England.''
</P>
<P>
   At this writing, the only other Republican presidential
candidate who has had the courage to join McCain is Elizabeth Dole.
``I certainly do not understand (Buchanan's) comments,'' she said.
But Party leaders are still trying to talk Buchanan into staying in
the fold, for fear that as a third-party candidate he might siphon
away enough votes to elect a Democrat as president.
</P>
<P>
   But they pay a price to keep embracing Buchanan. The defense of
pure evil is not good politics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Buchanan's writings and speeches over the years
indicate that he is antagonistic toward women, Jews, racial
minorities and practically everyone who is not just like himself _
right-wing, male, Roman Catholic. This is well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, even William Buckley, otherwise a philosophical ally,
denounced Buchanan as anti-Semitic, a serious charge that Buckley
did not make lightly. Naturally, Buchanan denies it. Who would
admit it?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's worst episode stems from his prolonged defense of
John Demjanjuk, a Ukranian accused of being ``Ivan the Terrible,''
a brutal guard at Treblinka, one of six Nazi death camps in Poland.
After years of controversy, in 1993 an Israeli court ruled that
Demjanjuk had not been proved to be Ivan.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan's defense went beyond the identity question to
doubt the very existence of the crimes of which Ivan was accused.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan claimed that although an Israeli court declared that
diesel engines were the means of killing the 850,000 Jews who died
at Treblinka, ``diesel engines do not emit enough carbon monoxide
to kill anybody. Witnesses say that Jews at Treblinka died from
gas, but the engine as described is not consistent with that, and
that's all this is about,'' Buchanan said in his column and in a
Washington Post interview.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone knows that those Jews were gassed to death at
Treblinka.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has visited the carefully-preserved prison barracks
and gas chambers at Auschwitz and Buchenwald, where victims were
murdered en masse would be stunned by Buchanan's comments. I
certainly was. The gas was appallingly efficient there.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has not gone so far as to deny that the Holocaust
occurred, but for a public figure who wishes to be taken seriously,
he has come alarmingly close.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem with Buchanan, who got his political start in
Richard Nixon's corrupt White House, is that he prefers a
dictatorship to democracy. What a dangerous fellow he would be to
have as president.
</P>
<P>
   During his 1992 campaign, he wrote, ``Of IBM, the Marine Corps,
the Redskins and the D.C. government, only leaders of the last are
chosen by democratic procedures. Only the last is run on
democratic, not autocratic principles. Yet who would choose the
last as the superior organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, all four organizations have had big problems and
undergone great changes. Only the D.C. government can be said to be
vastly improved.

   Peco Energy Co., Philadelphia's utility, and Unicom Corp., the
owner of the utility that serves Chicago, announced Thursday that
they plan a $16 billion merger that will bring together the
nation's largest collection of nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company intends to sell electricity in major
markets around the country as states open up their utilities to
competition, betting that its nuclear plants will produce energy
more cheaply than competing sources of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are going to be a nuclear powerhouse,''said
Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. He said
that if they manage the plants well ``it will give them a
substantial edge in terms of being able to market power and make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   A company with access to huge amounts of cheap nuclear power
could squeeze out a profit while undercutting the prices of other
marketers, Rubin said. That could eventually push down rates for
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which must be approved by an array of regulatory
agencies, would bring together Unicom's four nuclear plants, with a
capacity of 13,470 megawatts, and two nuclear plants operated by
Peco, with 4,070 megawatts of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Peco has formed a joint venture with British Energy
Co., called Amergen, which has bought four nuclear plants so far
and is negotiating to buy a fifth. Amergen already owns plants with
a total capacity of 3,625 megawatts. The new Peco-Unicom
combination, which has not yet been named, would assume Peco's role
in Amergen, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the nuclear plants associated with Peco would
represent about 17 percent of the nation's nuclear capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Corbin McNeill, the chairman and chief executive officer of
Peco, who announced the merger at a press conference in
Philadelphia with John Rowe, the chairman and chief executive
officer of Unicom, said that Amergen was interested in acquiring
more nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill, a fomer nuclear submarine commander, said: ``We intend
to be the premier nuclear operator in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the merger, Peco stockholders will receive
one share in the new holding company for each share of Peco stock
or $45 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Unicom shareholders will get 0.95 share in the new holding
company for each share of Unicom stock or $42.75 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The cash price represents a premium of about 11 percent of
Peco's and Unicom's average stock price over a ten day period
through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is not expected to add debt, according to Rubin,
and therefore will save in interest expense.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that about five percent of the combined work
force of 22,500 will be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe and McNeill intend to share responsibility in the new
holding company, which will be based in Chicago, until the end of
2003, when Rowe will become chairman and the sole chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Both executives took pains to reassure customers in Philadelphia
and Chicago that the utilities will maintain staff in both cities
and support local institutions to which they have been major
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, who was brought into Unicom in March 1998 because of his
experience as a troubleshooter, said his company will continue to
focus on repairing the transmission system of its subsidiary,
Commonwealth Edison. ``It's going to be hard work but we don't
flinch from that,'' he said. In August a series of blackouts shut
down the Chicago Board of Trade and the Field Museum for short
periods, and Chicago's Loop lost power one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Cohen, the executive director of the Citizens Utility
Board, the official watchdog group for consumers in Chicago, said
that while Unicom has had problems operating its nuclear plants in
the past, there had been a dramatic turnaround in the nuclear
operation since it brought in Oliver Kingsley, an expert, as
executive vice president in charge of nuclear operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen warned, ``Anything that diverts management attention from
the urgent task of repairing the delivery system is unwelcome.''

RUSSIAN PLANES BOMB CHECHNYA AIRPORT AND REFINERY

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian warplanes bombed the Grozny airport in Chechnya
Thursday and set an oil refinery ablaze on the outskirts of the
city, as the Kremlin took its military campaign against Islamic
rebels deep into Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian bombing raids near Chechnya's capital represented a
major escalation in the fighting and signaled a change of strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Russian military has concentrated on bombing
targets near the Chechen-Dagestan border. Now the Russian military
appears ready to strike throughout Chechnya by air and perhaps even
to stage raids on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed the burning wreckage of an old biplane
at the airport and blown-out windows in nearby buildings. A pool of
blood lay on the ground where an aircraft technician was killed in
the raid, the first air attack on Grozny since the end of the
Chechen war in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bandits will be pursued wherever they are,'' Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin said Thursday. ``If that is at an airport,
then at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials, however, said the propeller plane was used
for crop dusting and described the technician, an ethnic Armenian,
as an innocent bystander.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stepped-up attacks, military experts generally
discount the likelihood of an all-out Russian invasion of Chechnya.
The Russian military is still smarting from its stinging defeat in
the Chechen war, and the government appears fearful of being drawn
into a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning no large-scale military operation in
Chechnya,'' Putin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in the region began in August when thousands of
Islamic militants stormed into Dagestan and proclaimed their
intention to turn it into an Islamic republic. They were under the
command of Shamil Basayev, a Chechen warlord, and Khattab, a
militant born in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has been fighting to keep the militants out
of Dagestan ever since. Initially, Putin vowed to crush the
rebellion in two weeks. Instead, the conflict has turned into
long-term test of wills.
</P>
<P>
   For all their fervor, the rebels are opposed by most of the
people in Dagestan and do not have the support of the Chechen
government.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Russians have the superior weaponry, they are not
well trained, well led or highly motivated. At least 230 Russian
soldiers have been killed and 875 wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Airstrikes have played an increasingly important role in
Russia's military strategy as Moscow has sought to hold down its
losses. Some Russian commentators have even drawn a connection
between NATO's air campaign in Kosovo and Russia's reliance on air
power in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian air attacks are far less intense and less precise
than NATO's raids. Chechen officials have repeatedly complained
that Russian planes have pounded innocent villages.
</P>
<P>
   Because Russian military pilots get so little training, an
effort was made to round up the most capable pilots in the country
for the air campaign, accordingto Russian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's decision to move up to 15,000 troops to the area
near the Chechen border indicates that the military may be trying
not only to seal the borders but also to prepare for the
possibility of a series of raids into Chechnya after airstrikes
have softened the rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military is believed to have pushed for the air
attacks, preferring to attack the rebels in their Chechen
sanctuaries rather than tangle with them in the mountains of
Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The attacks carry a risk: They may turn more of the Chechen
population against Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's strike against the airport took place around noon.
The airport is about a 15-minute drive from central Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets reported to have been hit were an arms depot
and the radar. The radar was an important target, according to
Russian officials, because it tracked the flights of Russian
warplanes. Its destruction will give the Russian air force more
leeway to operate over Chechnya, they said.
</P>
<P>
   By destroying the biplane, the attack on the airport left the
Chechen government with a single aircraft _ a damaged TU-134, the
official plane of Chechnya's president, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   A second airstrike was carried out later in the day. The news
agency Interfax said those strikes had been directed at an oil
refinery and had led to a major fire, but no television footage of
that raid was broadcast. The Grozny area is ill-equipped to fight a
major fire because much of its equipment was destroyed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the unpopular Chechen war, the current airstrikes have
the support of much of the Russian public, which believes that the
recent wave of terrorist bombings has been the work of Chechen
militants, although the rebels deny it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But few Russians believe that the government can ensure there
will be no more terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   A new scare occurred Thursday in Ryazan, a city southeast of
Moscow, when some suspicious sacks were found in an apartment
house. Initial reports said they contained an explosive and a
timing device, but by evening investigators cautioned that details
needed to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a news report Thursday night that a man carrying
a bag with explosives had been detained near a Moscow hospital.

 &HT;    CLINTON VETOES GOP TAX PACKAGE AS ``TOO BIG, TOO BLOATED''
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vetoed a massive Republican tax
cut on Thursday, claiming the $792 billion package was ``too big,
too bloated'' for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The long-promised veto effectively killed for now any chance for
a significant tax cut and kicked the debate down the road toward
next year's presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, the move set the stage for weeks of tough
wrangling between Clinton and congressional Republicans over how to
use projected budget surpluses to shore up Social Security and
reduce the $5.6 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties remain at loggerheads over whether to return
hundreds of billions of dollars to taxpayers over the coming
decade, as Republicans advocate. Democrats want to devote that
money to strengthening Medicare, improving education and helping
poor families save money for retirement, as Clinton has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides quickly cast the debate as illustrative of the
differences distinguishing Democrats from Republicans, drawing
battle lines for the months of election-year campaigning that lie
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference in philosophy between this Congress and
the White House,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``It's
not a policy argument; it's a philosophical argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side portrayed the tax cut veto in the starkest possible
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the proposed cuts would put the eight-year-old
economic expansion at risk, starve government education and health
programs and possibly throw the country back into periods of
growth-stifling deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when America is moving in the right direction, this
bill would turn us back to the failed policies of the past,''
Clinton said during a veto ceremony on the sun-splashed lawn of the
Rose Garden. ``It is wrong for Medicare, wrong for Social Security,
wrong for education and wrong for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later on Capitol Hill, Republicans sought to paint Clinton
as the embodiment of big government and pledged to press on with
their tax cut crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret the president has stolen this tax cut from working
American families,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss. ``But we will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   And, offering a preview of a likely Republican campaign theme,
Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., scolded Clinton for ``turning his back on
every single taxpayer in America today by vetoing this
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day,'' said Watts. ``Shame on the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rhetorical volleys capped two months of political
theater over legislation doomed virtually from its inception.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised to veto the tax cut as soon as its House and
Senate passage last August appeared likely. Republicans delayed
sending the bill to his desk for more than a month, as they tried
to build public support for the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The support never materialized in any decisive way, and the bill
was waiting for Clinton when he returned from a weeklong
Asia-Pacific swing last week. Only scheduling complications and
Clinton's hoarse voice delayed the veto until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered to discuss his version of compromise legislation
with his Republican foes, but they appeared to reject further
negotiations over tax cuts. Lott and Hastert both signaled that
there would be no further tax cut package this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supports tax cuts of up to $300 billion over ten years,
provided they are targeted toward lower-income and middle class
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The White House claims that the Republican proposal offers
little tax relief to lower-income workers and that roughly
three-fourths of the benefits of the Republican plan would go to
moderately wealthy families.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that the benefits would accrue to all
taxpayers _ one provision of the cut would have reduced the income
tax rate by one percentage point across the board _ with special
emphasis on small business owners, married couples and families
saving for their children's education.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the issue is how to best allocate nearly $3
trillion in surplus revenues the federal government is projected to
generate over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan called for cutting taxes by $792 billion
over that period and dedicating most of the rest of the surplus to
paying down the federal debt and shoring up the Social Security
trust fund, the pool of money that supports the massive federal
program that provides payments to workers as they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed setting aside 77 percent of the surplus to
pay down the public portion of the $5.6 trillion federal debt while
bolstering Social Security and Medicare, the federal health care
program for the elderly. He would use most of the remainder to
create a savings account subsidy for low-income families and to
expand federal spending on education.
</P>
<P>
   The federal debt breaks down into two components. The so-called
public portion, which the government owes to banks and other
private investors, is $3.4 trillion. In addition, the government
owes $2.2 trillion essentially to itself, in the form of debts owed
to various agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Economists contend that the public portion of the debt is most
significant because that is the portion over which the government
is competing with private industry for finite capital and on which
the government must pay out interest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton claims that under his plan the entire public portion of
the federal debt would be eliminated by 2015 _ provided the economy
continues to grow at slightly above 2 percent a year between now
and then.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said there was room for
negotiation over tax cuts _ provided that they were limited to $300
billion over ten years and that they were targeted to low-income
and middle class families.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, Clinton was willing to negotiate with
Republicans over how best to shore up Social Security and Medicare
for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Lockhart, ``We can't do any of that if the Republican
Party decides that for political reasons, they want to walk away
and quit the process.''

CLINTON VETOES GOP'S `BLOATED' TAX-CUTTING PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Making good on his threat, President Clinton vetoed
the Republican's $792 billion tax relief measure Thursday and
challenged the GOP to work with him to meet other pressing needs
before adjournment this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, reacting quickly to the long-anticipated
veto, accused Clinton of stealing a tax cut from the American
people and pledged to bring forward another major tax relief
measure in the midst of the 2000 election season.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's veto clears the way for both sides to begin serious
talks on the 2000 budget, which likely will last much of this fall.
Congress, which has passed only four of 13 spending bills, must
pass a stop-gap spending resolution to prevent government from
closing Oct. 1, the beginning of the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Under a sunny autumn sky, Clinton sat at a desk in the Rose
Garden and signed veto papers killing the 10-year tax cut plan that
the Republican leaders in Congress hailed as the centerpiece of its
1999 legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is too big, too bloated, places too great a burden on
America's economy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would force drastic cuts in education, health care and
other vital areas. It would cripple our ability to pay down the
debt. It would not add a day to the Social Security trust fund. It
would not add a day to the Medicare trust fund or modernize
Medicare with prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., countered that the
president ``has stolen this tax cut from working American
families'' and pledged ``we will be back'' with another version
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The president maintained the GOP tax plan would overturn seven
years of fiscal discipline that netted the nation its first budget
surplus in 30 years, a thriving economy, low interest rates and low
jobless rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will veto this bill because it is wrong for Medicare, wrong
for Social Security, wrong for education and wrong for the
economy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Congress ``not to go home until we have worked
together'' to meet America's long-term challenges. They include his
plan to lengthen the life span of Social Security by 32 years to
2050, to extend Medicare's solvency by 12 years to 2027 and to pay
down the $4 trillion public debt that accumulated from three
decades of deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   After those obligations are met, he said he would work with
Congress ``to pass tax relief we can afford'' and one aimed at the
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a good bill I would happily sign,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican tax-cut bill, phased in over a decade, would have
cut income tax rates by 1 percent, cut capital gains taxes,
eliminated estate taxes and erased the so-called marriage tax
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has embraced a much smaller $250 billion tax relief plan
targeted to middle class taxpayers in the form of tax credits for
child care and long-term care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also made clear the Republicans will address their own
legislative priorities, not the president's.
</P>
<P>
   He said the GOP-led Congress will now focus its budget and tax
efforts on creating the Social Security lockbox to protect the
surplus from being spent, to prevent tax increases and to pay down
the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the effort this year; the president took the tax cut
away. So now our focus will be on those three items that I had
mentioned,'' Lott said, indicating there would be no major action
this year on resolving the solvency issues of Social Security and
Medicare or on another tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, issued a statement saying he would ``use every chance
available to cut taxes'' and accused Clinton of placing the needs
of Washington above the needs of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the Congress and the
White House face a tough road because the issue is over a
difference in philosophy. ``It's not a policy argument, it's a
philosophical argument,'' Hastert said, adding Republicans believe
``the American people should have a little bit more control over
their own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning for president in South Carolina, Texas Republican
Gov. George W. Bush said, ``I hope they override him. It's a good
thing to do. Once you meet the basic needs, it's good to give
people their money back. Plus I believe cutting taxes is good for
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has yet to detail his own tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders gave no indication they would seek to override
Clinton's veto, which would take a two-thirds vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The $792 billion tax cut faced problems from its inception.
Moderate Republicans opposed it because of its size. It passed the
Senate by only one vote and passed the House only after a series of
horse-trades by Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans passed the measure in August, they held
onto it until last week. They claimed they would create a
groundswell of support for it by holding hundreds of townhall
meetings during their August recess. The groundswell never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   A series of public opinion polls indicated the public was wary
of the measure. A CNN/Gallup Poll released Thursday showed 67
percent of those polled wanted a smaller tax cut and more money for
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll indicated the bulk of the support for a large
tax cut was among people who identified themselves as Republican.
The CBS poll indicated 59 percent of those polled who identified
themselves as Republicans said government should cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the number fell to 42 percent when asked if the government
should cut taxes or pay for social programs such as education.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart chided Republicans for
``taking their ball and going home'' after playing politics with
the $792 billion tax relief bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I think political reality at some point is going to
set in for the Republicans. They're going to look at the hand
they're playing. They're pushing a tax cut the public knows we
can't afford.''

CLINTON VOWS TO PROTECT COMBAT READINESS IN VIEQUES DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton told Congress in a letter
released Thursday that he will protect the combat readiness of Navy
and Marine Corps forces when he responds to demands to close down a
58-year-old target range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John
Warner, R-Va., Clinton said ``rigorous, realistic'' combat training
is ``essential for success in combat and for protecting our
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I believe that we can meet Navy and Marine
Corps combat readiness requirements while ensuring the safety and
well being of the people of Vieques.'' The letter didn't spell out
how he would do that.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders and allies in Congress are
campaigning to persuade Clinton to close the Navy target range on
Vieques after a Marine pilot accidentally bombed a range
observation post in April, killing a Puerto Rican security guard
and injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would weigh the military's needs, ``the
alternatives that may be available to meet their training needs and
the safety, environmental and economic concerns raised by the
commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the people of Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House released Clinton's letter one day after Navy
Vice Adm. William J. Fallon and Marine Lt. Gen. Peter Pace warned
Congress that combat readiness is being impaired by the five-month
moratorium on live fire training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy official said five of the six surface warships that
accompany the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower on a
six-month deployment beginning in February won't have their
required gunfire training because of the closure of the Vieques
firing range.

<P>
   Clinton's letter said he was working ``to find a solution that
fulfills our essential national security needs and meets the
concerns'' of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's letter was released as Puerto Rico's political
leadership rejected negotiations over Vieques and turned to Clinton
to override a Pentagon-drafted compromise that would permit the
resumption of limited bombing on the target range.
</P>
<P>
   Alcides Ortiz, director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs
Administration that handles Puerto Rico's affairs in Washington,
D.C., said Puerto Rican authorities have ruled out negotiations
with the Navy or the four-member Pentagon review panel appointed at
the request of the president to seek a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the panel's four members have ties to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sort of bargaining the Navy wants to enter into would
entail live bombing exercises on Vieques,'' Alcides said. ``We are
not willing to negotiate resumption of any live bombing
exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Democratic Gov. Pedro Rossello who last week met
with officials in Washington, including First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, said Puerto Rican officials who meet with defense
officials are making ``certain everybody understands...that the
positions are mutually exclusive'' rather than seeking a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, a top fund raiser for the presidential campaign of
Vice President Al Gore who has pledged to support the prospective
New York Senate campaign of Mrs. Clinton, said he is banking on the
president ``to see the broad panorama and make a decision that's in
the interests of the American citizens who live on Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Attorney General Jose A. Fuentes Agostini, a
Republican, has ruled out negotiations and drafted a request for a
federal court injunction to block any resumption of target
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carlos Romero-Barcelo, D-Puerto Rico, the non-voting member
of Congress who represents 3.8 million U.S. citizens in Puerto
Rico, called any more bombing ``totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon panel's draft recommendation would permit
resumption of live fire training, with restrictions to reduce the
number of bombs and trim the number of days of range operations
from 180 days a year to about 120 days a year.

   The campaign to end target practice on Vieques got a boost
Thursday when opponents delivered a petition via e-mail to the
White House and the Pentagon that sponsors said included the names
of more than 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to add our names and our wills to this just cause by
demanding you, Mr. President, as commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, to call for the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. Navy from
the island of Vieques,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   Flavio Cumpiano, the Washington, D.C., representative for the
Committee to Rescue and Develop Vieques, said his Vieques-based
organization is also urging Puerto Ricans and other supporters to
telephone the White House to urge the president to order the Navy
out of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official with the National Security Council,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president would not
intervene in the stalemate between Puerto Rico and the Navy until
he has received the Pentagon's recommendations.

   The Navy and Marine Corps say they rely upon a 22,000-acre
maneuver area, ammunition storage area and live fire range on
Vieques to prepare aircraft carrier battle groups for deployments
to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy study of operations on Vieques examining 16 years of
target practice showed that Navy and Marine Corps combat aircraft
dropped 135,574 non-explosive weapons and 39,358 explosive weapons
on the 899-acre live impact area on Vieques. Navy warships fired
97,830 rounds from ships' 5-inch guns over the same 16 year period.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps fired a variety of combat weapons during
training on the island, including 2.3 million rifle rounds, 7,351
rounds from 155 howitzers and 14,003 rounds from M-60 machine guns.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In 1949, Yang Yuena was an illiterate 17-year-old
peasant, living in a straw hut and farming for an absentee
landlord, when the Red Army entered her rural hometown. This month,
dressed in fashionable silks, she feted a grandson bound for UCLA
in the family's second home, a lavish apartment in Beijing with a
television that takes up an entire wall and a bar stocked with wine
and cognac.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the twists and turns of a half century of Communist
rule add up to a raging success: a rich businessman for a
son-in-law, exotic teas and plump shrimp at lunch, two family
members accepted into the Communist Party. But for other families,
like the Lings of Shanghai, the equation is far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Ling Qiang, 87, a former official of the Nationalist government
that was defeated by the Communists, uses the Queens' English as he
describes his family's persecution under Mao, pointing to two
discolored patches in his tiny yellowed flat, where, in the 1960s,
marauding Red Guards smashed walls in search of Western books or
bourgeois valuables. But those ugly memories have faded with the
prosperity and more relaxed political atmosphere of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And his grandson, 27, an engineer with a foreign company, now
gives little thought to his family's turbulent past, spending his
spare time on the Internet, trading stocks or e-mailing his sister
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of these two families is the story of the
revolutionary experiment that Mao initiated 50 years ago next week,
an experiment that in some way upended and uprooted virtually every
family in China, leaving millions dead or broken, but ultimately
easing the survivors into today's relative prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Though every family is unique, each has passed the same
landmarks: the revolutionary hopes and ideals of the early 1950s,
the brutality of Mao's political campaigns from the late 1950s
until his death in 1976, and the diversity and economic opportunity
in the last two decades of reform. And each stage has placed its
indelible stamp on its generation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as China prepares to celebrate the anniversary of the
People's Republic, most Chinese have a sense of progress and pride,
despite an uncertain economy and grumblings about the country's
political system. But, as the stories of these two families
illustrate, the road they have traveled has been filled with
painful and bizarre switchbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist troops came in late 1949 to Yuhuan, a remote
coastal village in southern Zhejiang Province, where Yang Yuena's
family survived, just barely, by a mix of fishing and farming.
</P>
<P>
   The family was too concerned with subsistence to either support
or oppose the approaching Communists in their battle against
Nationalist troops, Ms. Yang said, though fighting raged for months
in nearby fields.
</P>
<P>
   But they were fed up with the corruption of the Nationalist
government, she said, and quickly found reason to embrace the
victors in China's civil war. Officially classified by the
Communists as ``poor peasants,'' Ms. Yang's family was given land
when the new rulers carved up the property of local landlords and
rich farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we were extremely happy _ everyone was happy _ we
got land!'' said Ms. Yang. As a bonus, the Communists' policy
against arranged marriages meant she was able to choose her own
husband _ although it proved hard to find one given her ``bad''
background: an uncle had fled with the Nationalists to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Good will toward the Communist authorities ran deep in Yuhuan,
even as they organized farmers into work teams and a few years
later fully collectivized farming _ essentially taking back the
land previously handed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all believed in the Communist Party,'' said Ms. Yang. ``The
peasants were excited and happy. It was a time of great faith that
we were about to enter communism.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, in Shanghai, Ling Qiang also found the landscape
thoroughly transformed. In this once cosmopolitan city, cafes and
dance halls quickly shut. No one dared wear jewelry because it was
considered bourgeois _ although gold bullion still functioned as
currency underground.
</P>
<P>
   And if Ling, a former official in the Nationalist government's
salt monopoly, did not share the peasants' sense of giddy
anticipation, nor, he says, did he feel besieged.
</P>
<P>
   After returning from a brief exile in Hong Kong to rejoin his
wife, he bought rental rights to the one-room flat that is still
his home with a bar of gold and began teaching English at a Jesuit
school that had been taken over by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Ling, with his Western-style education and Nationalist
connections, was obligated to take part in a weekly political study
group to remold his thinking, and shipped out for a summer of
Marxist ``re-education.'' The Communist Youth League rejected his
son's application.
</P>
<P>
   ``But overall, it was not bad,'' said Ling. ``I was not a
capitalist, so was not so affected.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years, he said, he and his wife even began to embrace
communist idealism. When, in 1959, Mao called on youths in Shanghai
to move to the countryside to acquaint themselves with peasant
life, Ling enthusiastically encouraged his 18-year-old son to sign
up.
</P>
<P>
   But the late '50s witnessed the start of Mao's most sweeping
revolutionary campaigns, which would soon buffet the lives of the
emerging second generation.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries women in Yuhuan had tended the home, while the men
fished or tilled the fields. But with the Great Leap Forward in
1958, Mao smashed these traditions, insisting that all grain be
turned in to the government, forbidding individual fishing or
planting, and requiring every man and women to work to meet
government grain quotas in exchange for rations in communal
canteens.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, scarce local grain was siphoned off to feed China's
cities, creating dire shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1959, the peasants were exhausted, and couldn't or wouldn't
work more because the system took everything away,'' said Ms. Yang.
``By 1960, we'd stopped planting. And then the grain ran out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her future son-in-law, the businessman Wang Yicai, lived in the
same township and was only five years old at the time. But he
recalls chronic hunger, eating coarse bread and sweet potatoes _
supplemented by leaves _ to survive. Many died in Yuhuan, including
Ms. Yang's mother, part of a nationwide famine in 1960-62 that
killed tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1966, just as Yuhuan was recovering, Mao unleashed the
Cultural Revolution, closing schools, sending armies of urban
youths to the countryside, and anointing students as ``Red Guards''
with license to destroy any traces of China's bourgeois past. They
smashed ancient relics and persecuted people deemed to harbor
counter-revolution.
</P>
<P>
   For Wang, it marked the end of his formal schooling, at the age
of 9. He became a Little Red Guard and spent his days studying
Marx, communist operas and revolutionary songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it was interesting and exciting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also felt he needed more of an education, and quietly
borrowed textbooks from teachers to teach himself writing and math.
Still, when Mao died and the Cultural Revolution ended, Wang, then
20, was ill-prepared for China's free-market future, having been in
school just four years.

 BEIJING: four years. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During these same turbulent years, Ling Huakang, of the
second-generation Ling family, also found his life roiled by Mao's
campaigns to radically transform the country. In 1959, instead of
going to college, he volunteered to serve the party in the fields
of rural Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was an honor to be sent down _ that I should
respond to the call of Chairman Mao,'' he said, now a jovial
middle-aged state factory administrator. ``I had no idea that my
future would be so messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   He had gone to the countryside, he said, to uplift the peasants
and was disappointed to end up a farm hand. Then, a few months
later, after Mao announced that the future of China depended on
steel as well as grain, Ling was transferred to a newly established
rural steel factory.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, remembers the famine of the early 1960s: grain rations
that never arrived; eating dried sweet potato slices and cabbage
soup for weeks on end.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, he retained an underlying faith in the party.
And was thrilled when he was selected to attend a college of
metallurgy in preparation for an assignment at one of the country's
biggest steel plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then I still felt idealistic,'' he said, now with a
laugh. In fact, a few years later he named his children Gang
(steel) and Liang (grain), to express his devotion to Mao.
</P>
<P>
   That faith was again challenged by the Cultural Revolution in
1966, when the Ling family abruptly became hapless targets of
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   In the steel foundry, Ling was accused of bourgeois tendencies _
in part because of his father's middle-class background. Red Guards
smashed his RCA radio and, upon noticing a family alarm clock made
in Canada, accused him of worshiping foreign enemies.
</P>
<P>
   He was the object of ``struggle sessions,'' criticized by 30
coworkers crammed into a room. He recalls the fear that moved him
to rub the initials off an old U.S. Army surplus blanket. But also
the genuine shame he felt as he wrote his self-criticism. ``I
thought `Yes, I do have a very serious problem. It's terrible. I'm
infected with bourgeois ideals.'''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Shanghai, his father was locked in his school for a
month, and interrogated incessantly by students. Groups of Red
Guards ransacked the apartment and tormented his mother, who was
``totally terrified,'' Ling said.
</P>
<P>
   So terrified that one day she took the family's few remaining
heirlooms _ jewelry, gold, silver dollars _ and tossed them into a
sewer. His father, who had studied Western literature in college,
collected his precious paintings and books and _ believing them
tainted _ turned them in to the party.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in the 1970s, when the children of the third
generation were born, that the political radicalism started
abating.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Yicai's big break came in 1973, in the waning years of the
Cultural Revolution, when the central government decided to let
villages like Yuhuan set up small enterprises. He became a
salesman, ultimately assigned to live in Nanchang, the capital of
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
   With cash to spend, he married a women from Yuhuan and built a
brick house, the first in his family with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   More important, in Nanchang an older professor got the bright
youngster admitted to an aeronautics college. By the time Wang
rejoined his wife and new son to become a factory manager in 1979,
the Cultural Revolution had ended, and Deng Xiaoping had announced
China's ``opening and reform,'' paving the way the the development
of private business.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect was immediately appealing to Wang, who thinks Mao
was ``ignorant about economics'' and regards Deng as a great hero.
But having witnessed the wild political swings of the 1960s, he _
like many others of his generation _ had learned to be deeply
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge and powerful change under way,'' he said.
``But in the late '70s China was still not that stable, and I
wanted to make sure the new policy would last.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1983, did he ``jump into the sea,'' as the Chinese put
it, joining with eight partners who each put up $150 to start their
own firm, the Yuhuan Qingma General Machinery Factory.
</P>
<P>
   The factory made parts for cars and motorcycles just as China
was starting to motorize. The company's growth has been
exponential, sending the Wangs on an upward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the local Communist Party invited the budding
entrepreneur to join. Large factories must have a party cell; Wang
could form one, or have it created for him. ``I'm a party member
now because you really can't separate business and politics in
China at this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ling Huakang in Shanghai, the reforms of the past 20 years
have had less to do with finances than with spiritual recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a number of years, the fear faded very slowly,'' said the
second-generation Ling, who in 1982 was transferred to the Baoshan
Iron and Steel Plant in Shanghai. ``We only gradually came to
re-evaluate the Cultural Revolution and to see how ridiculous it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first returned to Shanghai, half a day of each week was
still devoted to political study, a practice that faded over the
next four years. In a world increasingly focused on economics, the
family's negative political background was slowly forgotten. Their
two children tested their way into good high schools and, later,
university.
</P>
<P>
   Though never prosperous, the Lings slowly accumulated the
trappings of a modernizing China: a television, a large
refrigerator, an electric ceiling fan. In a sign of the times, in
1984 the Lings modified the way their son Liang's name was written,
changing it from the character meaning ``grain,'' to another with
the same sound, meaning ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   The third generation of both families has come of age in a
different world, one in which politics still defines the limits of
Chinese life, but not its core.
</P>
<P>
   They never experienced the turmoil of their parents' lives, and
are too young to have been caught up in China's last great
political upheaval, the 1989 Tiananmen protests.
</P>
<P>
   In their short adult lifetimes, grain coupons have given way to
supermarkets. Marxist study sessions to pop concerts. Waiting for
state job assignments to suiting up for interviews at foreign
firms. They are pragmatic, materialistic and international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I studied history I can communicate with my father's
generation,'' said Wang Dong, the third generation of the family
from the village of Yuhuan, just before he left for UCLA, the first
family member to travel outside China. ``But many young people
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   An NBA fan with a cell phone and clad in sneakers and jeans,
Wang could already pass for a Western graduate student. His father,
whose company now makes 20 percent of car transmissions in China,
makes ``more money than Bill Clinton,'' and is paying his son's
tuition. Still, the youngest Wang plans to return to China after he
gets his Ph.D. in political science. Two years ago he followed his
father into the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to participate in the future of China and for that you
have to join _ both to develop the country and your career,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But his concerns seem utterly removed from the politics of
yesteryear, centering on WTO, the economy, and international
relations.
</P>
<P>
   These are the concerns of most young Chinese, who have little
emotional connection with the past, though they are often tightly
bound to their families.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Ling Liang, the grandson of the Ling family,
sleeps each night on a cot next to the old man's bed _ and surfs
the Internet in the room's other corner.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he graduated from college in 1994, his life has been
about choice: he chose his girlfriend, now working in Singapore; he
chose his job with a foreign company. He makes the highest salary
of anyone in his family and has helped modernize the old yellowing
room, introducing air-conditioning and a microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   He is happy to cook for the grandfather who raised him, but is
visibly impatient with the anxieties of his elders. At a recent
Sunday lunch, when his mother reminded him of the Mao-era
campaigns, as she often does, he quickly silenced her nagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No. I don't worry at all about that,'' he said. ``We don't
live for the cause of communism. We live for living better.''

   CHINA-REPUBLIC-CELEBRATION (Shanghai, China) _ The 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China is being heralded
here with a celebration intended by the government to top all
celebrations. On Friday morning, half a million invited citizens
will gather in Tiananmen Square in Beijing for a speech by
President Jiang Zemin, followed by the biggest military parade in
the country's history, with 90 floats, 140,000 marchers, numerous
tanks and weapons, and 130 sorties by Chinese Air Force planes. At
dusk, 100,000 dancers and singers will perform. When darkness
finally falls, fireworks displays with names like ``Chanting the
Eulogy of the Motherland'' will burst forth simultaneously from 10
locations around the capital. By Sheila Melvin. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

<P>
   VIENNA-PHILHARMONIC (Seewalchen Amattersee, Austria) _ Yes, 1999
is a Johann Strauss year, filled with commemorations of the
composer's death 100 years ago. And yes, it ends in the turning not
only of the century but also of the millennium. Yet when the Vienna
Philharmonic performs Strauss waltzes on New Year's Eve and New
Year's Day in the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna and on worldwide
television, it will be conducting business more or less as usual.

   TORONTO-FILM-FEST (subslug) (Toronto) _ The ten-day Toronto
International Film Festival ended its 24th incarnation last Sunday
after hosting more than 300 films, dozens of major stars and
filmmakers and hundreds of journalists and industry types from all
over the world. Slightly bleary from a day's worth of questions
about ``Sunshine'' _ a Hungarian generational epic from director
Istvan Szabo in which Ralph Fiennes plays three roles _ the actor
was collecting his thoughts after the last of the journalists had
left and was preparing to make a 36-hour escape before he had to
return for yet another push, this time for ``Onegin,'' an
adaptation of Pushkin's narrative poem directed by Martha Fiennes,
his sister. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).

<P>
   GAY-AIDS-FILMS (Undated) _ The Association of Lesbian and Gay
Pride Films, an activist group in France, has produced a series of
10 short films geared to the gay and lesbian population in the
context of AIDS. The films titled ``L'Amour Est a Reinventor''
(``Love Reinvented'') were released in France in 1998 and will open
in New York on Friday. By David Bahr. (Moved).

   GALLO-THEATER-DESIGNER (New York) _ What makes a David Gallo
design a David Gallo design? The scenic designer David Gallo will
only say, ``I tend to do things (italics)large.''(end italics)
That's a rather broad esthetic philosophy, but it sits well with
the husky, garrulous man whose latest larger-than-life set
surrounds the action of ``Epic Proportions,'' a new comedy opening
Thursday at the Helen Hayes Theater. By Steven Drukman. (Moved).

<P>
   EVE-ENSLER-THEATER (New York) _ If you'd never seen Eve Ensler's
one-woman show ``The Vagina Monologues'' and if you knew she had
also written plays about Bosnian refugees, women in prison and
nuclear war, you might expect her to be humorless, single-minded,
even didactic. But to step into Ms. Ensler's apartment in Chelsea
is to confront a positively bubbly figure. Ms. Ensler, 46, good
humor masks a serious purpose and a troubled personal history that
gave rise to ``The Vagina Monologues,'' which began its second New
York run last Tuesday (in previews at the Westside Theater). The
monologues are part of Ms. Ensler's crusade to wipe out the shame
and embarrassment that many women still associate with their bodies
or their sexuality. By Dinitia Smith. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   UPSIDE-DOWN-DANCE (New York) _ To the propulsive beat of the
Nigerian composer Fela Anikulapo Kuti's music, the choreographer
Ronald K. Brown led his 12 sinuous dancers across the floor in
fast, rhythmic movements, each stride increasing the tension in the
studio. Just five minutes into ``Upside Down,'' Brown had already
reached a wrenchingly emotional place. It is a place he fruitfully
visits often. ``Upside Down,'' a section from a larger work, the
1998 ``Destiny,'' illustrates the enormous effort and energy it
takes to move toward inner peace in a chaotic world. When Brown's
aptly named company, Evidence, begins its one-week engagement at
the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, it will present ``Upside Down'' as
well as two other Brown works; Ebony Magazine'' and ``Water.'' By
Valerie Gladstone. (Moved). Photo.

</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN-PHILHARMONIC (New York) _ For their season that opens
on Friday, Robert Spano and the Brooklyn Philharmonic have put
together a set of programs to survey the 20th century at its end.
This is a 20th-century season in two ways: not only does all the
music come from the last hundred years, but the planning has a very
20th-century feel. Spano and his orchestra are concerned less with
great composers than with great themes _ war, politics, pop
culture, the environment, faith _ and there is no attempt to make
sure that all the outstanding creative personalities will be
represented. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS-GAINES-ALBUM (Undated) _ Whether it is a testament to
cowardice, marketing or megalomania, ``Chris Gaines'' is a gutsy
undertaking, not only as an attempt by an outsider to fit into
another genre but also as a greatest hits album that tries to fit
into each phase of that genre's recent history. Gaines may be a
pseudonym _ complete with an elaborate invented background that
incorporates bits of Dylan, Beatles and Prince lore and parallels
elements of Garth Brooks's life (the solo careers of both begin in
1989, and both have the same number of letters in their first and
last names). But Chris Gaines is very much Garth Brooks, who has
described himself as a melting pot of the past. By Neil Strauss.

<P>
   COUNTRY-RADIO (Undated) _ There's always been an official flavor
of country radio, though not necessarily a totally homogenous one.
A form that takes in people as diverse and talented as Alan
Jackson, Patty Loveless, Vince Gill and Trisha Yearwood can't be
all bad. But country radio, the biggest format in America, is in
the throes of a particularly lame version of one of its cyclical
creative downdrafts, churning out ever paler, if sexier, would-be
Garths and Shanias with numbing regularity. By Peter Applebome.

<P>
   CONDE-NAST-ARCH (New York) _ I hope that the completion of the
new Conde Nast headquarters last month will make people think twice
before complaining about the Disneyfication of Times Square. Things
are better than that, and worse. Disney is but one in a group of
media giants that have chosen to settle here. Besides Conde Nast,
publishers of The New Yorker, Vogue, Vanity Fair and other
glamorous titles, the group includes Reuters, Bertelsmann,
Billboard Publications and MTV. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

<P>
   MONROE-PIANO-SALE (New York) _ As grand pianos go, the one going
on the block at Christie's this month is nothing special.
Paderewski did not play it. Neither did Liberace, though he would
have swooned over its fondant-white finish and maybe added some
stylistic flourishes of his own. And as far as Christie's knows, no
one but Marilyn Monroe, its last owner, ever tickled its ivories,
though it is possible that Frank Sinatra, a Monroe beau, might have
plunked out a tune or two. The baby grand piano is a centerpiece of
the sale of Ms. Monroe's personal effects at Christie's new
salerooms at Rockefeller Center on Oct. 27 and 28. By Mitchell
Owens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MARILYN-PERFUME (Los Angeles) _ Over the last couple of years,
the estate of Marilyn Monroe has not been kind to the goddess whose
memory it protects. In 1997, it sanctioned a line of Marilyn Monroe
lingerie. The 50s-style underwear was hawked at department stores.
Now comes an estate-approved perfume called Marilyn, from
International Flavors and Fragrances, the company that has
recreated the essence of Elizabeth Taylor, Victoria Principal and
Christie Brinkley. This takes the concept of celebrity perfume to a
new level: the notion of smelling like a famous dead person _ even
Marilyn Monroe _ is at best an odd one. By Deanne Stillman.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-ART (Hatfield, Mass.) _ Putting pictures to words is Barry
Moser's profession, but never has the challenge been greater than
in his latest project: a monumental, fully illustrated version of
the King James Bible. Not only is this the most central, most
revered and surely most contested text in our culture, but it is
one already firmly fixed in our collective minds by religious
inclination and by the countless artists who have already left
their mark. Moser, while keenly aware of those precedents and
preconceptions, has approached this daunting project by returning
to the words themselves to confront familiar stories as if for the
first time. By Miles Under. (Moved).

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MOESHA (Undated) _ As everyone in television sounds off about
desires supposedly dear to their hearts _ to see more nonwhite
actors in prime time and to see more shows that the whole family
can enjoy _ the producers and cast of ``Moesha'' have their Oz-like
wish. ``Hey, folks,'' they wonder, ``why not look here in your own
backyard?'' ``Moesha'' (pronounced mo-EESH-a), which has just begun
its fifth season on UPN, is about a family. It has a mix of
characters and plot lines that can engage both adolescents and
adults. And the family, like almost all the supporting characters,
happens to be black. By Lawrie Mifflin. (Moved).

GOP-LED CONGRESS WORKING ON STOP-GAP SPENDING MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tied in knots over Year 2000 spending issues,
Congress has begun hammering together a temporary funding measure
to avert a government shutdown when this fiscal year expires next
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to reach agreement among themselves or with President
Clinton and the Democrats, Republicans appear ready to extend
funding for some of the government's largest departments and
programs at 1999 levels through at least the first three weeks of
the new fiscal year and, possibly, through next September, if
necessary. Disagreements exist over everything from farm issues and
education to defense and foreign aid matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ... don't have a choice,'' said one Republican leadership
aide. ``We're still far apart on some things and ... probably won't
resolve the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders said a stop-gap spending measure, known
as a continuing resolution, would likely be approved sometime next
week. It's expected to be free of any objectionable amendments to
avoid a presidential veto, House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., also signaled his
support for a problem-free stop gap measure, if necessary,
suggesting that Republicans are ready to do whatever is necessary
to avoid a repeat of the disastrous 1995-96 partial government
shutdowns for which GOP lawmakers were generally blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for a government shutdown under any
condition,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are trying to push through a number of spending
measures Clinton is certain to veto. If he follows through on his
threats, as many as six of the 13 appropriations measures needed to
fund the government through next fiscal year could end up being
vetoed and sent back to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Republican leaders either will be forced to
negotiate spending agreements with Clinton, which they have shown
little interest in doing thus far, or simply continue funding at
current levels through next year for departments whose budgets have
yet to be accepted by Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   One bill facing a veto threat is being cobbled together by the
House Appropriations Committee. It would provide $316 billion for
funding the Departments of Education, Labor and Health and Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains more funding in some areas than Clinton
originally requested. But it would kill his plans to hire up to
100,000 new teachers, build more schools, and increase funding for
volunteer and job training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also employs some creative accounting techniques to
help pay for so-called emergencies and avoid borrowing from the
Social Security Trust Fund to meet demands for spending increases. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; One of the accounting devices, which would reclaim billions in
unspent state block grant money for welfare programs, has drawn the
wrath of Democratic and Republican governors who have vowed to
fight it and would urge a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Objections have also been raised about plans to replace Health
and Human Services money siphoned off for other programs by
borrowing from future budgets. But some Republican lawmakers,
especially in the Senate, have objected to such a move out of
concern that enough surplus money may not materialize to make up
the gap.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to spending matters, Congress is wrestling with a
myriad of other issues, including gun control. Efforts to pass a
juvenile crime bill have stalled because the Senate version
includes measures that would extend background checks on gun buyers
to gun shows and flea market sales, and it would strengthen safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which defeated similar gun-control measures earlier
this year, voted 305-117 to instruct its negotiators on the
juvenile bill to include gun-control provisions in the final
version of the legislation that emerges from a House-Senate
conference.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, who has been
leading the negotiations for the House, said Thursday that he
believes an agreement with the Senate on a final bill may be close.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement may call for mandatory background checks
at gun shows, a ban on large capacity ammunition clips and
mandatory trigger locks on all guns sold.

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A $125 million robotic spacecraft, the first ever dispatched
especially to investigate weather on another world, was missing
Thursday and presumed destroyed just as it was supposed to go into
an orbit around Mars.
</P>
<P>
   As the slenderest hopes of re-establishing radio contact
diminished with each passing hour, project officials announced that
the spacecraft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, was ``believed to be lost
due to a suspected navigation error.'' It probably flew too close
to the planet, within 37 miles of the surface, disintegrating or
burning up in the atmosphere or, possibly but less likely, crashing
into the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent navigation problem, officials said, was caused by
human or software error, not mechanical failure on the spacecraft.
The trouble was not detected by flight controllers until it was too
late to be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers were investigating the failure Thursday night, and
tracking stations were still trying a wide range of radio
frequencies in the hope of catching a signal, in the event all is
not lost.
</P>
<P>
   But if the spacecraft somehow drifted as far off course as the
last tracking data indicated, engineers said, it could not have
survived. At any altitude less than 53 miles, their studies showed,
the vibrations and heat from atmospheric friction would have torn
the vehicle apart.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., Richard Cook, the project manager, said, ``We believe the
spacecraft came in at a lower altitude than we thought it would and
that potentially resulted in the loss of the mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, putting the best face on the situation, said the
apparent loss of the spacecraft was a bitter disappointment but not
a devastating blow to the newly revived program of systematic Mars
exploration with low-budget missions mounted every two years.
</P>
<P>
   They emphasized that the failure was not expected to disrupt
operations of a companion spacecraft, Mars Polar Lander, which is
scheduled to reach the planet on Dec. 3. It is cruising on course
for a landing at the edge of the south polar ice cap, where the
frozen ground is thought to hold a record of the planet's climate
history.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ill-fated Climate Orbiter was supposed to relay
communications between the lander and Earth, flight controllers
said that the landing craft was capable of direct communications to
Earth. Another alternative would be to transmit some radio traffic
through Mars Global Surveyor, a spacecraft that has been orbiting
and mapping the planet since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the polar lander, Dr. Carl Pilcher, science
director for solar system exploration at NASA headquarters in
Washington, said, ``The science return of that mission won't be
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Climate Orbiter is indeed lost, Pilcher said, its
science objectives _ observing weather over a full Martian year
(687 days) and searching for the cold, arid planet's water
resources _ could be met by missions already on the drawing board
for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not necessarily science lost,'' he said. ``It is
science delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was especially frustrating for scientists like Dr.
Daniel McCleese, who built one of the two principal scientific
instruments on the Climate Orbiter. It is an infrared radiometer
for examining the temperatures and water content of the Martian
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   And it is identical to the instrument he designed for an earlier
spacecraft, Mars Observer, which suffered an eerily similar fate as
it approached Mars six years ago. For reasons still unknown, all
signals from Observer suddenly stopped three days out from Mars,
and it was never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   That was a devastating failure, McCleese recalled in an
interview, because the mission cost nearly $1 billion and was all
scientists had for exploring Mars.
</P>
<P>
   In the new strategy of spreading risks by sending out several,
low-cost spacecraft, he said, ``Mars exploration is now designed to
be tolerant of this kind of failure, and no one mission should make
or break the program.''
</P>
<P>
   McCleese, who is also chief scientist for the Mars Exploration
Directorate at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said he was not sure he
wanted to try again with a third radiometer. ``I can do it,'' he
said, ``but will I?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As far as flight controllers knew, all was well with the
1,387-pound Climate Orbiter when it approached the northern
hemisphere of Mars and fired its main rocket engine at about 5 a.m.
Eastern time to go into orbit. All data coming into the control
rooms in Pasadena and at Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver
appeared normal.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket firing to slow down the craft was to last 16 minutes,
but controllers could monitor only the first 5 minutes. As planned,
the craft slipped behind the planet as seen from Earth and radio
contact was lost.
</P>
<P>
   If the spacecraft was safely in orbit, contact with it should
have been restored by 5:30. But there was nothing but silence.
Flight controllers waited anxiously. If it was some common
malfunction on board, the spacecraft had instructions on how to
call on backup systems to restore operations. But nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   More than three hours later, Dr. Richard W. Zurek, the project
scientist, grew pessimistic. ``The longer we don't hear from it,
the worse off we are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After engineers examined tracking data from the spacecraft's
approach to Mars, officials discovered the likely navigation
problem. A trajectory-adjusting maneuver last Wednesday had put the
spacecraft on course to come no closer to the surface of Mars than
93 miles. It appeared that the actual altitude would be 37 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, the project manager, said that there was a significant
drop in the spacecraft's trajectory in the last few hours of the
approach, but ground controllers had for some reason failed to
detect the navigation deviation until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if human error, software problems or mechanical failures
were to blame, Cook said, ``We are essentially ruling out
spacecraft (mechanical) error and we are looking at the other
two.''
</P>
<P>
   The two spacecraft, Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander, are part
of a $327.5 million mission to Mars primarily to study its climate
for an understanding of conditions there in an earlier epoch that
might have been conducive to the emergence of life.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Mars Pathfinder and its roving vehicle,
Sojourner, explored the geology of the planet, and Global Surveyor
is photographing the surface for evidence of the planet's warmer,
wetter past.

CBS' `NOW AND AGAIN' MIXES BRAINS AND BODS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can't be said often enough: Most successful TV is wish
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Three's Company,'' an ordinary guy shares a bungalow with
two babes _ one blond, the other brunette. On ``The Cosby Show,'' a
prosperous black family is smoothly assimilated into the upper
middle class. On ``Friends,'' six young urban dwellers find
companionship and joy no farther away than across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Simpsons'' ... well, OK, not (set ital)all(end ital)
successful TV.
</P>
<P>
   CBS goes for a wish-fulfillment home run Friday night, with the
series premiere of ``Now and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   You might have heard rumors that CBS viewers tend to be a tad
older, maybe a year or 50, than typical viewers at the other
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Keep that in mind &LR; , &LR;  because in ``Now and Again,'' an aging,
overweight, beaten-down insurance exec (guest star John Goodman),
passed over for promotion and deemed expendable because of his age,
is jostled and falls fatally in front of an oncoming subway train.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, not many fulfilled wishes so far. But his government
has plans for the deceased Goodman. His brain is kept abuzz and
transferred to the cyborg body of Eric Close _ slim, young, buffed,
burnished.
</P>
<P>
   There's a scene of Goodman waking in a hospital bed, stumbling
to a mirror and confronting the taut face of Close. The music track
kicks into a version of ``Close to You.'' Goodman, now Close, pulls
open the front band of his pajama bottom and checks his
``package.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspection proves highly satisfactory to him. His exact
comment is, ``Holy crap!''
</P>
<P>
   This, emphatically, is what is meant by wish fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has been hyping ``Now and Again'' as ``The Six Million
Dollar Man'' meets ``The X-Files.'' Sure, but only half-right. Its
creator, Glenn Gordon Caron (``Moonlighting'') is gunning for
something grander, and yet more intimate, than rehashed sci-fi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' is also about becoming something you weren't,
and finally missing what you were.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Michael Wiseman (Goodman/Close), it's the obvious
thing _ family. Especially his wife Lisa (exquisitely played by
Margaret Colin).
</P>
<P>
   Close's character is told by his mysterious government handler
(Dennis Haysbert) that he mustn't try to establish contact with
anyone from his previous life. Shades of ``Seconds,'' a novel and
1966 movie in which a middle-aged businessman is transformed into
Rock Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   But Colin suspects, deep down, that her husband is still alive
and that he is determined to contact her. That's the real heart of
the show, and it's got nearly nothing in common with ``The Six
Million Dollar Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Matter of fact, that longing for dead or departed loved ones is
likelier to strike a chord with older viewers, not the sort of kids
who followed the stone cold Steve Austin on the 1970s ABC show.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is the thriller element. It seems Close's
government-configured body will be put to use finding ``The Egg
Man,'' an international terrorist fond of chemically induced mass
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you watch no more of ``Now and Again,'' try to catch the
first 10 minutes or so tonight. It's a suspenseful, beautifully
edited sequence in which ``The Egg Man'' targets a Tokyo subway
car. Superb.
</P>

<P>
   Two other newbies Friday night, and one notable TV event:
</P>
<P>
   _ NBC's ``Cold Feet,'' based on a British series, is a one-hour
comedy show about three Seattle couples struggling with commitment
issues.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dating couple (David Sutcliffe and Jean Louisa
Kelly), a married couple (William Keane and Dina Spybey)
anticipating their first child and another married couple (Anthony
Starke and Alicia Coppola) feeling the strains of parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   It might be thought of as a frothier ``thirtysomething,'' or
``latetwentysomething.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Cold Feet'' feels emotionally fraudulent. The only
memorable thing in the pilot is a scene of Sutcliffe singing and
parading nude in front of Kelly's window, with a rose wedged in his
buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ ABC's ``Odd Man Out'' is the season's second new sitcom about
a male living in an otherwise all-female environment.
</P>
<P>
   This time he's a 15-year-old (Erik von Detten). Markie Post
(``Night Court'') plays his mother, Jessica Capshaw (Kate's
daughter) his aunt, and Natalia Cigliuti, Vicki Davis and Marina
Malota his sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Post is always a capable presence, and I like Cigliuti's haughty
confidence as the eldest sister. But the show's fate will hinge on
von Detten's Throb-o-Meter appeal with adolescent girls. Hard to
gauge.
</P>
<P>
   The show's pilot was way too sex-suffused for ABC's
family-friendly TGIF slate and isn't airing Friday as the series
premiere. Next week, maybe?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Odd Man Out'' leads into ``20/20,'' where Hugh Downs,
retiring from ABC News, endures a special tribute. Here's hoping
that Downs' future is as Zenlike as his TV past. He's the only TV
news anchor who seemed to be meditating even as he spoke.

GEORGE C. SCOTT: GROWING INTO A LEADING MAN'S AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICK LaSALLE  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George C. Scott, who died Wednesday at 71, was a versatile
character actor who became a leading man through the force of his
personality.
</P>
<P>
   The Scott impact was made manifest in his penetrating features
and direct gaze _ but most palpably in that gruff voice, which he
could use like a bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   His films of the '70s, some of the most interesting of the
decade, are well worth seeing. But it's equally interesting to
check out the early Scott on video, to trace the development of a
screen giant.
</P>
<P>
   Even at his youngest _ he made his first film at 31 _ there was
a middle-aged man in Scott busting to get out. In his first year
making films, he had the privilege of playing James Stewart's
adversary in ``Anatomy of a Murder.'' As the district attorney, he
was snide and forceful and impervious to sentiment. He was
nominated for an Oscar in that role and for a similar coldhearted
turn opposite Paul Newman in ``The Hustler.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick gave him the sort of role that an actor dreams
of, in ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964). He got to break out of the
stiff, sneering stereotype and play a buffoonish general. His
antics hold up as well as those of Peter Sellers in that film. His
versatility was rewarded with a starring role in ``The Flim Flam
Man'' as a likable con artist.
</P>
<P>
   Scott had good luck playing generals, and he started the '70s,
his best decade, with his signature role in ``Patton'' (1970).
Scott's performance as the ambitious, charming, megalomaniacal,
fearless World War II general was the perfect meeting of actor and
role. It's hard to believe, in retrospect, that Scott was only 42
when he played it. He had the gravity, not to mention the physical
life, of a vigorous man 15 years or so older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patton'' _ and Scott's performance in it _ are destined for
rediscovery. Seen today, the film is the ultimate time capsule of
the Vietnam era, capturing, through the story of an earlier hero,
America's idealized vision of itself. The Vietnam parallels are
made obvious in the film's last scenes, in which the general
refuses to have a drink with his Communist allies.
</P>
<P>
   Scott won an Oscar, even though he had announced ahead of time
that he would refuse to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   He followed ``Patton'' with another tour de force in Paddy
Chayefsky's black comedy ``The Hospital'' (1971). Again, his vibe
was much older: He played a highly successful doctor at the end of
his rope, contemplating suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's ambition was never to make a lot of movies but to make
good ones. After a string of roles in the early '70s (``Oklahoma
Crude,'' ``Day of the Dolphin,'' ``Bank Shot''), his output slowed.
But he was at his best late in the decade with Paul Schrader's
``Hardcore'' in 1979, about a father who discovers that his
daughter is making pornographic films, and in 1980, starring
opposite Marlon Brando in ``The Formula.''
</P>
<P>
   The good roles seemed to dry up for Scott in his 50s, and his
appearances in the past two decades were sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   His best opportunities were, in fact, on television _ a
memorable turn as Scrooge in the 1984 ``A Christmas Carol'' and,
even better, the starring role in the docudrama ``Mussolini: The
Untold Story.''

LESSON IN OBSTRUCTIONIST PAINTING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Miracle on Page Street:
</P>
<P>
   At John Muir Elementary, corner of Page and Webster, it looks
like the endless game of paint-chip Ping-Pong is about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Any number can play. You simply find an excuse for not doing
whatever needs to be done to get rid of the blizzard of potentially
toxic paint chips floating onto the Muir playground. Using your
excuse, you bat the blame back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wins; the kids all lose. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the city, the school and the neighborhood
association have been dogging owner Sharon Borden to fix the badly
peeling side of her rental Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   The side wall looms, big as a drive-in movie screen, over the
Muir playground.
</P>
<P>
   Borden's house has dandruff. It rains yellow paint flakes, some
as big as potato chips, onto the kickball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Because the house and paint are old, the chips probably contain
lead, which can be hazardous to kids, especially the 4-year-olds in
Muir's pre-kindergarten program.
</P>
<P>
   Borden's attorney, Jerry Liberatore, said the school district
promised to remove a chain-link fence along the bottom of the house
so painters could do the job. Fence removal and replacement cost:
$3,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they reneged on pulling down the fence,'' Liberatore said
Tuesday. ``They agreed to do it, then they called and said they
didn't have the money.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true,'' said Paul Cardoni, project manager for the school
district.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoni said Liberatore asked the school district to pay the
$3,500 fence bill. Cardoni said he would ask, then came back to
Liberatore with word that the district nixed the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Liberatore, tiring of boring phone conversation with me
Wednesday, added, ``Don't you (newspaper) guys have anything better
to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Not today, amigo. Couldn't get a tee time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a teacher was threatening to bust up the paint-chip
Ping-Pong game. First-grade teacher Dave Wish, in his first year at
Muir, circulated a petition among students, pleading for Borden to
clean up her flaky act.
</P>
<P>
   The school is old but very neat and clean and tidy, and the big
house isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affront to the entire school,'' Wish said, ``to have
to look at this big-ass ugly building.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was heating up; more lawyers were about to get
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wednesday afternoon I got a phone call from a spokesperson
for the school district:
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is resolved,'' Sandina Robbins said. ``We've
talked to the contractor, and we'll work with him to accommodate
the painting, because we are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Mr. Chips.
</P>
<P>
   ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE who either rides Muni or doesn't: Give us
more Muni Toons.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, more of those totally hidden home videos of badly injured
and disabled Muni workers kayaking and car-washing while we pay for
their never-ending vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and Muni have launched a crackdown on workers' comp
cheaters, kicking off the campaign by showing surveillance video of
four such alleged liars-liars-pants-on-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Give us more, show the videos on TV. Show 'em at a movie
theater. I'll buy popcorn for the house.
</P>
<P>
   Those videos are even more fun to watch than the home-video TV
shows that feature guys getting hit in the groin with Frisbees.
</P>
<P>
   THE GIANTS' NEW BALLPARK passed a recent rigid feng shui
inspection. Everything in the park is perfectly aligned to promote
free-flowin' chi (life force), resulting in harmony and pennants.
But Mark Adamsbaum still worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just know,'' he says, ``that some 15-year-old hot-dog
fryer is gonna line up the dogs in the wrong direction and shoot
the whole chi energy thing to hell, no matter how many palm trees
they have outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like Mark's chi is a quart low.
</P>
<P>
   And Carol Baylor wonders when people are going to start
suggesting that the new ballpark be called Fengway Park or Shui
(Schway) Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be confused with Candlestick Park, which on that fateful
day in '89 became Sway Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   BILGEBOARD UPDATE: That billboard-on-a-barge that is already
floating in the Bay alongside 101 south of Candlestick might be
headed for stormy seas.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Leslie Katz points out that a '96 S.F. law prohibits
floating ads. The bay south of Candlestick is out of S.F. waters,
but Katz is issuing a warning.
</P>
<P>
   She's introducing a resolution urging the state, and the other
counties involved, to ban the barge. And:
</P>
<P>
   ``Should that floating eyesore drift into our waters,`` she
says, ``they will be keelhauled (a slight exaggeration).''
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Douglas Berry wonders, ``Doesn't the city have an old
attack submarine at Aquatic Park?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a little violent, Douglas. But the keelhauling idea has
merit.

JUDGE SENTENCES WOMAN WHO GAVE HER CHILDREN MORPHINE TO 5 YEARS IN
PRISON 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 19-year-old woman who used morphine to quiet five of
six small children in her care was sentenced Thursday to five years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge J. Michael Wilkinson sentenced Maria
Avellaneda to five concurrent five-year terms after she pleaded
guilty to five charges of serious bodily injury to a child.
</P>
<P>
   Avellaneda, who was arrested in February, could have received
anywhere from two to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each
of the second-degree felony charges, said prosecutor James Alston,
who argued for at least 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities learned of the situation in October 1998 when two of
six children, ages 22 months to 6 years, living with Avellaneda and
her two sisters in an apartment in southwest Houston, became ill.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas Children's Hospital, the two children were found to be
suffering respiratory failure. When tests showed they had ingested
morphine, the rest of the children were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   All but one 6-year-old girl tested positive for morphine, and
all appeared to have ingested varying amounts over a period of
time, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The morphine belonged to one of the defendant's sisters, who had
terminal cancer and had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason she ever gave it to the children was to
apparently relax the kids and she thought it would make them feel
better because it made her sister feel better,'' Alston said.
</P>
<P>
   Avellaneda also tested positive for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Avellaneda and the third sister went to Mexico to bury their
sister. Afterward, she returned to the United States but at a new
address, so it took police some time to locate her and resume the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Alston said the five of the six children are now either with
their parents or various relatives. Avellaneda's son, who was 3 at
the time of the offense, is being cared for by foster parents.

 &HT;    From small apartment, business grew tall
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although the MindSpring brand name will eventually be
absorbed into the EarthLink brand name, the story of the company's
humble beginnings will remain the stuff Internet legends are made
of.
</P>
<P>
   In countless speeches and interviews, Chairman and founder
Charles Brewer has honed the tale of how a bright young man looking
for a better way to access the Internet now finds himself at the
head of the nation's second-largest Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer founded MindSpring in his apartment in the Ansley Park
section of Atlanta, where he was founder, chairman, product manager
and customer service representative. In his spare time he also
worked as public relations director, taking advantage of Usenet
newsgroups and anything else he could think of to get the word out
about MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   The first MindSpring users were primarily Atlanta residents, but
as the word spread through the Southeast, Brewer moved into modest
office space on West Peachtree Street. Subscribers, analysts and
consumers were charmed by Brewer's low-key, self-deprecating style
and his insistence you could run a business with integrity and
respect for your customers, shareholders and employees. When
MindSpring was founded in 1994, the Internet was hip, uncharted
territory populated by mavericks, entrepreneurs and Web geeks
looking to break even doing work they loved. Brewer's now-legendary
core values and beliefs, which guide the company, also helped it
forge the reputation as the type of ISP the Internet's earliest
adopters would want to use.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1994, MindSpring had a few hundred customers
and had attracted the attention of ITC Holding, which decided to
invest. ITC Chairman Cam Lanier had a long record of building
successful and profitable telecommunications companies. The ITC
influence would be one of the major drivers in MindSpring's overall
philosophy of keeping an eye on the bottom line and working toward
profitability. That, combined with Brewer's commitment to providing
service and support to MindSpring users, separated it from the pack
of companies in the ISP industry.
</P>
<P>
   ITC's funding helped MindSpring expand to eventually become the
largest ISP in the Southeast. In 1996 the company went public,
trading under the Nasdaq symbol MSPG. By 1998, MindSpring was the
largest ISP in the Southeast, with about 350,000 subscribers. In
March of that year, the stock took its first huge leap as Internet
stocks began to take off. The stock surge began the first of the
many takeover rumors that would follow the company after that.
</P>
<P>
   Takeover rumors were rampant, but Brewer insisted he had no
plans to sell his company. Instead, as the stock price soared,
MindSpring began a string of acquisitions culminating with the
SpryNet acquistion in 1998. The acquisition of Netcom for $245
million in 1999 doubled MindSpring's subscriber base and made it a
major industry player.
</P>
<P>
   This year the company also launched MindSpring Biz, a separate
division for business and Web-hosting customers.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, MindSpring issued a cryptic press release
saying the company was in talks with a wide variety of companies
but declined to name names or discuss specifics. That statement led
to a feeding frenzy among the media, analysts and other industry
pundits who linked MindSpring with everyone from Dell Computer to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust finally settled, MindSpring found the perfect
partner in fellow ISP EarthLink. The new company is now the clear
No. 2 ISP in the country, with 3 million subscribers. The company
makes no secret of its goal of taking on and eventually catching
undisputed industry leader America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer was very upbeat Thursday when he spoke to press and
analysts to announce the EarthLink merger and the companywide
adoption of his core values and beliefs, along with the addition of
a new core value that reads, ``We love to compete and we believe
that competition brings out the best in us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to compete,'' Brewer said, ``But you haven't seen
anything yet. We may be No. 2 in size, but we are No. 1 in customer
satisfaction. With our combined marketing muscle, we are going to
make sure everyone in the country knows who we are.''

`FREAKS AND GEEKS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(``Tonight'' refers to Saturday, Sept. 25)  
BY DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Freaks and Geeks'' grows on you, steadily and
assuredly. The high-school kids on this show aren't the glib,
physically polished, hyper-verbal motormouths that are strewn
across the television landscape these days on shows from ``Dawson's
Creek'' to ``Get Real.'' They're inarticulate and reticent about
discussing their feelings, their jokes are sometimes strained,
they're gawky and have teeth and hair and faces that don't look
pathologically fussed over.
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of how distorted TV's pernicious view of life is
that it's initially disorienting to see such specimens _ real-life
kids you'd see ambling down your street _ actually on TV. Once that
shock wears off, more follow _ here's a TV show that's sensitive
without being treacly, that's funny without being cluttered by
sardonic performances, and is intelligent even though most of its
characters are head-bangers or sci-fi fans.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a Michigan suburban high school in 1980, ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' which premieres tonight, centers around Lindsay Weir
(Linda Cardellini). Her grandmother has recently died, forcing her
to reconsider her values, and she's drifting from her elitist,
smart friends to a clique of burnouts. Her brother Sam (John Daley)
is a classic geek freshman, bullied by toughs (who call him
``weird'') and pining for unattainable cheerleaders (even they look
like real people). Even the teachers can barely mask their
assessment of Sam as a wuss.
</P>
<P>
   Nick (Jason Segel) tries to cheer Lindsay up by getting her to
cut class. His aspiration is to be a rock 'n' roll drummer; six
more additions to his kit and he'll have a bigger set-up than Neil
Peart of Rush. Sam's buddy Neal (Samm Levine) does bad imitations
of pop-culture icons and pragmatically sits idly by while Sam is
hassled by a bully.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Flaherty (``SCTV'') plays Lindsay and Sam's dad, whose every
piece of parental advice includes an anecdote about someone who
broke a rule and died as a result, regardless of what the rule may
have been. ``You know who used to cut class?'' he barks. ``Jimi
Hendrix!'' At least they're more entertaining than the
``when-I-was-your-age'' spiels so many of us had to endure.
Naturally, Lindsay tries to avoid her parents as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Feig created the series, and executive produces it with
Emmy winner Judd Apatow, who has worked on two of the best shows of
the past decade, ``The Ben Stiller Show'' and ``The Larry Sanders
Show.'' Together, they capture the paranoia, confusion and humor
endemic in the ordeal of coming of age. Tonight's episode doesn't
feature any big plot points _ the guys try to survive dodge ball
and a bully; Lindsay's efforts to defend a student with Down
syndrome backfire and she's forced against her will to attend the
homecoming dance _ but it's all engaging and realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Cardellini is the heart and soul of the production, resonantly
conveying her humane character's roiling turmoil as she slowly
begins to realize that, contrary to everything she's been taught,
being a good person doesn't make life any easier.
</P>
<P>
   The grace with which Apatow and Feig depict their coterie of
characters growing awkwardly into adulthood is about the only grace
in the show. ``Freaks and Geeks'' is a series that both teens and
parents can cherish _ but they'll likely be doing it before
separate TVs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Freaks and Geeks.'' &QL; 
What: Hourlong comedy-drama examining the high-school caste system
circa 1980. &QL; 
Who: Linda Cardellini, John Daley, Samm Levine, James Franco, Busy
Phillips, Jason Segel, Martin Starr, Seth Rogen, Joe Flaherty,
Becky Ann Baker. &QL; 
Where: NBC (Channel 4). &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL; 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars &QL;

 &HT;    EarthLink CEO no stranger to MindSpring
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises and Pasadena, Calif.-based
EarthLink built their reputations and their businesses in different
regions, only starting to compete as each grew large enough to
strive for national status. But despite EarthLink's West Coast
address, Charles ``Garry'' Betty, chief executive officer of
EarthLink, was plenty visible all along to MindSpring, the company
founded by Charles Brewer in his Atlanta apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Betty's company might have the cachet of southern California,
but his experience has been more grits than tofu.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Columbus, Ga., and an alumnus of Georgia Tech, Betty
not only has run several Atlanta-area companies, but has maintained
an Atlanta home throughout his tenure at EarthLink. Betty became
something of a linchpin in the negotiations that led up to the
merger announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to Garry's roots in Atlanta and his prominence in the
technology community, and Sky Dayton's prominence, they ran into
Charles Brewer quite a bit,'' said W. Tinley Anderson III, a
partner with Hunton &AMP; Williams, the law firm that represents
EarthLink. ``I think Charles Brewer and Garry knew each other
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty's past includes a stint with IBM, then a top job at Hayes
Microcomputer when the now-defunct company was becoming the world's
leading modem-maker. He left Hayes in the late 1980s, going to
Digital Communications Associations, which was later sold to
Attachmate Corp. of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He ran and owned Atlanta-based Physicians Data Corp., which
builds medical databases .
</P>
<P>
   Betty joined EarthLink in 1996 at the behest of Dayton, then in
his mid-twenties. On Thursday, Dayton described himself as one of
the ``visionaries'' who foresaw the power of the Net ``to redefine
the way people communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded within a few weeks of each other, EarthLink and
MindSpring grew quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly on parallel tracks, both companies found themselves in
a market where size was becoming increasingly important. And while
both were growing quickly _ albeit in different ways _ they were
falling increasingly further behind America Online, which has 17
million members and an estimated 20 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Both MindSpring and EarthLink have apparently been scouring the
Internet landscape for partnerships and alliances that might offer
them a chance of catching up. MindSpring especially was close to
pulling the trigger on several agreements, only to back away.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Brewer and Betty had a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, Charles and Garry talked and they realized they
were much better allies than competitors,'' Anderson said. ``As
allies, they could commit all their resources. It was the
acknowledgement of that synergy that brought them together.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Betty was in New York with MindSpring's management,
unavailable for comment and apparently immersed in a flurry of
analyst meetings and investor briefings.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal he started negotiating in August was done. There
had been no hostile takeover, no angry stalling by Sprint, no
bitter and drawn-out battle for each inch of corporate turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done this thing in about 30 days,'' Anderson said.
``But an awful lot was done by an awful lot of people over a lot of
hours. It is mind-boggling.''

 &HT;    Wronged wife gets a free shot in `Double Jeopardy'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you haven't had all the surprises spoiled by the movie's
tell-all trailer, you might wring some mild thrills out of ``Double
Jeopardy.'' It's a handsomely made, entertainingly far-fetched
flick that brings a gender bend to the innocent-on-the-run plot of
``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   That movie's Oscar-winning star, Tommy Lee Jones, lends his
gravelly gravitas to the role of Travis, a tough parole officer who
runs a halfway house for ex-convicts. The newest arrival is Libby
(Ashley Judd), newly released for murdering her husband, Nick
(Bruce Greenwood).
</P>
<P>
   The twist is that not only is Libby innocent of the crime, but
the crime never occurred. The ``corpse'' set up his own apparent
demise, framed Libby, raked in some insurance money and moved on
with their young son in tow, changing his identity en route.
</P>
<P>
   Libby doesn't care about clearing her name, having already spent
six years in the slammer. She just wants to track down her
greaseball ex and get even. Thanks to the legal loophole known as
double jeopardy, she knows she can murder the guy in the middle of
a crowd of witnesses. And the law can't touch her, since she's
already been tried once for that very crime. (The movie softens her
quest by making her wish to reunite with her son as strong a
motivation as the need for payback.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Libby can't very well settle old scores while heeding an 8
p.m. curfew every night, she's soon on the lam, trying to figure
out Nick's new name and zip code, with Travis in hot pursuit. Jones
is so typecast in this kind of role, you expect him to respond to
Libby's claims of innocence with the same exasperated ``I don't
care'' he volleyed at Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   For better and for worse, ``Double Jeopardy'' glides along with
the smooth, impersonal efficiency of the sailboat that sets up the
movie's first big twist. David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook's
script presents Libby less as an individual than a collection of
skills that serve the needs of each scene. She's tough enough to
break into a locked building and put a pursuer out of commision by
totalling his car, but she can also finesse her way into an Armani
dress, charged to an unsuspecting matron's account. (Talk about
having it all!) But when Libby nears her prey, after risking so
much to get there, the script forces her to behave stupidly,
dropping her hard-earned guard long enough to land in peril.
</P>
<P>
   The movie punctuates her search with action sequences, some
better than others. There's a terrific bit involving Libby, Travis
and a quickly sinking car. There's also the occasional clunker,
like an unexciting Jeep chase on a beach.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jones is top-billed, the movie belongs to Judd. As usual,
she is striking to watch, with an acting technique that's more
admirable than engaging. Like the movie, she's technically polished
and gets the job done, but the performance doesn't linger in your
memory once the credits roll.
</P>
<P>
   The movie benefits from director Bruce Beresford's seasoned
professionalism, paired with longtime collaborator Peter James'
glistening cinematography. The film makes the most of its
photogenic settings in British Columbia and New Orleans. James even
invigorates an old-hat scene that has Jones trying to track Judd
through a moody New Orleans street, crowded with umbrellas and
neon.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Double Jeopardy'' is not much more than a pleasant
time-waster, at least it presents a sure-fire technique for
handling unwanted come-ons. As Libby finds out, mentioning your
parole officer usually squelches the sparks of any would-be
lotharios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Double
</P>
<P>
   Jeopardy''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. Rated R for
language,sexuality and some violence.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An enjoyable but generic bit of gender-bent action.

 &HT;    Powerful actor best known as `Patton'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we think of George C. Scott, one image immediately springs
to mind: Scott as Gen. George S. Patton, decked out in military
jodhpurs and helmet, standing in front of the most enormous
American flag ever to grace a movie screen. The movie is
``Patton,'' Oscar's best film of 1970 and, by many accounts,
Richard M. Nixon's favorite movie of all time.
</P>
<P>
   It is an image that in many ways defines Scott. The father
figure as brilliant, gutsy eccentric. Fearless. Vigorous.
Resourceful. And absolutely, uncontrollably erratic. He could be
gentle one moment _ the protective, compassionate daddy _ and
violent the next _ the punishing, domineering daddy. You loved him
or you hated him _ or, perhaps, both _ but you never, ever crossed
him. There was in Scott a kind of craggy Old Testament power. No
wonder John Huston cast him as Abraham in ``The Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 71, who died Wednesday afternoon of a ruptured abdominal
aortic aneurysm at his home 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, was,
in a sense, the last angry man. He seemed possessed by a complex
inner volatility that blasted through his acting roles. Essentially
a character actor _ the broken nose and boxer's build so dictated _
his mere presence was so powerful that it propelled him to stardom
almost in spite of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, he blew most other actors off the screen, whether it
was Jimmy Stewart in ``Anatomy of a Murder'' or Paul Newman in
``The Hustler.''
</P>
<P>
   Both these films earned him Oscar nominations for best
supporting actor. But the nomination for which he will always be
remembered was as best actor for ``Patton.'' He declined the nod,
telling the press, ``The ceremonies are a two-hour meat parade, a
public display with contrived suspense for economic reasons.'' He
won anyway. But unlike Marlon Brando who, three years later, also
declined the honor, he didn't send a Hollywood babe to pick up the
statue and serve as his mouthpiece. When Scott said no thanks, he
meant it. He sat home and watched hockey. Apparently, his Oscar
still sits in the academy vault.
</P>
<P>
   What most people don't know is that Scott's refusal to
participate was no trendy late '60s anti-Establish-ment gesture. In
1961, after being notified of his nomination for ``The Hustler,''
Scott asked that his name be withdrawn, likening the Oscars to ``a
weird beauty or personality contest.''
</P>
<P>
   And the academy? After he rejected the award, it nominated him
again in 1971 for his lead role as a disillusioned doctor in ``The
Hospital.'' This time he lost to Gene Hackman for ``The French
Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Hospital's'' director, Arthur Hiller, Scott
hadn't meant to create a furor over ``Patton''; he just wanted the
academy to know his feelings. He told Hiller that if he ever won
again, he would accept the Oscar, explaining, ``It was just too
much trouble not to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet trouble was often what Scott was all about. For all his
talent and success on screen, off screen he was a deeply troubled
man who, when stoked by booze, turned easily to violence. Ava
Gardner, who co-starred with him in ``The Bible'' and became
romantically involved with him, devotes a chapter of her
autobiography to his fearful and very physical rages. Not
surprisingly, he was married five times _ twice to Colleen Dewhurst
(their son, Campbell Scott is a successful actor).
</P>
<P>
   Born Oct. 18, 1927, in Wise, Va., George Campbell Scott studied
journalism at the University of Missouri and served in the Marines.
But acting was his true calling _ college productions, summer
stock, off-Broadway, Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   His first film role was in a Gary Cooper western, ``The Hanging
Tree,'' made in 1959, the same year he played the prosecuting
attorney in Otto Preminger's ``Anatomy of a Murder.'' He worked
steadily throughout the '60s and '70s. As Minnesota Fats'
enigmatic, milk-swilling ``banker'' in ``The Hustler''; as Gen.
Buck Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove''; as a
detective doggedly tracking his way through a cast of disguised
celebrity cameos in Huston's ``The List of Adrian Messenger''; as a
rascally con artist in ``The Flim Flam Man''; as a delusional
Sherlock Holmes wannabe in ``They Might Be Giants''; as a
Hemingway-esque artist in ``Islands in the Stream''; as a vengeful
Calvinist father cutting a swath through the porn underworld in
Paul Schrader's ``Hardcore''; as a reluctant ghost hunter in the
chilling and little-seen ``The Changeling''; as the inflexible
general in ``Taps.'' He also directed two films, the (tellingly?)
titled ``Rage'' and ``The Savage Is Loose.'' Both co-starred his
spouse Trish Van Devere. Both flopped.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid '80s, aside from some halfhearted dabbling, he'd all
but quit the movies, devoting his time to the stage and television.
He won an Emmy in 1998 as feisty Juror No. 3 in Showtime's
mesmerizing version of ``12 Angry Men'' and starred in more than 30
other television productions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether his movie ``retirement'' was entirely voluntary remains
an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Scott cultivated a reputation as a difficult personality and a
mean drunk. Huston, something of a hell-raiser himself, wrote in
his memoir, ``An Open Book,'' ``I have little use for Scott as a
private person, but my admiration for him as an actor is
unbounded.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, perhaps, is how we all remember Scott. Not with
affection or even nostalgia, but with a wary admiration.
</P>
<P>
   The years following ``Patton'' should've been peak years with
one outstanding portrayal after another. Instead, rather like
Patton's post-World War II career, they were a hit-and-miss time of
slow but undeniable decline in which temperament got the best of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller attributed Scott's unique gift to an ``ability to produce
an emotional response in you, the audience.'' Looking back, we see
he gave us extraordinary performances. We also see that he gave us
too few of them.

   TUNGSHIH, Taiwan _ The front half of Wang Chong-shih's
third-floor apartment has disappeared, but the rear half remains
intact.
</P>
<P>
   When Wang opens his bedroom door, instead of looking down a
narrow hallway, he looks outside at the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It is disconcerting. But he refuses to move, ignoring government
orders to evacuate and pleas from his wife to stay with her in a
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty strange,'' said Wang, 57, who owns a camera store.
``Part of my home is still here, like it was before, and the rest
is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for the entire city, which has reported the
highest number of deaths from the earthquake that devastated Taiwan
earlier this week. More than 430 residents have died in Tungshih,
out of the more than 2,100 deaths reported.
</P>
<P>
   One street in the middle of town looked clean and remarkably
unaffected; the next one over resembled a wasteland of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious damage to human life and property, the
earthquake seemed to have left a deep psychological scar. Survivors
feel lucky, yet they are burdened with the knowledge that they knew
so many of those who died.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in my family was hurt,'' said Wang, his eyes widening
momentarily, before he grimaced with his next thought: ``Half my
neighbors are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On Ben Street, where Wang's half-home stands, many of the
buildings collapsed when the earthquake struck early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cathay Tea House was standing, seemingly undamaged. But next
door, a house seemed to have vanished, leaving remnants of a tile
roof on the ground and, inexplicably, a child's chest of drawers
that was somehow thrust forward and left intact on the sidewalk.
One drawer hung open, showing a neatly folded stack of cotton
shirts inside.
</P>
<P>
   Several doors down the street, rescue workers dug through the
rubble of a collapsed five-story building, where more than 20
people are still believed to be buried. Rescue workers from South
Korea, wearing navy blue vests emblazoned with the name ``Samsung''
on the breast, looked on as Taiwanese soldiers dug through the
rubble. The soldiers were guided by a makeshift map of the
building's layout, drawn up with the help of a resident who had
escaped the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of dogs, also wearing Samsung vests, took turns touring
the debris, sniffing for the scent of a human, alive or dead.
Shortly after noon, one of the dogs indicated that it had found
something, but an hour of excruciatingly careful digging yielded
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can smell a person, but the problem is that they cannot
identify the spot exactly,'' said a Taiwanese rescue worker.
``There's too much chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue work has also been slowed by the collapse of bridges on
two roads that connect Tungshih, a city of 60,000 located a few
miles into the mountains, with the more accessible coastal areas of
central Taiwan. Some towns farther inland have been unable to
receive any outside help, despite efforts by the army to deliver
emergency supplies by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Ben Street, Liu Yu-chun, a 20-year-old woman sitting
with her sister in a broken chair outside the remains of her
family's cosmetics store, mused about the fact that she was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liu considered herself lucky. At first she laughed easily at
her fortune, though she grew more pensive as she described how odd
it felt to have escaped unscathed on a street where so many
neighbors have disappeared. Five houses collapsed right across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether to be happy or sad,'' said Ms. Liu,
thoughtfully resting her hands behind her head. ``I don't know how
I should feel.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, for no particular reason, Ms. Liu broke her
habit of sleeping on the third floor of the family home upstairs
from the cosmetics store, and settled in with her sister on the
second floor. After the earthquake jolted them shortly before 2
a.m. on Tuesday, Ms. Liu realized that if she had been on the third
floor, she might have been crushed by remnants of a neighboring
house that smashed through a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extra lucky,'' she said. ``I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   With the packaging damaged for almost all of the cosmetics in
the store, Ms. Liu wondered whether she should be giving the
products away to rescue workers.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, two nurses walked by, looking somewhat haggard. One
of them carried a gray body bag, to be ready in case the soldiers
found another victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like they need some makeup,'' Ms. Liu said, trying
to make a joke.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A few blocks away, on Sanmin Street, an even more disasterous
building collapse attracted crowds of rescue workers and onlookers.
A politician, Taipei's former mayor, Chen Shui-bian, also showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Wangchao Mansion, the building was a majestic
13-story apartment, completed last year and widely known as the
fanciest and most expensive address in Tungshih.
</P>
<P>
   But now, what was left of it was wedged against another building
at an impossible-looking angle. More than 100 residents are
believed to be buried inside.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of rescue workers entered and left through what was a
third-floor window, now the most accessible entry. Yellow cranes
encircled the building.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, the politician who heads Taiwan's Democratic Progressive
Party, is one of three leading candidates for president in an
election scheduled for March. Apparently eager to be seen at the
scene of a disaster, Chen expressed a need for compassion and
generosity to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, visited Tungshih on Tuesday,
immediately after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing this big has ever happened to Tungshih before,'' said
Wang Chang-min, a businessman. ``It's too bad it has to be this.''

HOUSE APPROVES BILL THAT WOULD MAKE CLASS-ACTION SUITS HARDER TO
WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Iowa, Wis., Texas, N.C.) (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives approved legislation
Thursday that would make it difficult, if not impossible, to bring
successful large class-action lawsuits against tobacco companies,
gun makers and a wide variety of other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was supported by many major industries, from
automobile and chemical producers to small aircraft makers and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   It would require state court judges, who have often been more
sympathetic to plaintiffs in such suits, to transfer most of their
class-action lawsuits to federal courts. The federal rules on class
actions are often more stringent than many state court procedures
and, as a result, plaintiffs' lawyers have been making greater and
more successful use of state courts in recent years in many kinds
of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., Thursday's measure was
approved 222-207 on a vote largely along party lines. It followed
heavy lobbying and ferocious campaign fund-raising on both sides _
big business versus the trial lawyers _ and is similar to a bill
that enjoys bipartisan support in the Senate. The Senate bill is
sponsored by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Herb Kohl, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Thursday that they had recommended
that the president veto the legislation if it reaches his desk
because it would lead to the widespread dismissal of many kinds of
claims that plaintiffs are now winning, and which have had the
effect of protecting consumers and deterring corporate misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the House legislation said that the measure is
aimed at ending abusive maneuvers by trial lawyers. They condemned
what they say is a growing number of instances where state judges
are making decisions that have nationwide implications in tobacco
and other lawsuits against businesses. The supporters also say that
state court judges are often biased against out-of-state
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The cases affected would include everything from employment
discrimination, environmental disasters and health care fraud, to
product liability cases such as asbestos suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will correct a statutory anomaly, as well as the
gaming of the system by plaintiff attorneys,'' said Rep. James
Moran, D-Va., and one of the sponsors of the legislation. ``Now a
judge in one state decides the laws in all the states. But I don't
want the laws of Virginia to be decided by some judge in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the legislation said that it was outrageous for
a Congress that has left so many federal judgeships vacant _ by
failing to confirm White House's nominees _ to now be broadly
expanding the caseload of an already overworked federal judiciary.
There are 64 vacancies in the federal district and appeals courts,
and judges have complained that their workload has increased
dramatically, in part because of legislation that has created new
federal crimes and in part because Congress has not created any new
judge positions for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, critics said, those class-action lawsuits that
would not be dismissed by the federal courts as a result of the
legislation would be significantly delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a sealed, locked, closed and forever
impenetrable door to justice,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Texas. Other opponents of the legislation called it a form of
``backdoor immunity'' for tobacco companies and gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's critics include a policy group of federal
judges headed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Conference of
Chief Justices of state courts, 15 state attorneys general, a
number of lawyer organizations, and a broad array of civil rights,
disabilities, consumer, anti-tobacco, gun control and health care
groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent months, there has been heavy lobbying on both sides of
the legislation, an important piece of what supporters have called
tort reform. While the full amount of spending will not be known
for months, when lobbyists must file disclosure statements, both
sides have spent millions of dollars in recent years in both
lobbying fees and campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations pushing for the legislation include some of
the nation's most significant business interests, including the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Chemical Manufacturers Association,
DaimlerChrysler and General Motors, the International Mass Retail
Association, Pfizer, Philip Morris, Procter &AMP; Gamble. The lobbyists
working for the legislation have included Jack Quinn, a former
White House counsel in the Clinton administration, and Arthur
Culvahouse Jr., a former White House counsel to President Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable opponents of the legislation included the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America and Public Citizen, a
consumer group founded by Ralph Nader that led a coalition of other
public interest organizations. Nader met at the White House last
month with John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, along with
representatives from the trial lawyers and other groups. The groups
working to defeat the bill include the American Heart and Lung
Associations, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free kids, the Violence
Policy Center (a gun control group), and a number of labor
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was endorsed by a number of Republican lawmakers
who campaigned on pledges of returning political power to the
states. Thursday they found themselves in the position of arguing
that the state courts need to be curtailed and that the federal
judiciary is better equipped to handle cases. While the Republicans
said the issues were not the same, some Democrats said it reflected
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same people who say we need to return power to
the local level, to the individual level, and here they are now
arguing to bring this back to the federal government,'' said Rep.
Melvin L. Watt, D-N.C. ``This is absolutely contrary to the horse
that my colleagues road to the Congress on, the states' rights
horse.''

 &HT;    Delta, pilot union strike deal for new planes, pay raises
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines and its pilot union announced a pay
agreement Thursday for two new aircraft models, enabling the
carrier to get its fleet upgrade plan back on course.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and the union said they reached a tentative deal on rates
for both the Boeing 777, breaking a months-long stalemate over the
international plane, and for the Boeing 767-400, used for domestic
travel.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which also includes a pay raise for pilots of other
aircraft, removes any labor obstacles that would prevent Delta from
smoothly deploying the new planes.
</P>
<P>
   It also eases tensions as the two sides begin broader
negotiations on a new contract to replace one inked in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Executive Leo Mullin said Thursday's deal ``sets a
constructive tone'' for the new contract talks, which started Sept.
8 and are expected to months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use a football analogy,'' said Charles Giambusso, chairman
of Delta's Air Line Pilots Association unit, ``this is a big score
for the Delta pilots, but the game is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta got its first two 777s amid much fanfare last spring, then
halted further deliveries. It blamed a pay rate standoff with ALPA,
which had threatened to invoke its contractual right to stop flying
the model without an agreement by Nov. 1. Delta also said it would
sell the first two 777s.
</P>
<P>
   ALPA accused Delta of using the pay dispute to mask the real
reason for the order delay, concern over industry overcapacity on
trans-Atlantic routes. The airline has denied that.
</P>
<P>
   The 777 pay talks quietly resumed a few weeks ago and were
wrapped into 767-400 negotiations that started in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deal means the two 777s will remain in service, and
Mullin said Delta will seek to reschedule the deferred deliveries
``as quickly as possible.'' The airline had originally planned to
have 11 in service by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries of the 767-400, slated to replace Delta's aging
Lockheed L-1011s on longer domestic routes, start next spring. The
airline has 21 on order, plus options for more.
</P>
<P>
   Delta shares jumped more than $2 on news of the tentative deal
Thursday morning, then skidded back to $47.31 1/4, down 12 1/2
cents for the day. The agreement still must be approved by union
leaders and members in votes within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of difficult pilot negotiations has been a dark
cloud over Delta, with the 777 logjam highlighting the tension,''
said PaineWebber analyst Sam Buttrick. ``This clears the skies a
little, albeit at a price.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ An initial rate of $250 an hour for 777 captains, up from
Delta's previous offer of $239 but short of ALPA's prior proposal
of $319.
</P>
<P>
   _ An initial rate of $230 for 767-400 captains, compared with
Delta's initial offer of $208 and ALPA's request for $262.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also calls for conversion of an annual profit sharing
bonus to salary on Jan. 1, raising pay 6 percent. With that added
boost, a 777 captain will get $265 an hour, or $238,500 a year
based on a standard 75-hour month. A 767-400 captain will get
$243.80 an hour or $219,420 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The profit sharing conversion also applies to other Delta
pilots. In addition, they'll get a 3 percent pay increase. The only
models exempt from that raise are new versions of the 737, covered
under a separate pay pact from earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes elimination of a long-standing
``b-scale'' under which certain junior pilots are paid
significantly less.
</P>
<P>
   Giambusso called the b-scale cut ``a milestone'' and said Delta
will be the first carrier at which ALPA has been able to eliminate
the scale. Killing the b-scale was a union goal in the new contract
talks.
</P>
<P>
   All pay rates are still subject to change in the new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said the 777/767-400 pact ``balances the best interests
of our company and our pilots.'' He added it will enable Delta to
``move forward with our plans for offering our customers'' a more
modern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The highly efficient, twin-engine 777 is considered crucial for
any carrier competing on trans-Atlantic routes. United, American,
Continental and British Airways already fly the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 777 is becoming the gold standard for trans-Atlantic
service, and either you have them or you don't,'' said Buttrick.
``Getting the 777 on the property at Delta is in everybody's
interests _ pilots, shareholders and customers'.''

SYMPATHETIC MENGELE FILM STIRS CONTROVERSY IN GERMANY

<P>
   BERLIN _ When a controversial film that tries to humanize the
Nazi concentration camp doctor Josef Mengele opened here Thursday,
Ursula Mueller-Wissler's 10th-grade class made up about half of the
audience at the Cinemaxx in Potsdamer Platz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my idea,'' the teacher explained sheepishly. ``My
students wanted to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The German film ``Nichts Als Die Wahrheit,'' or ``Nothing But
the Truth,'' which opened to lukewarm reviews, breaks one of the
country's last taboos by dealing with the concentration camps. But
the filmmakers have been criticized for employing a fictional
Mengele, one who doesn't slither away and die but stands up to
justice in modern-day Germany, one who tries to pass himself off as
a mercy killer, one cheered on by skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   That concept is revolting to many Germans. Some think the film
should not have been made, let alone seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Beast is Made Harmless,'' said a headline in the Bild
newspaper over its negative review. The newspaper accused the
filmmakers of being irresponsible and ``lacking the ability to
comprehend one of the worst criminals of human history.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the Jewish Cultural Center, a few doors down from the
Neue Synagogue that was gutted in the 1938 anti-Semitic attacks of
Kristallnacht, Irene Runge said she had no intention of seeing a
film in which a fictional Mengele character seeks to justify his
actions by saying he saved his victims from an even worse death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot learn about the truth by watching something that
isn't true,'' Runge said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Mengele, the infamous ``Angel of Death,'' escaped to
Argentina after World War II and drowned off the coast of Brazil in
1979. Taking considerable poetic license, director Roland Suso
Richter has Mengele voluntarily return to Germany at age 80 to face
trial and defend himself. In the film, neo-Nazi skinheads use
Mengele's return as a rallying call for their racism and
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   It is the prospect of the film spurring a real-life resurgence
of anti-Semitic and racist attacks that worries such Jewish
community leaders as Runge and Michel Friedman. Friedman called the
film ``banal,'' offering no insight into Mengele's thinking or
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film also makes the inexcusable attempt to make Mengele
seem to be a campaigner for euthanasia,'' Friedman added.
</P>
<P>
   Mengele used the prisoners at Auschwitz as guinea pigs in
warped, often fatal experiments. He harbored a particular fondness
for using children, especially twins, and the disabled. From the
moment he arrived at the most notorious Nazi camp in 1943 until the
end of the war, Mengele could decide someone's fate with the wave
of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he was responsible for the deaths of some 400,000
people, including nearly 3,000 sets of twins.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the US-made ``Schindler's List,'' which was a critical
and popular success in Germany, the homemade ``Nothing But the
Truth'' is more of a thriller and psychological drama than cinema
verite. It does not show Nazis killing their victims.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unnerving scenes shows a prosecutor reading out
the charges against Mengele _ of dissecting a baby, of killing 14
sets of twins, of throwing a baby into an incinerator _ while
neo-Nazis outside the courtroom chant support for him.
</P>
<P>
   There is no moralizing in the film. Kai Wiesinger, who plays
Mengele's liberal German lawyer, defends the film's ambivalent
moral tone. ``We only ask questions, not provide answers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The film opened in 180 theaters across Germany, just weeks after
Berlin reclaimed its position as Germany's capital. Werner Koenig,
the film's producer, says the movie is an important counterbalance
as Berlin stakes its claim as the capital of Europe and Germany
begins to assume a leadership role in global politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make this a German film in Germany,'' he said. ``The
way everyone tries to look away from the past in Germany annoys me.
Everyone shakes their head and says, `Sorry, it's all tragic and we
shouldn't talk about it any more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The film marks a personal commitment by Gotz George, one of
Germany's leading action-film stars, who plays Mengele. George's
father, Heinrich, starred in Nazi propaganda films and died in an
American internment camp shortly after the war ended. George and
other actors put up $500,000 of their own money to get the $4.5
million film made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bring back Mengele and therefore history to this city,'' he
was quoted as saying in a local newspaper. ``This city, this
country, must confront this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some film critics have praised the movie. Writing in Die Welt,
Hanns-Georg Rodek concluded that ``there has hardly been a German
film in past decades that has touched in such exemplary fashion the
post-Holocaust sensitivity of Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   When the film ended Thursday, Mueller-Wissler and her 27
students filed from the theater in silence. Neither she nor her
students had any immediate reaction to the film. They were moved,
but in ways they found hard to express.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too fresh to talk about it now,'' Mueller-Wissler said,
turning to some of her students, who nodded in agreement. ``It's
fiction, not real history. And those are the things we have to talk
about. We'll discuss this in class, tomorrow.''

BUSH CALLS FOR INCREASED SPENDING ON THE MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ George W. Bush, whose lack of foreign policy
experience is viewed by some as the weakest link in his campaign,
proposed Thursday an ambitious rebuilding of the military. Bush
called for a $750 per soldier pay increase and a renewed commitment
to a costly antimissile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If elected president, I will set three goals,'' Bush told
cadets at The Citadel military academy. ``I will renew the bond of
trust between the American president and American military, I will
defend the American people against missiles and terror, and I will
begin creating the military of the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious proposal in Bush's speech was a $20 billion
increase in military research and development, mostly for
antimissile systems that Bush acknowledged would not be built for
``many years.'' The military pay increase would cost $1 billion per
year for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those specifics, however, Bush was vague on most details
of his military and foreign affairs plans. The Texas governor
promised to provide more specifics after he is elected and conducts
a review of the Pentagon and the world situation. Bush said he may
withdraw US forces from areas around the world where they are
unnecessary, but he provided no examples. Similarly, Bush said he
would ``confront Congress'' over ``pork and patronage,'' but he
cited no weapon he would cut or base he would close.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, instead, outlined a thematic vision of a world reshaped
since his father left the presidency. With the end of the Cold War,
Bush said that the greatest threat comes from ``new technologies
and old hatreds.'' He said that a missile defense system would
protect the United States from rogue nations and terrorists, and
that he would back the creation of a more agile armed force that
could quickly respond to hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Like some Republicans in Congress, Bush also said he would
withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty unless Russia
agrees to amendments that would allow the creation a new
antimissile system. The Clinton administration has opposed
abolishing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was politically important for Bush for several
reasons. Bush's service in the Texas National Guard has raised
questions about whether he sought to avoid combat during the
Vietnam War, and his lack of expertise in military and world
affairs has drawn criticism from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush knows well how the perception of a lack of military
expertise can harm a presidential candidate. The 1988 presidential
campaign of George Bush, in which his son played a crucial role,
ran a television commercial showing Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis riding a tank and it questioned the military qualifications
of the former Massachusetts governor. ``This is no time for
uncertainty _ no time to train somebody in how to meet with the
Russians. This is the time for strength and experience,'' the ad
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, very similar words are being used by the Gore campaign
against George W. Bush. Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Vice
President Al Gore, Thursday dismissed Bush's speech: ``The
governor's foreign policy expertise begins with Slovenia and ends
with Slovakia, and even these have proven to be too much of a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his campaign, Bush, responding to questions from the
news media, made some awkward statements on foreign policy, such as
when he confused the names of Slovenia and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also faces challenges within his party on the issue. One of
Bush's top GOP opponents, Senator John McCain of Arizona, is a
former Vietnam prisoner of war who is focusing much of his
attention on military matters and especially on veterans in South
Carolina, which plans to hold its primary Feb. 19, shortly after
the first-in-the-nation primary of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain spokesman had no comment on Bush's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, seeking to turn the tables on the issue, spent much of his
address asserting that the Clinton-Gore administration has been
adrift and ill-informed on military matters, while he would
re-focus the Pentagon on the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since the years before Pearl Harbor has our investment in
national defense been so low as a percentage of GNP,'' Bush said.
``Yet rarely has our military been so freely used, an average of
one deployment every nine weeks in the last few years. Since the
end of the Cold War, our ground forces have been deployed more
frequently, while our defense budget has fallen by nearly 40
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech was crafted largely by a team of advisers who also
worked for his father, including former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, former National Security Council official Condoleezza Rice,
and former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage.
Notably, while the speech contained several criticisms of the way
the Pentagon budget has been cut in the last decade, the speech
left the implication that those cuts were entirely the fault of the
Clinton Administration. In fact, some of the biggest cuts were set
in motion by the Bush administration, with support from some of the
same people now advising Governor Bush and helping to craft the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, in an interview, acknowledged that ``there was
controversy'' among Republicans over the size of the defense cuts
that began in 1990, but she said they were prudent after the end of
the Cold War. She said the Clinton administration then went too far
in cutting military spending.

 &HT;    CARIBBEAN, CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADERS LOBBY FOR REGIONAL TRADE
BILL
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Central American and Caribbean leaders met with the
chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee Thursday to
step up their efforts to expand trade with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Bill Archer of Texas discussed strategy with the
leaders in the hopes of expediting a bill enhancing the Caribbean
Basin Initiative through Congress, where it has been stalled since
June.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ which is similar to the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) between the U.S., Mexico and Canada _ would
provide more trade opportunities between the United States and
Caribbean and Central American nations.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that the Caribbean and Central American Relief
and Economic Stabilization Act not only helps that region's nations
recover from the ravages of Hurricanes Georges and Mitch, but gives
the United States greater access to a rapidly growing market. U.S.
imports to the region have tripled since the bill was first passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a logical extension of the kind of economic integration
that was started with NAFTA, especially given the proximity of
these nations to the U.S.,'' said Bruce Stokes, a senior fellow
with the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stokes said the bill will cause some hardship for
American textile and apparel workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an interesting dynamic in the industry. Some companies
who have plants in those regions favor it. Those who don't oppose
it,'' Stokes said. ``It's a mixed bag politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes said that while the legislation would help improve the
economies in the region, the job losses in the hard-hit American
textile industry have to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually the people who have (those jobs) don't have many
skills,'' he said. ``What's missing is any meaningful efforts on
our part to provide assistance to the people who we know are going
to lose jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With that said and done,'' he added, ``we need to get on with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree that the most likely scenario at this point
is to amend the proposed legislation onto another bill authorizing
trade and investment in sub-Saharan Africa _ which has also passed
the House Ways and Means Committee and has support in the Senate.
Any discrepancies would likely be smoothed out in committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way with this bill,'' House and Ways
Committee spokesman Greg Crist said, adding that its ``chances (of
passage) look good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strong indication that the Senate would like to at
least consider moving the bill in October,'' he said.

GEORGE C. SCOTT, REFUSED OSCAR FOR `PATTON' ROLE, AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George C. Scott, whose raspy, temperature-lowering growl chilled
stage, screen and TV audiences for more than 40 years, died
Wednesday at his home 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Scott's
death was reporteldy caused by a ruptured abdominal aortic
aneurysm. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Although he became known for mellow gruffness in recent years,
he made his reputation through an ability to project a quality of
icy, almost psychotic unstoppableness. At his best, he was able to
seem both sympathetic and scary, a rare combination of qualities
that culminated when he won an Oscar for his portrayal of the title
role in ``Patton'' (1970), Franklin Schaffner's milestone biopic of
the brilliant but explosive World War II tank commander.
</P>
<P>
   Scott became more widely known for turning down the Oscar he won
for that film than most actors do who accept them. In this he was
consistent. After the first of his four Oscar nominations for what
was to become known as his characteristic cold relentlessness as a
prosecuting attorney in ``Anatomy of a Murder'' (1959), he wired
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and asked that his
name be withdrawn as a nominee. Instead, he was nominated three
more times: for his sharklike gang boss trying to devour Paul
Newman in ``The Hustler'' (1961), for ``Patton,'' and for his
decent, dedicated physician worn down by chaos and mediocrity in
``The Hospital'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   Although he gave film a handful of unforgettable portrayals,
Scott often expressed disdain for moviemaking and Hollywood, saying
he made films for money and likening the Oscar race to ``a beauty
contest in a slaughterhouse.'' He also had a low opinion of
television, saying that it was inimical to good acting. But his
angry New York social worker in TV's ``East Side, West Side'' gave
that medium one of its distinguished acting milestones. Although he
won and accepted several Emmys, he followed his Oscar turndown by
similarly refusing to accept an Emmy he won a year later for Arthur
Miller's ``The Price.'' ``I have to work in the theater to stay
sane,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   He kept returning to the stage, most recently in a revival of
``Inherit the Wind'' in 1996. Scott was born in the Appalachian
mountain town of Wise, Va., moved to Detroit with his family when
he was two. After a Marine Corps hitch, he entered the University
of Missouri journalism school, but found acting more congenial
after appearing in a production of ``The Winslow Boy.'' Following
six more productions there, he dropped out, moved to Greenwich
Village, made a living working nights as an IBM check-sorting
machine operator on Wall Street, and made the rounds by day. An
introduction to New York Shakespeare Festival founder Joseph Papp
led to a sensational debut as ``Richard III'' (1957), followed by
an equally lauded performance as the cynical philosopher Jaques in
``As You Like It'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Scott's third role, in an off-Broadway revival of ``Children of
Darkness'' (1958), cemented his stardom. As a chillingly arrogant
aristocratic poisoner, Lord Wainwright, whose money and position
gave him the run of a prison, he ended the play by carrying a young
Canadian actress named Colleen Dewhurst offstage, murmuring, ``I
desire ingress.'' He and Dewhurst (who died in 1991) married,
divorced, married again, and divorced again. They have two sons,
Alexander and Campbell, the latter a well-known actor. ``Children
of Darkness'' landed Scott his first film role, as a crazed
instigator of a lynch mob venting its fury at Gary Cooper in ``The
Hanging Tree'' (1959).
</P>
<P>
   Scott kept returning to the New York stage, where he scored
successes as a prosecuting judge in the Civil War courtroom drama
he later staged for PBS, ``The Andersonville Trial'' (1959), and in
revivals of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' ``Desire Under the Elms,''
``Death of a Salesman,'' ``The Little Foxes'' and ``Present
Laughter,'' among others. His stony grin and wary eyes showed to
advantage in film roles as a buffonish caricature of a hawkish
general in ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964), a burned-out physician in
``Petulia'' (1968), a pessimistic cop in ``The New Centurions''
(1972), a peaceful rancher turned killer when environmental toxins
kill his son in ``Rage'' (1972), a scientist battling an improbable
plot in ``Day of the Dolphin'' (1973), and a sculptor trying to
live an honorably in ``Islands in the Stream'' (1977). This last,
which he produced, seemed to resonate personally for Scott, whose
films often were informed by a sense that he battled lifelong
demons, including a lifelong drinking problem acquired when he was
stationed at Arlington National Cemetery during his Marine Corps
service.
</P>
<P>
   Idealistically, he staged and even financed plays, and wanted to
be known as a serious craftsman, although he had little patience
with high-faluting acting theories, saying simply, ``I get a mental
vision of the character and I try to project it.'' He was married
four times, most recently to actress Trish Van Devere, whom he met
while filming ``Day of the Dolphin.'' Early marriages to Carolyn
Hughes and Patricia Reed produced two daughters, Victoria and
Devon, and a son, Matthew. He also acknowledged a child born out of
wedlock during his school years.

 &HT;    IOC's Pound: `One-sided' Games report `disappointing'
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A top International Olympic Committee member
complained Thursday that Atlanta's Olympic bid report is one-sided
and ignores the reforms already established in the Olympic host
city selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Dick Pound of Canada, who headed an internal IOC
inquiry into the Salt Lake City scandal, said bid cities have found
it ``very convenient to blame the whole thing on the IOC. But there
is a push and pull'' between the bidders and some IOC members, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, who also headed the IOC's oversight commission for the
Atlanta Games, said the report written by former Attorney General
Griffin Bell would be forwarded to the IOC's newly established
ethics commission for review.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he had received a copy of the document, which Bell
delivered last week to the U.S. House Commerce Committee, and
disputed its contention that Atlanta was dragged into a corrupt bid
culture fostered by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the approach of the bid city disappointing _ that the
IOC expected this. I'm not sure that is true at all,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his Montreal law office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sound of one man clapping only,'' he said. ``They
didn't go to the trouble of talking to any IOC members and asking
whether any of this is true or getting an explanation for anything.
The report has been released and made public without giving the
impugned IOC members any opportunity to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said he would ask
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch to appear at hearings next
month investigating the ``culture of corruption'' surrounding
Atlanta's winning bid. Pound said Samaranch would probably consult
with his executive board about how to deal with Upton's request.
</P>
<P>
   The board is to meet late next week in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch declined to appear at a Senate hearing in April
prompted by the vote-buying scandal arising from Salt Lake City's
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicates that Atlanta bidders showered IOC members
with gifts and favors in an aggressive courtship to win their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, votes were for sale,'' said Upton, who contended
there was no difference in the lobbying tactics of Salt Lake City
and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he thinks there is a difference in degree. Salt Lake
City spent $1.2 million on scholarships and gifts for IOC members
and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Atlanta was over the line or not is a matter of
debate,'' he said. ``But it is clear that Salt Lake was.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said he hopes the hearings in Washington would provide
another side of the story. ``I hope that it will be clear there was
a huge element of push that wasn't encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   And he contends that Atlanta's lack of response to the earlier
IOC inquiry is proof that Atlanta bidders were the instigators of
inappropriate gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we wrote asking whether IOC members acted
inappropriately, we got back a one-liner,'' he said. ``It's an
admission by (Atlanta) that the IOC did nothing wrong. If there was
any wrongdoing, by implication it was (done by Atlanta).''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said the IOC has not been given credit for the actions it
has taken over the past 10 months, including the resignations or
expulsions of 10 of its members and the initiation of reforms,
ethics rules and a code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of improper action by the IOC, we should be
prepared to stand up and take our medicine, which we have,'' he
said. ``What is strange in all of this is it is as if all of the
stuff we've done over the last year ... hasn't happened. It's just
as if it were all in a vacuum.''

SECOND DEFENDANT GETS DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS DRAGGING DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ The onetime exalted cyclops of a prison Klan gang
blinked back tears and visibly paled Thursday when a jury sentenced
him to death for the 1998 torture slaying of a disabled black man
in the East Texas town of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr. had seen hope in the
fact that the jury took 14 1/2 hours to deliberate the punishment
and, just an hour before reaching its decision, indicated that it
was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   When the 32-year-old Sulphur Springs man was condemned to death,
his father, mother, sister and younger brother held one other in
the front row of the courtroom and shook with sobs.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of James Byrd Jr., the African-American man who was
chained behind a pickup and dragged to his death in June 1998,
wiped away tears, then said the punishment sends a strong message
that Texas will not tolerate such an inhuman act.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second of three trials stemming from Byrd's dragging
death. John William King was convicted in February and sentenced to
death. Shawn Berry, 24, a Jasper native like King, is scheduled to
go on trial Oct. 25. But that trial might be delayed, prosecutors
said, citing their exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   As the punishment was announced Thursday, one of Byrd's sisters,
Clara Taylor, said she thought of ``how my brother must have
screamed for help as his flesh was torn from his body and he
(Brewer) did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sister, Stella Brumley, said, ``I am relieved that he
won't be let out to do this kind of harm to harm to anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a happy moment for anybody, but it is a moment
that we know _ in the county of Jasper, the state of Texas, and in
this country _ that justice has been served,'' said Don Clark, who
heads the Houston office of the FBI, which aided local and state
authorities in the murder investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, Jasper County District Attorney Guy James
Gray echoed a defense contention when he said that the prison
system is turning out racists _ white, black and brown _ and needs
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's relatives testified that he had black friends as a
child, married a Hispanic woman and expressed no racial hatred
until a second term in prison. Then, he became a founding member of
a prison Ku Klux Klan group, the Confederate Knights of America,
and was later its exalted cyclops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not smart enough to tell what we need to do, but I think
you can see there is a problem,'' Gray said of prisons today.
``There are people being produced in there that are being thrown
back into society. And it wouldn't surprise me if there were other,
similar racial acts.''
</P>
<P>
   The next trial will be the toughest in terms of attaining the
death penalty even though more evidence directly links Shawn Berry
to the killing, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike King and Brewer, Berry did not have a track record as a
racist, did not join a gang while in prison and does not have white
supremacist tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether Byrd's torture slaying was a non-racial
thrill killing for Berry, Gray replied, ``Anybody who participates
in a crime like this has to be a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Brewer's sentence, the prosecutor said: ``I'm not a death
penalty fan. But if you don't give the death penalty, he will kill
again.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, an assistant U.S. attorney from Beaumont, said the
strongest evidence in Brewer's case came from his clandestine
prison notes, known as ``kites,'' which were boastful in tone and
showed no remorse for the gruesome murder, as well as a 1993 letter
Brewer wrote his then-wife, Sylvia Nunes Brewer of Fort Worth.
Hearing that she had returned to a former boyfriend, Brewer wrote
that he felt as if he had been dragged along a road, ``chained to
the bumper of a Corvette going 90 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In his crazy mind, that was the worst possible thing you could
do to another person,'' said Stevens. It was logical for the jury
to see that it was Brewer's idea ``to drag Byrd behind a truck. It
was a unique idea,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   After being sentenced, Brewer requested that his lead
court-appointed attorney, Doug Barlow of Beaumont, be retained to
handle his automatic appeal. Because of the lengthy appeals
process, the average wait on Texas' Death Row before execution is
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell had resigned himself to this, as he has to a lot of
his life in prison,'' Barlow said. ``I just left him upstairs, and
he said, `I'll be all right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice, said Brewer will be moved from Bryan to the
prison system's diagnostic unit in Huntsville, where he will be
fingerprinted and photographed.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably be assigned to Death Row in the Ellis Unit near
Huntsville. King, the first defendant convicted in the case, is
assigned to the Terrell Unit Death Row about 70 miles from
Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``King has been in protective custody ever since he got here,
which means he is isolated in a single cell,'' Fitzgerald said.
``Brewer will be placed in protective custody as well. Any time you
have someone come in after a high-profile crime like this, he'll go
into protective custody.''
</P>
<P>
   King's arrival on Death Row caused considerable disruption among
the other 400-plus condemned inmates, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there is a new person, there's some disruption, but
in King's case, the disruption was particularly raucous and
exuberant,'' he said. ``It died down after a while.'' &QL;

FLEET SHRUGS OFF LATEST MONEY-LAUNDERING REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Fleet Financial Group dismissed a published
report Thursday that quoted unnamed sources as saying the bank had
carried out wire transfers larger than previously reported in
connection with an alleged money-laundering scheme.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page USA Today article, quoting unidentified federal
investigators, said Fleet had conducted wire transfers as high as
$200 million with ``Russian accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what these anonymous investigators are referring
to,'' said a Fleet spokesman, James Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, including the FBI, are probing billions of
dollars in suspicious money that flowed through Russia-related
accounts at the Bank of New York. The probe, designed to determine
whether illicit Russian gains have been channeled through Western
banks, has led banks around the world to scrutinize their clients
and transactions.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the Globe last week, Fleet held four accounts for
a company, Benex, that is at the heart of the probe. Fleet had said
unrelated accounts had been used to process wire transfers totaling
several million dollars, not hundreds of millions, to Benex's Bank
of New York accounts, and that it was conducting an internal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston has said that it also processed wire transfers
totaling several million dollars in connection with Benex.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI source said Thursday that he ``had no information that
the (USA Today) report was true'' and said Fleet was not under any
kind of probe.

MARS PROBE PRESUMED LOST, NASA SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see Mars-sider) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a trouble-free, 91/2-month voyage from Earth, NASA's Mars
Climate Orbiter disappeared early Thursday as it was maneuvering
into orbit around the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   The small spacecraft was presumed lost due to a large error in
navigational calculations made back on Earth, causing it to break
or burn up in the atmosphere as it swooped too close to the Martian
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter was the first interplanetary weather
satellite, developed to gather a record of climate variations on
the planet. It was the third in a new wave of robotic spacecraft
that NASA began aiming at Mars in 1996 to determine whether the
cold, desertlike realm was once warm and wet enough to host life.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter also was to act as an orbiting
communications relay satellite for a companion probe, NASA's Mars
Polar Lander. The lander is on course to make a soft landing near
the Martian south pole Dec. 3 to search for subsoil ice.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., committed $356 million to the two missions, including
development, launch and mission operations, and science costs. It
estimated the loss of the Climate Orbiter at $125 million. The
Polar Lander will be able to communicate with the Earth
satisfactorily, though more slowly, despite loss of the Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency vowed to pinpoint the cause of the navigational
error. But it also characterized it as a temporary setback in a
lengthy campaign to launch orbiter and lander missions to Mars
every 26 months at least through 2005. Later missions are intended
to robotically gather Martian soil samples and return them for
analysis beginning in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of any mission is very serious, but it's not
devastating to the program as a whole,'' said Carl Pilcher, NASA's
director of science for solar system exploration. ``We have future
missions in the program that are not well defined. We will be
looking very carefully at those as opportunities to recover any
lost science data.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched Dec. 11 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., the Climate Orbiter
was in the home stretch of a 416-million mile voyage through the
solar system early Thursday. Its control teams at JPL and Lockheed
Martin in suburban Denver were confident of its rendezvous with
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to pre-programmed commands, the 1,300-pound
spacecraft was to execute a 17-minute braking burn by its primary
propulsion system. Snagged by Martian gravitational forces as it
slowed, the probe was to swing into an looping trajectory that took
it as far as 24,000 miles from the surface and as close as 100
miles on each orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six weeks, a succession of maneuvers would have
guided the Climate Orbiter into a circular 262-mile high orbit
above the planet's north and south pole. After functioning through
February as a communications satellite, the probe was to record
temperature, wind, moisture and dust variations in the atmosphere,
and photograph the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Signals confirming the braking maneuver reached JPL at 5:01 a.m.
EST as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:06 a.m. EST, the signal was interrupted when the probed
slipped behind Mars. The maneuver was to end at 5:17 a.m. EST, with
the Climate Orbiter still obstructed from Earth by Mars.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:27 a.m. EST, the Orbiter's signal was to reach Earth once
again. Instead, there was only silence, throwing JPL control teams
into a frantic search for the overdue spacecraft or an explanation
for its disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The searchers soon found clues that the spacecraft was seriously
off course because of an error in the navigational computations
made at JPL, said NASA's Richard Cook, project manager for Climate
Orbiter ground operations at the Pasadena facility.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said his team believed the Climate Orbiter would swoop to
93 miles above the Martian north pole as the burn began. Unknown to
the control team, however, the navigational effort directed the
probe to a 37-mile altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft was not designed to survive below 53 miles.
</P>
<P>
   In looking at the previous eight hours of trajectory data from
the spacecraft, controllers discovered the clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw what was about a 100 kilometer (62 mile) drop in the
point of closest approach. That was a very significant movement,
and we don't understand why that occurred,'' Cook told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said an investigative team would focus on navigational
calculations made by JPL team members and on the mission's computer
software rather than on the spacecraft's hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Mars has been an intriguing but difficult target for planetary
scientists, prone to wild success or dismal failure.
</P>
<P>
   NASA lists 30 spacecraft launches to the Red Planet by the
United States, the former Soviet Union, Russia and Japan since1960.
With the demise of the Climate Orbiter, 19 of those have failed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1993 loss of NASA's $1 billion Mars Observer mission,
one that bundled weather observation gear with cameras and
instruments designed to study the planet's geology, that prompted
the United States to radically alter its exploration strategy.
</P>
<P>
   NASA embraced a new strategy of launching more frequent, small,
less costly spacecraft, accepting a risk that the inevitable
failures would not be so devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Both approaches have captured the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, NASA's $262 million Mars Pathfinder bounced to the
surface of a rocky watershed in the planet's equatorial belt,
delivering the robotic rover Sojourner. Pathfinder's camera's
produced evidence of an ancient massive flood in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades earlier, cameras aboard Viking I and II spacecrafts,
an effort that would cost $3 billion to duplicate today, captured
images of features that appeared to be ancient river and lake beds.

STOCKS FALL HARD AFTER MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE`S REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKETS-LEVITT, MARKETS-REGULATIONS, MARKETS-EUROPE) 
(mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices, already weighed down by fears about
interest rates and the dollar, fell hard Thursday after the
president of Microsoft said high-technology companies like his were
considerably overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a session in which most prices were meandering
lower was quickly transformed into a steep decline, with the
technology-dominated NASDAQ market absorbing a loss of 3.77
percent, its biggest since April. The Dow Jones industrial average,
which lost 205.48 points, or 1.95 percent, closed at 10,318.59.
That put it more than 1,000 points below its record set on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's selloff contributed to the recent improvement in the
bond market as investors redirected money from stock sales into
fixed-income securities. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds,
widely used as a benchmark for home mortgages, eased to 5.79
percent from 5.91 percent on Wednesday, while the return on 30-year
bonds retreated below 6 percent to 5.98 percent from 6.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But while voices on Wall Street itself were talking down tech
stocks, it was Microsoft president Steven Ballmer who had by far
the most effect. Addressing a conference in Seattle of the Society
of American Business Editors and Writers, he cited what he called a
``gold rush'' mentality that had driven the shares far too high.
``It's bad whenever reality is out of line, and you get distortions
which are not healthy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such an overvaluation of tech stocks it's absurd,''
Ballmer said. ``And I'd put our company's stock in that category.''
The shares of Microsoft, the most highly valued company in the
stock market, skidded 4 7/8 to 91 3/16, reducing Ballmer's personal
stake by some $1.2 billion. ``I love our company,'' he responded.
``I don't sell my stock.'' Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, who
owned 1 billion shares, before recent gifts, had a paper loss
Thursday that approached $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Another depressant was a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, Bill
Rafftery, who said that Intel and Apple were overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also suffered from the dollar's slide against the yen,
which resumed after Lawrence Summers, the Treasury secretary,
seemed to rule out any chance the United States would join any
effort to halt the yen's appreciation, 14 percent against the
dollar since June.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's weakness has made investors fret that stocks and
bonds issued in the United States could become relatively
unappealing, although the American currency has held up against
most currencies other than the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to Timothy Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager
at Dreyfus, the market is more worried about the possibility that
the Federal Reserve will ratchet up interest rates once again to
head off any revival of inflation _ a move that itself tends to
buoy the the dollar _ than it is about the dollar's performance
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan's not out of the woods yet'' in restoring economic
growth, Ghriskey contended. ``Their currency will correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which had been among the stronger groups early
in the day, were caught in the selloff, with J.P. Morgan, Chase
Manhattan and the Bank of New York each down more than a point and
Morgan Stanley losing 3 3/16 to 86 3/8, Donaldson Lufkin 3 to 39
7/8 and Merrill Lynch 2 9/16 to 68 1/4. Lehman Brothers fell 1 7/8
to 53 3/8, despite reporting higher-than-expected profits and
winning a ``strong buy'' recommendation from an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon downdraft sank the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock
Index to a loss of 29.74 points, or 2.27 percent, to 1,280.77,
where it violated its 200-day moving average of just over 1,300,
technical analysts noted. And 405 of the index components closed
lower, compared with only 84 that rose; 11 finished unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrials also disappointed technicians, who dwell on
charts of prices rather than the performance of companies. After
rebounding a bit Wednesday from a support level of 10,500, the
blue-chip barometer moved decisively lower. Its decline was the
second this week of more than 200 points; it lost 225.43 points on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser market depressants seemed to be President Clinton's veto,
albeit entirely expected, of the Republican tax-cut bill and the
Labor Department's report that first-time applications for
unemployment insurance fell last week to the lowest level since
1974, a move magnified to some extent by floods in North Carolina
and other states that prevented some people from reaching claims
offices. The worry is that unremitting tightness in a labor market
could lead to wage inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Although drug, oil and airline stocks began the session with
gains, no major group survived the afternoon meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest individual losers among prominent companies
were Georgia Pacific, down 5 13/16 to 38 13/16 after the
resignation of its chief financial officer; Rite Aid, 2 to 12 on
accusations of overcharging; and Gillette, 2 1/16 to 37 3/4, the
second straight decline after an analyst cut her profit projection.
</P>
<P>
   Among tech stocks, Hewlett-Packard was the biggest drag on the
Dow industrials, sliding 4 5/16 to 94 3/8, with IBM third, down 3
3/16 to 122.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Ebay plunged 10 7/8 to 138 1/4, Amazon.com 3 3/4 to
62 1/4 and Intel 5 5/16 to 77 1/2. Coke lost 1 1/2, to 50 15/16,
bringing its loss for the year to 23.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderately heavy
890.88 million, with declining stocks surpassing advancing ones by
2,185 to 902. New 52-week lows beat new highs by more than 12 to
one _ 285_23.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were mostly higher in Europe, but major indexes closed
3.39 percent lower in Tokyo and 1.27 percent in Brazil.

MARS MISSIONS HAVE HISTORY OF FAILING _ AND SUCCEEDING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Resending for those papers who missed it.) 
 
By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The temperature on its rocky surface is below zero. At its
farthest point in orbit, it is 249 million miles from Earth. And,
so far as anyone knows, there isn't a McDonalds restaurant on the
place.
</P>
<P>
   And yet we keep trying to get there. Thirty times in the past 40
years, man has sent a spacecraft to Mars and 19 of those missions
have failed, the latest Thursday when the $125 million Mars Climate
Orbiter was presumed lost while preparing for a landing on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   The casual observer could be forgiven for wondering why, if it
is so obviously difficult and there doesn't appear to be much there
anyway, we keep spending the money on missions to Mars that have a
63 percent chance of failing.
</P>
<P>
   To those who have a passion for the Red Planet, though, that
would be like questioning the wisdom of exploration that led to the
discovery of the New World 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The example I use is to imagine myself in 16th-century
England, or Spain or Portugal going out and exploring other
worlds,'' said Louis Friedman, executive director and co-founder
with the late astronomer Carl Sagan of The Planetary Society. ``The
ships they used had failures and major problems. The road of
oceanic and continental exploration on Earth is filled with
failures and setbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   For Friedman, it is the ``trying,'' the act of exploration
itself, that is most valuable, not necessarily the data that is
collected. The missions that have been successful _ the 1997 Mars
Pathfinder mission is a notable example _ have provided information
about Mars that will take years to digest, but the major lessons
were learned from the mission itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The payoff is what these missions do for the advancement of
civilization,'' Friedman said. ``Getting the data from Mars is the
gravy. But when it comes down to the advancement of civilization,
it is the process of getting there that advances our
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the planets, it is toward Mars that we have most often
aimed our space ships, and we have done so with a host of different
objectives, but only one reason. Of all the planets in our solar
system, Mars is the most like ours. If there is, or was, other life
in our solar system, Mars, scientists say, holds the clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's relation to the evolution of our life and species makes
it special,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mars Climate Orbiter was the first of two spacecraft due on Mars
this year to study the planet's weather and to look for signs of
water. Preliminary indications are that the orbiter approached the
planet's surface about 50 miles closer than it should have and
either burned up in the atmosphere or broke into pieces. Not bad,
after a 10 month, remote-controlled journey through space; close
enough, in the minds of some, to be called a success, not a
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The returns for our efforts at this stage come through our
understanding of Mars, which has such a close relationship with out
planet,'' said David Black, director of the Houston-based Lunar and
Planetary Institute. ``We're getting far, far more information from
Mars than just data. The payoff is not in data bits, but in
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   How much is this knowledge worth? For perspective, Black said,
consider this: The Mars Climate Orbiter cost $125 million; five
Hollywood movies this year have so far each grossed more than that
at the box office.

GEORGE C. SCOTT, REFUSED OSCAR FOR `PATTON' ROLE, AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George C. Scott, whose raspy, temperature-lowering growl chilled
stage, screen and TV audiences for more than 40 years, died
Wednesday at his home 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Scott's
death was reporteldy caused by a ruptured abdominal aortic
aneurysm. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Although he became known for mellow gruffness in recent years,
he made his reputation through an ability to project a quality of
icy, almost psychotic unstoppableness. At his best, he was able to
seem both sympathetic and scary, a rare combination of qualities
that culminated when he won an Oscar for his portrayal of the title
role in ``Patton'' (1970), Franklin Schaffner's milestone biopic of
the brilliant but explosive World War II tank commander.
</P>
<P>
   Scott became more widely known for turning down the Oscar he won
for that film than most actors do who accept them. In this he was
consistent. After the first of his four Oscar nominations for what
was to become known as his characteristic cold relentlessness as a
prosecuting attorney in ``Anatomy of a Murder'' (1959), he wired
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and asked that his
name be withdrawn as a nominee. Instead, he was nominated three
more times: for his sharklike gang boss trying to devour Paul
Newman in ``The Hustler'' (1961), for ``Patton,'' and for his
decent, dedicated physician worn down by chaos and mediocrity in
``The Hospital'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   Although he gave film a handful of unforgettable portrayals,
Scott often expressed disdain for moviemaking and Hollywood, saying
he made films for money and likening the Oscar race to ``a beauty
contest in a slaughterhouse.'' He also had a low opinion of
television, saying that it was inimical to good acting. But his
angry New York social worker in TV's ``East Side, West Side'' gave
that medium one of its distinguished acting milestones. Although he
won and accepted several Emmys, he followed his Oscar turndown by
similarly refusing to accept an Emmy he won a year later for Arthur
Miller's ``The Price.'' ``I have to work in the theater to stay
sane,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   He kept returning to the stage, most recently in a revival of
``Inherit the Wind'' in 1996. Scott was born in the Appalachian
mountain town of Wise, Va., moved to Detroit with his family when
he was two. After a Marine Corps hitch, he entered the University
of Missouri journalism school, but found acting more congenial
after appearing in a production of ``The Winslow Boy.'' Following
six more productions there, he dropped out, moved to Greenwich
Village, made a living working nights as an IBM check-sorting
machine operator on Wall Street, and made the rounds by day. An
introduction to New York Shakespeare Festival founder Joseph Papp
led to a sensational debut as ``Richard III'' (1957), followed by
an equally lauded performance as the cynical philosopher Jaques in
``As You Like It'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Scott's third role, in an off-Broadway revival of ``Children of
Darkness'' (1958), cemented his stardom. As a chillingly arrogant
aristocratic poisoner, Lord Wainwright, whose money and position
gave him the run of a prison, he ended the play by carrying a young
Canadian actress named Colleen Dewhurst offstage, murmuring, ``I
desire ingress.'' He and Dewhurst (who died in 1991) married,
divorced, married again, and divorced again. They have two sons,
Alexander and Campbell, the latter a well-known actor. ``Children
of Darkness'' landed Scott his first film role, as a crazed
instigator of a lynch mob venting its fury at Gary Cooper in ``The
Hanging Tree'' (1959).
</P>
<P>
   Scott kept returning to the New York stage, where he scored
successes as a prosecuting judge in the Civil War courtroom drama
he later staged for PBS, ``The Andersonville Trial'' (1959), and in
revivals of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' ``Desire Under the Elms,''
``Death of a Salesman,'' ``The Little Foxes'' and ``Present
Laughter,'' among others. His stony grin and wary eyes showed to
advantage in film roles as a buffonish caricature of a hawkish
general in ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964), a burned-out physician in
``Petulia'' (1968), a pessimistic cop in ``The New Centurions''
(1972), a peaceful rancher turned killer when environmental toxins
kill his son in ``Rage'' (1972), a scientist battling an improbable
plot in ``Day of the Dolphin'' (1973), and a sculptor trying to
live an honorably in ``Islands in the Stream'' (1977). This last,
which he produced, seemed to resonate personally for Scott, whose
films often were informed by a sense that he battled lifelong
demons, including a lifelong drinking problem acquired when he was
stationed at Arlington National Cemetery during his Marine Corps
service.
</P>
<P>
   Idealistically, he staged and even financed plays, and wanted to
be known as a serious craftsman, although he had little patience
with high-faluting acting theories, saying simply, ``I get a mental
vision of the character and I try to project it.'' He was married
four times, most recently to actress Trish Van Devere, whom he met
while filming ``Day of the Dolphin.'' Early marriages to Carolyn
Hughes and Patricia Reed produced two daughters, Victoria and
Devon, and a son, Matthew. He also acknowledged a child born out of
wedlock during his school years.

   It was obvious that despite the deployment of 3,000 peacekeepers
in four days, multinational forces do not yet control the capital
of Dili _ much less the rest of the small, mountainous island
territory that exploded in vengeful, one-sided violence following a
recent vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   UN peace troops and Indonesian troops accused each other of
firing over each others' heads. Both sides denied the allegation,
but it was not a promising beginning for what is, for the time
being, a joint peacekeeping operation that could last months.
</P>
<P>
   Suspected pro-Indonesia militiamen were seen gathering behind
the UN compound and contigents of the violent anti-independence
paramilitaries were rumored to be massing at the border of
Indonesia's province of West Timor, raising fears they might try to
re-enter East Timor and cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shaken families sheltering inside the city stadium
said they had fled the beachside tent camp where some 5,000 of them
had camped until the day before, because departing Indonesian
soldiers tried to force them on to trucks bound for West Timor. The
UN has never recognized Jakarta's rule over the eastern half of
Timor, a former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   Brigadier David Richards, commander of the British component of
the multinational force, called the incidents a series of tasks for
the peacekeepers, and said there was a campaign under way to
``undermine the trust of locals and the world community in what we
are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he insisted, ``you would be wrong to think that this is
going wrong.'' It is ``remarkable'' that the Australian-led force
has in four days managed to move in 3,000 troops and start tackling
a humanitarian problem, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with that assessment, however. Relief
agencies have complained that the UN-approved force has not moved
quickly enough to faciliate aid, and has not provided adequate
security for the distribution of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Susanne Christosani, medical coordinator for Doctors Without
Borders, speaking from Darwin, Australia, the staging area for the
international peacekeeping force, said it was ``hard to understand
that ... dozens of journalists had been transported by the UN and
military planes and we have to sit here and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Mejid Hussein, UN humanitarian officer for East Timor,
said ``rogue elements'' of Indonesia's military looted a Dili
storehouse holding 6,000 tons of food meant for 500,000 refugees _
a security lapse that raised questions about why multinational
troops were not guarding the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officers, meanwhile, complained that elements of the
Indonesian military who resent having to give up East Timor are
trying throw a wrench not just into relief efforts, but into the
peacekeeping operations a well.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of the scorched-earth withdrawal from East Timor,
journalists saw truckloads of men in Indonesian military uniforms
torching a downtown building Thursday afternoon, just three blocks
from a post of Australian peacekeepers who said they were unable to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, 50-foot high flames a sprawling government
building a few blocks from another Australian military post. While
peacekeepers were securing a local stadium for people who fled
thier homes in fear of violence this month, a departing unit of
Indonesian special forces was busy torching the building they were
abandoning, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia ``built the building and everything here, and now they
have to leave _ so they want to destroy evrything,'' said Antonio
Barbosa, 20, shaking his head in amazement at the blistering
inferno across the street. Journalists who followed the curtain of
smoke that darkened the afternoon sky arrived before the nearby
peacekeepers did. And without firefighters or troop backup,
Australian soldiers were able to do little more than crouch down
with their guns poised, guarding against anyone who might return to
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, automatic weapons were fired near the UN compound here.
Three truckloads of men in Indonesian military uniforms drove by,
smiling and holding weapons, and more shots were soon heard from
their direction, according to Richards.
</P>
<P>
   British Gurkha troops at a nearby checkpoint pursued the
suspected gunmen, but had to pass off the chase to Australians when
they reached the edge of their command area. Australians pursued
the men, but did not apprehend anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, automatic weapons fire sent panicked
residents racing into the main street along Dili's waterfront.
British marines responded shouting and hustling people out of the
way, an scaling the wall of the Indonesian military facility from
which the gunfire seemed to have come. Indonesian security forces
inside became incensed, breaking plates, pushing furniture and
yelling, and when the marines emerged from the building an
Indonesian officer shouted after them, ``Don't repeat that again!''
</P>
<P>
   The marines had intervened to save a suspected pro-Jakarta
militiaman whom locals were attacking in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Peter Cosgrove, commander of the multinational
force, said he ``wasn't happy yesterday'' with the Indonesian
military ``because there were some serious allegations,'' of
military involvement in the murder Tuesday of a Dutch journalist.
He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem, he said, is that the ``discipline'' of
Indonesian troops has been ``sorely tested by the fact that they
were locally recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately some foreign soldiers confided they were pesimistic
about cooperation with Indonesian troops for however long they
remain in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strange relationship with Indonesian soldiers, some
of them smile at us and some look angry,'' said an Australian
soldier who spoke on condition of anonomity. ``The truth is they
want to make our lives miserable. They are the ones setting fires
around the city. We saw them yesterday and when we got there, they
ran away and started a fire somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he said, ``is we don't trust them and they
don't trust us.''

 &HT;    Consumer satisfaction expected to remain high
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ Staff writer Mark Clothier
<TEXT>
examines how the proposed merger of MindSpring and EarthLink
affects subscribers to the services.
<P>
   Q: The merger of EarthLink and MindSpring, if completed, creates
a company known as EarthLink, and it will be the second-largest
Internet service provider in the United States. What does it mean
for me? Will I have to change my (at)mindspring.com e-mail address?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. When an Internet service provider buys another ISP, the
customers of the purchased company usually get to keep their old
addresses. People don't like change, so the ISPs try to avoid any
address changes when they merge, said Juliet Reising, MindSpring's
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring Enterprises bought Netcom and Sprynet in the last 12
months and customers from both of those ISPs still use their old
e-mail addresses. They reach the Internet through MindSpring, but
they get mail at (at)sprynet.com
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't want to change,'' Reising said. ``It's like
changing your phone number. There's no reason to have people change
their address. They don't like it and there's no benefit to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will my service be affected by the merger?
</P>
<P>
   A: MindSpring's Reising said the change won't be noticed by
MindSpring's 1.2 million customers. MindSpring and EarthLink rank
toward the top of many customer satisfaction surveys. Reising said
the merger won't change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is getting a lot of media attention, but for the
user this should be transparent,'' Reising said. ``We don't expect
the quality to go down at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Some MindSpring customers might actually receive better service.
Customers of Sprynet and Netcom, companies MindSpring has bought
recently, have not enjoyed the same level of service as
MindSpring's customers in the Southeast, said Jeff Sadler, a
MindSpring customer and research analyst for FAC Equities covering
EarthLink and MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, who lives in New York, said he has trouble dialing in to
his MindSpring account. He said his service was almost flawless
when he lived in Atlanta. But now he said he gets a busy signal one
of every four times he attempts to log in.
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring has been having network issues that have been
plaguing it since they bought Sprynet and Netcom. In the Northeast,
the network has been having difficulty, people are getting a lot of
busy signals. Meanwhile, EarthLink has been growing and has an
outstanding growth strategy. MindSpring has been fixing problems
while EarthLink has been building out. So MindSpring customers
might see an improvement. Not the Atlanta customers, but the ones
in other markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the numbers I call for tech support or the number I use
to dial-in to log on change?
</P>
<P>
   A: Customers will still use the same phone numbers for technical
support, at least in the meantime. Those numbers tend to change
over time, anyway, so people might have a different number at some
point, Reising said. The dial-in numbers might change at some point
as well, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When companies merge, they always talk about ``economies of
scale'' and ``synergies,'' but what does that mean for me? Will my
monthly bill drop?
</P>
<P>
   A: The greater numbers possible because of the merger might save
the new company money on its health plan, but it probably won't cut
your bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monthly bills are priced at market value,'' Reising said.
``Most of the cost _ technical support and customer service _
depends on the customers. So you don't save much on that by merging
two companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will I need new software?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not right away. MindSpring recently issued an upgrade and
EarthLink is close to completing one. In the future, when software
upgrades are issued, there will most likely be one set of software.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the companies expect people to quit subscribing to the
service because of the merger?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. MindSpring loses about 5 percent of its customers through
something called ``churn,'' which is the number of customers who
quit subscribing to the service. In the past, the churn rate was
between 3 percent and 4 percent. The acquisitions of Sprynet and
Netcom increased that rate, Reising said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there is a change there can have a potential
impact,'' she said. ``People kind of have to decide whether they
like the change. But because MindSpring and EarthLink have both had
very high customer loyalty and both rank very high in terms of
customer service, I don't think we'll have that problem .''

CLINTON VETO REDUCES CHANCES FOR TAX CUT THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vetoed what he called a
``bloated'' $792 billion Republican tax-cut proposal Thursday,
leaving little likelihood of any kind of tax reduction this year.
</P>
<P>
   Solemn-faced congressional Republicans called it ``a sad day,''
and Clinton hosted a Rose Garden event, complete with a brass band
and a loyal collection of administration officials and Democratic
allies who applauded as Clinton inked the veto message.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is too big, too bloated, and places too big a burden
on America's economy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that the president has stolen this tax cut from
American working families,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, Republican of Mississippi, of the long-promised veto,
Clinton's 29th in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a kind of a sad day here in this US Congress,'' said
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois. ``We
didn't intend to give the president a tax bill to veto.''
</P>
<P>
   The veto had, in fact, been anticipated for weeks and ended what
has been a months-long political dance between the Republican
majority in Congress and the Democratic White House. Congress
doesn't have the votes to override Clinton's veto, and neither side
has approached the other about meeting to work on a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Both feel they have scored political points, however. The
Republicans, who tried to sell the tax package to a somewhat
indifferent American public over the summer, are setting themselves
up as the tax-cut party on the eve of the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats contend that American voters are more concerned
with saving Social Security and Medicare, both of which the
administration insists would be damaged under the Republican
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how the tax drama will play in next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The American public has tended in polls to favor both tax cuts
and saving Social Security, Medicare, and other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   And with the economy doing so well, voters aren't clamoring for
new fiscal policies, said Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a
conservative think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans aren't paying attention to much of anything going on
in Washington. We're prosperous, and so people aren't looking to
Washington right now to solve their problems,'' Moore said.
``Ultimately, they don't want big change right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the White House, after decades of fighting over
what to do about budget deficits, are now unable to agree on what
to do with a massive, projected budget surplus of $3 trillion over
the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress, voting largely along party lines,
passed a 10-year tax-cut package that would have lowered the tax
rate for every tax bracket by 1 percent over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   It would have eliminated the so-called ``marriage penalty'' by
increasing the standard deduction for couples filing jointly, and
eventually repeal the ``death tax,'' the levy on inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan also would have allowed full deductions of
health insurance premiums in some cases and lowered the capital
gains tax rate. The plan also would have upped the tax-deductible
amounts for Individual Retirement Accounts and IRA-like education
accounts. Businesses would also have received various tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the impact _ and cost _ of the tax package, would be
felt in the later years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the country can't afford such a huge tax
cut, and the plan would force devastating cuts in spending for such
constituent favorites as Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when America is moving in the right direction, this
bill would turn us back to the failed policies of the past,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would force drastic cuts in education, health care and
other vital areas. It would cripple our ability to pay down the
debt. It would not add a day to the Social Security Trust Fund, it
would not add a day to the Medicare trust fund or modernize
Medicare with prescription drug coverage,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the
Republican plan would have forced $41 billion in Medicare cuts over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is especially worrisome to teaching hospitals,
which already have suffered dramatic cuts in Medicare reimbursement
because of the Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   The extra cash from the budget surplus should be used to shore
up Medicare and Social Security and to diminish the national debt,
Clinton insists. The White House says it is willing to go along
with about $300 billion in tax relief, up from an earlier
recommendation of $250 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise seemed highly unlikely, especially since Congress
has a big legislative plate to clear before it recesses. It is
almost certain that Congress will not pass all the appropriations
bills before the end of the fiscal year next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said his party was committed to a tax cut, but it would
probably happen ``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Republicans not to ``throw in the towel,'' but he
made no gestures toward planning a White House tax summit or
suggesting he might accept a tax cut above $300 billion .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed ironic that we have been bickering about a
surplus, when just a decade ago, we were bickering about what
people saw as runaway deficits,'' said Representative Richard E.
Neal, Democrat of Springfield, a member of the House Ways and Means
Committee that writes tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Mr. Lott's position, I don't think they really want to
go to the White House and negotiate,'' Neal said.

FEAR AT FLORIDA A&AMP;M AFTER BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (Eds.: no byline)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ After the explosion of a second pipe bomb at
a predominantly black college here, students at Florida A&AMP;M
University expressed fear and frustration Thursday about the
possibly racial motivation behind the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   School officials clamped down on security after the latest bomb
exploded on Wednesday morning in a building where classes are held,
three weeks after another homemade device went off in the
administration building of the 12,000-student university. No one
was injured by either blast.
</P>
<P>
   Before the explosion, a caller telephoned a local television
station to announce the presence of the bomb in language laced with
racial slurs and profanity, said the university's president,
Frederick Humphries. A similar call was made around the time of the
first bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Many students said they were frightened that the second bombing
had happened near classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said Troed Williams, an 18-year-old freshman
from Fort Lauderdale. ``I don't understand why bombing a black
college would make you feel better if you don't like
African-American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students worried about where else a bomb might be placed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally am very afraid,'' said Tiffany Bush, a junior
from Thomasville, Ga. ``Is it leading to something bigger? Are they
going to go to the dorms?''
</P>
<P>
   Some students and faculty members said classes, which were
canceled on Wednesday afternoon after the bombing, should have also
been dismissed Thursday, so officials could address concerns about
safety. A university hot line established to provide information
about the explosion to parents and students has been ringing
nonstop since Wednesday, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The university is tightening security procedures and tripling
its security force. Starting on Monday, Humphries said, students
and members of the faculty and staff will be required to wear
identification badges at all times on campus. Doors to all
buildings will be locked, with only one entrance, guarded by a
law-enforcement officer, open at each building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show our students and our parents we have the
situation under control,'' Humphries said, adding that the
university ``will go to the very limit to make sure that these kids
are safe and secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphries said the university had been promised money to install
campus security cameras by Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. Bush said, ``I
am outraged and appalled by what appears to be a purely racially
motivated crime.''
</P>
<P>
   As students returned to classes Thursday, federal, state and
local law-enforcement officers joined to investigate the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeking to determine if
any federal civil rights statutes have been violated, a bureau
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials offered a $10,000 reward for information after the
first bombing but increased that amount to $16,000 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both bombs were set off in men's restrooms that were vacant when
the explosions occurred. The first bomb went off on Aug. 31 in the
building housing the university president's office. The second was
in the four-story Perry Paige building, which houses classrooms,
laboratories, the campus computer center and Navy ROTC offices.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, which damaged portions of the ceiling, caused more
damage than the earlier bomb.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's explosion, university officials received a
telephone call informing them that yet another bomb was in a campus
building, but a search found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Humphries said that despite the obvious similarities in the two
bombings, it was unknown whether they were committed by the same
person.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members in the building where the explosion took place
expressed frustration with the administration's handling of the
bombing. Professors in the animal science department said that by
Thursday afternoon, they still had not received a message from
their dean or any other university official about the latest
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel safe being here right now? No,'' said Donna Banks, a
research associate in animal biotechnology, who was in the building
when the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   Humphries acknowledged the fears and frustrations of faculty
members, students and parents, as well as his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hurting us, and it's frustrating,'' he said. ``It is
very distasteful to think that there is someone out there who would
want to do this kind of thing to Florida A&AMP;M University. I don't
know what kind of person would want to take away the opportunities
that this university represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Some on the campus said they would not be intimidated by the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a hate crime, I don't want to give them the
satisfaction of getting away with it,'' said Keith Harris, 21, a
senior from Milwaukee. ``I figure it will make me stronger if I get
through this.''

HISTORIC CIVIL WAR SWORD GOING TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One of Boston's oldest attractions is handing over its
sword to one of the city's newest attractions, a piece of American
history being passed down through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, the ceremonial sword of a Civil War hero,
Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, Boston-born commander of the famed 54th
Regiment of African-Americans, has given visitors to the Old North
Church museum a taste of what happened during one of the country's
darkest hours.
</P>
<P>
   The engraved steel arm made by Wilkinson Sword in London, was
sent to Shaw by his uncle, George Robert Russell, in June 1863, to
commemorate Shaw's promotion to the rank of regiment colonel.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in a ceremony at the African Meeting House on Beacon
Hill, presided over by the Right Rev. Barbara C. Harris, Episcopal
suffragan bishop of Massachusetts, the sword will arrive at a new
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Old North Church, in a gesture of brotherly love, will
present the sword to the Museum of Afro-American History. The
museum, which was founded in 1963, is completing a major renovation
at its Meeting House site.
</P>
<P>
   For the church the choice seemed obvious: Where better to tell
the story of the valor of African-American soldiers than a museum
that has gained international acclaim for its collection of black
history?
</P>
<P>
   The Meeting House, which houses some of the museum's artifacts,
was built in 1806 and is the oldest existing black church building
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a church first and a museum second and it seemed to us
to be good stewardship to give this sword to a sister museum where
it can tell its story best,'' the Rev. Stephen T. Ayres, vicar of
Old North Church, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres, 44, said Old North's board of directors supported him
unequivocally in the plan to give the museum the sword, ``appraised
at between $40,000 to $50,000, outright, with no strings
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   The sword has a black handle and a 39-inch blade, engraved with
``E Pluribus Unum,'' a six-pointed star representing eternity as
well as the word ``union.'' Its scabbard is plain steel.
</P>
<P>
   The Old North Church acquired the sword as a gift in the
mid-1960s when the Robert Gould Shaw Settlement House in the South
End was torn down for urban renewal. The settlement house gave the
sword to the church in gratitude for the service a former minister
had provided for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Watts McKinney, executive director of the museum,
expressed ``delight'' with the gift because it is an artifact
``that comes from the white side'' of the history of the Civil War,
alluding to the fact that Shaw was white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you get a phone call where they say they want to
give you a rare and unusual artifact, your heart jumps,'' she
added. ``We know such artifacts exist in auction houses, but to
acquire them is beyond our budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Conklin, 68, a retired engineer and an amateur historian,
planned to be at the ceremony. Thirteen of Conklin's ancestors
fought in the Civil War in either the 54th or 55th Regiments. One
of them was his great-grandfather, Nahum Gardner Hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nahum was 9 in 1839,'' Conklin said, ``he was kidnapped
from his home in Lunenberg (Mass.) and taken to Virginia to be sold
into slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, he was considered `dangerous' in the slave pen because he
could read and write and a constable from Massachusetts went to
Virgina and brought him back. Nahum soon volunteered for the 54th.
He was wounded in the battle at Honey Hill, but came back to live
until he was 83.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts McKinney said she was pleased that the Old North Church
had enough faith in her museum's ability to give the sword a proper
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wonderful,'' Watts McKinney added, ``that Father Ayres
chose this organization when so many others were interested, that
he placed confidence in us that we would know what do do with such
a rare find. A transfer of an artifact is not easy and it was a
step of bravery on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the colonel's descendants, Samuel Parkman Shaw, 56, of
Brookline, was also enthusiastic about the gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an act of great generosity that the Old North has been
willing and happy to make this significant contribution,'' Shaw
said. ``It is an important consolidation that the sword is going to
the museum where it will join a bust of the colonel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, also, significant from the point of view that the Shaw
family, in the late 18th and 19th century, had in their employ many
blacks who undoubtedly worshipped at the Meeting House.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Regiment became the
stuff of which legends are made. Books have been written about
their bravery. A 1989 hit film, ``Glory,'' recounted it.
</P>
<P>
   It is memorialized in the Augustus Saint Gaudens sculpture on
the Boston Common, which was dedicated 34 years after Shaw's death
at the battle of Fort Wagner, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Shaw was considered an unlikely hero.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-educated son of prominent Unitarian abolitionists,
he was chosen at the age of 25 to command the regiment by
Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew. Early in 1863, Andrew
was given permission by the secretary of war to form a regiment of
free African-Americans, the first black regiment formed after the
Emancipation Proclamation, to fight in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was killed when he led the 54th in an attack on Fort
Wagner, S.C. in 1863 and, at his request, was buried in a common
grave with his black enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Parkman Shaw, who is a private trustee, remembered that
his grandfather, after whom he was named, ``knew people at Harvard
who had known the colonel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather, who was in the Harvard class of 1899, always
said that Colonel Shaw was a very unlikely appointment for the
governor to have made because he was very shy and retiring, but
also somewhat spoiled because he was a rich boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Shaw continued, ``my grandfather always felt that it
was the appointment that made a man out of the colonel, that he was
a person who came from nothing into a leadership position, through
not so much dint of natural talent as through persistence and a
strong belief in the virtue of what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial sword, which would not have been used in battle,
has an unclear early history. Shaw said he believed it was in the
possession of another Shaw descendent, the late Francis Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that when the Robert Gould Shaw Settlement
House was torn down in the mid 1960s, Francis Shaw gave the sword
to the Rev. Howard Kellett, the vicar of Old North Church, in
recognition of Kellett's service as trustee of the settlement
house.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership of the sword has never been an issue, Ayres said.
``Given all the controversy there has been in the last few years
about the appropriate location of artifacts, we did some
soul-searching and found that while the struggle for freedom was
key in both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, we were primarily
about the first.''

8 STOCK EXCHANGES PLEDGE TO BEGIN A UNIFIED SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, MARKETS-LEVITT) 
(lh) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Threatened by looming competition from new
electronic trading networks, Europe's eight biggest stock exchanges
rekindled efforts Thursday to create a pan-European system.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, top executives from the exchanges
pledged to begin a unified system for trading European blue-chip
stocks by November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement falls short of the ambitious plans laid out by
the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges nearly 18 months ago, and
it failed to silence warnings from some financial institutions that
Europe's exchanges are falling behind the times.
</P>
<P>
   Just Thursday, three big institutions _ Dresdner Bank of
Germany, Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch _ formally
signed on as investors in an alternative electronic exchange called
Tradepoint Financial Networks PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Tradepoint currently competes with the London Stock Exchange,
although it still has only a tiny share of British trading volumes.
Its lead investor is a consortium that includes Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, J.P. Morgan, Warburg Dillon Read and Instinet, the
electronic trading system owned by the Reuters Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   European stock exchanges have been trying for years to build a
common system, particularly since the adoption this year of the
euro as the new common currency for 11 European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is acute on two fronts. Independent electronic
trading networks pose an increasingly serious challenge to
traditional exchanges here, just as they do in the United States.
But on top of that, investors want to reap the benefits of Europe's
currency union.
</P>
<P>
   The London and Frankfurt exchanges, which are by far the largest
in Europe, have announced their own bilateral plan to build a
common system for trading Europe's biggest stocks early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Angry about being left out, the bourses from Paris; Amsterdam,
Netherlands; Milan, Italy; Madrid, Spain; Brussels, and Zurich,
Switzerland, joined the project last year. But the progress bogged
down. Even London and Frankfurt have been unable to agree about
which exchange's system, Frankfurt's Xetra or London's SETS should
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of deciding on a common technology, the exchanges will
try to establish an interface to allow the different trading
systems to communicate and, in theory, behave as a single system
for blue-chip stocks. Under the agreement announced Thursday, the
eight exchanges agreed to a common model and list of operating
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now dealers have had to log on to eight different
bourses,'' said Werner Seifert, chairman of the Deutsche Boerse in
Frankfurt, at a news conference in Brussels. ``Now there will be
one electronic plug and one common virtual blue-chip market.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges agreed to embrace common rules on the size and
types of trading orders, systems for handling large block trades
and other procedures. Also, the exchanges will all act as ``central
counterparties,'' which means they will act as intermediaries
between buyers and sellers and preserve the anonymity of both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts are skeptical that alternative networks like
Tradepoint can seriously encroach on the existing exchanges. For
all the convenience of an independent electronic trading network,
the key issue for traders is having access to large trading
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Tradepoint nor its lead investors have said whether they
want the fledgling British network to evolve into a full-blown
European trading system.
</P>
<P>
   But financial institutions have become increasingly frustrated
by the slow progress of Europe's traditional exchanges. Companies
like J.P. Morgan appear at least partly interested in prodding the
exchanges to speed up their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at the nature of exchanges around the
world,'' said Ronald K. Dewhurst, head of European equities at J.P.
Morgan. ``They are reactionary bodies governed by factional
interests that have not historically embraced change. The only time
they act is when they're threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst greeted Thursday's announcement as a ``small step'' in
the right direction. But he also reiterated his warning that the
exchanges were in danger of becoming obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the exchanges do not move along with changes in the market,
then someone will take the market away from them,'' he said. ``The
way to deal with the problem is not to pretend that it is not
happening.''

 &HT;    Catching up to AOL will take time, analysts say
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The new EarthLink management team sounded more like a
pro football team headed for the Super Bowl than a new Internet
service provider running a clear, but distant second to America
Online. However, the big question analysts and industry observers
have is whether the projected 8 million subscribers aimed for by
the end of 2001 will be enough to catch industry powerhouse AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, we offer a better experience than AOL,'' says
MindSpring President and Chief Operating Officer Michael McQuary,
who will be president of the new company. ``I don't believe any
leader in our industry is unassailable. On a percentage basis,
we've closed the gap considerably. ``It is a realistic ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to compete like never before,'' says Charles
Brewer, chairman and chief executive of MindSpring, who will become
chairman of the new company. ``In the Internet business, there has
not been a significant No. 2. Well, now there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds McQuary, ``For folks who don't believe it can be done,
think about (MindSpring founder and Chairman) Charles Brewer in his
apartment in Ansley Park _ you would have gotten the same crazy
stares as the people who don't think we can make a run at number
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger is ``a very logical deal. The merged company will be
a much stronger competitor in the ISP industry than each was able
to be separately,'' said Joe Laszlo, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be some time before AOL has to worry about the new
EarthLink, he said. ``Chasing AOL is the Holy Grail for any ISP,
but neither EarthLink nor MindSpring nor anyone else for that
matter in terms of content, security and community is able to match
AOL.'' He said the new EarthLink/MindSpring combination may
eventually be able to pool its resources and build something that
can take on AOL, but not right away. ``Nothing they have right now
is strong competition to AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   Jag Sheth, marketing professor at Emory University's Goizueta
Business School says the deal makes sense, but warns that even
though the company's goal is to catch up to AOL, they need to pay
attention to the new second tier of companies that includes AT&AMP;T's
WorldNet service and Excite(at)Home,
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's broadband service. ``Watch out for AT&AMP;T,'' Sheth says.
``Through their (at)Home service, they compete as both a portal
(the first page a user sees on the Web) and an ISP. They are a
triple threat because they can offer cable TV, telephone service
and Internet access; soon they will offer wireless access to the
Internet. At this time, MindSpring only offers dial-up access to
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo agrees with Sheth that while MindSpring looks toward
catching AOL, they should also be mindful of the companies looking
to catch up with them. Among potential rivals are companies such as
NetZero, which offers free Internet access. Founded in October
1998, the company already has 1.7 million subscribers and is the
fifth-largest ISP. Laszlo also believes the Microsoft dial-up
network could present a formidable challenge to the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   ``MSN is revising their strategy and is a much more immediate
threat,'' Laszlo says. ``The combined company will be better at
facing and addressing competition from Microsoft. I definitely see
Microsoft doing more aggressive things in the dial-up area. They
have a free PC deal and other deals in place for discounted MSN
service that should boost MSN's subscriber base up from the
estimated 2 million subscribers it has now. ''
</P>
<P>
   But the new EarthLink/MindSpring combo has set its sights on AOL
and isn't much concerned about smaller companies moving in on their
turf. ``Today starts a new era in the Internet access arena,''
bubbled Charles ``Garry'' Betty, the new company's chief executive
officer. ``Sky (Dayton, EarthLink founder), Charles (Brewer,
MindSpring founder), Mike McQuary and I are joining together to
form a significant number two player behind AOL. We are definitely
leapfrogging AT&AMP;T and Microsoft for reliable, quality Internet
access. We have left most of our competitors in the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered what to do with the portal (the MindSpring
homepage) and partnerships that make sense,'' McQuary says. ``We
tried to think about what other combinations you could possibly
merge with. In trying to take care of the three constituents that
mattered to us _ subscribers, shareholders and employees _ we
realized the clear winner was EarthLink.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the MindSpring name is a more emotional issue in the
Southeast than it is in the rest of the country, McQuary says.
``There's an overreaction to the name change. People don't love the
name, they love what it represents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jupiter's Laszlo says the loss of MindSpring as an
independent company is cause for melancholy. ``EarthLink and
MindSpring have both been going at it independently for so long
it's kind of sad to see them both go, even if they are rolling into
one company.''

WHAT GETS LOST IN MARKET PROLIFERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKETS-LEVITT, MARKETS-EUROPE) 
(mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Knowledge is power, in the stock market as well as
other places. And until recently, regulation had assured that
anywhere in America that major stocks were traded _ whether on the
New York Stock Exchange or in some competitive market _ investors
could learn almost immediately about the size and price of each
trade.
</P>
<P>
   But something very important has been lost in the current
environment, which is reminiscent of the Maoist slogan, ``Let A
Hundred Flowers Boom.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of new places to trade has brought benefits. The
costs of executing a trade are lower than they have ever been, and
part of the reason is competition between markets for orders in the
same stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But as the number of trading markets proliferates, one important
benefit of the old system _ the visibility of trading information
to everyone interested _ has been put aside. Everyone agrees that
such visibility is a good idea, but it has not been a priority.
</P>
<P>
   In the prepared taxt of his speech on market structure at
Columbia Law School Thursday night, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, posed the following
rhetorical question: ``Today, is there `fragmentation' in the sense
that there are separate, isolated markets with reduced liquidity in
normal trading hours?'' His answer: ``I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is, although it has not become very important
yet. In its zeal to encourage competition for established markets,
the SEC has allowed the new electronic communications networks, or
ECNs in the jargon, to begin trading without having any way to
distribute their quotes to public investors in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the essential part of Levitt's question was the phrase
``in normal trading hours.'' Outside those hours, the market
fragmentation is real and troubling. After hours, the ECNs are the
only markets open to the public. If late trading catches on _ so
far, there has been more talk about it than actual trading _
investors may find themselves at a serious disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before he delivered his speech Thursday, Levitt
said he was determined to arrange for such disclosures. But he
seemed surprised by the idea that the SEC should not have allowed
such trading to proceed until disclosures were assured.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the delay is the way the system of distributing
quotes grew. The consolidated tape, which handles trades from most
exchanges, and the NASDAQ tape, which handles its trades, are a
vital source of income to the exchanges and NASDAQ. Some exchanges
would be in financial trouble without the income they get from
selling the information on the tapes to companies and individuals.
The new exchanges want to get in on that money, and the old
exchanges are not eager to let them in. In any case, the tape is
not open during some of the hours that after-hours trading now
takes place.
</P>
<P>
   While the arguments continue over how to distribute the
information, and over who will profit from it, the trading is
taking place without dissemination. It is the investors who may be
the losers.

``lack of parliamentary decorum.'' An investigating committee also
accused Pascoal, who was head of the military police in the Amazon

optimistic illusion. But this time the formula doesn't work nearly
as well. It's never quite as magical, emotionally gripping or as
darkly funny as Roberto Benigni's film, and Robin Williams'
self-conscious and rather bland performance never comes close to
bringing his character to life.

TAKING STOCK IN TRUMP THE COMPANY AND TRUMP THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald Trump, the latest would-be presidential
candidate, was bragging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political people like me because I do well in polls,''
Trump said in a chat this week. ``In Manhattan real estate, my name
is a huge positive.'' He brandished a chart showing that Trump
condominiums cost at least 79 percent more than non-Trump condos.
``This is the real Trump factor.''
</P>
<P>
   So why does the stock in Trump's casino company seem to be about
as popular with investors as Pat Buchanan's musings on Adolf Hitler
are with voters? ``People don't understand this company,'' Trump
moaned, adding that perhaps ``the investment community thinks I am
going to take the company private.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not what the investment community thinks. If
investors thought the company was going to be bought _ by Trump or
anyone else _ they would be bidding up the stock price. Instead, it
languishes at levels about 15 percent of the peak reached three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rap on Wall Street about Trump is that he operates Trump
Hotels and Casino Resorts as if there were no public shareholders.
In conversation, he uses the word ``I'' when talking about himself,
and he uses the same word when talking about the company.
</P>
<P>
   That public shareholders have done poorly with Trump should not,
perhaps, be a surprise. They suffered mightily during his first
venture running a public company, after he took control of the
Resorts International casino company back in 1987. Shareholders
ended up with far less than the market value of their stock at the
time Trump arrived.
</P>
<P>
   All three of Trump's Atlantic City casinos later went bankrupt,
but he managed to keep control of them and, in 1995, Trump Hotels
was organized to own two of the casino hotels and sell stock to the
public at $14 a share. At first, the shares fell, but they soon
rallied and then soared _ peaking at $35.50 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But then Trump decided that the company should buy his third
Atlantic City casino from him. The price seemed high to many, but
public shareholders voted their trust in Trump, and the company
bought the Trump Castle, since renamed the Marina.
</P>
<P>
   Investors soon concluded that the company had badly overpaid,
and the stock price collapsed. Unfortunately for Trump, his 42
percent stake in the company was pledged to secure a loan from
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, the company's underwriters, and the
value of the collateral was plunging. So Trump borrowed $25 million
from the company, and used some of that money to repay the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, no other shareholder facing a margin call on
his Trump Hotels stock received similar treatment. But Trump
defends it as a good deal for the company. He is paying prime rate
_ now 8.25 percent _ on the loan, which he says is more than the
company could get if it put the money in a bank.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company goes deeper and deeper into debt,
paying high junk-bond interest rates. Its bonds trade at yields
around 15 percent. Trump says he will repay the loan next summer
and voices confidence that the company will be able to refinance
its debts at lower rates. He says the Castle purchase was a good
one.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the company's problems can be blamed on Trump. Casinos
have suffered as more and more competition has appeared, and Wall
Street has penalized the entire industry. But his company has been
penalized more than most, and the stock, now at $4.44, is not
climbing even though the casinos' financial results are improving.
</P>
<P>
   As New York's most famous property developer toys with seeking
the Reform Party presidential nomination, his popularity appears to
be highest among those who have not invested in his company.

 &HT;    Insurance adjusters trickle in as flooding recedes
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINETOPS, N.C. _ As flood waters recede, an army of insurance
adjusters is slogging across eastern North Carolina to put a price
tag on Hurricane Floyd's fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say it is too early to tell whether claims on Floyd
will top the $1.3 billion paid on 425,000 claims after Hurricane
Fran in 1996. But claims for property and auto damage are pouring
in. Adjusters who mobilized last week are moving into communities
devastated by North Carolina's worst natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Not all towns are yet out from under water. In places where
water has receded, residents are returning to houses and trailers
where flooding upended refrigerators, beds and television sets, and
left vehicles filled with mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the depth of the water and the length of time it stayed
inside buildings that made it so bad,'' said Mike Maroney, an
independent flood insurance adjuster surveying houses around
Pinetops.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of homes in this town of 1,500 suffered damage, but
relatively few had flood insurance. Across eastern North Carolina,
that proved a costly decision for owners of many of the estimated
30,000 homes damaged by Floyd. State officials estimate that more
than 1,600 homes are beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very widespread,'' said Earl Coker, Pinetops mayor and
owner of a local insurance company that bears his name. ``The
magnitude of the damage is hard to imagine. Nobody ever thought the
water would rise as high as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Among 75 property claims Coker's office has handled so far, a
dozen had flood insurance. In those cases, lenders required
homeowners to obtain the flood insurance, more expensive than
homeowners insurance, Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single one came in and (voluntarily) asked for flood
insurance,'' said the 65-year-old mayor, who lost two tractors to
flooding. ``It costs money.''
</P>
<P>
   Property owners can turn to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency for low-interest loans or grants to repair or rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not going to cover 100 percent of the damage,'' said
Teresa Abbott, a FEMA community relations officer who visited
Pinetops on Thursday. ``But it could help them recoup as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   East of Pinetops, in a predominantly black area at the juncture
of two crooked creeks, Town and Bynum Mill, flooding took its
greatest toll. Six of 12 people fleeing in a motor boat last
Thursday drowned in the Dodge City subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services for one of the victims, 5-year-old Teshika
Vines, is scheduled today in nearby Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Thierman arrived in Pinetops on Thursday, dispatched to
assess damage to vehicles in this hard-hit southern end of
Edgecombe County. Flooding was so severe that it seemed her job as
an Integon claims representative would be relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything back there was submerged,'' said the 29-year-old
adjuster from Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   But as one of the first official-looking people to venture into
the Bynum Park subdivision, she didn't escape notice by residents
hauling their soaked household belongings into the sun.
</P>
<P>
   As she looked for vehicles carrying Integon insurance, Thierman
patiently listened to people who recounted how they escaped from
the flooding through their attics. Along Bynum Farm Road, she
fended off three grunting pigs and, attempting to photograph a car,
she nearly stepped on a dead cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad to see you here,'' said James Nobles, 68, who
lives in the Bynum Park subdivision. ``Everybody is tired of
walking, thumbing or bumming their way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that his 1988 Chrysler New Yorker and 1987 Fleetwood
Cadillac were ruined, Nobles hoped Thierman would write him a check
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have the titles to the cars?'' Thierman said, as she
nervously eyed Nobles' growling black Chow, named Boss.
</P>
<P>
   No, Nobles answered. ``If it washed down the creek somewhere, I
don't know what we'll do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thierman assured him he'd eventually get paid, probably in a
week or two when she returns to dispense checks to vehicle owners
who were not at home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Once she found the swamped vehicles, she identified them against
Integon's records, jotted down the mileage and license plate
number, and snapped a few photographs. She calculated how much
Integon would pay the vehicle's owner on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   In a day or two, Integon will dispatch a wrecker to retrieve the
vehicles. Most of them will be salvaged for parts, or repaired and
resold. They're no good sitting where they are now, except as
breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gas tank is full of water right now,'' said James Dickens,
looking under the hood of his red 1980 Chevy pickup. ``It ain't
cranking.''

CLINTON VETOES $792 REPUBLICAN TAX CUT PACKAGE

(th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton vetoed the $792 billion
Republican tax cut Thursday, but called on Congress to reach a
bipartisan compromise with him on taxes, domestic spending and the
long-term financing problems facing Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress and the White House headed for a showdown in
coming weeks over spending priorities for next year _ and with time
running out for his administration to make substantive progress on
big issues _ Clinton urged both parties not to ``throw in the
towel'' this year before trying again to reach a broad budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Congress and the administration had an obligation
to try to assure the financial health of Social Security and
Medicare and to provide adequate funding for education,
environmental programs and health care while still making progress
in reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days ahead, I will ask the Republican majority to work
with me to fulfill these fundamental obligations we have to our
children and to our future,'' Clinton said before vetoing the tax
bill at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. ``If we can work
together to meet these objectives, we can also work together to
pass tax relief we can afford, affordable middle class tax relief
that reflects the priorities of both parties and the values of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he was flexible, Clinton made no specific new
offers and he did not call for direct negotiations. And his attempt
to engage Congress drew a stiff arm from Republican leaders on
Capitol Hill, who have said for weeks that they would not be lured
into last-minute budget negotiations with a president they
distrust.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said their goals for now are to
block demands by the White House for increased federal spending and
higher taxes, and to pass the appropriations bills needed to
operate the government without dipping into the portion of next
year's budget surplus that comes from excess Social Security
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work with the president,'' Hastert said in a
statement. ``But we will not work with the president to raise
taxes, raid the Social Security trust fund or pile on more debt on
the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal dueling illustrated how both parties are increasingly
intent on reaping political gain by blocking the other side's
initiatives rather than on compromising and enacting legislation _
despite the opportunities created by projections of rapidly
mounting budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House staged Thursday's veto with all the trappings of
a victory ceremony. The Marine band was playing. Cabinet
secretaries and senior administration aides were gathered in the
sun-drenched Rose Garden, representatives of interest groups were
invited, and Clinton sat behind a desk on a platform to wield the
veto pen with the same flourish he might use in signing a favored
bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had made clear even before it was passed by the
Republican-led Congress in July that he would reject the $792
billion tax cut, which over the next decade would reduce personal
income tax rates, provide a break for many two-income couples, cut
capital gains taxes, repeal the inheritance tax and give
corporations and special interests a variety of provisions they
favored.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the tax bill used too much of the projected
surplus, would require deep cuts in domestic spending, did nothing
to stabilize the big social welfare programs and risked a return of
crippling budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will veto this bill because it is wrong for Medicare, wrong
for Social Security, wrong for education and wrong for the
economy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said later that the
administration was willing to provide more time to work out a deal
on the budget issues by signing a two-week temporary budget that
would keep the government operating in the all but certain event
that Congress has not passed all its spending bills by the start of
the new fiscal year next Friday, Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of both parties in Congress, though, see little
hope for any broad budget compromise this year. They said
Republicans are eager to use tax cuts and spending restraint as
issues in next year's elections, while Democrats see Medicare and
to a lesser extent Social Security as powerful issues working in
their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are a few optimists in both parties who think some
kind of limited deal might be struck.
</P>
<P>
   One vehicle for progress might be a package of routine tax
provisions that the House Ways and Means Committee is set to draw
up on Friday. The provisions include an extension of a credit for
corporate research and development costs, credits for companies
that hire workers from welfare rolls and rules that limit the
effect of the alternative minimum tax on low and middle income
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of both parties think there is room to expand the
package to include provisions with bipartisan support such as a
reduction in the so-called marriage penalty that hurts many
two-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials think their best chance for bipartisanship
rests with efforts in the Senate Finance Committee to draft
legislation shoring up Medicare and adding a prescription drug
benefit to the program.
</P>
<P>
   But a previous attempt to develop a bipartisan approach to
Medicare collapsed earlier this year, and the issue is so
complicated that prospects for a deal before Congress goes home
later this year appear slim.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of reaching a compromise on shoring up Social
Security appear even more remote. Despite nearly two years of
effort to find a middle ground, most Democrats remain wedded to
keeping the current system of retirement benefits intact and most
Republicans want to move toward a system under which workers could
invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the stock market.

   I'll Take a Double Latte And a Personal Loan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call South Umpqua Bank a store or a computer cafe, says Raymond
P. Davis, but please do not call it a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, chief executive of South Umpqua, based in Roseburg, Ore.,
said he doesn't want his bank's 15 branches to be ``prisons'' like
most banks; he wants his customers to kick back and relax.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, South Umpqua offers fresh-brewed coffee, sofas and
chairs, background music, a rack of magazines and newspapers, a
big-screen TV (usually tuned to a financial news channel) and
computer terminals for trading stocks over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is also gadgetry that lets customers learn about the
bank's offerings or even buy postage stamps. ``We're retailers,''
Davis said. ``We're a store where you buy things, only we sell bank
products and services, not Levis.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank-cum-cafe idea came from Charlene Stern, president of
Stern Marketing Group in Berkeley, Calif., who calls most banks
shortsighted for sending off their customers to automated teller
machines and discouraging visits to branches. Those banks reduce
costs but lose an opportunity to cross-sell, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the come-in-and-browse approach was a big reason that
South Umpqua's earnings have been growing 20 percent annually. Its
customers use an average of 2.5 of the bank's products _ checking
accounts, personal loans and so on _ compared with 1.2 for average
American bank customer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Locals in Roseburg, a logging town not yet blessed with a
Starbucks outlet, seem to like the kaffeeklatsch atmosphere. Joy
Marie Yeo, a patient advocate at a local hospital, said that the
last time she was in the bank, she schmoozed over coffee with her
dentist and his wife. While there, she made a mental note of the
automated loan machine in the bank. ``I've got a daughter who may
be going to medical school,'' she said.

   Perfect Pitch? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They are going after 20- and 30-somethings who are still forming
brand preferences. So why is the catchy, irreverent ad campaign
such a surprise? Because the ``product'' is a 370-year-old
blueblood church on Fifth Avenue in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Marble Collegiate, once the home of the Rev. Norman Vincent
Peale, wanted to attract young churchgoers who seem to be searching
spiritually, said Rev. Arthur Caliandro, the church's minister. A
longtime church member, John Follis, and his ad agency, Follis
Advertising, came up with ads that play up a coffee hour (``Happier
than most happy hours'') and $7.95 Sunday brunch (``Feed your soul
and stuff your face'') and boast, ``Our product really does perform
miracles.'' Naturally, all mention the church's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better product to advertise,'' Follis said,
``than one that is omnipotent and free with an after-lifetime
guarantee.'' &QL;

OF OVERCONFIDENCE AND THE ONLINE TRADER

<P>
   ``Don't confuse brains with a bull market.'' While no investor
should forget that market truth, anyone who is tempted to start
trading stocks on line should pay special heed. New research has
concluded that online investors are particularly prone to giving
their own brains all the credit for their short-term success and
discounting the role of luck. And all too often, such conceit leads
to self-destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The research, by Brad M. Barber and Terrance Odean, associate
and assistant finance professors, respectively, at the Graduate
School of Management at the University of California at Davis,
focused on trading by more than 1,600 individual investors from
1991 through 1996 at a large discount brokerage firm; at some point
during those years, the investors switched from trading by phone to
trading online.
</P>
<P>
   (Because the firm, which the professors declined to identify,
was a discount brokerage house, the investors were never receiving
brokers' advice.) Over all, the professors found that the fortunes
of the investors took a turn for the worse once they moved online.
</P>
<P>
   Before the switch, these investors turned in stellar
performances, beating the market by an average of more than two
percentage points a year. Such performance not only put them ahead
of the vast majority of individual investors, but it was also
enough to beat more than 90 percent of mutual fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after the switch, the investors lagged behind the market by
more than three percentage points a year, on average _ a
significant reversal of more than five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Intuitively, the downturn might not look that surprising, since
we generally expect several fat years to be followed by lean ones.
But that doesn't explain the returns of these investors: Speaking
strictly statistically, an investor's performance in any given year
is totally unrelated to that of the previous year, just as the
fifth flip of a coin has a 50-50 chance of coming up tails, even
after four consecutive heads.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to these investors?
</P>
<P>
   The professors dug deeply and came up with several findings.
They observed, for example, that not only did the turnover rates
rise sharply for these investors' portfolios, to 96 percent a year
from 74 percent, but that these investors also became twice as
speculative in their trading.
</P>
<P>
   The professors devised a particularly creative way to measure
that speculation. They defined speculative trading very narrowly,
as any sale of an entire position in a stock at a profit, followed
by a new purchase of any other stock within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, the professors virtually eliminated trades for
which the investors' motives might have been other than speculative
_ like tax-loss selling or raising cash.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these investors could justify their new online
hyperactivity if their replacement stocks performed better than
their old ones, as they generally did before the switch. In fact,
during those early years, the investors looked like geniuses: Their
replacement stocks outperformed the stocks they sold at an
annualized rate of more than four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   After the switch, however, the investors started looking like
Wrong-Way Corrigans: Their sold stocks outperformed their eventual
replacements at an annualized rate of more than five percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, once they went online, these investors would
have been a lot better off had they resisted the temptation to sell
their original stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The professors' conclusion strikes me as quite fair: Over all,
these investors never had genuine ability, but merely experienced a
run of luck before switching to online trading. Confusing the bull
market with brains, they became overconfident, trading much more
often and more speculatively than they did before _ to their own
detriment. &QL;

BUSINESS LEADERS VOW TO WAGE P.R. WAR ON WTO FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They won't be dressed in costume, and they won't be
picketing in the streets, but the business leaders of America are
preparing to engage in a war of words to defend the free trade
principles they believe will be under attack in Seattle at this
year's meeting of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Many of America's biggest companies and broadest trade
associations have agreed to back a new and fast-growing alliance
whose purpose is not to lobby the world leaders who gather in
Seattle Nov. 30-Dec. 3, but to influence American public opinion
through the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders have become increasingly alarmed in recent
weeks by a steady stream of news stories about protest
preparations, as well as by the misgivings expressed by some
members of the Metropolitan King County Council about the World
Trade Organization meeting. In response, the business community is
promising to become increasingly vocal in its defense of free
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be wearing rubber chicken suits and
rappelling down the Space Needle, but our intention is to provide a
reasoned and rational explanation of the benefits of global trade
expansion to both workers and consumers,'' said Scot Montrey, a
spokesman for the U.S. Alliance for Trade Expansion, the national
coalition whose membership includes local corporate heavyweights
Boeing and Paccar as well as national companies such as General
Electric and IBM. ``All you have to do is read the newspaper to
know that the anti-WTO forces have been more effective, thus far,
than we have, and that's why we're here. We're here to makes sure a
lot of the crazy things they say don't go unanswered.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO meeting, which will bring the trade ministers of more
than 150 countries to Seattle, will be the largest trade meeting
ever on U.S. soil, and promises to attract a colorful and diverse
array of protesters whose tactics are likely to range from holding
alternative talks to staging acts of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was chosen to host the meeting in part because of
Washington state's extraordinary dependence on trade. Washington
claims to be the most trade-dependent state in the country, with
one of four jobs directly related to exports. But the city, with a
strong progressive streak and a history of activism, also has
proven to be fertile territory for consumer and environmental
groups looking for ground troops to protest the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The business community is motivated not only by its concern over
the effect of news coverage of WTO critics on public opinion, but
also by the failure in recent months of Congress to renew
fast-track authority for the president. Fast-track is a provision
that in the past had allowed presidents to negotiate trade deals
and present them to Congress for expedited up-or-down votes without
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done a good job of presenting our case to the
American people,'' said Scott Miller, a lobbyist for Procter &AMP;
Gamble and chairman of the business alliance, known as U.S. Trade.
``There's now a real understanding in the business community that a
lot of our agenda has not moved forward the way we would like it to
because we haven't addressed ourselves in a clear way to answering
`What's in this for Americans?'''
</P>
<P>
   But the business community acknowledges it will be difficult to
compete for attention with protesters who are already getting
trained in attention-getting tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press will always find it more interesting to take
pictures of people practicing to scale buildings or going to a
protest boot camp than a silver-suited businessman trying to make a
point about the trading interests of the United States or an
economist talking about the improvement in consumer welfare,'' said
Ray Waldmann, the Boeing executive who is the director of the
Seattle Host Committee for the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A key organizer for the protesters scoffed at the business
community's efforts. The protesters, drawn from a variety of public
interest groups, argue that the WTO is anti-democratic and is not
appropriately attentive to the concerns of public health, the
environment and labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just quaking down to my boots that the business lobby is
going to put together a public relations campaign,'' said Michael
Dolan, an organizer with Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.
``They're a big business dinosaur that has a thought and then it
takes forever for its big lumbering corporate body to do anything
about it, when we've already scampered ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade hopes to join the debate by providing the news media
and the public with statistical and anecdotal information
bolstering the business community's arguments in favor of
unfettered global trade. The organization will argue that global
trade is responsible for America's booming economy and low
unemployment, and that global trade lowers prices and creates jobs
in America.
</P>
<P>
   The organization will try to steer the conversation toward the
general topic of free trade, and away from the more difficult and
arcane questions surrounding the World Trade Organization itself.
Miller said the business community actually shares some of the
critics' concerns about the WTO, in particular its penchant for
secrecy, but that U.S. business leaders still believe it is good
for the United States because the organization's rules open foreign
markets to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Miller plans to travel to Seattle in coming weeks to recruit
Washington state companies to join the coalition of business
groups, which already boasts more than 200 members, including a
variety of large trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the Business Roundtable.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to set up a ``war room'' in Seattle in the days
leading up to the WTO meeting to provide rapid response from the
pro-trade business community to the many allegations expected to be
raised by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade has been created in part to fill a vacuum created
because the U.S. Trade Representative's office will primarily be
engaged in representing the U.S. government at the meeting, while
the Seattle Host Committee, chaired by Microsoft Chairman and Chief
Executive Bill Gates and Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit, will
be focused on logistics. Neither the Clinton administration nor the
Host Committee has been willing or able to take on the job of
``message'' as aggressively as the business community would like.

 &HT;    Former N.C. day care owner freed of child abuse charges
 &HT;    By Anne R. Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A former day care center owner in Edenton, N.C., whose
trial on charges of molesting dozens of children was the longest,
most expensive and one of the most controversial in the state's
history, became a free man this week.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors on Wednesday dropped the last eight of 107 original
charges against Robert F. Kelly Jr., 51, who operated the Little
Rascals Day Care Center. The charges were filed in 1996 by a girl
who said Kelly molested her when she was 9. She did not attend the
day care center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, prosecutors dropped 99 criminal charges related to
alleged sexual abuse at Little Rascals in the late 1980s. Kelly was
convicted in 1992 of abusing 29 children, but higher courts
overturned the conviction and ordered a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the parents of the children who had accused Kelly
decided to drop the charges. They said they wanted to spare their
children the ordeal of testifying again.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's attorney, Gerald Beaver, said the district attorney has
stated he dropped the case because the alleged victim and her
family do not want to endure a trial. Chowan County District
Attorney Frank Parrish did not return phone calls seeking comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver said his client, who has been free on bond for three
years, was on vacation and could not be reached for comment. ``He's
taking off for parts unknown,'' Beaver said. ``He hasn't been able
to leave the state for nine years, so he called me and said, `I'm
heading south.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly lives in Raleigh with his third wife and works for a
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was one of seven people charged with forcing children at
the center to have sex with adults and other children. Kelly's
trial lasted 10 months and cost more than $1 million, making it the
longest and costliest trial in North Carolina history. Children
wove lurid and sometimes absurd tales of sex, satanic abuse,
spaceships and trained sharks. There was no medical or physical
evidence of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   When Kelly was sentenced to 12 consecutive life terms in prison,
children stood outside the courtroom and chanted: ``I hate you, I
hate you.'' Kelly maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   A cook at the center also was convicted. Kelly's wife at the
time, Elizabeth, and one other defendant pleaded no contest and
served a brief time in jail. Three others never made it to trial
before the charges were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The case received national attention _ first because it sounded
so horrific and then because it sounded hard to believe. Many court
observers doubted the children's stories and believed they had been
coached by therapists who believe abuse can be forgotten and then
remembered. Prosecutors were accused of asking the children leading
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the small town of Edenton were portrayed in some
national media as backward, vindictive hicks on a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Ann-Marie Knighton, Edenton's town manager, sighed wearily
Thursday when asked her reaction to the case against Kelly finally
closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people still talking about this are the reporters,''
she said. ``It was over a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaver said he hopes the nation has learned from Kelly's
experience and others like it. There have been several cases_ in
California and New Jersey, for example _ where adults have been
accused of abusing large groups of children. In most cases, the
charges were eventually judged to be exaggerated or false.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Kelly feels about the case being closed, Beaver said,
``He is as happy a man as I've seen in a long time.''

 &HT;    SENATE VOTES TO SPARE OIL COMPANIES HIGHER ROYALTIES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Senate approved a measure Thursday to
spare oil companies from paying higher royalties for drilling on
public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 51-47.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, sponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
blocks new federal rules for calculating the fees for one year, at
a savings to oil companies estimated at $66 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an independent producer issue,'' Hutchison said as she
wrapped up the latest victory in her crusade on behalf of her
state's key industry. If enacted into law, her moratorium of the
new royalty system would be the fourth she has won in the last 16
months.
</P>
<P>
   IN debate leading up to the vote, Hutchison said the higher
costs from the royalties would be ``the last nail in the coffin''
for some smaller producers.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the proposed new fee system a ``tax,'' she repeatedly
charged that ``it will raise the price of gas at the pump for every
working American.'' However, neither Hutchison nor her office
offered an estimate of how much more per gallon customers would
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had occasionally brought legislation to a halt in the
Senate for the past two weeks, as opponents led by Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., charged that the Hutchison provision was a cave-in
to big oil companies and their campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock ended Thursday when Hutchison mustered the required
60 votes to wrap up debate and force the vote on her measure, which
was an amendment to the annual appropriations bill for the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, the two sides faced each other with dueling
facts, charts and accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and her allies displayed a chart listing the ``seven
schemes'' by which some oil company executives have admitted they
used to miscalculate royalties paid to state and federal
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions are part of lawsuits in which several oil
companies have reached settlements worth $5 billion for
underpayments to states, including Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said those settlements were evidence that the current
method for calculating royalties makes cheating easy.
</P>
<P>
   Oil royalties are generally designated for education,
conservation and Indian tribes. Boxer argued that the taxpayers
have already lost $88 million because the new rules have not been
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison countered with an illustration showing a hodge-podge
of small boxes and connecting lines that she said represented an
impossibly complex new royalty system that the U.S. Mineral
Management Service has designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If oil companies cannot drill because they cannot make a
profit, then they're not going to drill,'' she said. ``There will
be a diminishing of the amount of money that's coming into the
federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's prediction of higher gas prices was rejected by a
private group, which has led a campaign charging oil companies with
shortchanging taxpayers in royalties for use of public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gas prices are regulated by the market.'' said Beth Daley,
spokesman for Project on Government Oversight, which has joined in
several of the lawsuits against oil companies over underpayment of
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Daley said that the 18 energy companies that pay 99
percent of royalties made an estimated $9.2 million in profits for
the first months of this year, according to their most recent
public filings.
</P>
<P>
   The debate Thursday briefly turned into sharp exchanges, as Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wisc., a campaign finance reformer, lambasted
the role of political donations from the oil industry to the
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Reading out a list of donations by energy corporations, he said
that ``I must object...when their deep pockets give them deep
influence that ordinary citizens never have.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's remarks brought protests. Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo.,
asked the chair to rule the the protested that the campaign cash
comments were out of order because they were not germane to the
amendment. But Feingold was permitted to complete his speech.
</P>
<P>
   In her reaction to the developments Thursday, Hutchison said,
``This is a victory for all Americans who are tired of paying
excessive taxes every time they visit the neighborhood gas station.
I am proud that the Senate stood tall and did the right thing.''

STATE DEPARTMENT EXPERT UPBEAT AT INQUIRY INTO RUSSIAN MONEY
LAUNDERING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton's top Russia expert
testifying Thursday before his toughest critic in the Senate about
accusations of Russian corruption and possible American complicity,
the advance billing promised a dramatic confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the exchange fizzled. The expert, Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, largely sidestepped the queries
of the critic, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and Helms
hurried Talbott away from the witness table in less than an hour
after just one round of questions, to make room for a panel of
specialists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Talbott gave an unusually upbeat assessment of the widening
investigation into accusations of Russian laundering of billions of
dollars through American banks and whether top administration
officials turned a blind eye to corruption at the highest levels of
the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption is an important issue that we are taking very
seriously,'' Talbott said. ``But we must keep in mind that it is
part of a much larger process under way in a vast and complex
country.''
</P>
<P>
   He politely ducked Helms' questions about American intelligence
reports on Russian corruption and allegations against specific
officials, and he suggested that the scandal was an unpleasant
price to pay as a ``result of an incomplete transition to democracy
and market reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaring down from his seat, Helms clearly did not wholly accept
Talbott's account. In his opening comments, the senator said the
committee did not challenge the wisdom of ``supporting or engaging
Russia.'' But he expressed concern that the administration's
policies might ``have abetted corruption in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sharp exchange occurred when Helms twice asked Talbott
whether aid from the International Monetary Fund, including
American payments, had been siphoned off, possibly to offshore
accounts. Talbott said there was no evidence fund money had been
misappropriated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right to say, `I don't know,' but don't give me a
convoluted answer,'' Helms responded.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was the last of three in the House and Senate that
focused largely on how at least $4.2 billion, and perhaps as much
as $10 billion, in Russian money flowed through the Bank of New
York and how it was used. Bank executives have admitted lapses in
procedures, and the administration and Congress rushed to tighten
money-laundering laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Attorney
General Janet Reno announced the first package of proposed
legislation and regulatory changes to combat the illicit flow of
money through American financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money laundering may look like a polite form of white-collar
crime,'' Summers said. ``But it is the companion of brutality,
deceit and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would require check-cashing and money-transfer
companies, brokerage houses and casinos to alert federal
authorities of suspicious transactions in the same way banks
already report such activity. In addition, the proposal would
expand the number of crimes that would be subject to
money-laundering prosecutions, among them fraud, arms trafficking
and official corruption. Currently, cases can be brought only in
limited circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were required under legislation that Congress
approved last year, before the Russian banking inquiry became
public.

 &HT;    SENATE VOTES TO SPARE OIL COMPANIES HIGHER ROYALTIES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Senate approved a measure Thursday to
spare oil companies from paying higher royalties for drilling on
public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 51-47.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, sponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
blocks new federal rules for calculating the fees for one year, at
a savings to oil companies estimated at $66 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an independent producer issue,'' Hutchison said as she
wrapped up the latest victory in her crusade on behalf of her
state's key industry. If enacted into law, her moratorium of the
new royalty system would be the fourth she has won in the last 16
months.
</P>
<P>
   IN debate leading up to the vote, Hutchison said the higher
costs from the royalties would be ``the last nail in the coffin''
for some smaller producers.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the proposed new fee system a ``tax,'' she repeatedly
charged that ``it will raise the price of gas at the pump for every
working American.'' However, neither Hutchison nor her office
offered an estimate of how much more per gallon customers would
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had occasionally brought legislation to a halt in the
Senate for the past two weeks, as opponents led by Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., charged that the Hutchison provision was a cave-in
to big oil companies and their campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock ended Thursday when Hutchison mustered the required
60 votes to wrap up debate and force the vote on her measure, which
was an amendment to the annual appropriations bill for the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, the two sides faced each other with dueling
facts, charts and accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and her allies displayed a chart listing the ``seven
schemes'' by which some oil company executives have admitted they
used to miscalculate royalties paid to state and federal
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions are part of lawsuits in which several oil
companies have reached settlements worth $5 billion for
underpayments to states, including Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said those settlements were evidence that the current
method for calculating royalties makes cheating easy.
</P>
<P>
   Oil royalties are generally designated for education,
conservation and Indian tribes. Boxer argued that the taxpayers
have already lost $88 million because the new rules have not been
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison countered with an illustration showing a hodge-podge
of small boxes and connecting lines that she said represented an
impossibly complex new royalty system that the U.S. Mineral
Management Service has designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If oil companies cannot drill because they cannot make a
profit, then they're not going to drill,'' she said. ``There will
be a diminishing of the amount of money that's coming into the
federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's prediction of higher gas prices was rejected by a
private group, which has led a campaign charging oil companies with
shortchanging taxpayers in royalties for use of public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gas prices are regulated by the market.'' said Beth Daley,
spokesman for Project on Government Oversight, which has joined in
several of the lawsuits against oil companies over underpayment of
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Daley said that the 18 energy companies that pay 99
percent of royalties made an estimated $9.2 million in profits for
the first months of this year, according to their most recent
public filings.
</P>
<P>
   The debate Thursday briefly turned into sharp exchanges, as Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wisc., a campaign finance reformer, lambasted
the role of political donations from the oil industry to the
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Reading out a list of donations by energy corporations, he said
that ``I must object...when their deep pockets give them deep
influence that ordinary citizens never have.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's remarks brought protests. Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo.,
asked the chair to rule the the protested that the campaign cash
comments were out of order because they were not germane to the
amendment. But Feingold was permitted to complete his speech.
</P>
<P>
   In her reaction to the developments Thursday, Hutchison said,
``This is a victory for all Americans who are tired of paying
excessive taxes every time they visit the neighborhood gas station.
I am proud that the Senate stood tall and did the right thing.''

FOR THE LOVE OF THEIR SONS' GAME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since my sons were old enough, I have been spending many of
my Saturdays watching them play organized soccer and baseball _
thank goodness not football and lacrosse, too. I only have so much
time.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, I would often watch the games with another dad,
a lawyer, and we would commiserate about how time-consuming all
this was. But, hey, how can you not be there for your children?
</P>
<P>
   One day, the lawyer showed up carrying the equipment bag. He had
become a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the heck did you find the time?'' I asked as he walked
toward me. He just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   His meaning: I find it for my son. My feelings: And I don't.
</P>
<P>
   As parents struggle with balancing work and family, most of the
issues are more serious than a baseball game. But it certainly
doesn't feel so minor when you can't coach or even attend the game,
but your neighbor can. For the parents who are squeezing out enough
time to be there for their children, what is it costing them at
work?
</P>
<P>
   For the answers, consider the parents and coaches of the Little
League team in Toms River, N.J., that has played in the Little
League World Series tournament in Williamsport, Pa., the last two
years, winning it in 1998. Last month, the team was eliminated in
the last game before the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Training for and playing in this World Series requires nearly as
many months of the year as it does for major leaguers. This year,
the season for these 12-year-olds began unofficially in February,
when the players hit the indoor batting cages, and it didn't end
until that loss on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   For the coaches and parents, the season is exhilarating but
exhausting. To attend games, they say, they forgo vacations, leave
work early and count on co-workers to fill in for them.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bernath, 35, who has a business cleaning homes and
offices, rescheduled her appointments around the games of her son,
Steve. She said none of her customers complained. Carol Cappello,
46, a preschool teacher, missed a few days of preparing her
classroom to watch her son, David, play. Her boss understood.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gaynor, 48, now the team's manager, said that he hasn't
taken a normal, extended family vacation in nine years. He owns the
10 Feet First athletic shoe stores and he knows that he has lost
sales because of his many absences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' he said. ``I probably wouldn't have done
it this year if my son, Casey, wasn't on the team. It's very
stressful. You walk away from a lot of responsibility at work.''
</P>
<P>
   That responsibility can include juggling merchandise orders to
stock shoes and apparel that are selling while avoiding unpopular
items. It's difficult work, especially when he has to leave work by
3 p.m. to attend practices, he said. And August, when the team was
in the championship series, was also the peak time for
back-to-school shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like a postal carrier not working from Thanksgiving to
Christmas,'' Gaynor said. ``For three of the last five summers,
I've walked away from my business. I think it cost us a tremendous
amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kondek, a coach, was away from his job as the produce
manager of the Perlmart Shop Rite for weeks, most of it vacation
time. The man filling in for him ended up working 34 consecutive
days. ``Last year it was 33 days,'' Kondek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sacrificing work and your vacation time,'' he said.
``It's all worth it because you want to see the kids succeed.
Everyone wants to go to Williamsport. To go there two years in a
row is something. I didn't think I'd go there once in my
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   When the team had to travel almost 200 miles to play tournament
games in Bristol, Conn., many parents rented hotel rooms and stayed
for the week. Others who couldn't get away from work drove back and
forth from New Jersey. By the time they finished in Williamsport,
some of them said they had spent between $3,000 to $4,000 to attend
the tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   The parents' erratic schedules can also raise the eyebrows of
supervisors at work. Peter Cappello, 46, a vice president of First
State Bank, said he put about 6,000 miles on his car during August,
driving to games. He would leave work around 3 p.m. and drive with
his wife to Bristol to watch their son play an evening game. They
would spend the night, watch an afternoon game the next day, then
drive back home.
</P>
<P>
   Cappello would go directly to the bank and work until 9 p.m. in
order to catch up. Then the process would repeat for the next round
of games. And all this was occurring as the bank was negotiating
its sale to Staten Island Savings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he heard complaints from his supervisor. ```What are
you doing?''' Cappello recalled his boss saying. ```I'm trying to
sell the bank here and you're watching Little League baseball.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cappello said he replied, ``Look, I'm not missing any games.''
But the situation, he said, ``was tough, and I knew where he was
coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island Savings did not return several calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   None of the parents, Cappello included, said they thought they
were in trouble because of their absences. Brett Rand, community
affairs liaison for Perlmart Shop Rite, said the company was
willing to work with Kondek to get him the time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done in the spirit of the team,'' Rand said. ``There is
no grumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents with children on a championship team may have freedom
because of community support, said Leslie A. Perlow, a professor at
the University of Michigan Business School and the author of
``Finding Time: How Corporations, Individuals, and Families Can
Benefit From New Work Practices'' (Cornell University Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But parents with children on lesser teams may get no such
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a crisis at work, you're in trouble if you leave
for the game,'' Ms. Perlow said. ``The perception is, if you're not
totally committed to the company, you're not going to succeed. Even
if you can get more done by 3 o'clock, you're still not there. It's
unfair, but it's all perception.''
</P>
<P>
   For another summer, parents in Toms River went up against that
perception. Their example doesn't exactly pave the way for the rest
of us, but it's a start. ``Wait till next year'' isn't just a wish
confined to sports. &QL;

 &HT;    Ga. lawmaker demands a vote on medical rights
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flanked by two dozen lawmakers of both political
parties, Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.) demanded Thursday that
Republican leaders allow a ``clean vote'' on his legislation to
overhaul managed care.
</P>
<P>
   By a ``clean vote,'' Norwood means a straight up-or-down vote on
legislation he has crafted with Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.). The
bill would give patients certain rights, including the right to sue
their managed care company and choose doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell and Norwood, an Augusta, Ga., dentist, are concerned
that House Republican leaders will use legislative procedures to
derail their bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want an honest debate and a clean bill,'' Norwood said.
``We're not going to give up until this bill becomes law.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lawmakers, representatives from 275 medical
groups and patient advocacy organizations turned out for the
Capitol Hill news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent were representatives of the GOP leadership,
health insurance companies and business groups, who generally
oppose the plan because they think it would drive health care costs
to prohibitive levels.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his opposition, House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.)
has given Norwood assurances that his legislation, which Norwood
has tried to pass since his 1995 arrival in Congress, would be
allowed to come to the floor the week of Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have a fair process,'' said John Feehery, a
spokesman for Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   But the Norwood-Dingell bill will face formidable competition
from several other measures, including at least one that will have
the endorsement of Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One such bill comes from Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio), who said
Norwood's bill would help trial lawyers, not patients. ``Charlie
and I are dear friends. We've agreed to disagree,'' Boehner said.
``His legislation would drive up costs, creating more uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups are more strident about their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Charlie Norwood legislation is a classic
bait-and-switch,'' said Karen Ignagni, president of the American
Association of Health Plans, which represents more than 1,000
managed care plans. ``It promises to protect patients, but in
reality it would increase costs and create second-class care. We
believe voters want to improve, not erode care.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not how groups such as the American Medical
Association see it. Tom Reardon, president of the association of
300,000 physicians, said the bill would improve care ``for all
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients want protections from managed care companies and
they're willing to put their votes behind it,'' Reardon said.
``Here's the key: This is a bill that the president will sign.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that President Clinton has vowed to sign the
Norwood-Dingell bill, but it is unclear if enough Republicans will
defy the wishes of the House leaders and vote for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said he has 21 Republicans on board and that he is not
worried about them defecting.

 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Saturn Corp. started as a grand experiment by General
Motors to make and sell cars in innovative ways. But while Japanese
manufacturers roll out all-new models every four years or so,
Saturn has made do for a decade with the same basic car.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Saturn has been confined to a small-car market
that is fiercely competitive and rapidly shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, the wait for a new product is over. The L-Series
line, which went on sale this summer, doubles Saturn's offerings
and puts it into the midsize segment, the largest part of the auto
market.
</P>
<P>
   The ``L'' stands for large, but the LS sedans and LW wagons are
not all that big, though they offer the two million current Saturn
owners a vehicle to which they can trade up. Saturn customers are
among the most loyal in the business, but as their families have
grown they have often turned to other makes, usually Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these buyers will find the long wait was worth it. My
test drives of two L-Series Saturns _ a four-cylinder sedan and a
top-of-the-line V6 wagon, left me impressed. These are the best
Saturns, by far, that I've ever driven, and they are surprisingly
fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   As details about the L-Series leaked out in recent months,
Saturn executives were barraged with questions like, ``Is the
L-Series truly a Saturn?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After all, the car rides on a front-drive platform derived from
the German-built Opel Vectra introduced in Europe in 1996. The V6
is a British-built variant of the Opel engine in the Cadillac
Catera and the Saab &QL; 
9-5. And the L-Series is assembled at a plant in Wilmington, Del.,
where the workers are covered by GM's national agreement with the
United Automobile Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the existing S-Series compact cars were designed by
Saturn from the ground up, and they are built in a Spring Hill,
Tenn., plant that was constructed exclusively to produce Saturns.
The select work force was drawn from the ranks of GM workers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And the workers are covered by a special local contract that
rewards employees for meeting objectives for quality, sales and
profits. Union workers also participate in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the differences, the L-Series is unmistakably a
Saturn. The Opel platform was heavily modified to include a space
frame, a skeleton-like structure to which exterior panels are
attached. The space frame accommodates plastic panels in lieu of
steel for the doors, front fenders and trim pieces at the front and
rear. Saturn says its customers consider the plastic panels, which
help to prevent dings and dents, an essential Saturn feature. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who looked over the test cars immediately recognized
them as Saturns, because they share so many styling features with
the smaller cars. Giveaways are the slope of the hood and front
fenders and the upright back end. The safe, conservative styling
neither excites nor offends.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn executives hope that the L-Series will win the highest
safety rating in its class when the government conducts crash
tests. The smaller Saturn was the first in its category to earn
double five-star ratings _ the top grades _ in federal front-impact
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The L-Series is close in size to the Honda Accord and Toyota
Camry. Its interior volume is slightly smaller, but it has plenty
of room, front and back, for 6-footers. The L-Series is slightly
longer than some competitors, and the extra length produced a
prodigious trunk. At 17.5 cubic feet, it is about 3 cubic feet
larger than its main rivals'.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, previous Saturn owners will feel at home. As before, the
window switches are on the console just behind the shifter, an
annoyingly illogical spot. But I appreciated the illuminated trunk
release that is conveniently and obviously situated on the dash at
the driver's left. Other nice touches were easy-to-use controls,
sturdy cup holders and numerous storage pockets and compartments.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The L-Series, particularly the LW2 station wagon with its
supportive leather seats, has a more attractive interior than the
old Saturn's. But I still detest the putrid tan color that Saturn
uses in its cars, and the cloth seat covers of the LS1 sedan looked
cheap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The L-Series sedan and wagon come with either engine.
Four-cylinder models have a five-speed manual transmission or an
optional four-speed automatic. The V6 is paired only with the
automatic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder engine of the LS and LS1 sedans, as well as
the LW1 station wagon, is an all-new 2.2-liter, dual-overhead-cam
design. The 137-horsepower engine is exclusive to Saturn, at least
for now, and it struck me as the best small engine GM has offered
in the United States. Although its durability has not been
established, it is unquestionably GM's quietest small dual-cam
engine yet. And everyone who drove the blackberry-colored LS1 test
car was surprised by its pep.
</P>
<P>
   The LS2 sedan and LW2 wagon are powered by a 3-liter V6 engine
built in Ellsemere Port, England. It, too, is impressive, and
though its 182 horsepower trails the Accord and Camry on the
specifications chart, the power is delivered confidently and
smoothly. As I drove it on Michigan highways, I could envision the
V6-powered car zooming down a European superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   I could also imagine the L-Series competently handling curvy
mountain roads in Europe. Its chassis feels solid, its steering is
surprisingly precise and its handling is responsive. The L-Series
stacks up well against the competition. I'd still give the nod to
the Accord, but the Saturn may have an edge over the rather
dull-to-drive Camry.
</P>
<P>
   I concluded that any skepticism about the Opel platform was
misplaced. European breeding has even made the L-Series fun to flog
around, something I would never say about the S-Series, which is
merely an appliance _ and not a great one at that.
</P>
<P>
   But given its emphasis on safety, Saturn should make anti-lock
brakes, which come with traction control, standard. That would give
Saturn a leg up on some Japanese competitors. And where are the
side air bags? Unlike the Camry, neither the Accord nor the
L-Series offers them.
</P>
<P>
   Superior quality has made the Accord and Camry the top choices
in the class, and it is too early to judge the L-Series on that
score. The only quality glitch I experienced came on three mornings
when the LS1 didn't want to start immediately. Saturn engineers
checked the car and found nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the L-Series appears ready for battle with the big
boys. The impressive wagon should do particularly well, since
neither Toyota nor Honda offers a midsize wagon; competitors will
be the Subaru Legacy and Volkswagen Passat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's customer-friendly dealerships also provide an
advantage, and the L-Series may have a slim edge on price. The base
sedan starts at $15,450, a few hundred dollars less than the Accord
and roughly $2,400 less than the Camry. The V6 starts at $20,575,
about $2,000 less than comparable Camrys and Accords. Wagons are
$19,275 and up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But shoppers should keep in mind that Toyota and Honda dealers
may be willing to bargain, and they may offer sales incentives like
rebates. Saturn's prices are nonnegotiable, at least in theory,
under the company's no-haggle, no-incentive policy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: At last, a Saturn that could become a star.

   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Describing the world as a dangerous place
with unpredictable threats to American security, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas outlined a plan on Thursday for additional spending
to increase military salaries and fashion a new generation of more
technologically sophisticated weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In what Bush and his advisers billed as his first major policy
speech on the military, Bush also said that if he were elected
president, he would conduct a thorough review of all of the
country's military commitments abroad, an implicit statement that
he might scuttle some of them.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, the leading contender for the Republican nomination,
said it was important enough for the United States to deploy
anti-ballistic missiles that he would back out of a 1972 treaty
with the Russians if they did not agree to amend its provisions so
that the United States could pursue this course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in this time of hope and confidence, we can see the signs
of uncertainty,'' Bush told hundreds of cadets in an auditorium at
the Citadel, a military college here. ``We see the contagious
spread of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction. We
know that in this era of American pre-eminence, it is also an era
of car bombers, plutonium merchants, cyber-terrorists and drug
cartels and unbalanced dictators _ all the unconventional and
invisible threats of new technologies and old hatreds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These challenges can be overcome, but they cannot be
ignored,'' Bush continued. Later, he added: ``If I'm elected, I
will set three goals. I will renew the bond of trust between the
American president and the American military. I will defend the
American people against missiles and terror. And I will begin
creating the military of the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech was rife with criticisms, both explicit and
implicit, of the Clinton administration, which he said had eroded
the spirit of American military troops through insufficient pay and
insufficiently planned interventions in foreign conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending our military on vague, aimless and endless deployments
is the swift solvent of morale,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He further questioned the country's sustained ability to protect
itself in a volatile world in which not just the United States and
Russia, but smaller nations like North Korea, Iran and Iraq had
achieved or were developing long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he said that he would add $20 billion over five
years for the scientific research and development of better weapons
systems, and that he would demand that 20 percent of the military
procurement budget be devoted to new technologies, not existing
ones.
</P>
<P>
   There were shades of former President Ronald Reagan's thinking
and oratory in the way Bush summoned the specter of foreign evils _
``a world of terror and missiles and madmen,'' he said _ and
emphasized American technological prowess as the amulet against
them.
</P>
<P>
   There was no acknowledgment, however, that some of the cuts in
military spending were initiated by his own father, President
George Bush, during his term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush invoked President Bush only in adulatory terms. He called
the Persian Gulf war ``a stunning victory,'' and when he talked
about the heroism of the men who fought in World War II, he said,
``I have seen all of this personally and closely and clearly.'' He
was referring again to his father, who was a fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rivals for the Republican presidential nomination and
many Democrats have criticized him as unprepared _ after just five
years as governor of Texas, his first elective office _ to deal
with foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee even keeps a list of gaffes
that Bush has made when talking about international relations, like
referring to Greeks as Grecians.
</P>
<P>
   His speech on Thursday, prepared in consultation with at least
eight foreign policy and military advisers, all of whom were listed
in supplementary materials distributed by his campaign, was a clear
attempt to portray himself as extensively briefed and thoroughly
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats immediately raised questions about Bush's
proposals, beginning with where he planned to find the $20 billion
for research and an additional $5 billion over five years to pay
for the cost of salary increases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposed pay raise is in addition to the one approved by
Congress earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to reconcile this with his support for the Republican
tax cut,'' said Marc Ginsberg, a former ambassador to Morocco and a
foreign policy adviser for the campaign of Vice President Al Gore,
the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
``Where's the money going to come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg and other Democrats also wondered how Bush would be
able to redirect money from the production of current weapons to
research into future ones without jeopardizing the country's
defense in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, the former provost of Stanford University and
the chief foreign policy adviser to the Bush campaign, said Bush
believed projected federal surpluses would be large enough to
accommodate tax cuts, the preservation of Social Security and
increased military spending.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his remarks, Bush did not say which foreign commitments he
would not have entered into. He simply said the United States
``would not be permanent peacekeepers, dividing warring parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say which military weapons were already becoming too
outmoded to warrant continued production. He simply said he wanted
``to build America's defenses on the troubled frontiers of
technology and terror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military is still organized more for cold war threats than
for the challenges of the new century _ for industrial-age
operations, rather than information-age battles,'' Bush said. ``The
last seven years have been wasted in inertia and idle talk.''

IRAQI EXILE SAYS U.S. PLANS GENOCIDE CHARGES AGAINST SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A leader of Iraq's opposition movement in exile
said Thursday that U.S. officials are planning to pursue genocide
and war-crimes charges against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Chalabi, a member of the interim presidency of the Iraqi
National Congress, a coalition of exile groups, said that he and
other Iraqi exiles discussed prospects for prosecuting Saddam
during a meeting in New York on Monday with David Scheffer, the
Clinton administration's ambassador at large for war crimes, and
Harold Koh, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human
rights and labor.
</P>
<P>
   Several American officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity confirmed that the meeting had taken place and did not
deny that the prospect has been considered.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also met Monday with the
delegation from the Iraqi National Congress. Congress has
authorized $97 million to be used to assist such Iraqi opposition
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has accused Saddam of destroying more than
3,000 Kurdish villages, killing more than 5,000 Kurds with poison
gas, killing Shiite Muslim clergymen and forcibly relocating
civilians in southern Iraq, and executing more than 2,500 prisoners
in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how Washington would pursue a case since an
international criminal court does not exist to bring the Iraqi
leader to trial. Such a step would also require a measure of
support from the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat familiar with the issue said that a
commission of inquiry could be set up to gather evidence against
the Iraqi leader, creating legal grounds for the kind of
prosecutions that led to the detention of the former Chilean
dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, in Britain last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chalabi, an Iraqi mathematician living in London, said that
exile groups have been asked by Washington to collect material that
could be used to strengthen the case against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Washington already has about 5.5 million individual
documents from Iraqi security police records, many of them captured
by Kurdish forces since the Persian Gulf war, and that some single
out specific villages and individuals that became targets of
repression.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Iraq preoccupied the foreign ministers of the
five permanent members of the Security Council _ Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States _ who were unable to bridge
their differences Thursday on a resolution opening the way for U.N.
weapons inspectors to return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the foreign
ministers issued a statement saying they wanted to find ``a way
forward'' to adopt a comprehensive resolution that would take into
account ``the disarmament and humanitarian objectives'' of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The split has developed over how to assure Iraq's compliance in
disclosing the full extent of its nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons and long-range missile programs, as Security Council
resolutions have repeatedly demanded since Iraq's defeat in the
1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Differences have also arisen over the extent to which economic
sanctions should be loosened to alleviate suffering among the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
   A draft resolution being circulated by Britain and the
Netherlands reiterates the council's position that sanctions cannot
be lifted until Iraq has demolished its weapons of mass
destruction. The resolution is supported by the United States and
eight other members. But France, Britain and China, who all have
veto power, want a less stringent yardstick applied for Iraqi
cooperation. Malaysia is said to be undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The draft reportedly also proposes raising the cap on Iraqi oil
output to allow purchases of more food and medicine under U.N.
auspices. Other provisions would suspend sanctions on some other
Iraqi imports, but with tight financial controls and renewable
periods of four months or so, conditional upon Iraq's compliance.
Baghdad said it would not accept any plan that does not lift
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers' joint statement Thursday said that they
were instructing their representatives on the Security Council to
resolve the remaining differences and reach agreement on a new
resolution as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we expected to reach agreement this week,'' said
James Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ``The fact that the
ministers discussed it and urged that agreement be reached should
give a boost to the effort to re-establish the Security Council
consensus on the critical issue of getting inspectors back into
Iraq.''

RANGERS' BIGGEST ENEMY IS THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are those making an attempt at what's-gone-wrong
explanations. Johnny Oates, prompted by a daily media grilling, is
among many taking a stab at the whys and whats.
</P>
<P>
   But be it Oates, or anyone else in a Rangers uniform, the
answers are like yelling into a well. Got a distinct hollow sound.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, bullwhip the pitching again. Or blame the lack of run
production. Where are the hitters who are supposed to carry the
load?
</P>
<P>
   At this point in a baseball season, explanations are cheap, and
excuses are worthless. The Rangers have no excuses, and the mere
fact explanations became constantly necessary tells us everything
we didn't care to know about this club.
</P>
<P>
   September for divisional leaders is not about talking. This is
about doing. Deep in the season's stretch-run, the Yankees have
recovered from early September slippage. They are doing. So is
Boston. So, lately, is Atlanta, while Arizona also plows ahead. But
the Rangers?
</P>
<P>
   Where is all that heart, all that soul, all that, well, spunk,
that had become such a trademark during a July and August of
bring-it-on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   What is suddenly missing in September? Is it guts? Greer?
Alicea? All of that, for sure, and probably more.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared the Rangers could play with the big boys
of the American League, and for that matter, the big boys of
baseball, this is a team running scared of September. Which doesn't
say much for October. If they make it that far.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks is a businessman well-known for his high-dollar
business ventures. But is this what he had in mind, banking a $75
million payroll that has come down with a collective case of the
blahs?
</P>
<P>
   Does ``Horn Man'' know ``Taps?'' If so, ask him to play the
real-slow, real-sad version to recognize what's on the field at the
moment. A dead team that is about to bury the best season in
franchise history. For those multitudes out there who are currently
muttering ``same ol' sorry Rangers,'' there can be no disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone benevolent enough to give the Arlington lads just
one more chance ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's the good part, and the lucky part. The Rangers catch an
incredible break, starting tonight at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   They will be provided a weekend opportunity to learn something
from the Oakland A's. Learn something about overcoming every
obstacle the game of baseball can present, starting with an $18
million payroll, second-lowest in the majors. For $18 mil these
days, a team isn't supposed to contend in the Texas League.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland visit is perfect timing, coming at a September point
where the Rangers finally face a club they desperately need to
beat. Actually, they need to sweep the A's and end the AL West race
here and now.
</P>
<P>
   This is a series that should have meant nothing, except the
Rangers gave their closest divisional rivals extended life by doing
a choke-a-thon against the low-rents of the league. This has been a
month when the Rangers lost three of four to Detroit, three of four
to Kansas City, two of three to Tampa Bay, and two in a row to
Baltimore. In the last 10 games, the record is 4-6 against teams
without a winning record. Want to be bored? Go see the Rangers
tip-toe through another nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, however, tip-toe time is over. The A's know the
story _ they probably need a sweep. The Rangers appear to be a team
waiting to be swept. If Oakland pulls it off, that could set up a
final-week-of-the-season collapse by the Rangers. The disgrace
would be immense.
</P>
<P>
   It is very, very good to have Oakland in town. If this series
doesn't wake up the Arlington clubhouse, then let the inhabitants
go sleep with the bluegills in Johnson Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of guys have a lot of stuff up there between
their ears right now,'' said Oates. ``At this particular point, I
would say frustration best describes our mood.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oates doesn't exactly try to quell any talk of ``pressure''
being present this weekend. ``There is no one in our clubhouse who
can deny we have put ourselves under pressure,'' he said. ``And
pressure is what the game is all about, particularly this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``June, July, and August, they are all very important. But in
September, when you are trying to win a division, that's a
different ballgame from all the other months.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting tonight, all the other months mean nothing. It's only
about right now.

   Names, like wolves, run in packs. People who keep tabs on
newborns say that a lot of Pampers are currently wrapped around
Michaels and Jessicas, not to mention Jacobs and Samanthas.
</P>
<P>
   The automotive equivalent is ``LS.'' If that doesn't dance off
the tongue, you can blame the Europeans, whose use of alphanumeric
names in lieu of animals (Mustang), evocative places (Yukon) and
coined words (Vitara) has spread to auto makers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln named its new luxury car the LS because the L stands for
luxury and the S for sport, said a spokesman, Jim Trainor. Also,
the car competes with European and Japanese autos that typically
use alphanumeric names, like the BMW 528i.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn Corp. says its new LS stands for large sedan _ although
the car is actually classified as midsized.
</P>
<P>
   Some other auto makers are less specific about why they use the
name. Chevrolet has LS versions of its Cavalier, Malibu, Impala and
Monte Carlo cars; its Silverado and S-10 pickups; its Astro,
Express and Venture vans, and its Blazer and Tahoe utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hubbard, a Chevrolet spokesman, said the L originally
denoted luxury. But Chevy's consumer studies found that the second
letter was even more important. ``Our research has shown that the
farther up in the alphabet we go with letters to follow the L,
people think of the vehicle as being more upscale,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, top-line Chevrolet trucks _ a step up from the LS _
are LTs.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury sells LS versions of its Tracer, Mystique, Sable and
Grand Marquis. A Sable competitor, the Buick Regal, also comes in
LS form _ but that is the plainest Regal, whereas the LS is the
fanciest Sable. The base Sable is the GS, as is the top Regal.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For Mark Krey, it was a ghastly sight, the
lifeless body of friend Sydney Browning, shot in the head, lying in
the foyer of Wedgwood Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily, he was frozen in shock. This was too personal for a
homicide lieutenant studying to be a minister.
</P>
<P>
   For Sgt. Tim Ellis, the father of twin 13-month-old girls, the
scene in the sanctuary was unlike any he had ever seen. The
anguished looks on the ashen faces of oter officers told him this
was an incomprehensible crime.
</P>
<P>
   For Officer Angela Jay, who heard about the shooting in a
television news bulletin, it brought back haunting visions of the
day she was shot three times in an apartment complex where three
small children had been slain, their mother critically wounded and
two other people shot. Resounding gunshots echoed in her ears.
</P>
<P>
   For any cop, the murderous spree inside Wedgwood Baptist the
night of Sept. 15 seemed beyond belief. Seven dead, four of them
teen-agers. Seven wounded, one paralyzed from the chest down.
Scores terrified. All this in the sanctity of God's house.
</P>
<P>
   Killer Larry Gene Ashbrook lay with the dead and wounded, his
tormented life snuffed by a self-inflicted shot in the temple.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make even the most calloused homicide detective
or street-savvy veteran cringe. Yet somehow, officers were expected
to push aside their personal emotions and step back into the
reality and necessity of investigating one of the city's deadliest
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn over the years to steel yourself from what you're
going to see and do the best to put your emotions aside and do your
job to the best of your abilities,'' said Krey, the homicide unit's
41-year-old commander and ministerial student. ``Still, it didn't
prepare me for what I saw in that sanctuary. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything the world is not supposed to be leapt into that
sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was what he saw in the foyer first that stopped him in
his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disbelief,'' Krey said.
</P>
<P>
   On a sofa lay the body of Browning, the church's children's
choir director and a friend who taught an after-hours class at
Trimble Technical High School for troubled youths. Krey often spoke
to her students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, `Surely, I'm mistaken.' I just thought, `Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then he walked into the sanctuary to view the carnage that he
knew awaited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin to prepare yourself ahead of time,'' Krey said.
``Your job still involves the need to respect and service those
victims to the best of your ability. You can't do your best for
those victims if you start to get clouded with emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look down and see young people about the same age,
the same sex, as your own children that have been violently taken
from us, your mind cannot comprehend it,'' said Krey, the father of
two daughters. ``It is absolute system overload and you revert back
to your (police) training, almost step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ellis is thankful for that.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old patrol sergeant and two officers were eating at
a restaurant on South University Drive when their radio crackled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 6:58 p.m. and it was the most horrible thing you could
hear,'' Ellis said. ``The screech was piercing, an officer
screaming that shots were fired inside a church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was yelling, `I need help. People are being shot and killed
in the sanctuary' or something to that effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, his siren wailing and emergency lights flashing,
Ellis was speeding toward the church. En route, he called his older
brother, Lt. David Ellis, 41, the police department's acting public
information officer, whose services he knew would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   At the church Tim Ellis found six officers trying to determine
who was alive or dead in the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the sanctuary and I could not believe my eyes,''
he said. ``Bodies were everywhere, and officers were rushing all
over to see if anyone was alive. I looked at the officers and they
had nothing but shock and fear in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt they were all looking at me saying, `Sergeant, do
something. Fix this.' But nothing could fix this horrific tragedy.
Nothing could be done. I think I dug deep in my soul and found the
strength to take charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Tim Ellis needed reassurance and found it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned around and saw my big brother walking toward me. ...
It wasn't that a lieutenant was there. It was my big brother and I
felt it was going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of Ashbrook's massacre didn't register until he
later saw newspaper photographs of the seven slaying victims. Until
then, his only image was as he had seen them in death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only human and it's tough,'' Tim Ellis said. ``I sat and
talked with my wife, Leslie, half the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see us and think we're cold. They see the stoic faces.
Their (the officers') emotions are there and they were hurt as bad
as anyone else there. But we have jobs to do and you can't allow
your emotions to get in the way of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim's brother, David Ellis, was just as jolted by what Ashbrook
had done in a place reserved for worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been involved in anything this terrible, anything
this catastrophic,'' David Ellis said. ``We (as officers) try not
to associate things with our personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes they do.
</P>
<P>
   David Ellis remained at the church until the bodies were removed
at 3 a.m. Then, with visions of the slain teens in his mind, he
went home and peeked in on his four sleeping children.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Jay, a 36-year-old officer scheduled for promotion to
corporal in a couple of weeks, did not work the crime scene. Yet it
was all too familiar to what happened to her on July 30, 1995, at
the Les Jardins Apartments on Travis Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Back then it was a man named John Wesley Wheat who went on a
shooting tirade. Now on Death Row, he killed three young children,
critically wounded their mother and shot two men in the apartment.
Jay, arriving at the scene, was shot three times and still carries
a bullet lodged in her chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there's a world of difference in the incidents, I
just thought of the people being affected, the kids, the police,
the firefighters, the emergency crews,'' Jay said. ``It will affect
them the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The night Ashbrook casually strode into Wedgwood Baptist and
calmly, methodically sprayed bullets at selected targets, Jay was
home watching ``90210.'' A news bulletin interrupted the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got my attention and I watched as it went on for several
hours. I couldn't take myself away from what was going on,'' she
said. ``It was an immediate feeling of reliving the sound of the
gunshots. ... This made it all fresh again.''
</P>
<P>
   All seven detectives and the sergeant of the homicide unit, as
well as three detectives and supervisors of the Major Case Unit,
faced grim duty at the church that night and in the ensuing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professionally, we've dealt with it as best we can.
Personally, you react like just regular people,'' said Sgt. Dave
Loftis, who leaves the homicide unit on Saturday after a recent
promotion to lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the detectives worked virtually non-stop with little
sleep after the shootings; they also had new homicides to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are dedicated, but I have to watch out for their physical
well-being,'' said Krey, the homicide unit commander. ``They get
very focused on their jobs and may not take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of questions, however, remain unanswered in their

WOODS, DUVAL ARE CAST AS RYDER'S DYNAMIC DUO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Shoulder-to-shoulder, the top two players in
the world golf rankings took turns fielding questions about the
presence of celebrities, the absence of paychecks and the mountain
of pressure that will mark the U.S. team's experience at the 33rd
Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Those shoulders, belonging to Tiger Woods and David Duval, are
expected to carry the Americans to victory at The Country Club when
matches begin this morning. But there is one question surrounding
members of the Dynamic Duo, who have combined for 10 victories in
professional golf tournaments around the world this season.
</P>
<P>
   It concerns their adaptability to a team-play setting. Woods,
23, posted a 1-3-1 record in his Ryder Cup debut in 1997. Duval,
27, will make his debut at the event today.
</P>
<P>
   Both were at the epicenter of a pay-for-play controversy
surrounding the distribution of Ryder Cup profits during last
month's PGA Championship that led to captain Ben Crenshaw
chastising both players _ along with teammates Mark O'Meara and
Phil Mickelson _ for selfish attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw reiterated yesterday that any off-course disagreements
with Woods and Duval ``dissipated very quickly'' and that he is
confident his two young guns can fire some telling shots in helping
the United States recapture the Ryder Cup for the first time since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The players said they are up to the challenge _ and the
pressure. Duval even joked about his bland image, saying the
Americans, if anything, have an edge in team chemistry over the
Europeans because ``we only have 11 people with personalities on
our team, so you only have to get 11 people to get along together.
So we've got a leg up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, the No. 2 player in the world rankings, said he expects
to be ``very nervous'' when he joins forces with Phil Mickelson for
today's opening match against Europeans Colin Montgomerie and Paul
Lawrie. But he stressed that he should be able to handle the
expectations of helping carry the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the world's top-ranked golfer, sounded like someone who
cherishes the opportunity to erase memories of his disappointing
debut at Valderrama Golf Club in Sotogrande, Spain. He'll get his
first chance this morning while paired with Tom Lehman against
Europeans Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   In fashioning a 1-3-1 record during the 1997 competition, Woods
is best remembered for: a) putting into a lake, and b) losing his
singles match to unheralded Costantino Rocca, 4 and 2 _ a defeat
that proved decisive when the United States lost, 14 1/2 to 13 1/2.
Swing that point to Woods and the United States, rather than the
Europeans, would be the defending champs in the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '97, I wasn't playing very well late in the summer ... and
it carried over into the Ryder Cup. But this year, I'm coming in
with more of a positive attitude, and rightfully so,'' said Woods,
who has won four of his past seven events, with two additional
top-10 finishes, since May. ``I've played well. I love match play.
And, hopefully, I'll be able to execute the shots at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to look toward me as a leader, that's fine. But
I'm not going to be a person who tries to get guys fired up by
jawing at them. It's not my personality. I would rather let my
playing lead the team.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the role envisioned by Crenshaw and Woods' U.S.
teammates, who consider Woods the glue of the team, from a
competitive standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger's game could lead anybody,'' Hal Sutton said. ``He's
capable of some things not many people in the world are.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said: ``Tiger has gained a lot of confidence this
season and it's showing in almost every department of his game.
He's a very, very smooth engine right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Woods has won six events, including the PGA
Championship. Add in the presence of Duval, a four-event winner,
and some members of the U.S. team _ as well as their PGA Tour peers
_ are beginning to sound a bit boastful.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with ``American Golf Digest'', Payne Stewart
said the presence of nine of the world's 14 highest-rated golfers
on the U.S. side tips the competitive scales to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, they shouldn't even be caddying for us,'' Stewart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggert, a Houston resident and Texas A&AMP;M product, said the
American roster includes ``the 12 best players in the world.'' Brad
Faxon, a two-time Ryder Cup competitor who will join Michael
Jordan, former President Bush and England's Prince Andrew among
this week's spectators, said the U.S. team ``is at least three or
four points better'' than the Europeans, based on track records.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is based on the presence of Woods and Duval, who
insist their seasons will not be soiled if they fail to lead the
heavily favored Americans to victory. Duval allowed Woods to sum up
the Dynamic Duo's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best player doesn't always win in match play,'' Woods
said. ``That's the beauty of it. We're not here to lose. But I
think David and I would both feel we've have a great year
regardless of how the Ryder Cup turns out. It would just put a nice
cap on it for us to win.''

 COMMENTARY: McCAIN'S FRESH AIR  
(jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking with clean clarity, Sen. John McCain has become the
only Republican presidential candidate to accept and pass a
political and moral challenge that faces them all. He said exactly
where Pat Buchanan belonged in the Republican Party _ out.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican now running for the nomination ever supported
Buchanan's racism, and anti-Semitism and the rest of the sickness
of soul he tries to deodorize with sprays of populism. Heavens, no.
</P>
<P>
   But until McCain came along to make things awkward for them,
Republicans had a decade of ducking the critical Buchanan question.
Should he be thrown out even though it might cost other Republicans
some revengeful Buchananite votes in primaries?
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Buchanan blamed the Jews of Israel and America for
``beating the drums'' for the Gulf War. Buchanan would not have
allowed that Jew war. If the United States had obeyed him, today
Iraq's piles and factories of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological
weapons could have been seen by Americans wherever they cowered.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaigns of 1992 and '96, after Buchanan's influence had
been watered several times a week by his salaried appearances on
CNN, fellow Republican presidential candidates did not demand that
he pack up his knapsack of bigotry and march out of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign, Buchanan gives his opponents another chance to
show what they are made of. His new book does not hide his belief
that it would have been better if Nazi Germany had won the war.
</P>
<P>
   No vital American interest was threatened by Hitler, he says.
But don't think he does not have his tender spots, old Pat.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that if Britain and France had not gone to the
rescue of Poland, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had not tricked
Americans into getting into the war, the Nazis would have been able
to conquer Europe and the Soviet Union, so there might have been no
blitz or Dunkirk. And the Jews _ well so many would not have been
destroyed in places like Norway, the Netherlands, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's airpower somehow would have allowed it to survive and
keep its empire, you see. Japan would dominate in Asia, and America
would be ``mistress'' of Western Europe, in bliss with Hitler, who
would be ``master of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Buchanan figured the book would disgust enough
Republican leaders so they would push him out. Then in righteous
wrath he would fulfill his ambition of becoming a third-party
leader of America's crackpots and of conservatives too stupid to
deserve the name. If that's what he thought, he overestimated all
but one.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle have asked him to
stay Republican. When I asked Gary Bauer, he denounced Buchanan but
thought it would be better for the Republican conservatives if he
stayed in the party. Elizabeth Dole said if Buchanan stayed in the
party, it would then decide if it wanted him as its candidate _
gourmet duck a la politician. I called Alan Keyes, who said there
were no grounds for Buchanan to leave the party and that he was not
going to decide who should go or stay.
</P>
<P>
   Now for a little fresh air. On Wednesday and Thursday, McCain
said Buchanan's own rhetoric, and his views about Hitler and Nazi
Germany, had no place in the Republican Party. Buchanan started
screaming he did not say this, didn't mean the other. Amusing,
almost.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe McCain's clarity and Buchanan's mental ugliness will bring
a smidgen of moral courage to Bush, Dole &AMP; Co. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, when I first saw Auschwitz, as a reporter, I understood
that silence was a sin. Ten years later, on an anniversary of the
creation of the Warsaw ghetto by the Germans, I wrote from Asia
that if a time of the beast ever approached again, from the world
over would rise a prayer: ``Forgive them not, Father, for they know
what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   And now I have to add, in America: And forgive not those who
still preach that America had no stake.
</P>
<P>
   Given his life and nature, McCain probably doesn't think his
attempt to free his party from Buchanan is particularly brave. It
wasn't, except among Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's comments had the perfect pitch of political
goodness and decency. We owe him thanks and an embrace for
reminding us what they are like.

TEXAS JURY DECIDES RACIST KILLER DESERVES DEATH PENALTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ The former ``Exalted Cyclops'' of a racist prison
gang, who boasted that he was ``the hero of the day'' for chaining
a disabled black man to a pickup last year and dragging him more
than three miles near the East Texas town of Jasper, was sentenced
Thursday to death by injection.
</P>
<P>
   A jury that included no black members deliberated 14 1/2 hours
over two days before deciding the fate of Lawrence Russell Brewer
Jr., 32.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, who last week had sobbed on the witness stand, followed
his attorney's instructions and showed little reaction as state
District Judge Monte Lawlis read the verdict before a packed
courtroom shortly after noon CST.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's parents, siblings and other relatives who had begged
jurors to spare his life sat with their arms around each other in
the front row of the courtroom, crying silently. They left the
courthouse after a brief meeting with Brewer, but declined to speak
with reporters as sheriff's deputies escorted them to their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer was immediately delivered to death row at Ellis Unit I
near Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Brewer's victim, James Byrd Jr., 49, sat across
the aisle, also crying and holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have another answer for my brother,'' an obviously relieved
Mary Verrett said. ``I prayed and told him after the first trial,
'Your death wasn't in vain. Somebody's going to answer for it,' and
now I can tell him again. Another man is going to answer for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Verrett said the family was anxious and stressed out awaiting
the decision because the Brazos County jury of seven men and five
women deliberated much longer than a Jasper County jury did earlier
this year when it convicted Brewer's co-defendant and fellow racist
John William ``Bill'' King.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, of Jasper, was sent to the new death row at the
Terrell Unit near Livingston. His high school buddy, 24-year-old
Shawn Allen Berry, will be tried next month in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Verrett said the jurors were ``morally upright people with a
deep respect, not only for the law of the land, but for human
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've said that not just in Jasper County or Brazos County,
but in the country and in the world, we do not tolerate this any
more,'' she said. ``Those days of lynching are gone. We have jurors
who will sit there and hold you accountable for the decisions you
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sister, Clara Taylor, said the jury obviously took its
duty seriously and agonized over its verdict. ``The right decision
was the one they made,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting here thinking about my brother in the final
moments of his life, how he must have been screaming for help as
his flesh was being torn off his body, and how much pain he was
in,'' she said. ``He (Brewer) had to have heard him screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors refused to comment when contacted by the
Chronicle. One, Fay Shepherd of College Station, Texas, summed it
up: ``I prefer to keep it in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone will forget it,'' said another juror, who
refused to identify himself. ``This is by far the hardest thing
anyone has ever been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is anything anyone would want to be part of
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The juror said that what Brewer did _ and what he didn't do _
the night of Byrd's killing convinced them to convict him and
sentence him to die. ``He didn't do anything to stop it,'' the
juror said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors agreed among themselves not to discuss why it took 14 1/2
hours to decide Brewer's fate or how many jurors might have earlier
voted one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply deciding life or death, the jury had to
answer three questions: whether Brewer would be a continuing threat
of violence, whether he intended to kill Byrd and did so, and
whether there were any mitigating circumstances that would warrant
sparing his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, you know that by your answer to those questions,
you will decide if he will live or die,'' the juror said.
</P>
<P>
   As they deliberated more than 11 hours Wednesday before being
sequestered in a hotel for the night, jurors disagreed on whether
there was a probability that Brewer would present a danger of
violence to society in the future, the juror said.
</P>
<P>
   They sent out a note asking for a legal definition of the words
``violence,'' ``society'' and ``probability.'' When the judge
answered that they should rely on the words' common meaning, they
asked for a dictionary, which they were denied.
</P>
<P>
   When the jurors returned Thursday, they deliberated 40 minutes
before sending out a note asking to see photographs of Brewer's
racist tattoos, as well as a blow-up color photo of him with his
family. The photographs showed the difference between Brewer as a
child and as an adult, the juror said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the panel sent out another note, saying it was confused
and could not reach a decision on the last question, concerning
mitigating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lawlis directed them to continue deliberating unless they were
hopelessly deadlocked. Less than an hour later, they reached a
verdict. One female juror was crying as they filed into the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The juror who spoke to the Chronicle would not say how the panel
resolved its conflicts, but he said they parted as friends.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Jasper County District Attorney Guy
James Gray said that while he is generally opposed to the death
penalty, it was ``absolutely necessary'' in this case to prevent
Brewer from infecting other inmates with his racist teachings and
violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where if you don't give the death penalty
to this man, he will kill and hurt again, so you don't have the
luxury of saying, `I'm not for the death penalty,''' he said.
``Your option is you either let this man kill somebody else down
the road or you take his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him to produce another Bill King.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's court-appointed attorneys, Doug Barlow and Layne Walker
of Beaumont, said they respect the jury's decision and appreciated
them taking the time to thoroughly go over the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell has resigned himself to this,'' said Barlow, who will
continue as Brewer's appellate lawyer. ``I just left him up there,
and he said, 'I'll be all right.'``
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at peace with it,'' Walker said of the verdict. ``I feel
like it was in the good Lord's hands and the good Lord made the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he's learned about Brewer over the past few months,
Walker replied: ``That he has a heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, who has spent most of his adult life in prison for
burglary, cocaine possession and parole violations, testified
during the guilt or innocence phase of his capital murder trial
that although he was at the crime scene, he did not kill Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   In his version of the story, which prosecutors called
``hogwash,'' Brewer said that he accompanied Berry and King when
they offered an intoxicated Byrd a ride in the early hours of June
7, 1998. Byrd, an unemployed father of three, was walking down
Jasper's Martin Luther King Boulevard on his way home from a
friend's anniversary party.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said Berry drove the men east of Jasper to a clearing in
the woods, supposedly so he could purchase steroids from Byrd.
Police and prosecutors have said that although Byrd had a record
for theft, there was no evidence to indicate that he was a drug
user or dealer.
</P>
<P>
   When the men stopped the truck, Brewer said, he kicked Byrd and
spray-painted his face black in an effort to break up a fight
between him and King.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was Berry who killed Byrd, slashing his throat
and rendering him unconscious before stripping him and chaining his
ankles to the back of the truck. Brewer, who claimed to be in a
state of shock, said he sat in the cab of the pickup and smoked a
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he pleaded with Berry to stop the pickup and let
Byrd go.
</P>
<P>
   A pathologist who performed Byrd's autopsy testified that there
was no evidence of a knife wound and insisted that Byrd was alive
and fighting as he was dragged. His torture ended when his body
slammed into a concrete culvert, decapitating him.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Byrd's mutilated body was found next to a
rural black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, who produced a cigarette butt and a Bud Light
bottle with Brewer's DNA found at the crime scene, as well as his
Nike tennis shoe stained with Byrd's blood, said it took all three
men to subdue Byrd and chain him to the truck.
</P>
<P>
   And they told jurors that while King was the charismatic
ringleader of the group, the hideous crime was the idea of his
mentor, Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   They produced a letter that Brewer had written from prison years
earlier to his then-wife. In it, Brewer wrote: ``I feel as though
I've been drug 120 miles chained by feet to the bumper of a
Corvette doing 90 miles an hour.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he was feeling really low and he was thinking, 'What
is the worst thing that you could do to somebody? That's how I
feel,''' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Johnny Stevens who assisted
Jasper prosecutors. ``Years later, he threw that idea on the table
and King seized on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late next month, prosecutors will turn their attention to
Berry's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Thursday that Berry's case is the weakest of the three
as far as the death penalty is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not have the same racist background as these other two
have,'' he said. ``He doesn't have the same criminal history. He
does not have the same (racist) tattoos that these other two have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, though, he may have been more of an active
participant than the other two.''

 &HT;    Fight over F-22 funds goes down to the wire
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the clock ticking on a deadline for federal
spending bills, vastly different stories emerged Thursday over how
much funding Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-22 Raptor fighter would
receive.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week before a new fiscal year begins, House and
Senate negotiators appeared far apart over funding the aircraft,
which is mainly built at Lockheed's Marietta, Ga., plant.
</P>
<P>
   And that proved frustrating to House Appropriations Chairman
C.W. ``Bill'' Young (R-Fla.), who said, ``if this bill stays in
limbo much longer, others are going to start raiding it for
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional negotiators met periodically behind closed doors
throughout the day. Simmering tensions between House and Senate
negotiators prompted at least one planned meeting to be abruptly
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is $1.8 billion that the Senate approved in its version
of the Defense Department's $267 billion spending bill. The money
would pay for the first six aircraft out of 339 that the Pentagon
wants to buy over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the bill eliminated the money to purchase
the planes, at the insistence of Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.),
chairman of the House panel overseeing defense spending. Lewis
argued that the planes were too costly, as well as untested.
</P>
<P>
   During a bargaining session Wednesday evening, Senate
Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) proposed spending
$1.8 billion to research and develop the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens proposed spending a portion of that money to buy new
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   That is starkly different from the plan proposed by Lewis. Lewis
is pushing a plan that calls for testing the aircraft before
ordering the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing will be at the forefront,'' Lewis told reporters on
Wednesday night after meeting with negotiators from the Senate.
``We will have a pause in procurement.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of the different versions of the deal was, no deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an agreement,'' Stevens told a reporter in a
brief hallway interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems, the division headquartered
in Marietta, had little comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time we are unaware of the details of these
discussions,'' said Lockheed spokesman Greg Caires. ``We remain
hopeful that the conferees will reconcile their differences and
honor the president's FY 2000 request to fully fund the F-22
program.''

   Jimmy Carter knows more than most people about problematic
relatives. But he still must have been startled to hear that a
member of his extended family had been arrested for scalping a
ticket to the ex-president's 75th birthday gala. Lewis Patrick
Harrison Jr. is a nephew by marriage of the late, fabled Billy (``I
have no embarrassment'') Carter. He not only allegedly sold the
ticket for 10 times its $50 face price, he broadcast his eagerness
to make money on the event with an ad in a local shopper.
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent time to meditate on what it is that makes
so many of America's presidential kin spin out of control.
Harrison's uncle, of course, set the standard here when he gave up
promoting Billy Beer and became a registered agent for the Libyan
government. But we can't forget all those who went before, like F.
Donald Nixon and his $205,000 loan from Howard Hughes or James
Roosevelt's admission during the Depression that he was getting
$15,000 a year from an insurance firm ``for the name, and any value
the name might have.''
</P>
<P>
   In this company, Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh and Tony
Rodham, barely qualify as mid-level embarrassments. They haven't
gotten arrested, produced a tell-all autobiography, or even walked
down the aisle with an eight-months'-pregnant bride, as Roger
Clinton did a while back. Still, Tony, a former private eye, has
re-created himself as a Washington investment adviser and Hugh, a
longtime public defender in Florida, ran for Senate in 1994 despite
the fact that he had minimal experience even as a registered voter.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Rodhams embarked on a business venture involving
hazelnut processing, the Republic of Georgia and a political
strongman from the Ajarian region with an energetic
public-relations department. Tony already had a record for causing
headaches in the State Department _ he once showed up in Cambodia
right before the national elections, chasing investments and
hanging out with Prime Minister Hun Sen, the thuggish human-rights
abuser. This time, Sandy Berger, the national security adviser,
apparently put his foot down after mention of the Georgian deal
appeared in The Washington Post. Shortly after, the brothers issued
a reluctant announcement that they were getting out of the hazelnut
game.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as it turned out, was not just that the Rodhams
were leaping into a venture for which they had scant expertise,
involving a commodity that somehow sounds slightly silly. They were
doing their deal with Aslan Abashidze, a rival of Eduard
Shevardnadze, the beleaguered Georgian president whom the Clinton
administration is trying to prop up.
</P>
<P>
   Abashidze issued a press release announcing that the visit was a
demonstration of President Clinton's own personal support, and the
Kavkasia-Press news agency reported that Tony Rodham had
volunteered to stand as godfather for one of Abashidze's grandsons,
``and, in accordance with a Georgian custom, he is regarded as a
close relative of the Ajarian clan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who only recently discovered some Jewish
relatives, may have had a less buoyant response to the news that
she is now, more or less, kin to the chairman of the Ajarian
Autonomous Supreme Council. There are, after all, relatively few
Georgian voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   According to the White House, the first lady had been told her
brothers were flying overseas on a business trip but ``didn't have
any of the details.'' Perhaps she intuited that the details would
not be anything she wanted to hear. But when far-from-wealthy
siblings are flying off to Batumi to build $118 million
nut-processing factories, most people would feel impelled to probe.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodham saga, not to mention Roger Clinton's hapless singing
career, Ron Reagan's hapless talk-show career, Patti Reagan's
hapless writing career and Neil Bush's Silverado Savings and Loan
fiasco, put one aspect of the current presidential race in clearer
focus. Legions of Americans have attempted to cash in on their
relationship to the most powerful man in the world, but George W.
Bush is one of the few who is actually succeeding at it.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Thursday proposed a system for displaying in one
place all orders to buy and sell U.S. stocks and called it an
essential foundation for the future of the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman, outlined his vision for the
financial markets after months of silence and wrenching change,
particularly in the way stocks are traded. New electronic trading
systems for stocks have emerged, online trading by individuals has
exploded, trading by small investors has begun to occur outside the
major exchanges' hours of operation and the exchanges themselves
have proposed becoming publicly traded for-profit companies.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt seems most concerned that if trading continues to migrate
to new electronic market systems, investors may not get the best
prices. Information about orders and transactions across the entire
market are not now available in any one place. Technology, he said,
allows the creation of a central system in which investors will be
fully informed about prices everywhere, from the New York Stock
Exchange, the NASDAQ market, the American Stock Exchange and the
new systems.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that he is asking for the development of a
technology that will allow all orders to be shown to investors, not
an institution or a place where all orders would be executed. In
this way, competition would continue, along with innovation and
pressure to keep costs low. ``The beauty of this is technology has
taken us to the point where we may be able to enjoy the benefits of
competition while getting the benefits of centrality,'' Levitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Columbia Law School, Levitt also said he was
intrigued by the possibility of creating a single, self-regulatory
organization to oversee the markets but suggested that each
exchange continue its own surveillance. The exchanges now have
self-regulating units, but those units could be compromised or at
least conflicted if the exchanges become public companies with an
obligation to provide the highest return to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, he was most concerned about fairness. He urged
the elimination of a rule by the New York Stock Exchange that
prohibits the trading of certain stocks by exchange members
anywhere other than on the exchange floor. Fees charged to outside
participants by the new electronic stock networks, he said, should
also be eliminated. And the options exchanges, which have been
effective monopolies for decades, must open their doors to true
competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize the industry's inherent resistance to change,''
Levitt said in an interview before the speech. ``But I'm willing to
fight very hard to move in the direction of change rather than
being a custodian.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the parent of the NASDAQ market, applauded
Levitt. ``I think he's saying to us, `You guys get this stuff fixed
or we're going to have to see that it gets fixed,''' Zarb said.
``It's a good clear menu of the major issues facing the industry _
a call for bold change when bold change is required.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said his ideas were the result of year-long deliberations
with the SEC staff and conversations with market participants. The
proposals will result in stock markets that are more open,
accessible and fair to all investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But given that so much about Wall Street remains hidebound even
as great change has rocked the industry, the proposals will
displease many in the business, both new and established. The
organization that appears to have the most to lose under the
proposals is the New York Stock Exchange, though its chairman said
Thursday the exchange was prepared to reinvent itself with the
times.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, 68, who has been the nation's chief securities regulator
since 1993, this month became the longest-serving chairman in the
commission's history. With the speech, he sought to position
himself as the chairman who seized technological advancements as a
way to level the playing field for investors and market
participants of all types.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt couched his speech by asking many questions. This will
surely disappoint market players who were looking for answers from
the nation's top regulator and a clearer regulatory blueprint,
though initial reaction Thursday was strongly positive to the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Brennan, chief executive of the Vanguard Group, the mutual
fund giant, said, ``While innovation is a great thing, you always
want to know that the innovation taking place is happening with
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt made clear that he was not giving the securities industry
its marching orders. Rather he was trying to shape the dialogue
that must occur before changes can be made. ``I want to see the
natural genius of the marketplace give vent to a better, cheaper,
more protected market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because commission approval is necessary for market participants
who want to expand their businesses, however, Levitt's opinion is
critical for firms and exchanges that want to move quickly to form
alliances, make deals or extend their hours without losing business
to more nimble competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The stock markets are undergoing rapid change and appear on the
verge of even more competition, with demand growing for instant
access. Over the last year, new electronic stock markets have
sprung up to trade NASDAQ stocks, the trading of stocks has
extended into the evening hours and the volume of shares traded by
online investors has surged.
</P>
<P>
   While these innovations have helped to drive some investors'
costs down, the upstarts have given rise to concerns that
individuals buying and selling stocks may not be getting the best
prices on their trades because the various marketplaces are not
connected. In some cases, an order placed in one venue may be
completed there even though a better price may be available
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Demand from investors for longer trading days seems to be
leading to 24-hour trading, and some of the electronic networks
already offer trading after 4:30 p.m., though with few orders,
investors cannot be assured of getting as good a price as they
would in a bigger pool of orders.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   With his proposal for a centralized system for stock market
information, Levitt is treading on turf explored by another SEC
chairman, Harold Williams, in the late 1970s. Back then, the
commission set out to help the securities industry create a
national market system through a central book of orders. But the
powerful Wall Street brokerage firms and exchanges blocked the plan
and it quietly died.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Levitt, the Wall Street establishment may not be as
opposed to the proposal this time around. One reason is that
technology has advanced sufficiently since the 1970s that such a
system could easily be created. Moreover, many of the established
brokerage firms own parts of the new trading networks, giving them
a foot in both the old and new camps.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Madoff, principal of Bernard Madoff Investment
Securities, a market-making firm that stands to lose from one of
Levitt's proposals, sounded sanguine Thursday. ``A central limit
order book _ that's something we have to see more of what it would
look like,'' he said. ``It's been something that has been talked
about for a very long time. It's been difficult to achieve because
of turf wars but probably if it ever has a chance of happening it
would have a better chance today.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarb, of NASD, said his organization would soon be filing with
regulators its plans for a central order book that has many of the
characteristics described by Levitt. ``What we're going to be
filing with the SEC this week or next has all the tools,'' Zarb
said. Previous efforts to create such a book failed to win broad
member support, because some big dealers worried that by running
such a centralized order book, NASD would be competing with them.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt's idea for a single self-regulatory organization to
police the investment arena is not exactly new. What was new in his
speech was his suggestion that the crucial duty of market
surveillance would remain local and performed at each exchange,
close to the operations. The SEC chairman said that plans by both
the NYSE and the NASDAQ to issue shares in their organizations to
the public could not be pursued until well-researched plans for
spinning off both exchanges' regulatory arms were provided to the
commission. ``We must be certain that their plan to create a
separation is sufficiently definite,'' Levitt said in an interview
Thursday. ``There can be no backing away from it. There won't be
any game playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the tradition-bound New York Stock Exchange took Levitt's
calls for change in stride. A central order book appears to be a
problem for the exchange since it would include those stocks whose
executions are now handled exclusively by specialists on its floor.
Levitt's call for the elimination of a rule by the exchange that
bars members from trading listed shares off the floor, known as
Rule 390, would bring more competition for the exchange's
specialists as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Richard Grasso, chairman of the exchange, said his
organization was up to the challenge. ``Change driven by customer
patterns and by technological advancement necessitates
reinvention,'' he said in an interview. ``Those that reinvent
themselves will succeed beyond their wildest expectations. We have
always been successful at reinventing ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC chairman expressed interest in opening options trading
to increased competition as well. The established exchanges,
including the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange, have had a virtual monopoly on the options they traded.
Under a gentleman's agreement, they vowed not to trade each other's
offerings. But they are now beginning to trade each other's options
and feeling the heat from an electronic trading system, the
International Securities Exchange in New York, which expects to
begin trading options in March.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt pointed out that the prospect of a new entrant has
fostered some nascent competition among the established options
exchanges. The SEC studied four actively traded options and found
that competition has reduced the effective costs of buying and
selling them by 22 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the new electronic communication networks, such
as the Island ECN, that have brought much of the recent upheaval to
Wall Street, also stand to lose if Levitt succeeds in eliminating
the fees they charge.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Atkin, chief executive of Instinet, the oldest, most
established electronic trading network, was enthusiastic about
Levitt's ideas, even though his company reaps ECN fees. ``If you
get to an efficient market structure, a pure central limit order
book,'' Atkin said, ``then there's no need for ECN fees.''
Presumably, the ECNs would get more business if quotes were more
widely disseminated and could alter their business model.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic networks, however, will benefit from other ideas
floated by the SEC chairman, such as the creation of a centralized
order book and the elimination of the rule restricting trading in
certain NYSE stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Bradley, senior vice president and portfolio manager at
American Century Investment Management in Kansas City, said he was
struck by how open the commission seemed to the young firms. ``It's
mind-blowing how realistic their thinking is about the evolution
and change in the marketplace,'' he said. ``This is an exciting,
exciting and visionary statement from an agency that has
traditionally protected the monopoly players.''

 &HT;    MindSpring, EarthLink merge to become second-largest ISP
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises, which has grown to be one of
the nation's premier Internet service providers and a leading
symbol of Atlanta's Internet hopes, announced Thursday a $3 billion
merger with EarthLink, a like-minded company from Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have reputations for being customer-friendly and
informal to the point of goofiness.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, MindSpring was a one-man operation in an Atlanta
basement apartment _ now it's a multibillion-dollar marvel.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta, the news is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for an exchange of stock after which MindSpring
will surrender its name, with EarthLink becoming the surviving
brand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the arrangement will make Atlanta the headquarters of the
combined company, and MindSpring founder and Chairman Charles
Brewer will continue his role as chairman. MindSpring's president
and chief operating officer, Michael McQuary, will be president;
Charles ``Garry'' Betty, EarthLink's chief executive, will be CEO
of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will give the new EarthLink more than 3 million
subscribers, propelling it into second place among Internet service
providers behind America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, AOL is the target: With more than 17 million
members, AOL has been pulling away from everyone else in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   By melding resources, MindSpring and EarthLink believe they can
mount a serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly perfect, MindSpring has won accolades of many users
for its emphasis on customer service. In fact, J.D. Power and
Associates, a national consumer survey firm, recently ranked
MindSpring and EarthLink first and second, respectively, in
customer service _ an area in which AOL's record has been
notoriously spotty.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer endowed MindSpring with a nine-point list of core values
and beliefs about how to treat customers, employees and
shareholders. His focus on those ethics repeatedly puzzled some in
appearances before investors and analysts during MindSpring's rise,
but the company made believers of many by becoming the first major
ISP to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   With the merger, EarthLink will adopt the nine-point guideline
and add a tenth. The newest precept stresses the value of
competition _ a bid to retain the companies' cultures while
stressing a willingness to tussle.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pat Buchanan's expected campaign for the Reform
Party's presidential nomination has won the tacit approval of Ross
Perot and the explicit encouragement of close Perot advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has said nothing publicly about the struggle over a
nominee that is roiling the Reform Party. And people in both camps
said Perot has not had any recent conversations with Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But through his intermediaries, Perot has sent unmistakable
messages that Buchanan is his candidate. Advisers to Perot and
Buchanan said they have talked with Buchanan's representatives to
discuss how he can navigate the byzantine ballot access rules of
the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, Buchanan's sister and chief strategist, said
Thursday that she did not think Buchanan and Perot had spoken since
1995. But she said the extent of Perot's approval was ``an
extremely serious consideration'' in Buchanan's decision about
whether to abandon the Republican Party and seek the Reform
nomination. She said Buchanan planned ``a courtesy call'' to Perot
in the next week to let him know his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of recent interviews, Buchanan has left little doubt
that he plans to defect from the Republican Party. And several of
his friends and foes in the Reform Party said they view him as the
leading contender _ and in no small measure because of Perot's
apparent consent.
</P>
<P>
   If he captures the nomination, that could serve Buchanan's
interests and Perot's, allowing both men to reassert themselves on
the national political stage. After mounting high profile
insurgencies for president in 1992 and 1996, both have lost
influence in their parties.
</P>
<P>
   A Buchanan candidacy would also allow Perot to draw attention
from Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, whose relations with Perot
soured even before Ventura was elected last year as the only
governor on the Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   People close to both men said Perot and Buchanan also would
relish the opportunity to siphon support in the general election
from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, should the governor win the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Buchanan and Perot have had tempestuous relations
with former President George Bush and his family. During the 1992
campaign, Bush said Perot had ``nutty ideas,'' while Perot blamed
Bush for dispatching a ``dirty tricks crowd'' against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grumpy old men stick together,'' said Ronald Kaufman, who was
political director in the Bush White House and is a close adviser
to the former president. ``For whatever reason, both men have held
the Bushes in less than high regard. And nothing unites like a
common enemy in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buchanan disputed remarks about enmity toward the Bushes as
``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Perot's closest advisers _ Russell J. Verney, the Reform
Party chairman and a longtime aide to Perot, and Pat Choate, who
was the vice-presidential nominee of the Reform Party in 1996 _
said in interviews that they have had talks with Buchanan or Bay
Buchanan over the mechanics of seeking the Reform Party's
nomination. Choate, in fact, actively recruited Buchanan to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross respects any person who has the courage of their
convictions,'' said Verney, who speaks to Perot every day. Asked if
Perot was comfortable with Buchanan, he said, ``From Ross'
perspective, we must have additional voices in the debate. And my
job is to make sure the welcome mat is out.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot lost control of the Reform Party last July when his
hand-picked candidate to head the party was defeated by Ventura's
choice. But Perot still has loyalists throughout the party who
could help Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, a former professional wrestler, has ridiculed Buchanan
as a ``retread,'' and expressed particular concern that the
commentator's staunchly conservative views on social issues do not
mesh with his Libertarian stands.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview, Ventura _ whose lieutenants have
sought to enlist other candidates like former Gov. Lowell Weicker
of Connecticut and Sen. John McCain of Arizona _ insisted that he
was not trying to interfere with Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked, `Have you started a force in Washington to
stop Buchanan?''' Ventura said. ``No! I could care less if Pat
Buchanan joins the Reform Party. We welcome him with open arms _
whether he'll get the nomination in 2000 or not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing Ventura's concerns about Buchanan, Verney said, ``To
claim that Buchanan is a retread when Lowell Weicker and John
McCain aren't is stretching reality a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Perot has maintained an unusually low profile in
recent months. Choate explained that Perot was trying to forestall
attacks that he is ``dictatorial and manipulative and that this is
another devious plot by Ross Perot.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet asked if Perot had the influence to stop Buchanan if he so
desired, Choate said, ``Absolutely.'' He added that ``Ross likes
Pat Buchanan. He admires his ability to write and to express
himself. And he admires his integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Perot does not aggressively work behind the scenes to
boost Buchanan, he would be immensely valuable to Buchanan even by
sitting on the sidelines. For one thing, if Perot decides not to
seek the nomination himself _ as thus far appears to be the case _
that helps clear the path for Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great help to Pat to have some of that
information,'' said Dean M. Barkley, who was chairman of Ventura's
campaign and remains a close adviser. ``There are insiders to tell
him the lay of the land, to point the way to which states are
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Buchanan put it this way: ``Having people on the inside is
very important.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At first glance, a marriage between Perot and Buchanan seems
beyond the strange bedfellows that politics sometimes throws up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform Party does not stand for the particular social
issues which are the masthead of what Pat Buchanan is all about,''
said Orson Swindle, who helped plot Perot's first bid for president
and is now a member of the Federal Trade Commission. ``Is there a
possibility this has all been stirred up by Pat to get all the
publicity? When you're not in the spotlight, you're bleeding to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the political motivations, Perot and Buchanan have
common interests in opposing trade agreements and calling for
political reform. In fact, Buchanan won the biggest ovation of all
the presidential candidates at a convention in 1995 of Perot's now
defunct organization, United We Stand America.
</P>
<P>
   While some Reform Party members said they are unsettled at the
notion of a polarizing figure like Buchanan leading their party,
others note that Buchanan is a popular enough figure that he would
likely win enough of the popular vote for the party to qualify for
federal funding in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The practical benefit for Buchanan now is that the nominee will
get $12.6 million in federal matching subsidies; Perot, in turn,
could feel comfortable about the survival of his party, at least
until the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settles a whole bunch of scores for Ross,'' said one
person who is close to the maneuverings of the Reform Party but
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``It gets him back into play
instead of Jesse. Ross loves playing Wizard of Oz. He can say he
had nothing to do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   But noting that Perot is unpredictable, Ms. Buchanan did not
rule out the possibility that the Texas tycoon could plunge into
the race and spoil every thing for Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of his money,'' Ms. Buchanan said, ``if he decided
this is the house he built and he is going to run, that would be an
extremely difficult hurdle to overcome.''

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Senate approved a measure Thursday to
spare oil companies from paying higher royalties for drilling on
public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 51-47.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, sponsored by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
blocks new federal rules for calculating the fees for one year, at
a savings to oil companies estimated at $66 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an independent producer issue,'' Hutchison said as she
wrapped up the latest victory in her crusade on behalf of her
state's key industry. If enacted into law, her moratorium of the
new royalty system would be the fourth she has won in the last 16
months.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the value of oil taken from federal land is
determined by the oil companies themselves. The Interior proposal
would peg the value to the oil's fair market price, taking into
account certain costs. Critics of the current system say oil
companies now undervalue the oil by as much as $4 to $5 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   In debate leading up to the vote, Hutchison said the higher
costs from the royalties would be ``the last nail in the coffin''
for some smaller producers.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the proposed new fee system a ``tax,'' she repeatedly
charged that ``it will raise the price of gas at the pump for every
working American.'' However, neither Hutchison nor her office
offered an estimate of how much more per gallon customers would
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had occasionally brought legislation to a halt in the
Senate over the past two weeks, as opponents led by Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., charged that the Hutchison provision was a cave-in
to big oil companies and their campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock ended Thursday when Hutchison mustered the required
60 votes to end debate and force a vote on her measure, an
amendment to the annual appropriations bill for the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, the two sides faced each other with dueling
facts, charts and accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and her allies displayed a chart listing the ``seven
schemes'' some oil company executives have admitted they used to
miscalculate royalties paid to state and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions are part of lawsuits in which several oil
companies have reached settlements worth $5 billion for
underpayments to states, including Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said those settlements were evidence that the current
method for calculating royalties makes cheating easy.
</P>
<P>
   Oil royalties are generally designated for education,
conservation and Indian tribes. Boxer argued that the taxpayers
have already lost $88 million because the new rules have not been
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison countered with an illustration showing a hodgepodge of
small boxes and connecting lines that she said represented an
impossibly complex new royalty system that the U.S. Mineral
Management Service has designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If oil companies cannot drill because they cannot make a
profit, then they're not going to drill,'' she said. ``There will
be a diminishing of the amount of money that's coming into the
federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's prediction of higher gas prices was rejected by a
private group, which has led a campaign charging oil companies with
shortchanging taxpayers in royalties for use of public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gas prices are regulated by the market,'' said Beth Daley,
spokesman for Project on Government Oversight, which has joined in
several of the lawsuits against oil companies over underpayment of
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Daley said that the 18 energy companies that pay 99
percent of royalties made an estimated $9.2 billion in profits for
the first months of this year, according to their most recent
public filings.
</P>
<P>
   The debate Thursday briefly turned into sharp exchanges, as Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., a campaign finance reformer, lambasted
the role of political donations from the oil industry to the
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a list of donations by energy corporations, he said, ``I
must object ... when their deep pockets give them deep influence
that ordinary citizens never have.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison recieved $1.2 million in contributions from the oil
industry from 1993-1998, the most of any member of Congress,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Her amendment cosponsor, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., received
more than $186,000.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's remarks brought protests. Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo.,
asked the chair to rule his comments were out of order because they
were not germane to the amendment. But Feingold was permitted to
complete his speech.
</P>
<P>
   In her reaction to the developments Thursday, Hutchison said,
``This is a victory for all Americans who are tired of paying
excessive taxes every time they visit the neighborhood gas station.
I am proud that the Senate stood tall and did the right thing.''

AIDES EXPRESS CONCERN OVER GORE'S CAMPAIGN SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some aides and advisers to Vice President Al Gore
are concerned that his campaign for president is ``hemorrhaging''
money because it is top-heavy with expensive political consultants
and spends far more on travel than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the current fund-raising quarter ends next week,
some supporters say they fear that Gore will have less money in the
bank for future spending than his opponent for the Democratic
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign agreed to release firm figures on fund raising
or spending for this year's third quarter, which ends on Sept. 30.
But several supporters and senior aides of Gore expressed concern
that Bradley's growing bankroll and lower costs will add to the
perception that the vice president's campaign is mismanaged and
will dent the aura of inevitability that Gore has been trying to
project.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Gore's fund raising is meeting campaign goals _
one aide estimated that he will report approximately $10 million in
contributions for the current quarter, more than he raised in
either of the last two quarters. But the campaign is spending at a
much faster rate than that of Bradley or the Republican
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Gore aides disputed the argument that the campaign
is overspending, saying that the money invested now will provide
the organization needed to carry many primary states next year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those assurances, some Democrats close to the vice
president are worried that his campaign's spending is out of
control and see it as a symptom of a troubled operation, riven by
infighting and bloated with political consultants, pollsters, media
advisers, fund-raisers and high-level functionaries with poorly
defined roles.
</P>
<P>
   The result, these Democrats say, is a campaign that is slow on
its feet, overly cautious and unable to connect with voters.
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, a chief architect of President Clinton's two
successful campaigns, said that Gore will have to accelerate his
fund raising and radically slash spending on staff and expenses to
remain financially competitive with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious they have to do the campaign equivalent of
raising taxes and cutting spending,'' Carville said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, the press secretary for the vice president's
campaign, declined to comment on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The runaway costs of the Gore campaign are in part attributable
to the vice president's voracious appetite for advice from a range
of Democratic figures upon whom he has relied for years. That has
led to the costly and seemingly self-defeating hiring of two
political consultants, Bob Squier and Carter Eskew, who once were
close friends and business partners but who now are barely on
speaking terms.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has also retained several polling firms and
hired a number of the Democratic party's top fund-raising
specialists, keeping their high-priced talent from Bradley but also
helping to deplete Gore's campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns last reported official financial figures as of
the end of June. At that point, Gore had raised $17.5 million and
spent $8.4 million, leaving $9.1 million cash in the bank. Bradley
had collected $11.7 million but spent only $4.3 million, leaving
$7.4 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to both camps said that they suspect that the gap in
cash on hand has narrowed in the three months since then and that
Bradley may well have surpassed Gore because of his successful
fund-raising efforts and tight cost controls.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, the spokesman for Bradley's campaign, declined to
say how much Bradley has raised in the third quarter. But several
supporters and aides to Bradley acknowledged that it would be a
major coup for the former senator if he had more cash in the bank
than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an epic disaster for him,'' said a senior Bradley
aide speaking of Gore. ``A sitting vice president, with all those
levers of power, trailing an upstart candidate?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has been hobbled by high costs in part because
his position requires him to fly aboard official aircraft and to
reimburse the government the cost of first-class airfare for the
entourage that travels with him. Bradley, running an insurgent's
campaign on a relative shoestring, can fly at low commercial rates
with a small coterie of aides.
</P>
<P>
   But a Gore adviser said that the discrepancy in travel costs
accounts for only about a quarter of the difference in spending
between the two campaigns. The bulk of Gore's high costs come from
the overhead expenses of the huge campaign organization he has
built up in costly office space on K Street in downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two quarters of the year, Gore spent $1.8 million
on direct- mail costs; Bradley spent $200,000. The vice president's
campaign also had considerably higher overhead _ for rent,
salaries, telephones, lawyers' fees, office equipment and travel.
Gore spent $4 million on overhead, while Bradley spent $2.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Gore strategist acknowledged that Bradley is, for the
time being at least, competitive financially with the vice
president. But he insisted that Gore's heavy spending over the past
months has built a formidable organizational base for the primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're raising unprecedented sums of money and we're doing it
quickly,'' this strategist said on condition that he not be
identified. ``We have the money to run this thing. We have the
organization and the strategy to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the vice president's campaign money has been
``invested,'' he said, in direct mail operations, experienced
advisers and on-the-ground organizations in critical early primary
states. ``The fruits of it are not that apparent right now,'' he
said, but will be when Gore and Bradley begin competing for primary
votes in California, New York and other major battleground states.

   AYDEN, N.C. _ The Swift Creek finally returned to its banks
Thursday, flowing pleasantly downstream as if it had not just
caused an agricultural catastrophe in Pitt and Craven counties. But
the mud and the fetid stench and the endless ruined crops it left
behind will never be forgotten by the Stancill family and the other
farmers who used to depend on its water.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad used to hear talk about the land going sour,'' said
Chris Stancill, who lost about $700,000 worth of cotton to the
flood waters that rose after Hurricane Floyd. ``But he never saw it
smelling as sour as this. Neither did my grandfather, or anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The creek's retreat Thursday on Stancill's farm revealed immense
fields of brown and stinking cotton bolls, which had rotted after
having been covered with Hurricane Floyd's rainwater for three or
four days. The devastation was matched across the eastern third of
North Carolina, where the state's worst agricultural disaster may
result in the staggering loss of 15 percent of its 52,000 farms.
</P>
<P>
   The waters damaged or ruined more than two million acres of
crops, Jim Graham, the state agriculture commissioner, said
Thursday, estimating the ultimate farm loss would exceed $1
billion. Coming after a poor growing year, the flood probably will
drive 6,000 to 7,000 farmers out of business, Graham predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been commissioner for 35 years, and I always tried to
have a positive attitude,'' Graham said. ``But this is really
discouraging, really discouraging. It's the worst thing to ever to
happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm losses began revealing themselves slowly as the waters
across the state started receding significantly Thursday. Although
more than 3,000 people remained in shelters, a few residents in
Rocky Mount and Tarboro were able to return to their homes
Thursday, although many found them unsalvageable. Parts of 1,000
roads remained closed, and the body of a National Guardsman was
found after his vehicle overturned, bringing the storm's death toll
in the state to 42.
</P>
<P>
   Many farms remained under water Thursday, and depending on their
crop, farmers often did not need access to their fields to know
they were ruined. Most tobacco had been harvested, but any leaves
that were inundated were gone, as was most cotton, which would not
have been harvested until next month. Peanuts, sweet potatoes and
soybeans might be salvageable, but it will be at least a week
before the full extent of the damage becomes clearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone came by yesterday and said they had just rowed across
our soybean field,'' said Karen Briley, whose family farms more
than 1,000 acres east of Greenville. Ms. Briley estimated that 80
percent of her family's crops were ruined. ``That wasn't really
something we wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of hogs, chickens and turkeys were killed,
resulting in losses of $9.4 million to livestock, the state
agriculture department said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether farmers survive often depends on one thing: insurance.
The Stancills were lucky. They have been paying $20 an acre a year
on their 3,000 acres for federal crop insurance that protects
against any kind of natural disaster. Without it, the burden of
paying off loans and bills on a ruined harvest would have almost
certainly resulted in bankruptcy, Stancill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a good year, you hate paying that insurance,'' said
Stancill, 34, a third-generation farmer who is partners with his
brother. ``But this year, those premiums seem real reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   But many farmers, including the Brileys, did not have crop or
flood insurance, and are hoping for government grants and loans to
keep them afloat until the next planting season. But in some cases
fields may be ruined by pollution for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of farmers had insurance, but even more didn't,'' said
Hubert Garris, agency manager for the Farm Bureau Insurance Co.
``We're talking about farms that had never flooded before, people
who never dreamed they would have a problem with flooding. I don't
know where they are going to get the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal disaster declarations mean that many farmers will be
eligible for low-interest loans, but Graham, the agriculture
commissioner, said that would not be enough. Many farmers are
already on the precipice because of low commodity prices and the
hottest summer in years, he said, and will need outright grants to
stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to lose a lot of those farms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's gravelly voice shook with rage as he condemned the
Clinton administration's civil suit against the tobacco industry to
recover the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses, which he
said will hurt tobacco farmers even more. Some farmers lost
harvested tobacco in flooded warehouses, and others have been
affected by a tobacco company decision to delay buying North
Carolina tobacco until it has been checked for pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the state's cotton crop may be lost, Graham said, a
blow that is particularly hard because this year's crop had been
expected to be a record for the state. Almost all of Pitt County's
40,000 acres were damaged by the high water, said Mitch Smith,
director of the county Extension Service, and the smell of rotting
cotton was beginning to pervade large sections of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those brown cotton plants?'' Stancill asked, as his pickup
truck squished through the fresh mud of fields his family has
farmed since 1927, at least a quarter mile from the creek.
``They're gone. I don't think any cotton's ever flooded here
before. And I hope it's the last time.''

   WASHINGTON _ In what are becoming almost regular sessions,
President Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met at the
White House on Thursday to discuss how to proceed on negotiations
that are to define a final peace settlement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials depicted the meeting as an opportunity
for Clinton to bolster Arafat's confidence so that he will proceed
briskly with negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Under an accord signed in Egypt three weeks ago, the two sides
agreed to an ambitious deadline of next February for reaching an
agreement setting out the concepts of a final settlement. Both
sides are supposed to reach that settlement a year from now,
defining the borders of Israel and a Palestinian entity, the future
of Jerusalem and the issue of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Arafat earlier this year, Clinton offered to hold
a summit conference of the Palestinians and Israelis if such a
high-level meeting was needed to move along the negotiations.
Thursday, Clinton stopped short of pledging a summit meeting again
but said he would ``do whatever I can to help the parties to come
to an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sidestepped a question about whether he wanted to be the
president who helped achieve a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of the state is one to be resolved in the
permanent status talks that have just begun,'' Clinton said. ``I
think that obviously the two sides will make an agreement on that
or there won't be an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official declined to say after the meeting
whether Clinton had addressed the matter of a Palestinian state
with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis of the meeting was more on the style of the coming
negotiations rather than nuts and bolts, the official said. Clinton
had emphasized such things with Arafat as ``flexibility,
creativity, ensuring public support and not cornering your
partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was described by administration officials as being in a
buoyant mood. They said he appeared to be pleased so far with the
steps Israel had taken to carry out the agreement signed in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Arafat was almost effusive about Clinton,
thanking him for ``the tireless efforts and unwavering
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has forged
a relationship with Clinton but would prefer to keep the
administration at arm's length during the coming negotiations,
Arafat called for the ``personal intervention'' of Clinton as the
negotiations proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks after leaving the Oval Office, Arafat said the
Israelis and Palestinians were headed ``toward the moment of
truth'' and predicted there would be ``difficult times in the
negotiations.'' But he referred warmly to Barak, calling him ``my
new partner.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting with Arafat, Clinton called Barak to fill him
in on the discussions, White House officials said. The call was
part of the role Clinton hopes to play in the coming months of
building trust between the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met the Palestinian leader in the Gaza Strip last
December, in Washington in the spring, and most recently at the
funeral of King Hassan of Morocco.

 &HT;    Collectors descend upon anything Disney during convention
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Pack rats prowled the Mouse Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   They were bent on buying. Anything Mickey. Anything Goofy.
Anything to feed the consuming, compulsive Disney desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't deny it,'' said Dug Feltch, a St. Louis collector.
``This is our passion. It's the magic. There's not enough magic in
the world. If you can share it with other people, it's like a
support group. We laugh at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For seven days in early September, Disney World's Contemporary
Hotel hosted the eighth annual Disneyana convention, where, Feltch
says, ``it costs you $3,000 to come and spend more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Feltch is a puppeteer by profession. Like most of these 1,500 or
so ``conventionears,'' he collects for fun, not profit, and he
specializes. He collects Disney animation cells and pencil
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   The convention alone costs $840. You get a few meal coupons and
tickets to parties, the main-event auction and an elaborate closing
banquet. The only thing you can't buy: self-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all normal people living normal lives,'' explained Julie
Selcke, a human resources manager at a Chicago tool and dye
factory. ``We all work, raise our kids and do all the things
everyone else does. This is just something special for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Selcke, who collects anything Tinkerbell, cried the day in 1966
that Walt Disney died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one place you can come and be a kid again,'' she
says. ``I have a mother who has breast cancer, and I'm going to go
back and have to deal with that. This is my break.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Ron, who runs a silver-polishing business, collects
Disney confetti. It's sort of a joke, he said, but then he tells
you the best confetti in his collection is from Disneyland Paris.
``It's cut in the shape of leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   This bizarre buying bazaar went way beyond the $385 limited
edition Disneyana leather jackets or $22 T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Conventionears came for pristine collectibles handled by Disney
employees with white gloves. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   The limited editions began at cheap _ $25 for one of 1,000
official posters _ all the way up to $3,500 for a one-of-a-kind
Lion King vase.
</P>
<P>
   And there was so much more. One of 1,350 Maleficent sculptures:
$795. One of five ostrich eggs painted with Disney characters:
$3,000. One-hundred Bambi, Flower and Thumper bronze sculptures:
$1,895 each.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach collectors Terry and Kerry Battbought their
first Mickey Mouse figurine at a Disney gift shop in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``You buy your first one,'' Kerry said, ``and that's it, it just
explodes. You can't stop. You become excessive compulsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney markets memories, and they market great memories.''
</P>
<P>
   You could buy very special memories at the live auction. To
properly sell this year's convention theme, ``Safari Adventure,''
Sotheby auctioneer David Redden, in full costume, entered the
ballroom on a sultan's throne carried by Disney attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear. You needed a sultan's platinum credit
card to compete.
</P>
<P>
   A car from the Dumbo ride hit $18,000. A car from the defunct
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride went for $13,000. A framed, matted, Walt
Disney-signed check with photo sold for $6,000. Spirited bidding
for a Jessica Rabbit Mattel prototype doll ended at $13,000. The
winning bid for Mickey Mouse Club jackets worn by Cubby, Sharon and
Eileen was $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The only auction price under $1,000 was $500 for a costume dress
from Frontierland's Diamond Horseshoe Revue.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Barber, a Pompano Beach fireman who has a second job as a
locksmith to pay for Disney spending sprees, bid $1,900 and got a
slab of concrete signed by Marc Davis, a Disney animator.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Disneyana, Terry and his wife, Nancy, had to rent
a 10-foot trailer to haul home all the stuff they bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every room in our house is Disney,'' said Nancy. ``Last year
we bought a topiary sculpture of Mickey Mouse. We hang lights on it
and it's our Christmas tree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And a monorail runs around it,'' added Terry.
</P>
<P>
   They bought the Mickey fake bush at the always popular Mickey's
Attic sale. Disney cleans out its storage space to sell signs,
banners, props and more for prices usually under $20. Collectors
lined up at 5 a.m. for the 3 p.m. opening.
</P>
<P>
   They also lined up for autographs from Disney artists and
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Animator Davis, who created Cinderella, Tinkerbell and Cruella
De Vil, attracted the convention's longest autograph lines. Walt
Disney called Davis, 91, and eight other 1950s animators his ``Nine
Old Men,'' a nickname adapted from Franklin D. Roosevelt's Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Conventionears also took seminars _ on everything from Disney
landscaping to Disney songs. Driven Disney-philes paid $85 a class
to earn make-believe degrees _ including the top degree, the
Ducktorate, which requires 10 classes.
</P>
<P>
   But don't try to sell Yvonne O'Neil, Disney events manager, on
the idea that the captive collectors were being gouged.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have a passion for anything Disney,'' she
said. ``People have passions, whether it's Disney or a baseball
autographed by Willie Mays.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil said collectors are constantly polled for opinions. If
they don't like an event, Disney dumps it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only fault that I see,'' concluded St. Louis puppeteer Dug
Feltch, ``is they've created junkies and addicts. They need to be
more gentle with us. More isn't always better.''

BUSH VOWS TO INCREASE PAY, BEEF UP MILITARY IF ELECTED PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush said Thursday that if he is elected president he will restore
the ``bond of trust'' with the U.S. military by increasing armed
forces pay, deploy an anti-missile defense system and dedicate
research to ``creating the military of the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before hundreds of cadets at The Citadel, one of the
nation's premier military colleges, Bush said he also will review
U.S. military deployments in places such as Kosovo and Bosnia to
arrange withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sending our military on vague, aimless and endless deployments
is the swift solvent of morale,'' the Texas governor said. ``We
will not be permanent peacekeepers, dividing warring parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's positions on military pay and deployment of a defensive
missile system were in keeping with many of his Republican rivals'
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also proposed $20 billion in research and development
spending and suggested skipping some of the currently planned
defense systems for the next ``generation of technology.'' In so
doing, Bush set himself apart from his GOP opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will require spending more _ and spending more wisely,''
Bush said. ``Our forces of the next century must be agile, lethal,
readily deployable and require a minimum of logistical support.''
</P>
<P>
   Former arms treaty negotiator Richard Armitage, one of Bush's
defense policy advisers, said the research and development could
study programs such as using electromagnetic energy to destroy an
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you don't have to bring the shells or powder,'' Armitage
said. ``Likewise, the combustion engine we have now in all our
tanks or assault vehicles that burn liquid fuel, but if you had a
solid fuel, you'd have no logistics associated with it ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are on the drawing board and are possible,'' said
Armitage, an international troubleshooter for Presidents Reagan and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, another policy adviser to George W. Bush, said
all weapons systems would have to be reviewed. She said a program
like the F-22 fighter, partly built in Fort Worth, Texas, might not
be as appealing as a future weapon as would a long-range bomber or
precision missile. But Rice said Bush supports spending $1.8
billion to build the first six F-22 fighters to keep the program
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has spent $25 billion developing the controversial
F-22 stealth fighter and wants to spend another $40 billion to
build 339 of the aircraft. But critics say its short range makes it
unacceptable in a time when global aircraft are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Rice and Armitage declined to say how much Bush's total military
program would cost. Rice said it would require a ``substantial''
increase over time but would not take the military back to the
Reagan era's high spending levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something of a challenge to the Pentagon and Congress to
join him in a program of strategic vision and direction for the
American armed forces that will align budget priorities ... and use
our technology advances in a way we have not been able to do
before,'' said Rice, who was a national security adviser to Bush's
father, the former president.
</P>
<P>
   The group that put together and reviewed Bush's military
proposals also included Colin Powell, the retired general and
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Brent Scowcroft,
national security adviser to President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed in February a plan to increase
military spending for the first time in 14 years, including a major
pay raise for military personnel. The Senate outdid Clinton's
proposal Wednesday by passing a $288.9 billion defense spending
bill that included a 4.8 percent pay raise for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that as president he would spend an additional $1
billion to give even larger pay raises to military personnel and
pledge to renovate military housing. One of his opponents, Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah, has proposed exempting lower-rank military
personnel from paying federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On anti-missile defense systems, Bush said the nation is
threatened by rapidly developing missile technology by such
countries as North Korea, Iran and Iraq. He also noted that China
has claimed to have missiles that could hit Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said deployment of an anti-missile system would require
changes in the anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia, but he
said he would withdraw from the treaty if Russia refused to make
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponents have made similar statements, but the
anti-missile system is opposed by the Democrats in the race _ Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also wanted to crack down on terrorism and said
that included improving domestic and foreign intelligence He said
the nation's response to terrorism must be ``devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When direct threats to America are discovered, I know that the
best defense can be a strong and swift offense,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never mentioned either his father or President Reagan by
name, but he noted their generation was responsible for bringing
the Cold War to an end with the demise of the ``an evil empire.''
Reagan once called the Soviet Union the ``evil empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also referred to the Persian Gulf War, which his father
conducted, as ``a stunning victory.''

HOUSE APPROVES BILL THAT WOULD MAKE CLASS-ACTION SUITS HARDER TO
WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS to say that White House officials are recommending that
president veto only House bill in 5th graf; ADDS 3 grafs at end
with details of vote) 
(ATTN: Va., Iowa, Wis., Texas, N.C.) (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives approved legislation
Thursday that would make it difficult, if not impossible, to bring
successful large class-action lawsuits against tobacco companies,
gun makers and a wide variety of other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was supported by many major industries, from
automobile and chemical producers to small aircraft makers and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   It would require state court judges, who have often been more
sympathetic to plaintiffs in such suits, to transfer most of their
class-action lawsuits to federal courts. The federal rules on class
actions are often more stringent than many state court procedures
and, as a result, plaintiffs' lawyers have been making greater and
more successful use of state courts in recent years in many kinds
of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., Thursday's measure was
approved 222-207 on a vote largely along party lines. It followed
heavy lobbying and ferocious campaign fund-raising on both sides _
big business versus the trial lawyers _ and is similar to a bill
that enjoys bipartisan support in the Senate. The Senate bill is
sponsored by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Herb Kohl, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Thursday that they had recommended
that the president veto the House legislation if it reaches his
desk because it would lead to the widespread dismissal of many
kinds of claims that plaintiffs are now winning, and which have had
the effect of protecting consumers and deterring corporate
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the House legislation said that the measure is
aimed at ending abusive maneuvers by trial lawyers. They condemned
what they say is a growing number of instances where state judges
are making decisions that have nationwide implications in tobacco
and other lawsuits against businesses. The supporters also say that
state court judges are often biased against out-of-state
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The cases affected would include everything from employment
discrimination, environmental disasters and health care fraud, to
product liability cases such as asbestos suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will correct a statutory anomaly, as well as the
gaming of the system by plaintiff attorneys,'' said Rep. James
Moran, D-Va., and one of the sponsors of the legislation. ``Now a
judge in one state decides the laws in all the states. But I don't
want the laws of Virginia to be decided by some judge in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the legislation said that it was outrageous for
a Congress that has left so many federal judgeships vacant _ by
failing to confirm White House's nominees _ to now be broadly
expanding the caseload of an already overworked federal judiciary.
There are 64 vacancies in the federal district and appeals courts,
and judges have complained that their workload has increased
dramatically, in part because of legislation that has created new
federal crimes and in part because Congress has not created any new
judge positions for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, critics said, those class-action lawsuits that
would not be dismissed by the federal courts as a result of the
legislation would be significantly delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a sealed, locked, closed and forever
impenetrable door to justice,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Texas. Other opponents of the legislation called it a form of
``backdoor immunity'' for tobacco companies and gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's critics include a policy group of federal
judges headed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Conference of
Chief Justices of state courts, 15 state attorneys general, a
number of lawyer organizations, and a broad array of civil rights,
disabilities, consumer, anti-tobacco, gun control and health care
groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent months, there has been heavy lobbying on both sides of
the legislation, an important piece of what supporters have called
tort reform. While the full amount of spending will not be known
for months, when lobbyists must file disclosure statements, both
sides have spent millions of dollars in recent years in both
lobbying fees and campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations pushing for the legislation include some of
the nation's most significant business interests, including the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Chemical Manufacturers Association,
DaimlerChrysler and General Motors, the International Mass Retail
Association, Pfizer, Philip Morris, Procter &AMP; Gamble. The lobbyists
working for the legislation have included Jack Quinn, a former
White House counsel in the Clinton administration, and Arthur
Culvahouse Jr., a former White House counsel to President Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable opponents of the legislation included the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America and Public Citizen, a
consumer group founded by Ralph Nader that led a coalition of other
public interest organizations. Nader met at the White House last
month with John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, along with
representatives from the trial lawyers and other groups. The groups
working to defeat the bill include the American Heart and Lung
Associations, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free kids, the Violence
Policy Center (a gun control group), and a number of labor
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was endorsed by a number of Republican lawmakers
who campaigned on pledges of returning political power to the
states. Thursday they found themselves in the position of arguing
that the state courts need to be curtailed and that the federal
judiciary is better equipped to handle cases. While the Republicans
said the issues were not the same, some Democrats said it reflected
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same people who say we need to return power to
the local level, to the individual level, and here they are now
arguing to bring this back to the federal government,'' said Rep.
Melvin L. Watt, D-N.C. ``This is absolutely contrary to the horse
that my colleagues road to the Congress on, the states' rights
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The House vote was almost strict- ly along party lines, with
only 18 Democrats favoring the measure and just 15 Republicans
opposing it. The sole independent, Representa- tive Bernie Sanders
of Vermont vot- ed with the Democrats, as he often does.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats favoring the meas- ure were Representatives James
A. Barcia of Michigan, Rick Boucher of Virginia, Allan Boyd of
Florida, Gary A. Condit of California, Robert E. Cramer of Alabama,
Pat Danner of Missouri, Cal Dooley of California, Virgil H. Goode
Jr. of Virginia, Bart Gordon of Tennessee, Ralph M. Hall of Texas,
Chris John of Louisiana, Ken Lucas of Kentucky, James P. Moran of
Virginia, Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, Norman Sisisky of Vir-
ginia, Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, John Tanner of Tennessee and
Gene Taylor of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans who broke with other members of their party were
Representatives John T. Doolittle of California, Tom Campbell of
Califor- nia, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, Lin- coln Diaz-Balart of
Florida, Phil English of Pennsylvania, Mark Fo- ley of Florida,
Greg Ganske of Iowa, Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, Lindsey Graham
of South Carolina, James C. Greenwood of Pennsylva- nia, Peter T.
King of New York, Constance A. Morella of Maryland, George
Nethercutt of Washington, Ron Paul of Texas and Lee Terry of

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When leaders gather here each year to set out
policies and debate world issues, some use the spotlight to draw
attention to their countries.
</P>
<P>
   This year no one seems to be working harder at that than
Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was elected president of Algeria in April
after the country had endured seven years of fighting between
Islamic militants and an army-backed government in which tens of
thousands of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Algerian voters overwhelmingly endorsed an amnesty
plan devised by Bouteflika that was intended to persuade militants
to surrender so that the country could begin to rebuild. And now,
Bouteflika, who fought against French colonialism and later served
a radical leftist Algerian government as foreign minister, is in
New York talking to business groups, courting investors and
promoting free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving, Bouteflika was building bridges closer to home.
Algeria, now chairman of the Organization of African Unity,
recently was the host to a conference of African leaders, which
went smoothly in a country considered too dangerous to visit a year
ago. Earlier, Bouteflika surprised people by greeting Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak when they met at the funeral of King Hassan II
of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people shake hands, it's not a world event,'' he said
this week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with a market economy,'' he said in an
interview Thursday. ``We had our socialist experience, which was
excellent. But at a certain time it reached its limits, and it
could only go backward. We are moving to a market economy because
we have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Algeria must start from scratch in building economic
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a bazaar economy, as we do, with trafficking and
corruption _ 90 percent of our commercial operations are conducted
illegally _ taxes are not paid, or customs duties,'' he said. He
has begun a drive against corruption, not a popular measure for a
president whose election was contentious. All six other candidates
dropped out saying that Bouteflika, who had the support of the
military, would win unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   That crisis now seems to have passed. Violence has been reduced,
although at least 5,000 armed militants remain, belonging to two
groups that did not accept the amnesty plan. The largest force,
however, the armed wing of the Islamic Salvation Front, has decided
to work with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika has rejected calls for investigations and trials for
those in previous governments and in the military who have been
accused of rights abuses, including his predecessor, President
Liamine Zeroual. The military still wields substantial political
and economic power.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked at a news conference here this week about
prosecuting Zeroual, Bouteflika cut off the questioner with a curt
remark: ``You know absolutely nothing about Algeria!''
</P>
<P>
   Algeria, one of Africa's largest countries in area and with a
population of 30 million, ranks in the middle of the world's
nations in terms of development, according to a 1999 U.N. Human
Development report. Algerians are slightly better off than
Moroccans and slightly less so than Tunisians, their neighbors to
the west and east.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika said the message he was telling potential investors
is that he represents ``a country, a huge country, with great human
and material potential.'' He said he was asking them to look beyond
Algeria's oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is agriculture,'' he said. ``We have the high plateaus
and one million acres in the Sahara that can be worked. We have
minerals that just need some know-how to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth is important, he said, because the middle class
has been weakened, ``and the middle class is supposed to insure
stability in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika, who despite his anti-colonial credentials earned in
the fight against the French, said that Algeria remains culturally
close to France. French officials say that ties have improved
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relations between Algeria and France are always important,''
he said. ``When they are bad, they are important. When they are
good, they are also important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika remains a strong nationalist, uncomfortable with
suggestions that outsiders should help monitor human rights in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an Algerian, I cannot in any way subscribe to the idea that
if we are told that a child is in distress because a parent is
beating it, I am therefore entitled to break into my neighbor's
house to save the child,'' he said.

<P>
   Shortly before 9 a.m. on Sept. 17, an alarm sounded on Derek
O'Banion's personal computer _ the signal that Vitria Technology,
an Internet business software developer, had begun its first day of
trading on NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Vitria, offered at $18, soared to $45 but quickly dipped.
O'Banion pounced, buying 200 shares at $43.375, watching them rise
to $46, and then selling when they slipped to $45.50. Ten minutes
and a $425 profit later, he was back in bed for another half-hour
of sleep before his 10 a.m. introductory fiction-writing class.
</P>
<P>
   With the school year in full swing, O'Banion, a senior at the
University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash., is one of thousands of
college students who fit on-line stock trading into already busy
schedules of lectures, exams and keg parties.
</P>
<P>
   Younger versions of the office workers who sneak in trades while
the boss isn't looking, more students are checking prices and
shifting their portfolios between, and sometimes during, classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect it to conflict, but if it does, once in a while
I can miss a class,'' said O'Banion, 21, a computer science major.
``It's not like I haven't done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Most undergraduates grew up with personal computers and saw the
stock market soar throughout their teen-age years. And they have
easy access to financial news and research in their dormitories,
fraternity and sorority houses and campus computer rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Student day traders may be no better prepared than their elders
to handle the risks of rapid, short-term speculation. Last month,
the North American Securities Administrators Association reported
that 70 percent of day traders lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Most students, however, appear to be taking a safer approach to
online investing. Mustafa Gultekin, a finance professor at the
University of North Carolina, said that of about 70 students in the
undergraduate investing club last year, only two were ay-trading.
``That's a sure way to lose money,'' he tells students.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors, a research firm in Lincoln, Mass., that follows
the online brokerage industry, said a July survey of online traders
showed that about 548,000, or nearly 11 percent of the nation's
5.12 million online traders, were 25 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   While the firm could not say how many of those under-25 traders
were students, it reported that nearly 5 percent, or about 25,000,
were placing orders from schools, mostly universities. About 61
percent, or 305,000, were placing orders from home, a number that
could also include some students.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez found that, like their older counterparts, nearly half of
the younger online traders had long-term, or at least 10-year,
investing strategies. But nearly 23 percent of them invested online
primarily for fun or challenge, compared with 13 percent of their
elders.
</P>
<P>
   O'Banion is more active than most students, making as many as 20
trades daily since he opened an online account last spring with MB
Trading of El Segundo, Calif., using $10,000 he inherited. While
his portfolio has grown about 40 percent, he has lost and recouped
thousands of dollars along the way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has cut down on his trading since, shortly after he started,
he spent $1,000 in commissions, even with discounts for frequent
traders.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Banion, however, the thrill and the dream of great riches
are why he continues to day-trade and why he focuses on initial
public offerings of Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into an IPO, your heart starts racing, because
you could make or lose a lot of money real fast,'' he said shortly
after making his Vitria Technology trades.
</P>
<P>
   Because he concentrates on the first few hours of trading,
beginning at 6:30 a.m. on the West Coast, O'Banion said, investing
does not usually cut into class or study time.
</P>
<P>
   Other students spend more time following the market than trading
in it. Rodger Bucchianeri and Jeffrey Monat, 21-year-old seniors
and roommates at the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania, opened online accounts two years ago. They watch CNBC
and get stock quotations from Bloomberg terminals in campus
buildings. Bucchianeri also carries a pager that displays stock
prices and news, which he monitors during his classes.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Cohen, a senior business major at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, has made three or four trades a week
since opening his online account with E(star)Trade at the beginning
of this year. His portfolio started with stock in blue-chip
companies like Philip Morris and Merck that he received as gifts
from his parents and grandparents beginning in first or second
grade.
</P>
<P>
   He now has $15,000 to $20,000 in the market, mostly in long-term
holdings, but with $2,000 to $3,000 allocated to making short-term
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, 21, consults with Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity brothers
who are also interested in stocks, and he is in close touch with
his brother, Lawrence, a day trader in in New York City. ``If he
sees something I should look into, he'll send me an instant
message, and I'll do the same with him,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   For many student investors, managing online portfolios is
training for a career on Wall Street or in the broader business
world. Bucchianeri, who has already done internships with Paine
Webber, J.P. Morgan and Bear, Stearns, regards his early start in
investing as a chance to take risks that he might shun later. As he
put it, ``I can afford to lose it all, so I'm looking for the high
gains.''

 &HT;    Fashions celebrate Palm Beach's `lioness' socialites
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Kors has Palm Beach to thank for the sexy,
sporty, moneyed look of his spring line.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as he put it in notes handed out before the show, Palm
Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea behind the whole collection is the sexiest girl at
the club,'' Kors said later.
</P>
<P>
   The requisite backstage poster meant to inspire the models in
the properly haughty attitude summed it up best: ``Preppy Socialite
Lionesses,'' it began. ``Think Palm-Bitchy, Florida, Yacht... Be
super sexy, glamorous, up, up, up!!! And very happy! And always
strong and energetic. You are really rich and gorgeous and everyone
wants to be you!''
</P>
<P>
   The pep talk paid off. Kors' Wednesday show _ attended by preppy
socialites Aerin Lauder, Blaine Trump and two of the three Miller
sisters (Pia was MIA) _ was one of the few times all Fashion Week
that Naomi, Amber and Shalom revealed their pearly whites.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the show's campy soundtrack that made them grin: A
medley of ABBA hits, including ``Dancing Queen,'' ``Fernando'' and,
appropriate to Kors' theme, ``Money Money Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Blass says farewell in the rain
</P>
<P>
   More mature members of the social set such as Nan Kempner and
Nina Griscom came out in a downpour Thursday to bid Bill Blass
farewell.
</P>
<P>
   His final show was among the few that went ahead as scheduled
when Hurricane Floyd's rains descended on Manhattan, shutting
schools and making a mess of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through, water started dripping into the Bryant Park
tent, but that didn't faze the designer who's retiring after
decades of dressing the social set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I planned the rain,'' he said afterwards. ``It was part of
the special effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the show needed it. Fuschia bugle-beaded skirts and
neon green sequined pants were plenty special on their own.
</P>
<P>
   And the ovation that greeted Blass as he took his curtain call
to the closing bars of ``Rhapsody in Blue'' was indeed thunderous.
</P>
<P>
   Blass's inspiration for his last hurrah? ``The same thing that
always inspires me. Fabrics and the women I know who wear my
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too much shimmer
</P>
<P>
   Makeup maven Bobbi Brown wielded the brushes and sponges for
Blass' show, one of seven she cosmetized last week. Here are some
fast facts about Brown's many faces:
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest show she did makeup for this season: NYC 2000, a
fashion parade put on by the city in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   _ Number of models in NYC 2000: 80
</P>
<P>
   _ Number of assistants Brown used for that show: 25
</P>
<P>
   _ How long it typically takes for Brown to fully make up a face:
15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   _ Number of tubes of black mascara used by Brown and her team
last week: 200
</P>
<P>
   _ Number of ounces of eye makeup remover used: 1,600
</P>
<P>
   _ Brown's top makeup tip for fall: ``One thing that looks really
fresh is soft pink, pale blush, which usually you don't see for
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Brown's top makeup tip for spring: ``Play with some shimmery
color on the eyes,'' she said as she applied shimmery shades to
models backstage at the Zang Toi show. ``What you don't want is
what you're seeing in the shows, which is shimmer on eyes, cheeks,
lips and nails. Choose what works best for you and just wear it in
one spot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 1 makeup faux pas: ``Most women do nothing or they wear
their makeup the same way for 10 years. ... It's good to
experiment. It's not like you're going to wear it everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't just walk away, Renee
</P>
<P>
   You say your social calendar is still empty on Dec. 31?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you should give Renee Zellweger a call; she says she
hasn't a clue what she'll do to greet 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``No idea! No idea!'' said the bubbly, cherubic actress, whom
Tom Cruise charmed from the word ``hello'' in ``Jerry Maguire.''
``I better make a plan! With my luck I'll be at home in my
pajamas!''
</P>
<P>
   Or she could wear one of Ralph Lauren's classic ball gowns with
a long, full skirt and fitted top. In satin organza with beads, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Lauren's show in Soho Wednesday morning, Zellweger
sported a most Ralph-like ensemble: sleeveless black sweater, slim
black skirt and red boots.

NEW AT FONTANA: SKY'S THE LIMIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG PADILLA  
 c.1999 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ On a clear day, the new skybox suites at
California Speedway offer the most scenic view in Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   Come race day, though, the scene to watch is the one that
extends no further than the track's backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since California Speedway opened three years
ago, suite-holders will get a view of the entire racetrack, as the
facility's latest expansion phase is nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 28 skybox suites above the grandstand and two
additional elevator towers were built and are on schedule to be
ready for the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and CART season finales
the last weekend of October.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.5 million expansion, which began immediately after the
NASCAR Winston Cup race May 2, is modest considering the grandstand
extends nearly a mile down the track's frontstretch. By
conservative estimate, there is room for at least another 70 skybox
suites.
</P>
<P>
   But suites will be supplied only if there is a demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-eight is a pretty hefty number to add to the
luxury-suite marketplace,'' California Speedway marketing director
Craig Rust said. ``But we're confident with the growth of NASCAR
and the strength of motorsports as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   While all 71 of the terrace suites on the California Speedway
infield have been occupied for every race weekend thus far, a few
obstacles stand in the way of keeping suites at 100 percent of
capacity in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Rust said that an undetermined number of skybox suites are
available for the Oct. 30-31 race weekend. Since some terrace-suite
holders transferred their leases to skybox suites, terrace suites
were available, but the last of those was taken Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The awkward timing of the expansion means that more suites have
been added just as original three-year suite leases are coming to
term. Ultimately, the speedway not only needs 28 new parties
interested in a suite, it will need replacements for all parties
that elect not to renew their original leases.
</P>
<P>
   The suites come at a hefty price: $70,000 per season for a super
skybox (49-person capacity), $50,000 for a skybox (30-person
capacity) or $45,000 for a terrace suite.
</P>
<P>
   Rust is optimistic that all suites will be occupied on the last
weekend of October, but he isn't certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is a sellout, but we're dealing with a time limit,''
Rust said. ``We didn't start the expansion until after the Winston
Cup race.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty Rust cited is that most businesses already
have budgeted money for the year and might be hardpressed to come
up with a minimum of $45,000 at such a late date.
</P>
<P>
   Rust said the suites are more geared to businesses than to the
the hardcore race fan who wants to spend a casual day at the track
in a comfortable setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're used for prospective clients, current clients and as
an incentive for current employees,'' Rust said. ``Because they are
not inexpensive, to get a guy that will pay $70,000 because he's a
race fan typically doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Van Matre, president of Van Matre Lumber in Fontana, is in
his third year of leasing a suite and just had his lease
transferred from a terrace suite to one on the skybox level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are motor-racing fans and the location is very attractive
for us,'' said Van Matre, who uses his suite to treat clients.
``There is no doubt that (the skybox) is the best place to spectate
from.''

 &HT;    Columbine victim's words of faith inspiring, but not saintly,
some say
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Cassie Bernall was worried about her
weight, her lack of a boyfriend, her final exams. She was, in many
ways, just another 17-year-old high school junior who didn't know
where she was going to college or with whom she would go to the
prom.
</P>
<P>
   But when she was shot to death inside the library of Columbine
High School on April 20 and was no longer able to speak for
herself, she became a symbol of something much greater. She became
a symbol of faith. Indeed, to thousands of people, she became a
martyr.
</P>
<P>
   In ``She Said Yes: The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall''
(Plough Publishers, $17), which was released earlier this month,
Cassie's mother, Misty Bernall, looks at her daughter's life and
death with tremendous candor. In doing so she raises more questions
about parenting and youth culture than she answers.
</P>
<P>
   Cassie Bernall, her mother writes, was not an angel. When she
was in her early teens, she became involved with a group of friends
who were obsessed with Satanic worship and self-mutilation. Through
a set of letters Misty Bernall found in her daughter's room when
she was 15, she learned that Cassie and her friends were sniffing
glue and had very graphically described murdering and mutilating
Misty and her husband, Brad.
</P>
<P>
   The incident sent the Bernall household into a tailspin. Misty
and Brad reported the threats to the police, forbade Cassie to see
her friends and pulled her out of the public school she was
attending and enrolled her in an Evangelical Christian high school
in the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
   That action set off a three-month siege between parents and
child that came to a sudden end in the spring of 1997 when Cassie
went to a weekend retreat with a Christian youth group. In the
book, which is interspersed with writings from Cassie's father,
brother, friends and youth minister, a classmate recalls Cassie
breaking down in tears at a redemption service and asking God for
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   After the service Cassie and her friends drove into the
mountains and looked at the stars:
</P>
<P>
   ``We just stood there in silence for several minutes, totally in
awe of God. It was phenomenal: our smallness, and the bigness of
the sky. The bigness of God was so real. Later I noticed that
Cassie's whole face had changed. You looked at her, and even though
she was still shy, it was like her eyes were more hopeful. There
was something new about her.''
</P>
<P>
   `Die every day for Jesus'
</P>
<P>
   By her mother's account and letters she wrote, Cassie didn't
become saintly after that weekend, but she changed dramatically,
becoming optimistic and focusing her energies on subjects other
than her anxiety and depression. Her youth minister, Dave
McPherson, said it was Cassie's willingness to ``die every day for
Jesus'' that prepared her for her final moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are driven by their wants,'' McPherson said from Colorado
last week. ``Letting Jesus into your life means that now instead of
saying what you want to say, what is it that God wants _ and that's
what Cassie did.''
</P>
<P>
   The about-face that Bernall turned invites a question for
parents who are dealing with troubled teens everywhere. Two years
before she was killed, Cassie seemed more likely to socialize with
her killers, Eric Harrison and Dylan Klebold, than kids from a
church group. But unlike her killers, she changed the direction of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, last week as Misty Bernall was on the road publicizing
Cassie's story, yet another building filled with youngsters was the
scene of carnage. This time, it was a church in Fort Worth, Texas,
where a gunman killed seven people and himself after barging into a
youth rally _ leaving the country once again to face the
consequences of destruction and alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Misty Bernall said her decision to write the book was motivated
by her desire to let other parents know there is hope for those who
are trying to turn their kids' lives around. In the book, she tells
how she and her husband had tried hard to be Cassie's friends, when
what she needed were stronger parents to set boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes feel that with their actions, these kids are
crying out for help, and that they will respond positively to
someone stepping into their lives and giving them guidance,'' she
said. ``I hope parents will understand that it's OK to intervene in
your kids' lives and to take a strong stand.''
</P>
<P>
   `They just blew her away'
</P>
<P>
   Though Misty Bernall and different friends throughout the book
stress that Cassie was an ordinary teen with ordinary worries, in
death she has become a worldwide symbol. It was just a few hours
after the shootings at Columbine that Cassie's affirmation of her
belief in God became the silver lining in this dark national
tragedy when a classmate of Bernall's told reporters what he heard.
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts in the book, one classmate said he saw her
praying, another said he could not see her because he was hiding
under a desk, ``but I could recognize her voice. One of them asked
her if she believed in God. She paused, like she didn't know what
she was going to answer, and then she said, 'Yes.' She must have
been scared, but her voice didn't sound shaky. It was strong. Then
they asked her why, though they didn't give her a chance to
respond. They just blew her away.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Northrup, an associate professor of religion at Florida
International University, said the term martyr is loosely defined,
but it would probably not be fair to call Cassie a martyr unless it
was known what she was thinking at the moment a gun was pointed at
her head. If she thought the gunmen would spare her life if she
answered yes, she could hardly be called a martyr, Northrup said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's important here in terms of the attitude of our
culture is that here you have someone who is willing to assert her
faith and presumably take the associated risks,'' Northrup said.
``We have grown into an age when people are not very vocal and
outspoken about faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassie's affirmation of her faith _ and not the motivations
behind it _ is what has resonated with the public. In the retelling
of Cassie's death, the Bernalls have received letters from all over
the world. Dozens of Internet sites have sprung up memorializing
Cassie's martyrdom, but the label carries with it a burden.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Misty Bernall quotes another of Cassie's friends on
the subject: ``People can call Cassie a martyr, but they're off
track if they think she was this righteous, holy person, and that
all she did was read her Bible. Because she wasn't like that. She
was just as real as anybody else. With all the publicity she's
getting _ the stories, the T-shirts, the Web sites, the buttons,
the pins _ I think she'd be flipping out. She's probably up there
in heaven, rolling her eyes at it all, going, 'Oh-my-gosh.'''
</P>
<P>
   And some of those who have tried to use Cassie to further their
cause have been criticized.
</P>
<P>
   The Bernalls have said they would be open to a feature film
based on the book. And a line of backpacks, coffee mugs, leather
chokers with a pendant and other items bearing Cassie's last words:
``Yes, I believe in God'' are being marketed primarily at Christian
bookstores, though not by the family. The company marketing those
products has not said what will be done with the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sect owns publishing house
</P>
<P>
   The reputation of the book's publisher, however, is highly
unusual in the world of big-stakes book deals. Plough Publishing
House in rural Pennsylvania is owned by the Bruderhof community, a
Christian sect founded in Germany in 1920 that aims to live as much
like the early Christians as possible. Men wear full beards and
women wear bonnets. Members of the community are pacifists and do
not own property. The company's previous books are typically small
scale, compared with the 250,000-print run of ``She Said Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bernalls picked Plough after they learned it was the
publisher of several of the books Cassie had been reading up until
the time of her death. As if giving testimony to Misty Bernall's
reminder that Cassie was never perfect, Plough has hired the same
New York City public relations company that worked with Monica
Lewinsky after her autobiography was released.
</P>
<P>
   The Bernalls are donating an undisclosed percentage of the
proceeds to set up a Cassie Bernall Charitable Foundation
(www.cassiebernall.org) to educate young people about violence and
to support causes Misty Bernall believes her daughter would have
favored.
</P>
<P>
   And months after her daughter's death, Bernall herself seems not
to have beatified her daughter _ and that's why her book rings
true. If Cassie were to be a martyr, Misty Bernall has said, she'd
be an unlikely one who left a legacy that has taken on a life of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything I would like to leave you, the reader it
is (this),'' Bernall says at the end of her book. ``Cassie's story
is not only mine (and my husband's). It is yours, and what you do
with it now will give it meaning.''

 &HT;    Female martyrs who died young
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Though definitions vary according to
religions, martyrs are generally defined as those who died for
their faith and saints as those who did good works on earth and
then were elevated by a particular religious hierarchy to the
status of saint after their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   While a saint may be a martyr, a martyr is not necessarily a
saint. Among the best known martyrs of this century are the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Gandhi. Gandhi led India toward
independence before he was killed on Jan. 30, 1948, and King was
the Nobel Prize-winning civil rights leader who was assassinated on
April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Some female martyrs who died young:
</P>
<P>
   SAINT MARIA GORETTI
</P>
<P>
   Maria Goretti (1890-1902), born at Corinaldo, Italy, was stabbed
to death by the 20-year-old son of her father's partner in a small
farming community when she refused to have sex with him. She was 11
years old. Maria Goretti forgave her attacker on her death bed, and
after she interceded in several miracles she was declared a saint
by Pope Pius XII on June 24, 1950. Known as the Patroness of Modern
Youth, she is the youngest officially recognized Roman Catholic
saint.
</P>
<P>
   SAINT LUCY
</P>
<P>
   One of the few female saints mentioned in the Roman Catholic
Canon of the Mass, Saint Lucy was born in 283 and died at the age
of 20 rather than give up her virginity. Though her story does not
mention blinding as part of her torments, she is commonly pictured
in art bearing a dish containing two eyeballs, and she has long
been invoked against eye ailments.
</P>
<P>
   JOAN OF ARC
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-15th century when Joan was a 12-year-old shepherd,
she began to hear voices telling her it was her divine mission to
liberate France from the English. The voices told her to cut her
hair and dress in men's clothes. After leading several battles, she
was captured by the English and turned over to the church, which
burned her at the stake for heresy and for dressing in men's
clothes, which was then considered an offense against the church.
She was burned at the stake when she was 19. Twenty-five years
later, her trial was overturned, and in 1920 she was declared a
saint.
</P>
<P>
   EDITH STEIN
</P>
<P>
   Edith Stein was born a Jew in Germany in 1891 to a large Germany
family. A brilliant student, she studied philosophy and converted
to Catholicism in 1921 and later became a Carmelite Nun. A famed
lecturer and philosopher, she was murdered by the Nazis because of
her Jewish heritage at the Auschwitz death camp in August of 1942.
</P>
<P>
   QUARRATU'L-AYN or TAHIRIH
</P>
<P>
   In mid-19th century Persia, a woman was not allowed to unveil
her face. To do so was considered an expression of promiscuity and
a transgression against the clergy and God. Quarratu'l-Ayn unveiled
herself in what was considered the first act of civil disobedience
by a woman in her country's history. In 1852, she was imprisoned
and at the age of 35 executed. She was a role model during the
American suffrage movement and is now considered one of the first
women's civil rights martyrs.

MOYNIHAN ENDORSES BRADLEY, DISMISSING GORE'S CHANCES OF ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York on Thursday
endorsed Bill Bradley for president, bluntly dismissing the
prospects of Bradley's main opponent for the Democratic nomination,
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is the matter with Gore, except that he can't be
elected president,'' Moynihan said at a news conference at the 92nd
Street Y in Manhattan. Upon delivering that single-sentence
judgment on the nation's vice president, who has spent most of the
past two decades preparing for a race for the White House, Moynihan
walked stiffly back to his seat, as Bradley and his supporters
watched in what appeared to be stunned silence.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement itself was not unexpected. Moynihan and Bradley
worked together in the Senate for 18 years, sharing committee
assignments and working on many of the same pieces of legislation.
And in his announcement, Moynihan offered effusive praise of
Bradley's record and leadership abilities, calling him someone
``who belongs in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan's terse dismissal of Gore seems certain to
reinforce growing concern among many Democrats, including the vice
president's own supporters, about the health of Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Moynihan was asked why he believed Gore could not
win, he rose again, returned slowly to the microphone and, with a
slight grin, responded: ``Do you want a list of reasons?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's press secretary, Kiki Moore, responded to Moynihan's
statement by playing down the clout of the four-term senator, who
is retiring at the end of next year. ``I'm sure that President Bob
Kerrey appreciated his support in 1992,'' Ms. Moore said, referring
to the Nebraska senator's short-lived campaign that year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given Moynihan's stature in New York and the nation, the
endorsement seems likely to lend additional legitimacy to Bradley's
campaign, allowing the former senator from New Jersey to present
himself as less of a long shot and more of a mainstream alternative
to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And although Gore continues to enjoy the support of a large
number of elected officials in New York, the loss of Moynihan was
clearly an unwelcome blow. It suggested that Gore could no longer
assume an easy victory in a state that had strongly supported
President Clinton and that Gore's aides had once virtually taken
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Moynihan's announcement, Gore's New York
office in recent days had been issuing news releases containing the
names of New York Democrats who have endorsed Gore, like the New
York state comptroller, H. Carl McCall. Gore also enjoys a lopsided
advantage in endorsements from elected officials across the nation,
reflecting the institutional advantage he enjoys as a sitting vice
president. In addition, New York's other senator, Charles Schumer,
is likely to endorse Gore, one of Schumer's associates said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore sought on Thursday to argue both that Gore's campaign
was in strong shape and that Bradley should be considered the
favorite in New York's primary, scheduled for March 7, because he
is from neighboring New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is also well-known in the state as a former member of
the New York Knicks basketball team..
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, we are in great shape up there,'' Ms. Moore said.
``And that is not an easy thing to do when you're playing in Bill
Bradley's own back yard. There is a favorite-son factor up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, who is 72, has always been an unpredictable if
beguiling figure in national politics. His appearance with Bradley
at Thursday's packed news conference seems likely to reinforce that
persona, as he went from lecturing his audience about the history
of presidential elections to parrying questions about the politics
of his own time.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Moynihan quickly responded to a question about how he
might campaign, simultaneously, on behalf of both Bradley in his
presidential race and Hillary Rodham Clinton in her expected bid to
succeed Moynihan in the Senate. Mrs. Clinton, like her husband, is
firmly backing Gore, a point she reiterated while campaigning in
the Bronx on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she can be elected senator,'' Moynihan said,
explaining how he thought she differed from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley chose to respond to this one, once the laughter died
down: ``Now you see why he gets on TV and I don't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moynihan invoked the eighth president of the United States in
explaining why he concluded that Gore could not win. ``I think we'd
have to go back to Van Buren to find a vice president who succeeded
to the Presidency,'' Mr. Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   At that, there were shouts of ``Bush'' _ as in George Herbert
Walker Bush, who succeeded Ronald Reagan to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``And George Bush,'' Moynihan said, without skipping a beat.
``Van Buren and Bush. It's a rare and unusual event, and many
people say, people say that George Bush, who is a wonderful man,
really got Ronald Reagan's third term.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his concern about Gore's ability to win the
presidential election, Moynihan pointed to a recent Wall Street
Journal/ABC poll showing the strength of the Republican
frontrunner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in a head-to-head
confrontation with Gore. ``It's becoming very clear,'' Moynihan
said. ``The distance behind George W. Bush is now 19 points. But I
don't want to get into those details.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man with heart and courage and stamina,'' Moynihan
said of Bradley. ``You can't govern, as Woodrow Wilson envisioned,
without those qualities. He has shown them.'' &QL;

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Friday morning will be electrifying at The
Country Club, for those who can't wait for the Ryder Cup to begin,
and for those who can't wait to see Tiger Woods versus Sergio
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The 33rd Ryder Cup matches between the United States and Europe
will start with a bang, when a foursome match featuring Woods and
Garcia highlights the first morning of competition. After weeks of
speculation, the U.S. captain, Ben Crenshaw, and the European
captain, Mark James, finally announced their opening pairings
Thursday afternoon. And when word got out that Woods and Garcia
would face each other in a foursome match, the excitement spread
around the course like a brushfire on a windy day.
</P>
<P>
   The pairings for Friday's foursome matches: David Duval and Phil
Mickelson (United States) vs. Paul Lawrie and Colin Montgomerie;
Tom Lehman and Woods (United States) vs. Garcia and Jesper
Parnevik; Davis Love III and Payne Stewart (United States) vs.
Padraig Harrington and Miguel Angel Jimenez; and Jeff Maggert and
Hal Sutton (United States) vs. Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   In foursome, or alternate shot, teammates play one ball and take
alternate shots, so the expected gallery of at least 30,000 on
Friday will not witness a one-on-one duel between Woods and Garcia.
Having the two of them in in the same match, however, creates the
possibility of more memorable shot-making, the kind of riveting
theater they provided at the PGA Championship in August, when Woods
held off a hard-charging Garcia to win by one stroke in one of the
season's special moments.
</P>
<P>
   Even other players could hardly wait to see them in the same
foursome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that's a nice one for the fans,'' said Lehman, who
was surprised to be paired with Woods. ``Even though it's a team
format, Sergio and Tiger going at it is a golf fan's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woods-Garcia meeting happened by chance. Neither captain
knows whom the other captain will play, or in what order. After
both captains make their pairings, their selections are announced,
and everyone finds out who their opponents will be. When Thursday's
selections were revealed, Crenshaw smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark James and I met down by the skating pond on No. 3 and
worked this out for y'all,'' Crenshaw said, joking. ``The envelope
came out and the pairing came out, and everybody just kind of shook
their head. It should provide people with excitement the first day.
I think the process of how you submit your team simultaneously is a
good one. It adds to uncertainty. It's part of the agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw and his players hope to end the agony of the United
States in this biennial event, which was won by Europe in 1995 and
1997. Just as they were in the two most recent Ryder Cups, the
Europeans are decided underdogs. But just as they were in 1995 and
1997, the Europeans are confident they can shock the world, and
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are strong, but we are strong, too,'' said Garcia, a
phenomenal 19-year-old talent from Spain, who would give Europe an
early emotional boost if he earns a point in his first match.
``Even if we don't start well, we have to believe in ourselves, and
believe we can beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   While recent Ryder Cups have not been decided until late Sunday
afternoon, the early matches can help set the tone. Europe has
dominated the alternate shot format during the last three Ryder
Cups, holding a 15-9 edge. Alternate shot is perhaps the most
difficult format, because players who hit errant shots leave their
teammates in awkward and sometimes unfamiliar positions. Some
players find it difficult to find a rhythm hitting only every other
shot, and teammates who use different brands of golf balls must
decide which brand to use, leaving one player hitting an unfamiliar
ball. Meanwhile, teammates must also decide which player will tee
off on odd holes, and which will tee off on even holes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the American pairings seem natural. Duval and Mickelson
are friends and long hitters with similar games. Love and Stewart
should be an interesting combination, Love's power teamed with
Stewart's creative short game and solid putting. Maggert and Sutton
are the U.S. team's most accurate drivers. The most unexpected
pairing on the American side was Crenshaw's decision to put Woods,
the Ryder Cup's longest hitter, with Lehman, who is a solid iron
player but doesn't come close to Woods' length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, quite frankly, somewhat surprised,'' Lehman said of
playing with Woods. ``I hadn't played with Tiger at all in practice
rounds. I thought I'd probably be paired with Davis or Phil, and
voila, Tiger. We played together today to get more acquainted.
Anytime you're playing with the best player in the world, it gives
you a lot of confidence, so I feel pretty good about our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his match against Garcia, Woods said: ``It's not
one-on-one. It's alternate shot and you only hit half the shots. I
know they want to see us play head-to-head, but we have to rely on
our partners. I can't wait. I know my experience from the last
Ryder Cup is going to help me deal with the nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamwork has been a strong suit of previous European teams, and
James hoped that would continue. Montgomerie and Lawrie practiced
together all this week, Clarke and Westwood are close friends, and
earlier in the week Garcia and Parnevik told James they wanted to
play together.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's surprise pairing is Harrington and Jimenez, two Ryder
Cup rookies. James originally wanted to pair Jimenez with Jose
Maria Olazabal, but Olazabal has been struggling with his game,
particularly his driving. He didn't feel ready, and he told James
that Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, the two-time Masters champion, is Europe's most
experienced Ryder Cup player, and if he does not straighten out his
game quickly, it will hurt Europe's chances. In five previous Ryder
Cups, Olazabal had never sat out a match, compiling an impressive
14-8-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't ready,'' Sam Torrance, Europe's assistant captain,
said when asked about Olazabal. ``He's a strong man. He told Mark,
`I'm not quite ready for foursomes.' I think that's awesome he
would do that. That's being honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw decided not to play Justin Leonard, Mark O'Meara, Jim
Furyk, and Steve Pate on Friday morning, and James bypassed
Olazabal and three Ryder Cup rookies, Andrew Coltart, Jean Van de
Velde and Jarmo Sandelin.
</P>
<P>
   But all 12 players on both sides will have similar feelings
Friday morning. They will be nervous. They will be excited. But
after all the buildup and anticipation, they will finally be able
to start the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here long enough practicing,'' Sutton said. ``It's
time to get this thing under way.''

33RD RYDER GETS UNDER WAY WITH CROWD-PLEASING PAIRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Gentlemen, play away please. The call to arms
for the 33d Ryder Cup Matches that begin 7:30 a.m. at The Country
Club was sounded with the pairings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There were surprises, a few occasions to raise eyebrows, and the
crowd-pleasing revelation that Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia will
be out there in the second foursome. It's the tinsel; the pure
head-to-head can't happen until Sunday's singles.
</P>
<P>
   The popular view that already had teamed World No. 1 Woods and
World No. 2 David Duval was incorrect. Team captain Ben Crenshaw
chose Duval-Phil Mickelson to lead off for the US as it attempts to
win this competition for the first time since the matches on Kiawah
Island in 1991, and Europe's leadoff team will be Colin Montgomerie
and Paul Lawrie. The only one of the four to win one of the game's
four major championships is Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the Ryder Cup tweaks the imagination. Lawrie
finished birdie/birdie in the four-hole playoff with Justin Leonard
and Jean Van de Velde at the British Open at Carnoustie this past
July. Neither Leonard nor Van de Velde are playing in the morning _
perhaps they will in the afternoon four-ball matches. The
major-event winner sitting out the morning is Masters champion Jose
Maria Olazabal, whose game has been subpar of late, which would be
a detriment in alternate-shot play.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the lineup: Garcia and Jesper Parnevik will team up
against Woods and Tom Lehman; Miguel Angel Jimenez and Padraig
Harrington will go against Davis Love III and Payne Steward; and
Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke square off against Jeff Maggert and
Hal Sutton, who will be participating in his first Ryder Cup in a
dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team I have is a solid one,'' said Crenshaw. ``I
said yesterday a lot of our guys are playing well, so I thought
that it made the process slightly more difficult in trying to find
a combination. These conclusions were reached, and we feel good
about them. They seem fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   The major European surprise was Harrington instead of Olazabal.
European captain Mark James said Olazabal felt he needed another
morning to work on his game, and he felt Harrington was on a high.
``He's in this position because he got a couple of seconds in the
last minute to get onto the team,'' said James. ``He's played
extremely well since and he's played extremely well in practice. I
made the decision yesterday to put him in if Ollie was not 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw left out Mark O'Meara, Jim Furyk, Justin Leonard, and
Steve Pate. James bypassed Olazabal, Van de Velde, captain's
selection Andrew Coltart of Scotland and Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin.
``These guys were happy playing together at the start of the
week,'' said James, ``and they've reacted well together. They're
feeling good, and I saw no reason to split them up for the first
morning. I know what it's like the first morning. Someone doesn't
play well and things change and you get swept along in a sort of an
unstoppable river.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternate shot format is fun in and of itself. You let Tiger
tee it up, then put an iron in Lehman's hands. You let Garcia tee
it up, and Parnevik goes next. Or visa versa. ``It's exciting to
think about driving two greens (Nos. 4 and 6) in the first nine
with a certain breeze,'' said Crenshaw. ``People on both sides
possess the power to get those two. It's a player's decision. I'd
give them input, but they're the one with the clubs.''

<P>
   The players have seen a variety of weather since their arrival
early in the week, and the latest forecast is for warm temperatures
and sunny skies. The first day can be a tipoff for the second two.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Europeans braved wild morning weather at
Valderrama that forced some matches to be carried over to the next
morning and eventually forged a 10 1/2-5 1/2 edge entering Sunday's
singles. Even though the US made a solid bid to claw its way back
into the hunt, Europe won, 14 1/2-13 1/2. The Europeans are 4-2-1
in the last seven Ryder Cup matches, but are generally given little
chance against a US team that simply seems the stronger and more
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   If you were betting, you'd probably go with Lehman-Woods against
Garcia-Parnevik and Love-Stewart against Jimenez-Harrington. The
team of Westwood-Clarke seems stronger than Maggert-Sutton. So it
comes down to the opener. Can the Scots beat Duval/Mickelson? Even
though the crowd may choose to follow the match that goes second,
the opener should provide the key to the morning's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it's worked out, I will play the odd holes, so I'll
hit the first shot in the Ryder Cup,'' said Lawrie. ``I'm sure it
will be nerve-wracking. I know I'll be nervous, but I've dreamed of
this for a long time and can't wait to get started.'' Tiger vs.
Sergio? ``It's not one-on-one,'' said Woods. ``It's alternate shot,
and you only hit half the shots. It's not what the media is
speculating. I know they want to see us play head-to-head, but it's
not necessarily head-to-head. We have to rely directly on our
partners.''

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The recent hoopla over the anniversary
of the Apollo moon landing failed to mention Michael Light's ``Full
Moon,'' a stunning coffee-table book from Knopf ($50) made up of
previously unpublished NASA photographs.
</P>
<P>
   There is documentation of the cramped quarters, the
extra-vehicular walks, and plentiful coverage of Earth and the
moon, including some glorious panoramic fold-out shots that picture
the red and blue of the American flag on the side of the lunar
module and the gold foil on the landing arms in the foreground,
with the middle distance and background eerily capturing the moon's
surface as denatured gray.
</P>
<P>
   It looks colorized, but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   This is a book for the astronomy or space buff, or anybody who
revels in the beautiful and strange.
</P>
<P>
   For All the People Who Think This Job Is Easy ...
</P>
<P>
   I am currently in possession of two books embodying an idiocy
that approaches the pristine. One carries the title ``How to Wash
Your Face,'' about skin care. Under ordinary circumstances, it
would be hard to beat. But ``How to Have Sex in the Woods'' is the
real triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Initially I thought it was a charming metaphorical volume about
nature appreciation. But no, it turns out to be literal, all about
the ever-present danger of nettles, the proper etiquette of
fornicating in front of others (always ask permission) and the whys
and wherefores of ejaculating in a natural hot spring. It even
offers haiku (``Sex in a pup tent/Condensation drips slowly/Water
in my eyes.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's not the sex in the woods I object to, it's the idea that
people would have to buy a book to figure out how to do it.
Somewhere, in some poor writer's drawer, is a good novel that can't
get published, but ``How to Have Sex in the Woods'' exists.
</P>
<P>
   Do It Yourself ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Self-Publishing Handbook'' (Plume, $13.95) offers
good advice about new wrinkles in vanity publishing. With the
advent of the PC, it's easier and cheaper than it ever was to
design and publish your own book, but the problem is still
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Most critics _ including this one _ shy away from self-published
books, because nobody except your family cares about your 60 years
in the garment trade. Commercial publishers, of course, have better
things to put out _ ``How to Have Sex in the Woods,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Quote Unquote ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a
club.''

BRITISH PAPER'S STING NETS AN EARL AND A SCOLDING FROM A JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a harsh challenge to a news-gathering technique used
by some British newspapers, a judge criticized a paper on Wednesday
for allowing two of its reporters to dress up as rich Arabs,
pretend to want to buy motor scooters from a peer, and then ply him
with expensive food and alcohol until he sold them cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   After its elaborate sting left the peer, the 10th Earl of
Hardwicke, drunkenly snorting cocaine through a five pound note
while boasting about how he could get some any time, The News of
the World ran a full report, plus pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The Earl was arrested and on Wednesday a jury convicted him of
selling drugs, but sent a highly unusual note to the judge, Timothy
Pontius, saying that, in its opinion, Lord Hardwicke, 29, sold the
drugs only under ``extreme provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge let the verdict stand, but ruled that Lord Hardwicke
and Stefan Thwaites, his partner in a scooter business, would not
be sentenced to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists in general, and those involved in this case in
particular, should carefully examine and consider their approach to
investigations where it involves no police participation,'' the
judge said. ``I have concluded with some degree of hesitation that
the circumstances are, by virtue of the jury's clearly stated
views, so exceptional that I am justified in suspending the
operation of the prison sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men faced up to four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters for Britain's more sensationalist papers are often
called on to use any means necessary, including lying and
installing wiretaps and hidden cameras, to get their articles.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists were not charged in connection with buying the
drugs and rarely are in these cases, in which they often share
their information with the police.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a huge embarrassment for the Murdoch-owned News
of the World, a Sunday newspaper that often sets up elaborate scams
intended to catch sports figures, aristocrats and various minor
celebrities in compromising situations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, victims of the papers' efforts have included
the captain of the English national rugby team and the sons of
Camilla Parker Bowles, Prince Charles' girlfriend, and Jack Straw,
the British home secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Mazher Mahmood, investigations editor of The News of the World,
masterminded the trap. Posing as ``Harry Khan'' and saying he was
interested in buying 50 scooters, Mahmood invited the pair to the
Savoy hotel, where they met him and ``Sheik Mohammed,'' actually
another reporter, for a $1,200 meal that included martinis,
Champagne and brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Suitably relaxed, the four then repaired to a suite in the
hotel, where Lord Hardwicke and Thwaites were captured on a
concealed video camera arranging for cocaine to be delivered to the
hotel, and then selling $320 worth to the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to have the biggest line I have had in my life,''
Lord Hardwicke said on the tape, referring to the drugs, ``and then
I am going to be sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the paper reported, Lord Hardwicke gave Mahmood,
still in his costume, a tour of the House of Lords, and then sold
him $200 worth of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the judge's remarks, The News of the World said it
stood behind its investigative techniques and was simply trying to
stop drug trafficking. In a statement, the paper said it had ``no
hesitation in investigating and exposing ruthless and habitual drug
peddlers.''

JACOBS SWINGS IN TO STRAIGHTEN OLAZABAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ For four days, they have been inseparable,
searching for answers, cramming for a final exam.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, it became official: Jose Maria Olazabal and John
Jacobs had not completed their homework. Thus, for the first time
in his brilliant Ryder Cup career, the proud Olazabal will sit out
a match. His almost-certain partner, Miguel Angel Jimenez, will go
out in foursomes with Padraig Harrington, a decision made not by
captain Mark James but by Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning Masters champion had gone to James at last week's
Trophee Lancome in Paris and promised: ``If I'm not playing well, I
will take myself out of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he kept his promise.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple problem with a most difficult solution. Olazabal,
never the purest of drivers, continues to struggle off the tee.
Mission Impossible? Perhaps not, but close enough to call in the
man they affectionately call Dr. Golf in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him well, know his game,'' said Jacobs. And he should.
The gentlemanly Englishman was for 28 years the Spanish National
Coach. It was in that capacity that he met in 1980 a young boy of
14, a son of a greenkeeper who could work magic with a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   Though they went their separate ways _ Olazabal to professional
stardom, Jacobs to wherever he could lend his wisdom to young
European golfers _ they have never really been apart. Always,
Jacobs would find a way to Olazabal's side if there were a reason.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that they met up at the British Open at Carnoustie in
July and Jacobs knew right away that it was serious. ``I
congratulated him on his Masters victory and he said, `John, it was
an oasis in the desert.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs shook his head, but wasn't surprised. ``He tries to be
too perfect. He's so hard on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The European PGA Tour exists in large part because of Jacobs, a
revered figure across the pond, and forever he will be a part of
these Ryder Cup festivities. He is the father of the European PGA
Tour, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my, no. Grandfather, perhaps,'' and the 74-year-old Jacobs
let out a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But this competition is serious stuff, so he offered his
services. He went to Olazabal's manager a few weeks ago and asked
what he could do. He was told that Olazabal didn't need a swing
coach, he needed a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, thought Jacobs, and he went to James. Back in 1979,
the first year that Europeans were brought into the Ryder Cup,
Jacobs drew the assignment of bringing Brits and Europeans
together, a volatile situation he calmed. James was on that team
and two years later, Jacobs was again captain and he named James to
his team. They are friends and on the same page, so it was no
surprise that James thought it a good idea to have Jacobs by
Olazabal's side at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs is determined to turn this thing around for Olazabal, who
is struggling like a rookie. Since winning his second green jacket
in April, missed cuts have been the norm, under-par rounds the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the celebrated injury at the US Open, when
Olazabal, angered by an opening 75, punched a wall and broke his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   All of it too much for Jacobs to sit and watch, so since Monday
he has been at Olazabal's side, on the range and on the course.
``We are really great friends,'' said Jacobs, ``but we fight like
tigers when I'm teaching him. (Driving) is the only part of his
game that is missing. The rest is wonderful. To me, I feel a real
responsibility if I can possibly get him good with the driver
because he's crucial to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, that is a point that cannot be argued, for while
Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood are perhaps 1 and 1A on this
team, talent-wise, it is Olazabal who embodies the spirit. He was
nurtured by Seve Ballesteros, with whom he was so closely
associated with. Five times Olazabal has been on a Ryder Cup team
(he qualified in 1995 but had to withdraw with an injury), five
times he has played in all five matches.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen this time around, which is not to say that
Olazabal is out of the picture. ``If he's on form, he could have a
great match and I think that might be just the difference,'' said
Jacobs, who has had Olazabal hitting driver ``off the floor,'' that
is, without a tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's to get him opened up here,'' and Jacobs demonstrated
the hip movement he wanted to see, in synch with the swing. ``He
will get in his own way.''
</P>
<P>
   He will stay on the practice range, too, hitting driver after
driver after driver, many of them screaming out there low, far, and
with an effective little draw. It looked so good, Jacobs was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but you see, that's my job, to somehow get him with that
same feeling on the golf course,'' Jacobs said. ``As soon as he
gets on the golf course he hits one bad drive and he starts to rant
and rave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too hard on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But he is professional enough to have made it easy on
his team captain.

SPORTS COLUMN: FRESH AMERICAN HISTORY ON HALLOWED GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ With the Ryder Cup matches not far from where
Paul Revere rode, the U.S. golfers should have a historical
home-course advantage. This is where America teed off. British tea
was dumped into the Boston harbor. Lexington and Concord are just
down the road. So is Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And at the dog leg of the 17th hole at The County Club, the
``Vardon bunker'' is where America's golf history turned.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1913 U.S. Open playoff, Harry Vardon, an Englishman who
was the most renowned golfer of that era, pulled his tee shot into
the sand in that bunker. Moments later, Francis Ouimet, a skinny
20-year-old amateur who lived on Clyde Street near the 17th green,
holed an 18-foot birdie putt for a three-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ouimet, a gardener's son who had caddied here as a youngster for
28 cents a round, won that Open and put golf on Page 1 one of
newspapers all over America.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, golf was no longer a game dominated by English and
Scottish pros: An American had won the Open in that playoff with
Vardon, a six-time British Open champion who also won the 1900 U.S.
Open, and another Englishman, Ted Ray, the big hitter of his time.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Ryder Cup matches begin Friday, nearly a century
later, Tiger Woods, David Duval and 10 other Americans will be
trying to do, in a sense, what Francis Ouimet did _ end Europe's
overlapping grip in the biennial competition.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first 25 Cup matches, the Americans lost only three,
mostly against teams from Great Britain, before golfers from
continental Europe were included in 1979. But since 1985, with the
emergence of Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo, the Europeans have
won five of seven matches, including those at Oak Hill outside
Rochester, N.Y., in 1995 and at Valderrama in Spain in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Ben Crenshaw, the American captain who thrives on
golf tradition, is on a crusade to win, especially here at The
Country Club where Ouimet won. The guess here is that it will be
America's cup of tee, 16-12. If it isn't, it will be the biggest
upset in Ryder Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is in the Americans' favor _ the course, the crowd
and, more than anything else, their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have won a total of 11 major titles, the Europeans
only three. In the world rankings, the Americans rank from No. 1
(Woods), No. 2 (Duval) and No. 4 (Davis Love III) to No. 28 (Steve
Pate); the Europeans rank all the way from No. 3 (Colin
Montgomerie) and No. 5 (Lee Westwood) to No. 89 (Jean Van de Velde,
who will forever be remembered for losing this year's British Open
with a triple-bogey 7 at the 72nd hole).
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have only one Ryder Cup rookie, Duval; the
Europeans have seven, notably the 19-year-old Spanish prodigy,
Sergio Garcia, the runner-up to Woods in the recent Professional
Golfers' Association Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans no longer have the pros who returned the Cup in
recent years to where it was initiated in 1927 by Samuel Ryder, a
British seed merchant. Ballesteros, their spiritual leader of those
triumphs and the 1997 captain, is absent. So are Faldo, Ian
Woosnam, Sandy Lyle and, surprisingly to many European critics,
Bernhard Langer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Langer is No. 44 on the world ranking, Mark James, the
European captain, chose Andrew Coltart, No. 66, rather than the
two-time Masters champion.
</P>
<P>
   For the pros, rankings and reputations are determined by stroke
play over 72 holes, not hole-by-hole match play. But Friday and
Saturday before Sunday's 12-singles showdown, the cup format
involves two-man teams in four alternate-shot matches in the
morning and four better-ball matches in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In other recent cup matches, European golfers such as Westwood,
Parnevik, Costantino Rocca, David Gilford, Paul Broadhurst, Per
Ulrick Johansson and Philip Walton _ then virtually unknown _
contributed to their cup triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure, which is unlike that in any other golf event,
seems to have affected the celebrated best Americans more than the
young Europeans with no reputation to lose. Woods, Love and Justin
Leonard, for example, were a combined 1-9-3 in their Valderrama
matches; Woods lost to Rocca in singles, 4 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   But the American golfers seem to have put aside the August
controversy over their request for payments from the PGA of America
that they would donate to their personal charities, as they did
with $100,000 each after last year's President's Cup matches in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Each golfer's pride in his game is more important to him than
each's pride in charitable donations. But as a patriotic reminder,
Payne Stewart, the U.S. Open champion, will turn up the sound at
the team's downtown hotel on his theme song for these Ryder Cup
matches _ Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it's close, maybe some of the Europeans will hit their
drives into the Vardon bunker.

STEWART-LOVE COMBO HARD TO TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ In terms of pedigree, it's no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart and Davis Love are two of America's most
accomplished golfers. Between them, they own 24 PGA Tour victories,
four major championships, and seven Ryder Cup caps.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one area in which their opponents outshine them.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Were they not traveling with the European team and wearing the
same uniforms as their colleagues, Miguel Angel Jimenez and Padraig
Harrington undoubtedly would be denied access to The Country Club
grounds. Between them, they own six European PGA Tour victories,
nary a whiff of a major championship, and one Ryder Cup footnote:
Jimenez was an assistant to his Spanish pal, European captain Seve
Ballesteros, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But they'll be in the spotlight Friday _ if the marshals let
them on the first tee without identification tags. Their union
basically is the product of necessity. The duo was supposed to
feature a headliner _ Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal. Captain
Mark James essentially had settled on his pairings at the start of
the week, and the plan was to put the two Spaniards together. But
Olazabal's game still hasn't fully recovered from the
self-inflicted broken hand he suffered in June when he punched a
wall in his hotel room after a poor first round of the US Open. He
informed James that he didn't feel ready for this morning.
</P>
<P>
   So James essentially employed Olazabal as a de facto assistant
even as he was playing his final practice round Thursday. His
assignment: to determine if Harrington was ready to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paired him with Padraig in the same four-ball today,'' James
said, ``so that Jose Maria could see that if he actually didn't
play, someone who's playing very well was going to take his
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal's report was favorable, but Dubliner Harrington and
Jimenez, who speaks halting English, already were in sync. No
matter what language they employed, they somehow read James's and
Olazabal's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, they started using each other's balls before I even
told them,'' said James. ``I guess Ollie must have tipped them, the
wink, and they were already prepared when I spoke to Ollie and
spoke to them.''
</P>
<P>
   They discovered they're compatible and hope to show the world
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Padraig and I played together the last two days,'' said
Jimenez, ``and it worked very well. We are both hitting the ball
solid. I think we will make a good partnership. Stewart and Love
have won major championships and have to be respected, but we
believe in ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful the unitiated do. Stewart and Love have the
marquee value, and something else that should serve them in good
stead in match play _ perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart experienced a drought that relegated him to spectator
status in the last two biennial Ryder matches after he'd made the
previous four teams. But he's come back with a bang this year,
winning his second US Open to complement his 1989 PGA Championship,
and he's considered the heart and soul of this aggregation. ``I'm
enthusiastic,'' he said. ``I will be enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Love was discouraged about his chances of being
here. The 1997 PGA champion easily qualified for his fourth Ryder
berth. But a pinched nerve that affected his neck and shoulder area
last month forced him to miss two tournaments on doctor's orders.
But so committed was Love to being at TCC that he even eschewed his
beloved fishing to expedite his recovery. And here he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go,'' he said. ``I'm hitting the ball good. It's
a matter of can I get it done in the matches.''

 &HT;    Braves up 4 after sweep
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New Yorker nightmares should go something like this:
Chipper Jones turning his hips, connecting sweet part of bat to
ball and peering deep into the abyss ... in slow motion, over and
over ... to a backdrop of Turner Field fans chopping and chanting
``Sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the light of day Thursday and their first lead in a
game in this series could jolt the Mets out of the submission
they've been pounded into by Jones and the Braves for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's 6-3 Braves win, giving Atlanta a four-game lead in
the NL East with nine games to play, was just the latest answer to
the team's first September challenge in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did their own version of a pennant race by rushing out
of town, and can only hope for some sort of redemption next week
when they host the Braves in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our butt kicked,'' Mets catcher Mike Piazza said.
``Don't think there's any way you can sugarcoat it. We got
outplayed, outpitched, outhit, and outdefensed.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting beat 2-1 on two Chipper Jones homers Tuesday
night, the Mets tried to at least match him Wednesday night with
Piazza's two-run homer but still lost 5-2. On Thursday they tried
pitching around Jones in the first inning, but Andruw Jones came up
with an RBI single behind him. They tried pitching to him in the
fifth inning, but Jones launched a three-run homer off Al Leiter
for the go-ahead runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a sense like you can do no wrong at the plate,''
Chipper Jones said. ``No other way to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was 4-for-9 this series, driving in seven of the Braves'
13 runs. All four hits were home runs. His last gave him 45 for the
season, the most by a Brave since Hank Aaron went deep 47 times in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to watch,'' said Thursday's pitching beneficiary,
Greg Maddux, who earned his 19th win. ``I don't think there's any
question, he's pretty much carried us these three games. We just
kind of jumped on his back and let him take us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is hitting .448 against the Mets this season, including
seven homers. He's a major reason why the Braves lead the Mets 7-2
in the nine games they've played this season and ave won all three
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pretty even series except for him,'' Mets third
baseman Matt Franco said. ``We might still be playing all three
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had held relatively strong for two days but by Thursday
began to crumble, losing for the 13th time in their 14 games at
Turner Field and reminding Mets fans of their final three-game
meltdown last year in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The best infield in baseball gave up two unearned runs. The
second-best hitting team in the NL was outhit 13-7. John Rocker
walked consecutive batters in the ninth inning but pulled out his
third save in three games to give him 36, three shy of the Braves
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the guys started to sense it, we wanted to go out and
finish the deal,'' Chipper Jones said.

WHITE HOUSE REPRIMANDS DRUG MAKERS FOR CRITICISM OF CLINTON PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration summoned six drug
company executives to the White House this week and reprimanded
them for running advertisements critical of President Clinton's
plan to offer prescription drug benefits to everyone on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisements, ``Flo,'' an arthritic Medicare
beneficiary, suggests that Clinton's plan would limit the ability
of doctors and patients to select the best medicines. The ads
recall a scathing debate that occurred in 1993 and 1994, when the
insurance industry conducted an advertising campaign to kill
Clinton's plan for universal health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new ads presents a chart saying that Clinton's latest
proposals would allow ``government bureaucrats'' to influence the
choice of medicines, ``chill promising research with bureaucracy or
price controls'' and ``displace seniors' existing private coverage
with a big government-run plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, the president's health policy
coordinator, Chris Jennings, said: ``These ads are false,
misleading, inaccurate, unfair and destructive. Also absurd and
ridiculous. Any time we talk to the pharmaceutical industry, we
critique these ads. We relay our dismay. We also encourage the drug
companies to re-engage in a more constructive manner and address
the real problems of seniors and people with disabilities who need
drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The six companies that sent representatives to the meeting on
Tuesday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House were Genentech,
Genzyme, Eli Lilly, Merck, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn and Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed these companies
might be more cooperative than other members of the industry's
trade association, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The association agrees that all Medicare beneficiaries should
have access to prescription medicines, but its members do not agree
on how to achieve that goal. The group has budgeted $20 million to
$30 million for advertising and advocacy on Medicare drug coverage,
and it helped set up a coalition known &UR; cs Citizens for Better
Medicare, the sponsor of the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Alixe Glen Mattingly, senior vice president of the drug
companies' trade association, said, ``We don't feel the
pharmaceutical industry or Citizens for Better Medicare have
misrepresented the facts at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Ryan, executive director of Citizens for Better
Medicare, said, ``The advertisements are fair and accurate, and the
debate is just getting under way.'' In future advertisements, he
said, the coalition will cite research to buttress its criticism of
the president's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the six companies said they would not respond
publicly to the White House criticism. ``We would all like to avoid
Armageddon,'' said a drug company executive. ``We're smart enough
to know that if we go to war with the administration, both sides
will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several people who attended the White House meeting said the
administration appeared to be trying to split the industry. In the
interview Thursday, Jennings asserted that ``there's a split in the
industry right now,'' with some companies more eager than others to
plug a gaping hole in coverage for millions of Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the meeting this week included Jennings; Lawrence
Stein, director of legislative affairs at the White House; Joel
Johnson, a senior policy adviser to the president; Daniel
Mendelson, a top budget official, and David Beier, the chief
domestic policy adviser to Vice President Al Gore. From 1989 to
1998, Beier was a vice president in the Washington office of
Genentech, the biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The original fee-for-service Medicare program generally does not
pay for prescription drugs outside the hospital. Sixteen percent of
the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are in health maintenance
organizations, and many of these HMOs are cutting drug benefits or
requiring the elderly to pay more for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials run by the insurance industry in 1993 featured a
couple, ``Harry and Louise,'' fretting over Clinton's proposal to
guarantee comprehensive coverage for Americans of all ages. In one
commercial, an announcer said, ``The government may force us to
pick from a few health plans designed by government bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a commercial criticizing Clinton's drug proposal for the
elderly, Flo says, ``The White House plan puts bureaucrats in
charge of our medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Bill and Hillary Clinton lashed out at the insurance
industry, saying its commercials were filled with lies. As a
result, the commercials got even more attention. The White House is
pursuing a quieter strategy this year, but has not ruled out a
direct assault on its critics.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials dispute Flo's contention that Clinton's
plan would limit her choice of medicines. Under the proposal,
Jennings said, the government would hire private companies to
manage pharmacy benefits for Medicare. These companies would
establish lists of recommended drugs, but patients could get other
drugs if a doctor certified they were medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies said there would not be true competition because
Medicare would designate only one company to manage benefits in
each region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they were outraged by the ads'
suggestion that Clinton wanted price controls. Under the
president's proposal, the government would not set prices, but
Medicare beneficiaries would be entitled to substantial discounts
on prescriptions. The discounts would be set through negotiations
between drug makers and the pharmacy benefit managers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one advertisement, Flo says that she and millions of other
Medicare beneficiaries already have drug coverage through retiree
health plans. A study issued this week by Citizens for Better
Medicare says Clinton's plan would encourage employers to drop such
coverage, ``forcing 6 million to 9 million seniors into a
government-run plan with less choice'' and fewer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say the industry is just trying to scare
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a multibillion-dollar initiative to encourage
employers to maintain their drug plans,'' Jennings said.

HOUSE GOP ON CREATIVE ACCOUNTING SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Calif., N.Y., Ill.) (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Creative accounting by Congress reached new heights
Thursday as House Republican leaders, desperately seeking money for
their spending bills, used budgetary devices to manufacture nearly
$17 billion out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   First they ordered appropriators to tap $12.7 billion from the
budget for the year after next, the 2001 fiscal year. Then they
declared $1.1 billion for a long-established program to help the
poor pay their heating bills as an unforeseen ``emergency,'' taking
the money off the official ledger.
</P>
<P>
   And then, apparently breaking a pledge made by the former
speaker, Newt Gingrich, they moved to rescind $3 billion in welfare
funds for state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were part of a plan to help finance a bill for labor,
education, health and human services programs that nonetheless cuts
or eliminates so many health and education programs that President
Clinton vowed Thursday night to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership's effort to take back welfare money provoked
protests from the nation's governors, Republicans and Democrats
alike. They issued a statement calling it ``a drastic departure''
from a deal between Congress and the states.
</P>
<P>
   That deal, sealed by Gingrich in a letter on June 5, 1998,
pledged that the Republican Congress would not touch the welfare
money, known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. ``I gave
you my word that TANF funding will be guaranteed for five years,''
Gingrich said. ``Rest assured that I will stand by that
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been talk in Congress last year of a similar plan to
tap into the states' welfare coffers, and Gingrich's letter sought
to quell the governors' suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the National Governors' Association, Gov.
Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a Republican, said the current
Republican leadership in Congress had privately assured the
governors that Gingrich's word was still good. ``We took them at
their word and still hope they'll maintain the integrity of their
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss would be temporary, Republican leaders say. They
promised to replace the funds in the 2001 fiscal year. ``It's just
a temporary relocation,'' said John P. Feehery, a spokesman for
Speaker Dennis Hastert. ``They'll get the money back.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has completed work on only four of its 13 spending
bills. It appears certain to fail to complete them, with one week
left until the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is on track to drain a projected $14 billion
surplus for the 2000 fiscal year and to break the spending caps it
imposed on itself. It looks increasingly likely to tap into surplus
Social Security payments to finance its spending bills, something
the Republican leadership has said repeatedly that it will not do.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' deepening dilemma was apparent in the moves to
borrow heavily from the 2001 budget, to declare a 24-year-old
home-heating program an unforeseeable emergency, and to try to take
back the welfare money.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has used borrowing from future years, a process called
forward funding, in the past. But it has never used more than $12
billion in a single year for all government programs combined, let
alone a single spending bill, the Senate Budget Committee said.
</P>
<P>
   And it has not declared programs like home-heating assistance to
be fiscal emergencies, a category usually reserved for wars and
natural disasters, not the coming of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has it asked the states to give back welfare money. At least
38 states would be affected if the welfare recession becomes law.
New York would lose $508 million in welfare funds in the fiscal
2000 year, and California would lose $417 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $89 billion bill for labor, education and health and human
services was approved Thursday by a House appropriations
subcommittee on a party-line vote, with eight Republicans in favor
and six Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill.,
made it plain that the creative accounting measures to finance the
bill had been dictated by the Republican leadership. ``I work with
what they give me,'' he said. ``Decisions have been made that I'm
not a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   In other legislative action, negotiators from the House and the
Senate worked toward a compromise that would require more flight
tests for the F-22 fighter plane, a $70 billion program, before
allowing the plane to begin production. The House voted to withhold
$1.8 billion to build the first six F-22s; the Senate wanted the
planes built next year.

TIME FOR TALK TO END, GOLF TO BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ We're the bad guys and they're the good guys.
But you already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club is where American golf got its kick start 86
years ago. But you already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   Our captain is passionate and achingly sincere. Their captain is
droll and oft-inscrutable. But you already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   The first team to get to 14 1/2 points wins. You may or may not
have known that.
</P>
<P>
   All week long it's been practice, practice, practice and talk,
talk, talk. The buildup has been at a Super Bowl level, and that's
not a compliment. But that's about to change. At precisely 7:30
this morning, someone will place a little stick of wood in the
ground, place a dimpled ball atop it, whack the ball with a golf
club, and the 33d Ryder Cup Matches will be under way _ finally.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the Ryder Cup took place at The Belfry in Sutton
Coldfield, England, and no one outside the insular golf community
cared. Two years later, Bernhard Langer missed a 6-foot putt at
Kiawah Island that enabled the United States to squeak by the
European team, 14 1/2-13 1/2, and a lot of people took notice. Two
consecutive European victories later, many more people care, and
the fact that the US players have been reduced to lurching after
the Cup like so many Dagwood Bumsteads running after the bus is not
the only reason.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most eagerly anticipated golf confrontation in
history, and part of the reason for the interest will be on display
in the second of this morning's four alternate-shot matches. For by
the blissful and benevolent luck of the draw, Tiger Woods and Tom
Lehman will be paired up with Spanish prodigy Sergio Garcia and
colorful Swede Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   That, friends, is precisely what people wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in this second slot here,'' drawled American captain Ben
Crenshaw, ``(European captain) Mark James and I met down by the
skating pond on No. 3 and worked this out for y'all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger. Sergio. Sergio. Tiger. These are the only two golfers who
can always get by with first names only, and for very good reason.
These young maestros play this game with both startling efficiency
and panache. They have captured the imagination of sports fans in
this country, and not just golf fans.
</P>
<P>
   No one could plan this. With the Sunday singles pairings
strictly subject to a blind draw, there was a better opportunity
for some sort of Tiger-Sergio pairing in the two four-man formats,
where the odds of a lucky matchup are significantly increased. Had
the weekend gone by without these two being matched up in some way,
the event would have suffered. People would have felt emotionally
ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should provide people with excitement the first day,''
gushed an exuberant Crenshaw, the latent fan in him temporarily
muscling aside the sober-faced team captain. ``Lo and behold, here
it came, right out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Less overtly emotional was James. ``I don't attach any
particular significance to those players being in the same group,''
he declared with a Great Stone Face.
</P>
<P>
   This seeming indifference was too much for one British
inquisitor. ``Mark,'' he said, ``we all love you for your deadpan
style and understated style of talking, but do you not share any of
the rest of the golf world's excitement at the thought of Sergio
and Tiger out there together? And don't say no.''
</P>
<P>
   James stared blankly at the assembled scribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think it's extremely exciting,'' he droned, his face a
Mt. Rushmore companion piece.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Mark James won't play along. Perhaps he was asleep on the
sofa at his home in Ilkley, England _ it was, after all, late in
the evening over there _ when Sergio stalked Tiger on the dramatic
back nine at Medinah in last month's PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio's spirited pursuit of the American created an instant
rivalry that has captivated the sports world. ``They are two of the
most exciting people in the world to watch play golf,'' enthused
Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup is only partial. There are, after all, teammates
involved, and very good ones they are. ``It's not one-on-one,''
pointed out Tiger. ``It's alternate shot, and you only hit half the
shots. It's not what the media is speculating.''
</P>
<P>
   The media and fans alike are easier to please than Tiger thinks.
Just the idea that Tiger and Sergio are engaged in direct
competition on the very first morning of this event is enough to
have people springing out of bed eagerly, no matter how ungodly the
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers will downplay the magnitude of this event. We can hear
them now. ``It's only golf,'' they'll growl. ``Golf isn't a sport.
Golf is a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's table the semantics debate for a moment. The indisputable
fact is that in the 10 years since that neglected American victory
at The Belfry, golf has gotten completely democratized. It is no
longer in the primary custody of the elite. Anyone who has been
paying the slightest bit of attention has to know that golf has
become a major blue-collar sport. Major. It is, without question,
the common meeting ground for other professional athletes, most of
whom gaze at the 24 men who are here to engage in this competition
with the same adoring eyes with which your 17-year-daughter ogles
the Back Street Boys. In order to build all the golf courses
necessary to satisfy the tee-time needs of an ever-growing golfing
public, it would be necessary to annex Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Tiger. Young Mr. Woods has had an incalculable
effect on the overall public awareness of golf, and not just among
minorities. Golf is chic, and Tiger Woods is a major reason why.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a spectacular sports year for Greater Boston. It
began in March with the NCAA Basketball Tournament's first and
second rounds and continued with the NHL Draft, Women's World Cup,
Davis Cup, and All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   They were all big. The Ryder Cup is bigger.

be. (John L. Ioven Jr./Boston Globe Photo)

SENATE BACKS CLAUSE TO SAVE COMPANIES ON ROYALTIES FOR OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate narrowly approved a measure Thursday
night that saves oil companies from paying more than $5 million a
month in royalties that the government says they owe to the public.
</P>
<P>
   By a 51-47 vote, the Senate backed an amendment by Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, that blocked the Interior
Department from ordering oil companies to pay royalties based on
the market price of oil. The companies now pay the royalties on oil
taken from federal land at a lower price set by the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Forty Democrats and seven Republicans opposed the measure.
Forty-eight Republicans and five Democrats supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison called the department regulations an unfair tax on oil
companies. Sen. Pete Domenici, a Republican of New Mexico, called
them ``government mooching.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who opposed the
amendment, said the oil companies had ``knowingly and intentionally
cheated the federal government and the American taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some oil companies have been paying the royalty based on a price
they set at $4 or $5 a barrel less than the market price, according
to federal regulators. The Interior Department says energy
companies have been underpaying at least $66 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as the Senate approved a $14 billion spending bill
for the Interior Department. The bill also contains an amendment
that benefits companies seeking to operate large gold mines on
federal land.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has threatened to veto the bill over these
amendments as well as over $1.2 billion in cuts the Senate made
from funds President Clinton requested. The House passed a
different version of the Interior Department spending bill, and the
two measures must now be reconciled in a House-Senate conference.

 &HT;    Getting hooked on collectible books
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Slightly Chipped,'' by Lawrence and
Nancy Goldstone. St. Martin's; 213 pages; $22.95.
</P>
<P>
   The first edition of ``The Sun Also Rises'' was $300. It was a
very fair price, but that wasn't the problem. I was on my
honeymoon, and that $300 was what was going to get me through the
second week of said honeymoon as we rambled through New England.
</P>
<P>
   I held the book, looked through it, read several pages. I
wandered around the store, and returned to page through the book
again. This went on for a half-hour. My new wife suggested I put it
on plastic, but, true Calvinist that I am, I didn't want to do that
_ I was sailing too close to the credit limit as it was.
</P>
<P>
   I ended up walking away from the book. I've never quite forgiven
myself. (Have you ever noticed it's usually the things we don't do
that we regret, not the things we do?)
</P>
<P>
   That was almost 14 years ago. I ended up getting another first
edition of the same book a few years later, when I had more money,
but it wasn't the same quality and it cost me more than $300. A
first edition of ``The Sun Also Rises'' in excellent condition is
now worth about $750 (with the dustjacket, it's $17,500), which is
one of the reasons, although not necessarily the best one, that
people collect books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slightly Chipped'' (a bookselling term that means the edges of
the dustjacket have some pieces missing) is an anecdotal, loosely
structured tour through the world of rare or sometimes just old
books. It's a sequel to ``Used and Rare,'' an earlier book in which
Lawrence and Nancy Goldstone learned about the rare, wondrous and
wildly eccentric world of book collecting.
</P>
<P>
   I fell for this book at the point where the Goldstones come
across a first edition of Shirley Jackson's ``The Haunting of Hill
House'' for $75. Laden down with other titles, they pass it up,
only to see the same copy bought by a dealer and advertised a few
months later for $500. He probably got it _ ``The Haunting of Hill
House'' had a small first printing.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who loves books has had an experience like this, and
this book is for everybody who loves books.
</P>
<P>
   In my own experience, book people are another offshoot of the
genus Obsessive _ they're like sci-fi nerds, except that they often
actually have lives and they're smarter, usually overweight, with
that unhealthy pallor that comes from spending too much time in
small rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slightly Chipped'' covers some of the authors' peripatetic
travels to out-of-the way used bookstores, their attendance at the
Edgar Awards _ to get big-name authors to go, winners are,
evidently, informed in advance _ the typestyles and books devised
and manufactured by William Morris.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an eloquent disquisition on the Mr. and Mrs. Bridge
novels by Evan Connell, and a fairly heated screed on the value, or
lack of it, of shopping via the Internet, which has made it much
easier for consumers to get books they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the Internet increase interest in a field where the
product's appeal is personal and largely sensory? ... To attract
new people, to keep the field alive, the industry needs to provide
opportunities to see the books _ in person _ to handle the books,
to speak to an educated, passionate professional, to be intoxicated
by the atmosphere and the history, to get a sense of what a real
library (their library) can be like. ... With the Internet, you'll
never be surprised, never find something you weren't already
looking for, never see the fold-out map at the beginning of (the
first edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's) `Kidnapped'.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goldstones go to the Rosenbach library in Philadelphia, a
beautiful collection that includes Bram Stoker's notes for
``Dracula'' (a first edition of the book, in any condition
whatever, goes for $10,000 and up), and James Joyce's handwritten
manuscript for ``Ulysses'' (Dr. Rosenbach had foresight; he bought
the manuscript directly from Joyce for $1,900).
</P>
<P>
   The climax of the book is the Goldstones' attendance at the
auction of the effects of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, wherein
they observe the same goofy dynamic that usually informs celebrity
auctions: The good stuff has been siphoned off by relatives, so
hideous paintings worth a few hundred dollars at most bring
thousands, and tchotchkes worth perhaps $10 can go for $5,000,
strictly because of what is called ``association,'' i.e. a rich and
famous person once owned and, presumably, handled this otherwise
negligible object.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldstones decide to make a stab at a collection of the
Windsor books, none of them of any intrinsic interest. They decide
to go as high as $3,000. The lot sells for $13,000 to someone
bidding via phone.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Slightly Chipped'' so entertaining, in spite of
some copy-editing problems (``Stueben'' glass), in spite of its
nonexistent structure, is that the Goldstones are good company.
Their book is engagingly written, reasonably argued, not at all
dissimilar to a languidly paced but ultimately exhilarating book
forage through New England.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Throughout much of the year, Karl Yergey
teaches history for grades 9-12 at Canterbury School in Fort Myers,
Fla. This week, he asked for a one-week leave from his job so he
could be a part of history.
</P>
<P>
   If you're part of the gallery walking along The Country Club
course for this weekend's Ryder Cup matches, you might not see
Yergey. He works for a behind-the-scenes group, the greenskeepers.
</P>
<P>
   They are a group of 60 persons, 30 on-staff personnel, 30
volunteers, who have spent this week mulling over the greens, tees,
and fairways so players like Mark O'Meara and Colin Montgomerie can
focus on more important things.
</P>
<P>
   After each group hit Thursday, the greenskeepers were there,
with work so diligent that by the time the next group came along,
the hole looked as if if hadn't been touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here every day this week at 5:30 a.m., and the next
three days we'll be here at 5,'' said Yergey. ``We essentially cut
(grass) until everything gets done or it's dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cutting greens three times a day, tees once a day,
fairways once or twice or day, and bunkers are raked every day.
Basically everything on the course gets done at least once a day.''
They did so Thursday amid thousands of spectators walking along the
damp course, leaving footprints along the crosswalks of each hole.
</P>
<P>
   There were many precautions taken Thursday to make certain that
greenskeepers didn't interfere with spectators, however. Early in
the morning, helicopters flew over the 13th fairway to dry off a
soggy, up-hill patch. Whipping poles were used to clear off divots
and patches of grass.
</P>
<P>
   That took the place of tractors and blowers. ``The less the
traffic the better,'' said superintendent Bill Spence, who also
said that as of Thursday morning, the greens were running at a 10.2
on the Stimpmeter, an instrument used for measuring putting speed
on the greens. He said by this morning, the greens are expected to
run at 11.0, which is fast but not lightning fast as they might be
for a US Open.
</P>
<P>
   The greenskeepers' efforts didn't go unnoticed during Thursday's
practice round. While Mark O'Meara drew applause with a long putt
on the eighth green and Steve Pate holed a shot from the bunker
into the cup seconds later, greenskeepers drew rousing applause by
merely clearing divots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets you through the day,'' said Yergey. ``The toughest
thing of late is working through the crowds, but they've been great
cheering us on. We were out here when it rained the other day,
drying off the course, and people were cheering us as we worked,
because we were working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the greenskeepers are seasoned veterans, like Brendan
Byrne, a superintendent at a course in suburban Philadelphia. ``I
worked here four years ago, and I came back as a volunteer,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yergey came back after working eight weeks this summer. ``It's a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be here this week,'' said Yergey,
who left Fort Myers amid Hurricane Floyd last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yergey said not much tutelage is given leading up to the job. If
you know how to cut and clear grass, you're virtually qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss this whole week (of school),'' he said. ``But the
folks at my school in Florida were tremendous, and they recognized
it for what it was and said, `Karl, you have the personal days.
Take the time. It's something you have to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So how does one get involved with greenskeeping at golf's most
prestigious event? ``I saw an ad in the BC student newspaper when I
was a graduate student at BC,'' he said. ``That was 11 yers ago. I
came over and they interviewed me and off I went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked five summers, hit or miss, or miss, off and on.
Only a few of us have tournament experience. I worked here for the
US Women's Amateur a few years ago, but that was with about 200
people. Here, they're expecting 35,000 a day.''

 &HT;    The Truman show: Sleek comfort
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ Pay close attention: I'm about to reveal the
three most important things any tourist needs to know before
heading to Key West.
</P>
<P>
   Important Thing No. 1: The best Key lime pie can be had at the
Key West Key Lime Pie Co. It's not too tart, not too sweet and
comes with the classic graham-cracker crust.
</P>
<P>
   The folks behind the bakery's three outlets claim the recipe
dates back nearly 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Important Thing No. 2: The best conch is served by the kindly
proprietors of Johnson's Cafe, a take-out establishment in the
thoroughly ungentrified Bahama Village neighborhood. It's not too
chewy, not too fishy and comes with enough side dishes to feed a
small family.
</P>
<P>
   And Important Thing No. 3: The best place to stay is the Truman
Annex, Key West's answer to that most mundane of South Florida
entities, the suburban subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you were expecting me to name some hard-to-find
bed-and-breakfast, filled with precious antiques and run by a
couple who serves fresh croissants every morning. I'm not a big fan
of those kind of places. They remind me of museums; I'm always
expecting one of my two children to knock over a priceless
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Annex actually is connected to a museum _ the Little
White House, a naval commander's quarters that became Harry
Truman's presidential retreat. The 43 acres surrounding the house
were also naval property, filled with buildings dating back as far
as 1844.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the entire lot was sold to a developer, who kept some
of the original structures and then built a series of townhomes and
apartments. Everything is designed to look reasonably true to the
spirit of the local architecture _ there are porches and white trim
aplenty _ but with a key (pardon the pun) difference: The interiors
are modern.
</P>
<P>
   I found out about the Truman Annex by chance. I was desperately
seeking a contemporary, reasonably priced efficiency for our family
of four, but couldn't find anything under $200 a night that put us
within walking distance of the town. I turned to the AA
Accommodation Center, figuring they would end up recommending the
same hotels I had already called. Instead, my sales associate,
Valerie, suggested a townhome at the Annex. God bless her.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, these are people's homes. But since most of them
appear to be used as second residences, they're vacant for much of
the year. That means the Annex does a brisk rental business and has
a central office to coordinate transactions between owners and
vacationers. Valerie handled the details with that office _
whatever commission she earned came through them _ and in a few
minutes, she arranged for a two-bedroom townhome during early
August. The price was $150 a night, cheap by Key West standards,
even with the four-night minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind you're not getting a hotel room, you're getting a
house, with a porch, back yard, living room and fully equipped
kitchen (you supply the dishwashing detergent). What's more, the
house is in a large community with pools and guarded entrances.
Purists and old-timers may snicker all they want; I found it safe
and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the Annex is essentially in town, bordering Bahama
Village to the south (that's how I discovered Johnson's Cafe) and
that famous sunset-watching spot, Mallory Square, to the north.
Duval Street, the main drag, is two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The lushly landscaped Annex offers its own tourist attractions,
including the Little White House. Though the building is small (by
presidential standards) and the tour fairly brief, it gives a solid
look into the life of Truman, the politician with the common touch.
The Annex is also connected to Fort Taylor, which dates back to the
Civil War and boasts the finest beach on Key West.
</P>
<P>
   So, what else did we do during our four-day stay at the Annex?
We took in the usual Key West sights _ the Conch Train Tour, the
aquarium _ and we walked throughout the history-filled streets. But
mostly, we enjoyed staying in the city as quasi-locals: After all,
we were the temporary owners of a house.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and we ate lots of Key lime pie and conch.
</P>

there's a seven-night minimum, but through our reservation agent,

SPORTS COLUMN: WHISPERS ARE GETTING LOUDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first game in this series against the Mets,
Atlanta fans came to Turner Field with cautious confidence; for
Game 2, they came with quiet arrogance. Thursday, they came with
brooms. Anticipating a sweep of the little-brother Mets, Braves
fans talked trash and brought sweeping utensils to clean it up. In
the ninth inning, the chants resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta fans got their wish. For the first time since the
All-Star break, the Mets were swept in a series. Thursday's 6-3
Atlanta victory rounded out a three-game series of total
domination, and a bit of a psyche job by Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   What made Thursday's loss unsettling is how the Mets unraveled.
They were betrayed by every element that has sustained them through
the second half of the season _ timely hitting, clutch pitching.
Worst of all, the Mets' vaunted defense crumbled. A ball got stuck
in John Olerud's glove and he couldn't make the play. On another
play, Olerud made a throwing error and a run scored. Two innings
later, Turk Wendell threw wildly to second and a run scored.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the moment is that the Mets' hopes for a division
championship, so lush and vibrant on Monday when they were just one
game back, seem dashed, and now they have to be nervous about the
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Thursday's loss, far from sending them into a
spiral, may have shaken the Mets out of a trance. These losses are
nowhere near as crushing as the three Atlanta hung on the Mets in
1998 that ended their season and dashed their playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Mets have nine more chances, including three
against Atlanta at home. Will Chipper Jones be as hot next week in
New York as he was this week in Atlanta? Will Atlanta be as
consistently timely at the plate as it was this week? Will the Mets
be as untimely?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, for all of its bluster, knows in its heart of hearts
that this is not the same team that it was a season ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think they can beat us, but they seem to get by
and get the key hits when we play them,'' the Mets' Rickey
Henderson said. ``They think they're going to win the division, we
think we're going to win the division. We've got to play 'em again;
it's in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticize Henderson if you want, but his cockiness and his
aggressive attitude are a part of the reason the Mets are where
they are, and why they probably won't fold as they did at the end
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   In their first two games, the Mets showed too much reverence for
Atlanta, a little too much respect. Thursday's game was an ugly,
ragged and poorly played brawl _ but there was no reverence. The
Mets were aggressive from the first at-bat, when Henderson doubled
off Greg Maddux and scored the Mets' first run. But he strained his
hamstring in the process. Still, the tone was set: the Mets would
go after Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets led by 2-1 going into the fifth inning. Henderson
walked. Edgardo Alfonzo doubled, and Henderson eased up going into
third. When he saw left fielder Gerald Williams bobble the ball,
Henderson said he tried to score, despite the sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he saw the third-base coach Cookie Rojas flash the stop
sign, maybe he didn't. The point is that Henderson felt he could
score, or that the Mets needed him to score to change the momentum
and apply the pressure that Atlanta hadn't felt in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson decided _ independent of the coaching staff _ that if
the Mets were going to lose, they were going to lose going all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to be aggressive against Atlanta,'' Henderson said.
``Their pitchers are established: if the ball is off the plate,
they usually get the call. You can't be patient with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said Henderson made an aggressive error and that he
would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially larger problem for the Mets, if Valentine doesn't
check it, is not Henderson, and not even Thursday's loss. The
problem is a false sense of comfort some Mets have created for
themselves. The Mets seem to feel as if they have breathing room. A
number of players _ veterans _ keep talking about the safety net of
a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Safety net? The Mets lead the Reds by two measly games.
</P>
<P>
   As Valentine sat alone after Thursday's loss, he bristled at the
idea of his players talking about a cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking that,'' Valentine said. ``Actually I should
have had a meeting about it. I addressed a lot individually and
stressed it, obviously not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine slammed his hand on a metal desk. ``You can't hold on
in this situation,'' he said. ``You have to add on.''

STRIKING MATCHES MAY IGNITE COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ben Crenshaw looked 10 years younger, somehow
finding the Fountain of Youth overnight in downtown Boston. ``I did
have a better night's sleep,'' the US captain said, appearing
transformed from an obsessed man to an almost jovial one. ``And now
I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Crenshaw had decided Wednesday night on three of
his four pairings in this morning's opening matches of the 1999
Ryder Cup. He would pair Phil Mickelson with David Duval, Tiger
Woods with Tom Lehman, and Hal Sutton with Jeff Maggert.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while accompanying Davis Love Thursday on Love's practice
round, Crenshaw decided on the final pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had made up my mind on the other ones,'' said Crenshaw,
``but it wasn't until (Thursday) morning on the Love-(Payne)Stewart
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw then chatted with Love for a few moments on the fourth
fairway, spotted a boyhood pal, Dan Napier, behind the ropes and
was off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as he had done on the third green a few moments earlier,
Crenshaw sought out the gallery and warmly shook hands with fans.
His mood seemed so much lighter than the previous day. ``Ben told
me he was really happy with the team,'' said Napier, a Crenshaw
chum for junior high school days in Texas. ``And he was confident
the team would do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to the same time that Crenshaw decided that Love,
recovering from a sore neck and shoulder, had his game in order,
European captain Mark James was on the course, learning that Jose
Maria Olazabal did not. Olazabal, whose wayward driver still was
not under control, told his captain he was not ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty much (Olazabal's) decision,'' said James. ``I
think Ollie just wanted another morning to work on his game. He's
very, very close.''
</P>
<P>
   So, a few hours later, Crenshaw and James submitted their
pairings for the opening alternate-ball matches to the PGA and
eyebrows were raised. Not only because Olazabal, whose touch in the
short game can hardly be topped, was not in the opening matches but
also because Crenshaw had chosen David Duval and Phil Mickelson to
open for the United States with Tiger Woods and Lehman following in
the second group.
</P>
<P>
   While Crenshaw said the selection process ``drove me nutty,''
his choice of Lehman as Woods's partner surprised both Lehman and
the Europeans. ``I didn't really see that one coming,'' said Sam
Torrance, a European assistant captain. ``I thought it would be
Tiger and (Mark) O'Meara or Tiger and Duval.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans weren't complaining, though. That's because James's
second group had Sergio Garcia paired with Sweden's Jesper
Parnevik. This Woods-Garcia meeting is what golf fans have eagerly
sought _ perhaps not at 7:45 in the morning, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Garcia-Parnevik vs. Woods-Lehman match clearly is the best
of the morning. Garcia has exploded onto the golf scene and the
19-year-old Spaniard ``has made the fastest transition'' of any
golfer from amateur to professional, according to teammate Colin
Montgomerie _ Monty perhaps taking another sly dig at Woods. With
youth comes fearlessness, and Garcia will not flinch seeing Woods
across the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik and Lehman are each solid and Crenshaw's thinking of
pairing the veteran Lehman with Woods is that Lehman ``loves this
golf course'' and ``is playing very solid right now.'' In other
words, Lehman will not cause problems with his shots but will set
up shots for Woods, clearly the best player in the world now.
</P>
<P>
   But before this match is handed to the Americans, consider that
Woods's only weakness is the 4- to 8-foot putt. Some days they go
in, some days they do not. But making those putts is absolutely
essential in match play.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods's match is the best of the morning, the duo of
Mickelson-Duval is the best of the eight pairings. Both of them
seem to have finely-honed their games during Thursday's final
practice round. Montgomerie and teammate Paul Lawrie, the British
Open champion, will have to play very well to top the Americans.
One bonus of the pairing of righty Duval and lefty Mickelson is
that Duval's high fade off the tee will land in familiar territory
for Mickelson, who hits a soft draw.
</P>
<P>
   The key match of the morning is the third one, pitting Padraig
Harrington of Ireland (who took Olazabal's spot) and Miguel Angel
Jimenez of Spain against the Love and Stewart. The winner of this
match could give its team an early boost.
</P>
<P>
   This match has much uncertainty. Will the rookie jitters cause
the iron play of Harrington to be shaky? Will Love's going nearly
three weeks without touching a club (until last Friday) leave his
game spotted with rust? Another factor is that Jimenez expected to
be paired with Olazabal, but now will play with Harrington.
Stewart, of course, is perhaps the most Ryder Cup-passionate of the
US players, and thrives under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The final match of the morning seems to lean toward the
Europeans. England's Lee Westwood and Northern Ireland's Darren
Clarke _ a duo that is strong, solid, and compatible _ face Jeff
Maggert and Hal Sutton. Maggert may not have missed a fairway since
the spring _ the spring of 1989 _ and Sutton has regained his
putting touch of long ago. But Westwood has been superb all summer
and Clarke hits the ball far.
</P>
<P>
   In all matches, a key may be who tees off on the first hole.
Both Crenshaw and James said they will leave the decision to the
golfers, and a golfer who tees off on the first hole will tee off
on all odd-numbered holes and his partner on the even-numbered
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Even though two of the par-3 holes at The Country Club are
even-numbered (second and 16th), it is likely that long hitters
such as Woods may tee off second. That would allow Woods to attempt
to drive the green on the fourth and sixth holes (short par 4s),
and also blast drives on the 10th, 12th (long par 4s), 14th (a par
5), and 18th (long par 4).

<P>
   Peco Energy Co., Philadelphia's utility, and Unicom Corp., the
owner of the utility that serves Chicago, announced Thursday that
they plan a $16 billion merger that will bring together the
nation's largest collection of nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company intends to sell electricity in major
markets around the country as states open up their utilities to
competition, betting that its nuclear plants will produce energy
more cheaply than competing sources of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are going to be a nuclear powerhouse,''said
Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. He said
that if they manage the plants well ``it will give them a
substantial edge in terms of being able to market power and make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   A company with access to huge amounts of cheap nuclear power
could squeeze out a profit while undercutting the prices of other
marketers, Rubin said. That could eventually push down rates for
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which must be approved by an array of regulatory
agencies, would bring together Unicom's four nuclear plants, with a
capacity of 13,470 megawatts, and two nuclear plants operated by
Peco, with 4,070 megawatts of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Peco has formed a joint venture with British Energy
Co., called Amergen, which has bought four nuclear plants so far
and is negotiating to buy a fifth. Amergen already owns plants with
a total capacity of 3,625 megawatts. The new Peco-Unicom
combination, which has not yet been named, would assume Peco's role
in Amergen, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the nuclear plants associated with Peco would
represent about 17 percent of the nation's nuclear capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Corbin McNeill, the chairman and chief executive officer of
Peco, who announced the merger at a press conference in
Philadelphia with John Rowe, the chairman and chief executive
officer of Unicom, said that Amergen was interested in acquiring
more nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill, a former nuclear submarine commander, said: ``We intend
to be the premier nuclear operator in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the merger, Peco stockholders will receive
one share in the new holding company for each share of Peco stock
or $45 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Unicom shareholders will get 0.95 share in the new holding
company for each share of Unicom stock or $42.75 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The cash price represents a premium of about 11 percent of
Peco's and Unicom's average stock price over a ten day period
through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Peco closed Thursday at $36.4375, down $1.6875, and
Unicom closed at $36.25, down 81.25 cents, in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is not expected to add debt, according to Rubin,
and therefore will save in interest expense.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that about five percent of the combined work
force of 22,500 will be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe and McNeill intend to share responsibility in the new
holding company, which will be based in Chicago, until the end of
2003, when Rowe will become chairman and the sole chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Both executives took pains to reassure customers in Philadelphia
and Chicago that the utilities will maintain staff in both cities
and support local institutions to which they have been major
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, who was brought into Unicom in March 1998 because of his
experience as a troubleshooter, said his company will continue to
focus on repairing the transmission system of its subsidiary,
Commonwealth Edison. ``It's going to be hard work but we don't
flinch from that,'' he said. In August a series of blackouts shut
down the Chicago Board of Trade and the Field Museum for short
periods, and Chicago's Loop lost power one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Cohen, the executive director of the Citizens Utility
Board, the official watchdog group for consumers in Chicago, said
that while Unicom has had problems operating its nuclear plants in
the past, there had been a dramatic turnaround in the nuclear
operation since it brought in Oliver Kingsley, an expert, as
executive vice president in charge of nuclear operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen warned, ``Anything that diverts management attention from
the urgent task of repairing the delivery system is unwelcome.''

MILLER MAKES THE GRADES JUST IN TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This was the plan all along, to have Mel Miller in
uniform for the first game of Cal State Northridge's Big Sky
Conference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   After delays for various reasons, Miller, a starting cornerback,
was academically eligible. Until now, just in time for the
Matadors' Big Sky opener at Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel brings serious credibility to our secondary,'' CSUN
interim head coach Jeff Kearin said, ``and he solves a lot of our
depth problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a senior who transferred to CSUN last year after
starting two years at Washington, is strong in man-to-man coverage.
Without him, the Matadors gave up an average of 238 passing yards
in their first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's healthy, he's starting,'' said CSUN defensive
coordinator Foster Andersen. ``He has a little bit of an ankle
(injury). We want to see him run around a little bit. You can't
play in the secondary if you are limping.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's return means Steve Forte, the team leader with 12
tackles, moves from cornerback to his natural strong-safety
position. Rahman Sparks, who has 11 tackles, will start at free
safety.
</P>
<P>
   __ Desperate measures: The offensive line, decimated by injuries
since fall practice began, might get a boost from an unlikely
source next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to start moving defensive linemen to offense,''
Kearin said. ``We're at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Only eight offensive linemen are making the trip to Eastern
Washington, including Scott Martinez, who didn't travel to Kansas.
Geoff Watson, who started the season third on the depth chart at
right guard, is now the starting left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Center Julio Alcala will start Saturday, but he has a bad back.
He probably wouldn't have played if CSUN didn't have a bye last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julio feels a thousand percent better than he did last week,''
Kearin said, ``but he couldn't even go the whole practice today. .
. . I've never seen devastation like this. It's bleak at best.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line's depth was hurt even before the season, when
Alatani Malu, a 300-pound recruit from Torrance High, chose to
serve his Mormon mission.
</P>
<P>
   __ Monopoly on records: Senior wide receiver Aaron Arnold needs
just 70 receiving yards Saturday to become CSUN's all-time leader
in receiving yards. Arnold has 2,190 yards; the record of 2,259 is
held by David Romines.
</P>
<P>
   If Arnold surpasses Romines against Eastern Washington, he will
hold every career receiving record.
</P>
<P>
   __ So close: Brennen Swanson, CSUN's preseason Division I-AA
All-American candidate at linebacker, needs just one sack to break
the CSUN record for sacks in a career. Swanson has 19{ and trails
Dan Lazarovitz, who has 20.

 &HT;    Female sleuths becoming more common
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, most women who solved mysteries in suspense and
crime novels were mostly housewives or had other stereotypical
female jobs. Then, along came a few female doctors whose jobs were
connected to police work _ coroners, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Then entered a few female detectives, then private eyes. Now,
another mystery solving job has been taken over by at least two
heroines of popular crime novels _ the skip tracer, or bounty
hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The best know at present is Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter deluxe
in suspense novels written by Janet Evanovich, novels that have
recently hit some best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Plum is a raunchy, tough talking and acting semi-young
woman whose major area of operation is in and around Trenton, N.J.,
where she grew up and knows just about everybody and everybody
knows her and her relatives. This both simplifies and complicates
her job as a bounty hunter _ specifically, she finds people who
have skipped out on bail put up by her cousin the bail bondsman.
</P>
<P>
   The current Stephanie Plum adventure story is titled ``High
Five.'' It is the fifth Plum book, the second one I have read. I
can't say which one I liked best. Both are fun reading and worth
your time, if you aren't looking for something seriously deep. Both
are what is called light reading. Very light. But that's not all
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Evanovich's strong point is humor. Some of it is almost
slapstick and some if it is funnier than others of it, of course.
She includes several humorous characters, such as Grandma Mazur,
who likes to steal Stephanie's stun gun, and an angry little man
who hates to be called a dwarf and won't leave Stephanie's
apartment for reasons you'll have to read the book to find out.
There's also Lula, a giant, outspoken assistant in the bail bond
office, who loves a good fight.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised to discover the Plum novels, with the female
hero a bounty hunter, and as you can imagine I was even more
surprised a couple of weeks later to find another mystery/suspense
novel with a female bounty hunter as the central character. Is this
a trend, or coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   ``High Five'' is published by St. Martin's Press.
</P>
<P>
   The other female bounty hunter adventure novel is entitled
``Bitch Factor'' by Houston author Chris Rogers (Bantam Books). The
heroine is a tough talking, tough fighting (she knows judo and has
had police training, so she can handle most bond skippers she seeks
and finds; she also is, when she bothers to put on some make up and
feminine outfits, very attractive, but that's a totally different
part of the story) bounty hunter who always gets her man, usually
to their huge surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bitch Factor,'' Dixie goes all the way to the frozen north
country to find her bail jumper. She finds him and captures him,
but their return to Houston is complicated by a history-making snow
storm that causes Dixie and her prisoner to be snowbound in a motel
room in a small town far from home.
</P>
<P>
   It's no real surprise that Dixie soon is convinced her prisoner
is innocent of the crime (murder) he is accused of and she sets out
to prove it, once they finally make it back to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There's some humor here, but not to the extent you'll find it in
``High Five.'' But the story is more suspenseful.

PALMER STRIKES A CHORD WITH WILLIAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ At Friday night's gala honoring Arnold Palmer
at Boston's Symphony Hall, one of Palmer's biggest fans will be
responsible for the beautiful music.
</P>
<P>
   John Williams will return to conduct the Pops for the occasion,
an assignment for which he volunteered. ``I've always admired
Palmer, particularly as a person of great character and appeal to
the public. He's an icon, a marvelous figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who holds the title of Boston Pops Laureate Conductor,
is a golfer. ``I'm not particularly good at it, but I do love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former president George Bush will make a special presentation to
Palmer, ABC's Jim McKay will introduce a film presentation of
Palmer, and entertainment will be provided by singer Tony Bennett
and local comedian Steve Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the event will benefit the Deacon Palmer
Scholarship Fund, named for Arnold's father, a longtime club pro
and greenkeeper in Latrobe, Pa.

   Seiji Ozawa, longtime conductor of the Boston Symphony

for his love of the Red Sox (he once said he wouldn't retire until
the team won the World Series) and had vowed to keep the Patriots
in the area when it looked like they might leave. But now Ozawa is
taking his sports devotion to a new level. He's winging his way
home from a Hawaiian vacation, and he plans to spend Sunday at the
Sox game, catch some Ryder Cup golf, and then head to the Patriots
game in the evening.

   The wives and female friends of the Ryder Cup players opened
Thursday with brunch at Escada in Boston, where the American women
gloated that two of their own _ Tiger Woods's girlfriend Joanna
Jagoda and Mark O'Meara's wife Alicia _ won a putting contest set
up for the event. ``I said, well, that's a good start to the week _
Americans winning,'' joked Julie Crenshaw, wife of US captain Ben
Crenshaw. But it was European member Jarmo Sandelin's fiancee,
Lynda Sofia Lundgren, who caused a stir in her eye-catching
European attire. Not only is she Sandelin's sweetheart, she's his
caddy . . . After the putting fun, the women shopped at the pricey
boutique. ``There weren't many of us who didn't walk out with
something,'' Crenshaw said.

   Twelve-year-old Katherine Crenshaw has put blue and red bands on
her braces to show her support for the US Team. But the captain's
daughter also is a big fan of European golf phenom Sergio Garcia.
She ``adores'' him. Before developing her crush on the telegenic
Garcia, Katherine kept her heart for Woods . . . After a week of
parties, Julie Crenshaw was ready for the golf action to start. As
official host for both teams along with her husband, she spent more
than a year planning this week's packed schedule of events,
including the ``Get to Know You'' clambake at the Union Oyster
House, a reception at the Harvard Boat House, and a lunch at the
Four Seasons. ``You can choose to do as little or as much as you
want, and we chose the latter,'' said Crenshaw, as she rested her
feet during her first free hour of the week. ``The festivities are
over. It's time to put the game face on, and let's go.'' . . .
Crenshaw described Celine Dion's performance at Wednesday night's
Ryder Cup gala as ``incredible,'' but she and the other wives were
most smitten by the Boston Pops and their conductor. ``Keith
Lockhart was so charming,'' she said. ``We all fell in love with
him.''

   An aide to President Bill Clinton said Thursday that the duffer
in chief won't be traveling to Brookline. ``The president is not
going to the Ryder Cup, in case there were still any illusions,''
the aide said. While several observers have pointed to the strong
Republican presence at the cup (including former President George
Bush) and note that Clinton was snubbed by Tiger Woods after his
Masters win, the White House says Clinton just can't clear his
schedule. There's a meeting of the Democratic National Committee
and a previously unannounced physical.

   Golf is generally considered to have been born in Scotland, so
it is only right that bagpipes were on hand for the opening
ceremonies. Boston bagpipes, no less. That phase of the program was
provided by the Boston Police Gaelic Column of Pipes &AMP; Drums. The
group had auditioned for the job, via videotape, and when the call
came, the officers were ready. ``We've been getting ready for this
since July,'' said the group's president, James Barry. ``We have
had two four-hour sessions a week, and each day the members have to
practice an hour. We have worked hard for this.'' There were 18 of
the group's 32 members on hand complete with kilts imported from
Scotland. But the kilts were not simply mailed over, said Barry.
``We few the two kilt-makers over with them _ and they brought
their golf clubs, too.'' . . . There are many candidates, but
perhaps the individual with the toughest task at this Ryder Cup is
Ben Kilgore. He was hired by the Brookline Chamber of Commerce and
given an impossible job _ organize Thursday night's party for 1,200
members of the media. ``It's a tough crowd, not easy to please,''
said Kilgore.

 &HT;    Holyfield plots strategy for rematch
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ He has watched the controversial March fight countless
times, and the images are the same for Evander Holyfield: His face
repeatedly is at the end of Lennox Lewis' long left jab. That was
not the fight plan.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's quest was then _ and will be on Nov. 13 in the
rematch at the Thomas and Mack Center at UNLV _ to avoid Lewis'
lead punch, get inside and do damage to the body. It didn't work
out that way, and the 6-foot-6 Briton looked to have controlled the
fight from arm's distance.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was judged a draw. Now, with a chance to settle
matters, Holyfield is at work on conditioning and strategy in
Texas. To reverse his performance, the three-time champion
acknowledges he has to overcome the Lewis jab that peppered his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me with the jab, so I ask myself, `Why?''' Holyfield
said from his Houston home last week. ``I've worked on some things
to counter that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Technical adjustments. ``I have to double up on the jab,''
Holyfield said, ``have my legs in shape and go to the body to make
him bend down. And when he bends, then I can get to his head with
big shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've already pointed out that's important is that
he wore the wrong (protective) gear in the first fight. The waist
pads he had were too high. They weren't legal. And they protected
his ribs. The referee let that slip, and he benefitted from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get inside his jab, that's where my legs come in. I have to
be mobile, bob and weave and move in. Now, he doesn't want that. In
the first fight, he didn't really fight. He wouldn't really get
close so I can take shots at him. He ran. But I'm going to work my
way in this time and go to the body and slow him down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mental outlook. ``I put it in the proper perspective,'' he
said. ``I think people underestimated (Lewis), so any little thing
he did was magnified. He's a good fighter and a big man, so you
can't overlook that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of mistakes. The first thing you have to do to
overcome them is admit to them. So, I'm fine with that in my head.
I don't have that stuff lingering with me. I know I can perform
better. The thing is, that was that fight. You can't live off one
fight, one way or the other. The fact that I beat (Mike) Tyson
means nothing now. The fact that Lennox Lewis fought a good fight
against me means nothing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Added trainer Don Turner: ``One of Evander's greatest assets is
his mental toughness. He left that fight behind him as far as
affecting his confidence goes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Physical status. ``First of all, I don't make excuses. But the
fact of the matter is that I didn't ever get a chance to fight the
first game plan. I had cramps that kept me from moving like I
normally do. Now, that wasn't Lenox Lewis' fault that I got cramps.
It was my fault. But this time, with the way I'm training and my
(balanced, nutritrous) diet, I won't have the cramps. So, already
I'm better right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought I was aggressive because I was pursuing him. I
wasn't. I was pawing. Then I got too anxious. I needed him to
commit himself and he would. So, it was: Do I chase him to make a
fight and prevent the people from booing? I chased him and just ran
into punches because I couldn't move out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas: ``Evander's always a
great conditioned fighter. But with the way we're going on the
diet, he won't have any physical limitations on this next fight.
And that'll make all the difference in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Confidence. ``After spending time around Lewis in Las Vegas,''
Thomas said, ``I detected that he's overconfident. That would be a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Holyfield said: ``I wasn't my best and I was hurt
physically, but I finished that first fight. With the way I was
feeling, that was an accomplishment to endure. So, considering how
I felt and the fact that he fought probably as well as he can
fight, I'm very confident about what I'll do.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some fighters, there's nothing you can do to affect their
confidence during a fight. The only way is to beat them, and even
then that might not do it. They're true winners. They don't let you
break their spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that said, I don't know how tough Lennox Lewis is
mentally. I know he talks a lot. But until I punish him _ and I
will punish him _ we won't know whether his confidence can be
shaken. I want to lead the fight early and make his corner start
cussing at him to get going. Then, he'll have to fight and I can
land my shots. It may not be a beautiful win, but it'll be a win.''

METS APPEAR TO UNRAVEL AS BRAVES COMPLETE SWEEP, 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the debacle done and the chagrin mounting, it was
left to Mike Piazza to explain just how the Mets had imploded in
Atlanta, how the team that had hoped to leap into first place
during this series instead skidded toward its final nine games of
the season with its playoff future clouded and its confidence
waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our butts kicked,'' Piazza said after the Mets' 6-3
loss to the Braves Thursday. ``We've come a long way, but I think
you could see we have a long way to go. We came in here and we did
everything wrong. We came in tight and we did not execute on a lot
of levels. I don't think we can look at the wild card or the
division. We've got to look at ourselves and realize we played
pretty bad baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Mets played the kind of mistake-laden, mindless
baseball they had avoided since they began to turn their season
around in June. In losing, they were swept for the first time in 21
series since the All-Star Game break and found themselves four
games behind the Braves in the National League East. And the safety
net of the wild card has suddenly developed a hole, too. The Mets'
lead over the Cincinnati Reds is down to two games, the smallest
margin in a month.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that with Greg Maddux pitching the Mets lost
Thursday. But what was revealing was that the Braves yanked on one
string _ the Mets' psyche _ and the team unraveled. Manager Bobby
Valentine might consider ignoring the next pitcher who says he can
deal with Chipper Jones, but that was hardly the only problem in
this game. The team that had allowed just 18 unearned runs all
season _ the lowest total in the majors _ made a series of miscues
Thursday, a cruel reminder that sloppy play can interrupt at the
worst time.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets took a 2-1 lead in the second inning, and Leiter
struck out Jones, who had already hit three home runs in the
series, in the third, it seemed as if Leiter would be the one to
stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fifth the Mets hurt themselves over and over, as if
pricking themselves with pins until finally they hit an artery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fifth inning,'' Leiter said, ``was a collapse.'' It began
with Rickey Henderson, who walked with one out. When Edgardo
Alfonzo doubled into the left-field corner, the Mets seemed sure to
have runners on second and third with one out, with the middle of
the order coming up. Except that Henderson, who was moving toward
third base as leisurely as a Sunday jogger in Central Park,
suddenly decided at the last moment that he would try to make it
home.
</P>
<P>
   So as he rounded third, he picked up speed, ignored the stop
sign from the third-base coach, Cookie Rojas, and kept going. He
was thrown out at the plate on a play that wasn't all that close.
</P>
<P>
   The out defused the Mets' rally. Afterward, Henderson said that
he had been watching the ball in left field, thought it had been
bobbled and thus took off, and that he never saw Rojas' upheld
hands demanding that he stop at third.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Henderson insisted after the game that he hurt his
left leg coming out of the batter's box in the first inning and
that that was why he was ultimately taken out. ``When I was going
full blast, the muscle was grabbing,'' said Henderson, who was
replaced in left field by Benny Agbayani but said he should be fine
for Friday night's game in Philadelphia. ``I tried to stay under
control. I'd have stopped if I was aware he had the stop sign. I
couldn't run around the bases. I would have been at home standing
up if I was running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had stayed there,'' Valentine said. ``It would have
been a lot more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got plenty interesting in the bottom half of the inning.
Williams hit a one-out single to left and then, on an 0-2 count to
Bret Boone, took off for second base. Leiter had picked up the
movement, though, and he threw to John Olerud at first to start the
rundown. Except that Olerud couldn't get the ball out of his glove
and never made a throw. Williams was now at second, and when Boone
hit a bloop single to left field, the Braves had runners at first
and third with one out, and Leiter had a problem: Chipper Jones was
at the plate again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He struck him out before, so I figured he had a plan,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to keep the ball so inside to Jones that he
wouldn't be able to hit it. Leiter had intentionally walked Jones
in the first inning and struck him out in the third on a curveball.
And with two runners on, Leiter was loath to walk Jones and load
the bases. Jones took the first pitch for ball one. Jones had had
limited success against Leiter in the past _ only 5 for 19, with
one home run _ so Leiter felt confident that he could get a slider
down and in past Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't. The ball caught too much of the plate, and Jones
blasted it into the center-field seats for his fourth home run of
the series. It gave the Braves a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You envision good things,'' Leiter said. ``I'm thinking ground
ball, that I'm going to get out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, already trailing, the Mets began a slow dissolve.
Andruw Jones and Brian Jordan singled. Brian Hunter hit what
appeared to be a harmless pop to Olerud in back of first. But
Jones, gambling, tagged up and headed to third. Olerud tried to
nail him, but his throw took a short hop in the infield grass and
got past Ventura. Nobody was backing up the base _ Valentine
thought Agbayani had the best chance to be there _ and Jones came
around to score.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievably, that wasn't all of it. After Piazza hit a solo
home run in the sixth inning to set a Mets season record of 118
runs batted in, the Mets endured one more indignity. When Jordan
hit a shot back to the reliever Turk Wendell in the seventh,
Wendell whipped around and threw too quickly to second base as he
tried to start a double play. A sliding Rey Ordonez could not grab
the ball and as it rolled into center field, Boone scored from
third.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, with a mix of bluster and denial, said all the Mets
could do was laugh and then added that he still didn't think the
Braves could beat the Mets. But the mood elsewhere was much
quieter, and the doubts could be heard tiptoeing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope this doesn't carry over to Friday, Saturday and
Sunday,'' Leiter said. ``If you're really bummed out about it, it
will snowball for a portion of time that is not a good time to do
it.''  &QL;

LATE ARRIVALS TEE OFF SOME FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Golf fan Pat Guilfoil was willing to wait a
long time for Tiger Woods to tee off on the 10th hole. A really
long time. She left her home in Gales Ferry, Conn., with her
husband at 4:30 a.m. Thursday. The couple arrived at The Country
Club by 7 a.m. They had found the best viewing spot at the 10th tee
by 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Guilfoils read in the morning paper that the Americans would
tee off at the 10th from 9-9:30 a.m. Until 9:30, they didn't hear
anything different. Then, marshall Michael Thornton of Boston told
the waiting crowd that the first golfers would arrive approximately
45 minutes later. He did not know the reason for the delay, but
heard that only two European players were on the practice range at
9 a.m. Thornton decided to announce the delay after a number of
fans asked what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The American and European players got off to a
much-later-than-expected start on the final practice day. The
announced order of play was rendered useless. Mark O'Meara, Hal
Sutton and Steve Pate started on No. 9 and reached No. 10 at 10:15,
receiving polite applause. Three European groups followed the
American threesome at unevenly spaced intervals. Woods arrived at
the practice range at 11:23 a.m. and hit for 10 minutes. He started
play on the first tee, reaching the 10th hours later than
antipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just disapointed,'' said Guilfoil, dressed in a sweater
displaying an American flag. ``I paid a lot for these tickets and I
will see them for about five minutes. But I won't be rude. I'll be
very polite.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Tony Divicentis of Whitinsville, who staked out a place
next to the 10th tee at 7:45 a.m.: ``I'm very annoyed. I'd like to
know who they think they are. They're supposed to be here between 9
and 9:30 and they don't show up. I think they should understand
that we're not happy about this. I haven't missed a tee time in 30
years. I don't know why they have to miss their tee times. I have
late nights too.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Guilfoils and Divicentis had reserved a spot at the
practice range, they would have gotten a show for their money. On
the practice range, Woods hit two balls off the green fence in the
distance. The crowd cheered and he performed his trademark first
pump. Again, the crowd cheered and shouted, ``Go for it Tiger, put
one over.'' The most popular player hit his next shot over the
fence 315 feet yards. The crowd went wild, Woods shook hit fist
again and then turned to acknowledge his fans. After his display,
the young American sped off in a cart and played 13 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the 10th hole, other fans waited. Some spectators at the
10th tee did not have the luxury of keeping an extra long vigil for
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be back at work at 1 p.m.,'' said actuary Bruce
Gaffney of Medfield, ``but it's nice to be here. It's a neat place.
I guess I'll go take a walk around and check the place out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' said Martin Gaynor of Plymouth. ``It's a good
day and we have no other choice.''

<P>

</P>

   Butch Harmon suffered a broken bone in his right ankle Wednesday
when he took a misstep while walking off the fifth tee engaged in a
swing discussion with David Duval. Harmon rode for the rest of the
round in a cart driven by US assistant captain Bruce Lietzke and
later fulfilled his daily commitment as a television analyst. But
the ankle continued to swell, and as Harmon was driving to his
hotel, he noticed Newton-Wellesley Hospital and stopped in at the
emergency room for an evaluation. ``They told me it was a cracked
bone on the outside of the ankle and wanted to put me in a full
cast,'' said Harmon. ``I told them, `No way. Let's go to Plan B.'
'' So Harmon was back on the practice range at The Country Club
Thursday, hobbling around with a walking cast and a steel cane and
dispensing advice to various US team members. Because of his TV
duties, he was taking no painkillers. ``It would have been a lot
more convenient if this happened next week,'' he said . . . Tom
Lehman's caddie, Andy Martinez, was asked if he anticipated a
blowout by the heavily favored Americans. ``No way,'' he said.
``I've seen too many of these. It'll be a dogfight, hand-to-hand
combat. It's going to be brutal.''

<P>
   As Woods and Lehman were playing their final hole, the 13th, a
man behind the green went into full cardiac arrest. Medical
personnel defibrillated him within 40 seconds and he was rushed by
ambulance to Beth Israel Hospital, where he was being evaluated,
according to Dr. Mark Haffenreffer, one of the Ryder Cup medical
directors. Medical personnel on site did not know the identity of
the patient. Woods and Lehman were asked to delay their exit from
the 13th for four or five minutes while the patient was being
transported from the grounds. Lehman called over one of the
marshals to inquire about the man's condition. ``He was genuinely
concerned,'' said the marshal, who requested that his name not be
used. The man was later reported to be not in a life-threatening
situation.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   A sign of confusion
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sutton played nine holes before retiring and, after playing his
final hole, he obliged a few autograph seekers. But when O'Meara
left the course and was asked for his signature, he declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only going by what I was told,'' he said. ``(Wednesday), I
signed, and I got into trouble.'' Players have been instructed not
to sign autographs . . . On the 12th hole, O'Meara's approach shot
landed on the fringe, about 10 feet from the rope cordoning off
fans. Just before striking the ball he yelled, ``Move back a little
bit folks,'' and after a pause, added, ``for your safety.''

<P>
   Brad Faxon, who went through an emotional time during a divorce
that preceded his appearance in the Ryder Cup two years ago at
Valderrama and missed a big chunk of time this year when he fell
from a ladder at his home in Barrington, R.I., found new life
Monday morning. He beat Fred Funk to win a playoff in the
rain-delayed B.C. Open in Endicott, N.Y., his first victory since
New Orleans two years ago on the way to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a year of personal trauma,'' he said at The
Country Club. ``I was trying to get my life in order. Taking it off
the back burner and putting it on the front burner was great. I was
four down with seven to go. I was never out of it, but I was never
right there until the last two holes.''

O'MEARA, OLAZABAL HAVE MORNING OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The last two Masters champions will be on the
bench when Ryder Cup play begins at The Country Club this morning
between the US and Europe. Mark O'Meara and Spain's Jose Maria
Olazabal were both left off the list Thursday afternoon when the 16
players were announced for the foursome (alternate- shot) matches.
</P>
<P>
   Also sitting out are Justin Leonard, who won the 1997 British
Open, and France's Jean Van de Velde, who led that event this year
until he imploded on the 72nd hole and lost in a playoff. They'll
be idling alongside Jim Furyk, Steve Pate, Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin,
and Scotland's Andrew Coltart.
</P>
<P>
   Since O'Meara and Olazabal had both conceded that they haven't
been playing well recently, their omissions were not surprising.
``I understand it,'' said the 42-year-old O'Meara, who won both the
Masters and the British last year but had four forgettable majors
this season. ``Four guys have got to sit out. I haven't been
hitting the ball this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, 33, who won at Augusta both this year and in 1994,
broke a bone in his hand punching a wall after the first round of
the US Open and went on to miss the cut at both the British and
PGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ollie just wanted another morning to work on his game,'' said
European captain Mark James, who'll pair Ireland's Padraig
Harrington with Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez instead. ``He didn't
feel quite ready. He's very, very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, who played all five matches and went 2-2-1 in Europe's
1997 victory, will probably be used in this afternoon's four-ball
(best ball) competition. So may O'Meara, who paired with Tiger
Woods in both four-balls last time. ``Maybe I'll play tomorrow
afternoon,'' said O'Meara, who is 2-2-1 in Ryder four-balls. ``I
feel I can help the team in best ball and I told Ben that.''

GIULIANI THREATENS TO EVICT MUSEUM OVER ART EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MUSEUM-GIULIANI-ASSESS) 
(jt) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stepped up his attack on the
Brooklyn Museum of Art on Thursday, threatening to terminate its
106-year-old lease with the city and possibly even seize control of
the museum unless it cancels a British exhibition that features a
portrait of the Virgin Mary stained with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that the exhibition, which is to open next week,
would violate the terms of the lease, because the museum does not
intend to allow children under 17 to view it unless they are
accompanied by an adult. His remarks came a day after he vowed to
cut off all city subsidies to the museum if it proceeded with the
exhibition, which he described as ``sick stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor's threat came as a range of political,
cultural and religious leaders staked out positions on the show and
on Giuliani's response to it. Bishop Thomas Daily of the Diocese of
Brooklyn said that city funds should not support the exhibit. Peter
Vallone, the Democratic speaker of the City Council, and Howard
Golden, the Brooklyn borough president, said that the exhibit was
offensive, but that Giuliani should not try to quash it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the directors of many of the city's prominent museums
expressed dismay over the mayor's threat while attending a dinner
at the Whitney Museum of American Art on Wednesday, most refused to
speak publicly about the controversy Thursday. Many of the museums
rely heavily on city funds.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, and Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art,
released identical statements Thursday that read: ``I understand
that the Brooklyn Museum and the office of the mayor are in
dialogue with the Brooklyn Museum. Anything I might say could
compromise these talks.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Virgin Mary painting, the show includes a pig
sliced in half and suspended in a tank of formaldehyde and a bust
of a man made from nine pints of his own frozen blood.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani explained at a news conference that the museum's lease
for the city-owned building it occupies states that museums housed
in city-owned buildings ``shall at all reasonable times be free,
open and accessible to the public and private schools'' of the
city, and ``accessible to the general public on such terms of
admission as the mayor'' sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I checked, I'm the mayor, and I don't find closing
down access to a public museum consistent with the use of taxpayer
dollars,'' Giuliani said. ``People have an absolute right to
express anything they want to express, but they do not have an
absolute right to have that funded by the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arnold L. Lehman, the museum's director, said Thursday that
he had no intention of calling off the exhibition, opening it to
minors or moving it to a privately owned building.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and Robert S. Rubin, the president of the museum's board
of trustees, said the museum had required children to be
accompanied by adults during at least one previous exhibition,
which took place in 1990 and featured the work of Joseph Kosuth.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we are told how vile and degenerate the exhibition is,
and now we are being expected to open it up to children?'' Lehman
said in a phone interview Thursday night. ``The mayor is sending a
mixed message that we obviously need to sort out.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, called ``Sensation: Young British Artists From the
Saatchi Collection,'' originated at the Royal Academy of Art in
London in 1997 and drew the highest attendance of any contemporary
art exhibition in London for the last 50 years. A survey at the
time showed that 90 percent of people who saw the exhibit believed
that the Royal Academy had a responsibility to mount the show,
despite the disturbing nature of the art.
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Hess, the city corporation counsel, sent a letter to
Lehman Thursday warning that the exhibit violated the terms of the
museum's lease. He also told reporters that if the museum forged
ahead with the exhibit, the Giuliani administration might try to
take over its board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might result in, not the closure of the museum, but a
change in the board of the museum,'' Hess said, adding that the new
board ``would have better judgment as to what is appropriate for
this type of museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Schuyler G. Chapin, the Commissioner of Cultural
Affairs, have representatives on the museum's board, which has been
discussing the exhibit at meetings for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, the museum's director, said Thursday night that Giuliani
had ignored several requests over the last two days to meet with
him. He optimistically predicted that if he explained the exhibit
to Giuliani, then the mayor would change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not hesitate to express his opinion of the artwork
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that I can do isn't art,'' he said. ``If I can do it,
it's not art, because I'm not much of an artist. And I could figure
out how to put this together. You know, if you want to throw dung
at something, I could figure out how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show will go on even if Giuliani holds his ground,
Lehman said.

 &HT;    Want Woods vs. Garcia? Foursomes a start
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Participants at the 1999 Ryder Cup know the
golfing nation would like to see American Tiger Woods, 23, and
Spain's Sergio Garcia, 19, paired against each other in a Sunday
singles match.
</P>
<P>
   Not to belittle the most significant story line at The Country
Club _ Can the United States avoid getting three-peated by the
European team? _ but the potential for a Woods-Garcia match has
television executives salivating. And imagine how much interest
would be generated if the two young golfers battled down to the
18th hole with Samuel Ryder's hardware on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The singles matchup probably won't happen, but today's pairing
in foursomes was a start.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Garcia were paired against each other in the 7:45 a.m.
match, Woods teaming with Tom Lehman and Garcia with Sweden's
Jesper Parnevik in an alternate-shot format.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people in so many places, that's something people
want to see,'' U.S. captain Crenshaw said, ``and, lo and behold,
here it came right out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods downplayed the matchup and its significance toward the
budding rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one-on-one,'' he said. ``It's alternate shot, and you
only hit half the shots. It's not what the media is speculating. I
know they want to see us head-to-head, but it's not necessarily
head-to-head. We have to rely directly on our partners now.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a bit more luck would be needed to match Woods
and Garcia head-to-head Sunday. On Saturday night, following the
conclusion of the team matches, Crenshaw and European captain Mark
James will place the order of their 12 singles matches in an
envelope. The selection process is random.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if it happened,'' Woods said, ``but if it
doesn't, it doesn't. We have no control over that, and neither do
the captains. ... I don't think either captain would go up to
another captain and say, `I think we should put Tiger here and
Sergio here,' because that would be tipping off our hands. That
would be wrong, and I know Ben would never do that. And getting to
know Mark, he would never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garcia: ``It would be nice, but what I have in my mind
right now is to help the European team try to win the Cup, and I
don't care if I'm going to play Tiger or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of the dream matchup occurring Sunday probably are
better than 1-in-12. The captains are less likely to play Woods or
Garcia in the first four spots, figuring later matches will be more
pivotal. They might avoid the last couple of matches, fearing that
the young players could be wasted with the outcome already decided.
So call it a 1-in-6 chance in spots 5 through 10.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens Sunday, a Woods-Garcia matchup probably will
take place many times during the next two decades. But after only
five months as a pro, Garcia said it's not important for him to
match what Woods has accomplished. Woods is ranked No. 1 in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' said Garcia, who proved his own
match-play ability with a victory at the 1998 British Amateur. ``I
just have to be happy with myself. ... I'm thinking of being No. 1
(at some point), but I don't care if Tiger is No. 2 or whoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The two battled down to the wire with great shots last month at
the PGA Championship at Medinah. And both are capable of even more
spectacular shotmaking during match play. Match play typically
creates a more gambling, aggressive approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees are not as close as they were there,'' Garcia said
of The Country Club. ``I hope to be on the fairway most of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is more more crucial to the U.S. chances as a five-match
performer than in a singles situation against Garcia. He is the
world's best player performing at the zenith of his game, but he'd
like for that type of performance to carry over to the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   After three U.S. Amateur titles, Woods has been mediocre in
match play since turning professional. Two years ago at Valderrama,
he managed only to share one point with partner Mark O'Meara, then
lost in singles to Italy's Costantino Rocca. He appeared
uncomfortable with his teammates and the formats.
</P>
<P>
   With six PGA Tour victories this year and his play amazingly
consistent (13 top-10s in 18 events), Woods is expected to be a
dominant force in this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Tiger Woods is playing right now, any golf course
would suit him,'' Scotland's Colin Montgomerie said.
</P>
<P>
   With a Woods-Garcia match in mind, Crenshaw was asked this week
if he favored changing the singles procedure so that captains could
match opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This formula has worked very well,'' he said. ``You all know
me. I'm pretty slow to change. It has worked successfully and
distinctively for a long time, and I think any departure would be
wrong.''

MICROSOFT DISCLOSES NEW INTERNET STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft Corp. disclosed several pieces of its new
Internet strategy Thursday with announcements that it would offer
the public a piece of its most successful online effort, the
Expedia travel site; would significantly redesign its MSN portal,
and would introduce a network computing device.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a world in which software will be sold as a service
instead of a packaged good, the company, the world's largest
software maker, said it would re-introduce MSN, shifting its focus
to online communications, improved information searching and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The company also demonstrated its new low-priced network
computer, the MSN Web Companion, which will deliver the MSN service
beginning in mid-2000. The company said the device was part of an
evolving business strategy _ going beyond its stranglehold on the
PC industry to develop new ways to connect consumers to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company called the new approach its ``everyday Web''
strategy and, in a complete turnabout, said it no longer had a
dogmatic commitment to the PC platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision of the company is about software as a service,''
said Richard Belluzzo, group vice president for consumer and
commerce business. ``This fundamentally changes business models.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its new approach to the Internet, Microsoft said it
planned to sell part of Expedia in an initial public stock
offering. Expedia will become a separate company but will be
majority-owned by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock plunged $4.875, more than 5 percent, to
$91.188 as the briefing unfolded Thursday _ not because of
Microsoft's announcements but because its president, Steven
Ballmer, told a gathering of business journalists that he believed
technology stocks were overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, speaking at a company conference to outline
Microsoft's Internet strategy, Ballmer sketched what he called a
``Web services platform,'' built around ``megaservices'' like
specialized messaging and e-mail for use in building high-level
electronic businesses it calls marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The company also demonstrated a new portal oriented to
small-business and called Bcentral.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying many of the announcements was a deepening Microsoft
reliance on the advanced Internet standard known as XML, a set of
rules, or a protocol, that enables Web browsers to exploit the same
information stored in databases for a variety of commercial
transactions and information gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said that Microsoft would use XML to compete
with Sun's Java language in many arenas on the Internet. Microsoft
dispelled rumors that it would begin offering free access to the
Internet. In fact, it said it planned to raise the price of its MSN
access service by $2, to $21.95, and to add features while
aggressively expanding its PC-bundling marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The company deferred announcing pricing for its Microsoft Office
suite of productivity software, saying that changes in its MSN
strategy announced Thursday would ultimately percolate through the
entire company.
</P>
<P>
   One executive, Jon Devaan, said that America Online, while it
leads MSN by a wide margin, is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that as many as 50 percent of AOL members
are extremely dissatisfied and would switch to another provider
with better and more reliable service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make it easy for consumers to switch to MSN, the
company has reduced the number of steps it takes to subscribe to
MSN to six, less than a third of the steps it takes to subscribe to
America Online's Compuserve subsidiary, Devaan said.
</P>
<P>
   The MSN Web Companion device ``will raise a couple of eyebrows
around the industry coming from the company that has been thought
of as the PC company,'' admitted Yusuf Mehdi, director of marketing
for the Microsoft consumer and commerce group.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that the MSN Web Companion would be based on
the Windows CE operating system and would be tested later this
year. It will be made by several manufacturers and will be
discounted heavily as part of a subscription to MSN.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 SALE OF JAPANESE BANK LIKELY TO PRIVATE U.S. EQUITY FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government is close to selling the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan to an American-led investor group, a
transaction that would put a financial icon of the country's
postwar reconstruction in foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated sale of Long-Term Credit to a group led by
Ripplewood Holdings, a New York-based private equity fund, would
for the first time give foreigners control of a Japanese bank.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit was nationalized last October as part of an
effort to overhaul the nation's financial system, laden with
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bad debts as a legacy of
the speculative lending boom of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking government official said Thursday night that he
expected a deal with Ripplewood to be approved by next week. The
official said that despite political opposition to the purchase of
the bank by foreigners, the government had ultimately decided to
opt for the deal because it promised the least cost to the Japanese
public, which has already seen enormous amounts of its tax money go
into efforts to keep the financial system afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy C. Collins, a corporate buyout specialist who is chief
executive of Ripplewood, is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo early next
week. Collins has been part of the negotiations over the bank's
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ripplewood officials in Tokyo could not be reached for comment,
and its representatives in New York declined to comment. A
spokesman for the Financial Reconstruction Commission, the Japanese
supervisory agency overseeing the sale effort, could not be reached
either.
</P>
<P>
   But Hakuo Yanagisawa, the head of the commission, has made
little secret of his preference for a Ripplewood deal. He has said
he hopes that such a sale would help accelerate change in an
insular, antiquated banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Masamoto Yashiro, an aggressive Japanese banker, who made
Citibank's operations here a success, was expected to head
Long-Term Credit under Ripplewood. He would be expected to impose
Western-style management, accountability and flexibility on the
bank, making it a tough competitor to more traditional Japanese
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Ripplewood consortium is a collection of influential names.
It includes former Rep. Tony Coelho, the director of Vice President
Al Gore's presidential campaign, and Chris Flowers, a prominent
former Goldman, Sachs investment banker. Paul A. Volcker, the
former Federal Reserve chairman, is an adviser, and financial
institutions backing the bid include Citigroup, the GE Capital unit
of the General Electric Co. and ABN Amro of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium has offered about 120 billion yen, now $1.15
billion, for the bank. The government would receive about a billion
yen for the shares, or $961 million, and the rest would go to
recapitalize the bank. A competing bid from Chuo Trust and Banking
and Mitsui Trust and Banking offered the government less money than
the Ripplewood deal.
</P>
<P>
   The government has already taken many of Long-Term Credit's bad
loans off its books. The bank's labor force is also much leaner,
which will relieve Ripplewood of one of the major challenges
involved in taking over any Japanese business.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have had difficulty understanding what attracts
Ripplewood to Long-Term Credit and have speculated that the private
equity fund's real aim is to break up and sell the bank's assets
and eventually to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit's role as financier and provider of long-term
loans to Japanese corporations, which made it a major architect of
postwar recovery and expansion, is largely redundant in the global
marketplace. Its clients, which include many of Japan's bluest
blue-chip companies, now tap the international capital markets for
their financing needs.

FORMER CONNECTICUT STATE TREASURER PLEADS GUILTY TO KICKBACK
CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Paul Silvester, a former Connecticut state
treasurer, pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday to accepting
cash kickbacks in return for placing $500 million in state pension
investments with certain equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that while the state pension money was never in
danger, their investigation would continue, focusing on investment
consultants, some of the equity funds and donors to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Robinson, the U.S. attorney, said Silvester had
``improperly used his position of public trust to enrich himself,
his friends and to subvert the electoral laws of the state of
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors described the scheme, when Silvester was about to
invest money from the state's pension fund in a private equity
fund, he asked the fund to pay a finder's fee to a consultant, who
then gave Silvester part of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester, 37, admitted in U.S. District Court here that he had
collected cash and campaign contributions, and had even negotiated
a job, in return for some of those investments. He waived his right
to be indicted and pleaded guilty to six acts of racketeering,
including three instances of bribery, and one count of conspiring
to launder money.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester, who lost the race for state treasurer last November
after spending about $500,000, also admitted that he had used part
of the money to illegally finance his campaign by giving cash to
people who then made donations of up to $1,500 in their own names.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal could tarnish Connecticut's reputation for clean
government, and is another in a string of embarrassments for Gov.
John Rowland, a Republican, who appointed Silvester state treasurer
when the incumbent left for the private sector. The governor
campaigned with Silvester last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they had identified $1.5 million in
questionable fees paid to associates of Silvester's by five funds
between July and December 1998. In the case of one fund that
received a substantial amount of state money, the fee was $1
million, according to court papers. The government did not identify
the funds, citing a continuing investigation. The assets of the
State of Connecticut Pension Fund total about $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his relative youth, Silvester was among the state's
best-connected politicians. The honorary chairman of his campaign,
according to campaign documents on file with the state, was
Jonathan Bush, a brother of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Silvester went to work for Park Strategies, a
business consulting firm in Washington that is headed by Wayne E.
Berman, a major fund-raiser for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in his
Republican campaign for president. Former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
of New York is a partner in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester, a former investment banker who lives in West
Hartford, had been the deputy state treasurer for just over two
years when he was appointed to the top job by Rowland in July 1997,
after the incumbent resigned to join the private sector. Silvester
left office this January.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester's downfall is one more headache for Rowland, who lost
an expensive bid to lure the New England Patriots in April, and
failed to pull off a plan to privatize the state's computer systems
in June. On Thursday, Rowland used the word ``betrayed'' 10 times
in a brief statement discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel betrayed, as the people of the state should feel
betrayed,'' he said.

LOOK FOR OLAZABAL IN THE P.M. 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Though Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal
is likely to play in this afternoon's four-ball matches, European
captain Mark James won't say whether the rest of his bench
(Scotland's Andrew Coltart, Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin, France's Jean
Van de Velde) will also be getting the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not necessarily,'' James said. ``They may be. Just have to
wait and see what happens in the morning.'' Two years ago at
Valderrama, the Europeans changed only one man between morning and
afternoon on the first day _ Ignacio Garrido stepped in for
Per-Ulrik Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's redemption
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shot of the day during Thursday's final practice round was made
by Van de Velde, who made a sideways-downhill putt from the far
edge of the 10th green after aiming 10 feet to the left of the
hole. Olazabal didn't even wait for it to drop. He merely threw up
his hands in homage and picked the ball up . . . Ireland's Padraig
Harrington, who vaulted onto the Ryder Cup team at the 11th hour
and will play in this morning's foursome matches, was the man of
the people at The Country Club Thursday afternoon. He gladly signed
autographs for 15 minutes before the opening ceremonies, obliging
all comers.

 &HT;    Falcons practice improving ratio of give and take
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Buchanan had four interceptions in practice
Wednesday, and another Thursday. Falcons secondary coach Ron Meeks
thus bestowed ``All-Suwanee'' status upon his Pro Bowl cornerback,
generating much laughter.
</P>
<P>
   This is no laughing matter, however.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in practice was the same as in the first two games:
The offense was giving the ball up.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a singular hallmark to last season, it was the
Falcons' opportunism, which led to an NFL-best plus-20 turnover
ratio. The Falcons led the league with 44 takeaways, which led to
147 points.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, Atlanta (0-2) is minus-five, and turnovers have
set up 31 of their opponents' 41 points.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves has said it thousands of times: ``If you can't
take care of the ball, you're going to get beat mre often than
not.''
</P>
<P>
   For as well as the defense is playing, ranked No. 7 in the NFL
while allowing 265.5 yards per game, Atlanta had no takeaways in a
17-14 loss to Minnesota, and two interceptions in a 24-7 loss to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are definitely aware ... that we go for turnovers, that
we try to pull the ball out,'' said defensive end Lester
Archambeau, who forced a team-high seven fumbles last season.
``They're trying to hold onto the ball harder ... and the
quarterback is getting rid of it quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense and special teams shoulder the majority of blame for the
negative ratio.
</P>
<P>
   In the loss to the Vikings, Tim Dwight lost a fumble on a
kickoff return. Ronnie Harris fumbled after a long reception. Chris
Chandler lost the ball when sacked by a linebacker running back
Jamal Anderson barely touched on a blitz.
</P>
<P>
   While losing to the Cowboys, quarterback Tony Graziani threw an
interception and lost a fumble on a scramble, and quarterback Danny
Kanell threw two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, they were at times running for their lives. The
offensive line is working to do something about that.
</P>
<P>
   The team spent time this week with defenders working on ripping
the ball loose, and on offensive players protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's just good fortune,'' defensive coordinator
Rich Brooks said. ``Some of it is lack of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Defensive end) Chuck Smith (who's bothered by a sprained
right big toe) is not able to play at the same speed level as last
year ... and (defensive tackle) Travis (Hall) has been in and out
of the lineup with injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvement is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got to ball-hawk,'' Archambeau said. ``Fumbles don't
just happen; you have to make them happen. When our offense is
struggling, the defense needs to pick it up. The way you help the
offense is to give them a short field.''

 &HT;    UGA offensive line: Underclassmen making strides
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Age and experience normally are considered two of
the most important factors in building a formidable offensive line.
But Georgia is trying to get stronger up front by getting younger.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Jon Stinchcomb started both games this season
at right tackle. Freshman Kevin Breedlove is poised to take over at
right guard, if not Saturday against Central Florida, then
eventually this season. That would give the Bulldogs an
all-freshman right side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Alex Jackson has taken over as the No. 2 left tackle.
Redshirt freshman George Foster is getting playing time at right
and left tackle. Redshirt freshman Bubba Young has caught up with,
and soon could pass, junior Brad Register at second-team left
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's coaches insist the youth movement is not a sacrifice
for the future. They say it helps the Bulldogs get better now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it's just a lack of upperclassmen on the line, but the
other part is they are all pretty good players,'' head coach Jim
Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Stinch' could have played last year, and so could George; we
just wanted to redshirt them. As for Breedlove, UCLA was talking to
him about starting for them, and so was Tennessee and some other
pretty good programs. He's just a special player.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the season, junior Jonas Jennings and seniors Steven
Herndon and Miles Luckie were entrenched at left tackle, left guard
and center, respectively. They are considered All-SEC candidates
and, barring injury, will start every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fiddling with that left side too much,'' offensive
line coach Pat Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances have contributed to the transformation on the
right side.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Kelvin Williams, who played all 12 games as a reserve
last season, was scheduled to start at right tackle. But he
sustained a severe right knee sprain in the preseason and returned
to practice just this week. That opened the door for Stinchcomb,
who not only walked through it but appears to have locked it with a
deadbolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelvin has some good experience, but that's not all there is
to it,'' Donnan said. ``(Stinchcomb) is doing well, and so is
George.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-year junior Reggie Stargill played all 12 games last
season and was the incumbent at right guard. But generously listed
at 6 feet 2, the 281-pound lineman is small by SEC standards.
Breedlove is 6-5, 310.
</P>
<P>
   With youth comes growing pains, though, and Georgia expects its
young linemen to make mistakes. But the long-term gains outweigh
the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning there's a huge step up from high school to
college, even more than I expected,'' said Breedlove, a consensus
high school All-American from Daniel, S.C. ``But I'm having a great
time. I have a good coach and teacher in Coach Watson, and I can
tell I'm getting better every day.''

2 PROVIDERS OF NET ACCESS SET TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ga.)   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earthlink Network Inc. and Mindspring Enterprises Inc., two
pioneers in the business of selling Internet access, announced a
merger agreement Thursday, with hopes of more effectively
challenging America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, a $1.7 billion stock swap, creates a company with
2.8 million subscribers. It will be named Earthlink but will
operate out of Atlanta, Mindspring's home. Earthlink is now based
in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The combined entity would leapfrog Internet services from AT&AMP;T
and Microsoft to become the clear but distant second-place service
provider in the United States behind America Online, which has 18
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to aspire to something that is more exciting than
we could in the past,'' said Charles Brewer, who started Mindspring
out of his apartment in 1994 and saw it grow into one of the top
five Internet service providers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be No. 1 in the world,'' added Brewer, who will
become chairman of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of two companies that symbolized success for the
small Internet service provider underscores what some industry
observers see as inevitable consolidation in the Internet access
market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the number of small Internet service providers continues to
grow, now standing at more than 5,000 in the United States and
Canada, and entrepreneurs are pursuing alternatives to the
subscription-fee business model. Netzero, for example, is a growing
advertising-based service that is free to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is also being changed by high-speed, or broadband,
access with digital subscriber lines and cable modems. Such access
threatens the dominance of the traditional dial-up service
provider, while Earthlink, Mindspring and America Online are
forming partnerships to offer these broadband technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But the real competition among service providers today is to add
subscribers, and Earthlink and Mindspring insisted that their
merger would allow them to do that more efficiently. The companies
said they planned to merge back-office operations and to redirect
some of the savings to marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both spending a tremendous amount toward accelerated
growth,'' said Charles Betty, EarthLink's president and chief
executive who will be chief executive of the combined company. ``We
stepped back and said `Wow, we should be doing this together.'''
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink projected adding 230,000 subscribers in the third
quarter, while Mindspring will add roughly 80,000 new subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   As of March, each company had 1.1 million subscribers, according
to Jupiter Communications, a New York-based market research firm.
For the second quarter, Mindspring reported revenue of $86 million
and operating losses of $12.7 million, while Earthlink reported
revenue of $78 million and operating losses of $28.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will trade under the Earthlink stock symbol,
ELNK, on NASDAQ. Mindspring shareholders will receive one share of
the new company for each share they hold, while Earthlink
shareholders will receive 1.615 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Betty said the company would have a combined $500 million in
cash to seed the marketing effort. He said the deal should be
completed by the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink shares fell $1.125, to $42.375, on the NASDAQ stock
market. Mindspring shares dropped $5.50, to $27.375.

 &HT;    Comeback complete for Auburn QB Leard
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ About two hours before Saturday's game with
Mississippi, Auburn will file out of Sewell Hall and proceed to
Jordan-Hare Stadium in a tradition known as the ``Tiger Walk.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, quarterback Ben Leard will look into the crowd
lining Donahue Drive and find his mother. Kathy Leard will hand her
son a note and a piece of bubble gum. They will hug briefly, and
Ben will march on. Then Kathy and her husband, Bill, will walk into
the stadium and anxiously await the day's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our little tradition,'' Kathy said.
</P>
<P>
   With four sons who played the sport and a husband who loves it,
the Hartwell family's autumns always have been built around
football. ``It gets to the point where you don't think about all
the miles you travel and places you go,'' said Kathy, an assistant
principal at a Hartwell middle school. ``To us, football is just a
way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy's way of life took a heartbreaking turn last September
when Ben struggled in his first few games as the starter. The
Tigers started 1-3, and many at Jordan-Hare Stadium made it clear
whom they were blaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point where we would wear earphones and listen
to the radio so we wouldn't have to hear (the abuse),'' Kathy said.
``It didn't work. I told Bill that we couldn't have rabbit ears and
let everything affect us. But when people start screaming `I hope
he's not going to go back in'... well, that's pretty low.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing 1 of 10 passes in the fourth game, against
Tennessee, Leard lost his job to freshman Gabe Gross. Kathy, tired
of the abuse, quit going to home games. She would go to the Tiger
Walk, then retreat to Ben's apartment to cook, clean and nervously
listen to the game on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just couldn't take it,'' Leard said this week. ``She had
never been through anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ben's struggles were worse. After a loss to LSU in the third
game, defensive lineman Leonardo Carson stood up in a players-only
meeting and accused Leard of taking a less-than-serious approach to
the game. The two eventually made peace, but the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the low point,'' Leard said.
</P>
<P>
   After an Oct. 17 loss to Florida, Leard did not take another
snap. The coaching staff, first under Terry Bowden and then Bill
Oliver after Bowden's resignation Oct. 23, made it clear they had
no confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had no idea what I was going to do,'' Leard said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Thanksgiving, Tommy Tuberville left Ole Miss and
became the coach. Before he arrived, he checked out the personnel.
``The people I talked to said (Leard) needed to transfer to a I-AA
school and find an offense that fit him,'' he said. ``Basically,
they didn't think he could play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Leard was in Tuberville's office, asking
if he would get a chance to win back his old job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that everybody on the team was going to have to
show us what they could do ... to earn their spot,'' Tuberville
said. ``He really loved it. I think it gave him a sense of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Leard decided his best chance lay with knowing Tuberville's
offense better than anyone. He stayed in Auburn all summer, worked
out with the receivers and watched films of Tuberville's Ole Miss
teams. ``I'm not the most athletic guy in the world,'' he said. ``I
knew I'd have to make up for it by knowing the offense inside
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days before the first game, against Appalachian State,
Tuberville said Gross would be the starter and Leard No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Ben that he deserved a chance to play and would play,
but how much, we didn't know,'' offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone
said. ``We had to wait and see how the game went.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kathy Leard was going to skip the game. ``I'm kind of a
wimp, I know,'' she said. ``But I just couldn't bear to hear those
kind of things again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Wednesday before the game, Ben called her and said he
would be on the field with the other captains for the coin toss. He
wanted her to be there. She agreed, but was more than a little
nervous as the game began.
</P>
<P>
   Ben's chance came with Auburn trailing I-AA Appalachian State
15-7 in the third quarter. He took command in the huddle. He led
Auburn on a 64-yard touchdown drive and completed a pass for a
two-point conversion that tied the score at 15.
</P>
<P>
   The score was still tied with 1:42 left when Auburn took
possession at its 23-yard line. ``Ben just walked into the huddle
and told everybody to relax,'' center Cole Cubelic said. ``He said
we were going to run the two-minute drill just like we did every
day in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben completed four consecutive passes to put Auburn at the
Appalachian State 33 with less than a minute to go. On
third-and-10, Mazzone called a simple pass hoping to get close
enough so kicker Ron Bironas could attempt a field goal. Ben pumped
his fist at Mazzone, a sign that he wanted to change the play and
go deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few plays before, I had seen the corner cover our guy real
tight,'' Ben said. ``I knew it would work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone shook his head. Ben pumped his fist again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally I just said OK,'' Mazzone said. ``I wasn't calling
that great a game anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, Kathy could not watch, her head buried in the lap
of Melanie King, Ben's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   On the snap, Ronney Daniels did a down and out in front of the
Appalachian State cornerback. Ben pumped as if he were going to
throw short, and Daniels streaked deep. His pass over the
cornerback's head was perfect for the winning touchdown with 38
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Leard remembers an explosion of sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was going crazy. Everybody was going crazy. I was crying,
and I wasn't the only one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the 35, Ben stood and fought back the tears as he soaked it
in. The crowd was cheering, and for the first time in a long time,
it was cheering for him. ``It was the best feeling I've ever had in
my life,'' he said. ``I thought about everything I had been through
just to get back to this point. It was really a storybook ending to
a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben has established himself as the starter. Last week in a 41-7
win over LSU, he threw for a career-high 304 yards. In three games
he has completed 42 of 61 passes for 629 yards and six touchdowns.
He is No. 2 nationally in passing efficiency behind Georgia Tech's
Joe Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Gross saw the writing on the wall this week and decided to give
up football for baseball, in which he has a good future.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, a unanimous pick for last in the SEC West, is 3-0. Not
even Ben Leard dreamed any of this could happen. ``That's why
you've got to keep trying, no matter what,'' he said. ``My parents
raised me not to be a quitter. I know I am very privileged to be in
this position now, and it came from a lot of hard work and a lot of
support.''

DEMOCRATS' NEW CHAIRMAN IS SIGN OF AL GORE'S POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an eye on the growing pile of cash that Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas is accumulating for the 2000 presidential
election, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have moved
to strengthen the Democratic National Committee's fund-raising
ability by bringing in Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia as
the party's new general chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Rendell is a clear sign that the Gore campaign
is in charge of the party apparatus. Party chairmen usually remain
neutral in primary fights, but Rendell has already endorsed Gore
for president. He said today that while he is an admirer of former
Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the party's presidential
nomination, he is ``an unabashed admirer'' of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, who raised $14 million for his own two mayoral
campaigns and has raised millions for Clinton and Gore, is an
acknowledged expert at raising money and made no bones today about
his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very important in the next six, seven months that
Democrats raise as much money as possible so that we can be
competitive all throughout the election year next year,'' Rendell
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a mounting concern that Gore has been
spending so much money _ and may have to spend more to fend off a
strong primary challenge from Bradley _ that he could wind up
cashless for several months next year until federal matching funds
kick in in August.
</P>
<P>
   A party official said the committee was prevented by law from
spending money on beyalf of a candidate during the primary, waiting
until a nominee is chosen at the convention. But with the national
party structure so heavy with Gore supporters, it remains to be
seen whether the committee will maintain that neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said he would be ``scrupulously fair'' in not favoring
Gore over Bradley. Nonetheless, he said, the party would have to
spend money to counter Bush's campaign. ``We cannot fail to have a
presence for any time during that period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell replaces Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, who is perceived as
more of a spokesman for Democratic philosophy than a fund-raiser.
Rendell's installation as chairman is formally scheduled for
Saturday. Gore tried wooing two other skilled fund-raisers _ Terry
McAuliffe and Peter Knight _ to the party post but was not
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and the vice president have numerous mutual friends
and supporters, among them Clinton, who offered Rendell the post
during a two-hour private discussion Wednesday night at the White
House. Rendell then slept over in the Lincoln Bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would bring a new approach to fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the past we've sort of taken our big donors for
granted and said, `Give money, because you're going to be able to
come to the White House to the Christmas party or because you're
going to be in a special club or have a special pin,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to instill them instead with a sense that they
were Democrats because they wanted to help people. ``I don't think
we need to have any of the perks,'' he said.  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Isle of Man _ With glittery new steel-and-glass
offices, an imposing mansion and a high profile in yacht racing,
Peter M. Bond has never quite been shy about his success.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as head of Valmet (Isle of Man) Ltd., Bond is now in the
top ranks of one of this misty island's biggest industries: setting
up offshore corporations that shield clients from taxes and
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a booming market: Last year, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. estimated
that the world's wealthiest individuals might be keeping a
staggering $6 trillion in off-shore shelters. Yet, in a globalized
economy powered by freewheeling money transfers, havens like this
also offer what a British government report called ``great scope
for abuse of company vehicles to facilitate financial crime and
money laundering.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond has been linked in court documents to Russian corporate
machinations concerning potentially billions of dollars. At issue
is whether companies he administers are part of attempts to siphon
assets from some of Russia's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   A review of some of his dealings suggests just how the anonymity
provided here makes it almost impossible to know who really
controls these Russian companies and what their purposes are.
</P>
<P>
   American investors charge in lawsuits that ``shell'' companies _
empty entities created here to hold other companies or investments
_ are part of a scheme to defraud Russia's second-largest oil
company, Yukos Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan adopted in March, Yukos tried to issue millions of
new shares equal to a majority of its voting stock and transfer
them to a series of offshore companies _ two of them now
administered by Bond. No one has said publicly who the ultimate
owners of these companies will be. One company has official
headquarters in the mock-Tudor home of a 34-year-old accountant
just outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   The other company, according to public records here, is owned by
two other companies that are in turn owned by Bond and Valmet IOM.
The trail stops there.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a burly 42-year-old who favors khakis and open-collar
monogrammed shirts, denied wrongdoing and noted that no one has
accused him of any crime. His company, he said, merely provides
routine services to clients he refused to name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't wish to participate in any improper transaction,
but I can't confirm whether these transactions were improper or
not,'' he said. ``There are two sides to every story.''
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, the transactions ignited a messy legal battle
and prompted the island's high court to block the stock transfers
from Yukos to the shell companies, at least temporarily. At the
same time, the case has intensified the soul-searching on this
Irish Sea outpost. Local leaders badly want to shore up the
island's respectability, but they also recognize that its
prosperity stems largely from its ability to offer foreigners low
taxes and great discretion.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary is clear enough. About 37 percent of the island's
economy is based on financial services, much of that on behalf of
foreigners. With a population of 72,000, the island's corporate
registry boasts 42,000 companies _ well ahead of the rival tax
havens on Jersey and Guernsey, in the sunnier Channel Islands to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man boasts a sturdy sense
of independence. It has its own parliament, the Tynwald; language,
Manx-Gaelic; flag; currency, linked to the British pound, and legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   Though all three islands _ known as Crown Dependencies _
recognize the Queen of England as head of state, they remain
broadly autonomous: when Britain joined the European Union, they
all simply said no. Fittingly enough, the Isle of Man's emblem is a
three-legged figure accompanied by a Manx-Gaelic motto roughly
translated as ``Wherever I'm thrown, I stand on my own feet.''
</P>
<P>
   But with authorities in the United States and Europe digging
more deeply into accusations of Russians using Western institutions
to launder money, abuse of the island's status is under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   And the focus has narrowed to the hundreds of unregulated
corporate service providers which, like Valmet, offer clients
everything needed to set up and maintain a corporation based on the
Isle of Man: legal paperwork, ``nominee'' directors and a local
address.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last year's British government report on the Crown
Dependencies called for regulation of such businesses, saying that
a ``troublesome minority'' of them ``usually in collaboration with
others outside the Islands, have been associated with disreputable
business such as money laundering, fraud, false booking of profits
and tax evasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it criticized the extent to which Manx laws permit
companies to obscure their true ownership, meaning that ``private
companies have come to be favorite vehicles for criminals and money
launderers.''
</P>
<P>
   Valmet, which vigorously denies any wrongdoing, is hardly the
only company here linked to Russian activities. For instance,
International Company Services Ltd., according to records here, set
up a shell company for Peter Berlin, a Russian emigre who is a
central subject of investigations into Russian money laundering
through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Bond and Valmet had particularly extensive ties. Bank
Menatep, a failed Russian bank at the center of investigations into
Russian money laundering, owns 20 percent of Valmet's parent
company, Valmet Group, which is based in Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   A former top Bank Menatep executive is the husband of a Bank of
New York official who was suspended without pay as a result of the
money laundering investigation. Menatep was also a big shareholder
in Yukos.
</P>
<P>
   While Bond will not divulge his clients' identities, Yukos' own
shareholder documents listed companies now administered by Valmet
as recipients of its new shares.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a native who started a branch of Valmet here 10 years ago,
has steadily built his business. In March, he opened a flashy new
office building and boasted of revenue of about $16,000 a day _ a
twentyfold rise from the first year. Treasury Minister Richard
Corkill took part in the opening celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1994, Riggs National Bank in Washington owned 51 percent
of Valmet Group, which operates through a chain of corporate
entities in the Dutch Antilles, Switzerland and elsewhere and says
it has an annual revenue of $15 million from some 8,000 clients
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Riggs wanted out, so Valmet executives bought back most of
its stake and sold a 20 percent stake to Bank Menatep. At the time,
Western financial institutions were euphoric about Russia's embrace
of capitalism and Menatep appeared to be one of the country's
central players.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Samuelson, group president of Valmet Group, said
that Valmet refused to give Menatep any seats on its board and
demanded written commitments that it would not try to influence
Valmet's business. In the wake of Menatep's collapse after the
financial meltdown in Russia last year, Valmet is invoking its
right to buy back its stake. That process is still under way.
</P>
<P>
   Bond and Valmet were not the only ones involved in obscuring the
Yukos transactions. Among the more curious players is Paul Mellor,
a 34-year-old accountant who recently started his own corporate
services firm in a suburb of Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, Mellor and his partner, Paul Gelling,
received what seemed a routine request from a company in London to
set up a company called Thornton Services Ltd. At roughly the same
time, by its own account, Valmet got a similar instruction to
establish a company called Brahma Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing the real owner's identity, Mellor said, he and
Gelling listed themselves as Thornton shareholders and listed
Mellor's home as its official address. ``It was routine,'' Mellor
said. ``We thought no more about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, he said, they resigned in favor of two new
directors from yet another tax haven, the tiny island of Sark in
the English Channel. The move is a common technique on the Isle of
Man, because disclosure requirements in Sark are even weaker than
here.
</P>
<P>
   The big surprise came this spring. Yukos _ a Russian oil giant
with reserves worth billions of dollars _ said it would issue
hundreds of millions of new shares in its operating subsidiaries
and then transfer these to a series of offshore companies,
including Thornton and Brahma.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian company's shareholder documents, the
offshore companies were not expected to pay any cash for their
shares. In the case of a subsidiary called Yukansknefpegaz, for
example, the payment _ 12.5 rubles a share _ would be in promissory
notes issued by another Yukos subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   To American investors in Yukos, led by the family of Kenneth
Dart, the billionaire industrialist, the move was a bare-faced
attempt to move the assets out of the reach of minority
shareholders, according to lawsuits the investors filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not charging Bond personally with fraud,'' said Michael
Hunter, president of Dart Management Group. ``We do believe that
companies he is involved in administering are being used as
instrumentalities in a scheme to defraud investors.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Yukos board pushed through shareholder
resolutions approving the sale of oil for about $1.48 a barrel _
less than a tenth of its market price at the time _ to a list of
obscure Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before the deal created turmoil here. The
investors successfully sued in the Isle of Man and elsewhere to
block the planned stock transfer. Apparently frightened by the
lawsuit, the two nominee directors from Sark quit and left Thornton
in corporate free fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mellor says Thornton proposed two Russians as its directors, but
was turned down by the Isle of Man's high court. Instead, at the
court's behest, Valmet installed its own associates as directors _
in part, Bond said, because Valmet was ``familiar with some of the
principals behind the case.'' He insisted, though, that the entire
Yukos affair was no more than ``a transaction that never got beyond
the early stages of contemplation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond now says the transactions will not go through anyway.
``There is no intention of either of the companies under Valmet's
administration participating in any share transactions relating to
the operating subsidiaries of Yukos with or without the benefit of
any injunction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the case goes to the heart of changes envisioned by the
Tynwald, the island's parliament. Under legislation now being
considered, corporate service providers like Valmet would have to
know their clients and authorities would have greater powers to
investigate malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Isle of Man is streets ahead of other jurisdictions in
this area,'' said John R. Aspden, head of the island's Financial
Supervision Commission. But the entanglement with Russia still
rankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the Isle of Man a satellite of Russia?'' he said. ``Of
course, it's not.''

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney's office is looking
into a now-defunct London law firm for clues to the genesis of the
Russian money movements through the Bank of New York that are now
under federal investigation, according to officials with knowledge
of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the firm, Talbott, Creggy &AMP; Co., was first
investigated by British and American authorities for its role in
setting up off-shore shell companies that were supposedly involved
in money laundering and stock fraud. The firm was subsequently
disbanded and two lawyers have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   These investigations identified links between some of the
suspect off-shore companies and two companies _ the Benex
International Co. and Becs _ now identified as the primary
pipelines through which at least $7.5 billion from Russia have
moved through the Bank of New York since 1996. The link brought
investigators from Britain's National Crime Squad to New York in
the fall of 1997 seeking the assistance of the Manhattan district
attorney, Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that the Talbott, Creggy law firm had set up
a number of shell companies for Russians, some of which had
dealings with Benex.
</P>
<P>
   The exact source of the Russian funds at the Bank of New York is
still unknown. While a significant portion was apparently related
to tax and customs duty avoidance schemes, investigators believe
the funds also may have involved organized crime proceeds,
corporate embezzlement and possibly political graft. No charges
have been filed in the United States, but a grand jury has been
impaneled in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the London law firm, two lawyers, Andrew R.
Warren, 43, and Stuart Creggy, 60, were arrested by British
authorities in 1998, on money laundering and stock fraud charges
and are still in custody in Britain. The two men could not be
reached for comment. Warren was indicted on stock fraud charges in
June by Morgenthau. He is trying to extradite Warren so he can be
tried in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that shell companies set up by
the British firm did business with Benex and Becs, and
investigators believe that Warren can play a crucial role in
unraveling much of the mystery that still surrounds the companies.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Benex and Becs in 1997 led Morgenthau's office
and Britain's National Crime Squad to the Bank of New York sometime
in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to a March 1998 memo from the district attorney's
office to the U.S. Customs Service, hundreds of thousands of
dollars a week were moving through Benex into Bank of New York
accounts controlled by Roman Amiragov, a Russian living in London
and New Jersey who could not be located and whose background
remains unclear. This was the earliest that federal authorities in
the United States were aware of a link between Benex and Becs, and,
according to people with direct knowledge of the accounts, more
than $3 billion had already passed through the accounts unchecked
at the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not begin examining the
Bank of New York until September 1998. At that time the bank first
became aware of the problem and began cooperating with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has not been charged with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, Creggy's former offices were in a brownstone on Queen
Anne Street in central London that housed three other law firms.
British and American authorities say the stock fraud scheme was
hatched from these offices and included bribes supposedly paid to a
former African diplomat to help register shell companies in Africa.
The Manhattan district attorney's office believes that a similar
scheme may have been engineered for Benex.

 &HT;    Importance of upcoming games `awesome' to Reds' Casey
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Sean Casey walks into the pre-game clubhouse these
days with a broad smile and a twinkle.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Sean Casey always smiles and his eyes always twinkle because
he is a guy who believes big-league baseball is Sean in Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, with his Cincinnati Reds on the brink of
something very special, Casey's smile turns up at the ends a bit
higher and his eyes sparkle a deeper blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a kid turned loose in a candy store,'' Casey said.
``What's happening is awesome, the magnitude of each game, how much
each game counts. Every game, you come to the park like it's the
first week of the season, excited to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds begin a four-game series tonight against the St. Louis
Cardinals, the final four games of the season at Cinergy Field,
unless. . .oh, yes, unless.
</P>
<P>
   With nine games remaining, the Reds are chasing the spectre of
the postseason, if they can catch National League Central division
leader Houston by the end of next Sunday or if they can catch
wild-card leader New York by the end of next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, of course, bring Casey's counter-part at first
base, Mark McGwire, and if one is to believe everything McGwire
says about preferring victories over home runs, he would trade
places tonight with Casey, even though Casey has 24 home runs to
McGwire's 59.
</P>
<P>
   For those matriculating through the orange barrels and dust
surrounding the construction around Cinergy Field solely to watch
Big Mac pump baseballs into the seats, get there early enough to
watch batting practice. He doesn't do it in games against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers against the four Cincinnati pitchers he faces this
weekend are, uh, pathetic:
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris _ 1 for 4, 0 home runs. Denny Neagle _ 0 for 10,
five strikeouts, 0 home runs. Juan Guzman _ 0 for 11, five
strikeouts, 0 home runs. Ron Villone _ 0 for 3, 0 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, you better check out batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Reds won't care if McGwire hits eight home runs
over the next four days as long as they win all four games before
heading Tuesday for a two-game Showdown in the Dome against the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get to within 1 or 2 games of Houston before we
go there, somewhere in that area, then I'll take our chances,''
manager Jack McKeon said. ``We have to win these four games against
St. Louis, we can't afford to have too many bad ones right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Villone, rescued out of lifetime 911 duty out of the bullpen
during his entire major-league career and stuck into the rotation
by McKeon this year, pitched the Reds to within 2 games of Houston
Wednesday In San Diego, his ninth victory this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like being in this pennant race,'' The Big
Rig said. ``I sat around in bullpens for a couple of years watching
my teams, picking pine out of my butt. I was just along for the
ride, not contributing, not a part. Now, to be involved and to have
something to say about what is going on, man, this is why you are
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-fielder Greg Vaughn (42 homers) is beaming from a September
Home Run Explosion, 13 so far, one short of the club record for any
month (Frank Robinson, 14, in August, 1962), but his focus is on
catching Houston and the Mets rather than McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win, win, win, win,'' he said. ``If we don't win,
if we don't beat the Cardinals, it is irrelevant what the Astros
and Mets do. If we don't win, we don't have to worry about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief pitcher Danny Graves, suddenly the bullpen closer, agrees
with Vaughn that scoreboard-gaping does no good if their own
business is not attended to perfunctorily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't count on Houston losing, and we can't count on the
New York Mets losing,'' Graves said. ``We have to play our own
baseball, stay relaxed, stay focused on what we have to do to win
baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to play in April and May when nothing is on the
line,'' Graves added. ``The you can always say, `
</P>
<P>
   We'll get 'em tomorrow.' Not now. Tomorrow won't come if we
don't win today.

 &HT;    Bitter history context for Ravens, Browns matchup
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ As Cleveland Browns offensive tackle Lomas Brown
learns more about Art Modell, the discoveries continue to amaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like, I had no idea the son was hated, too,'' Brown said,
genuine surprise in his voice. ``Someone came up to me and said
they hate the son even more than the dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, David Modell could not escape the sins of his father
just by moving to Baltimore with the family and a Cleveland
institution. Players knew him as a hard-line negotiator who liked
to blow cigar smoke in their agents' faces. Fans just knew him as a
buffoonish figure who didn't fall far from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, nothing like genuine hatred to fuel a rivalry. Problem is,
only a few members of the Baltimore Ravens ever played for the
transplanted Cleveland Browns and only three of the new Browns ever
cashed paychecks from Modell. So as the Browns and Ravens prepare
to meet for the first time Sunday in Baltimore, players on both
sides find themselves caught in a hail of crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Added cornerback Antonio Langham, a former Raven, ``The fans had
every right to be angry.''
</P>
<P>
   All that's been missing this week is for Browns owner Al Lerner
to come storming into the locker room with his best Knute Rockne
speech. Like Modell, his former good friend and now bitter enemy,
Lerner has been conspicuous by his silence _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might still hear something,'' Brown said. ``I'm sure
something will leak down and we'll get the hint that they want this
one bad. Maybe on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   You can bet Modell already has communicated similar sentiments
to first-year Ravens head coach Brian Billick, although Billick did
his best to make this seem like any other game during a midweek
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the feeling it probably means a little more to them than
it does to us,'' Billick said. ``The people of Baltimore are
interested, but I don't know if they're fanatical about it the way
people in Cleveland will be. Sure, there's a certain sidebar to the
game, but that's what makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that fanatical? One group of Baltimore zanies plans to wave
diapers at the Browns, implying that Cleveland fans behaved like
babies after losing their team.
</P>
<P>
   Browns tackle Orlando ``Zeus'' Brown says he intends to stay
calm. But he makes no promises. Like Langham, he has played for the
old Browns, the Ravens and now the expansion Browns. He's seen this
rivalry grow and develop on paper, leading up to actual gridiron
conflict. ``I'm wired up,'' Brown said. ``I'm always wired up, but
if I get too wired up, then I mess up.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeus Brown vividly recalls that fateful day in 1995 when Modell
announced he was ripping the franchise away to Baltimore, office
furniture and all. Brown was in the midst of building a house in
the Cleveland area at the time and, like most everyone else, found
the transition troubling and inconvenient _ until his agent told
him Modell would have to pay his moving expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a business move to him,'' Brown said. ``He just should
have handled it more professionally. But I didn't have a choice. If
the team was moving to Alaska, I had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Escaping Baltimore at his earliest opportunity, Zeus signed with
the new Browns on Feb. 17 as an unrestricted free agent. His new
team and his old team have something in common _ both are winless.
</P>
<P>
   For Modell, losing to the Browns ``would be humiliating,'' Lomas
Brown said. ``Nobody wants to be beaten by an expansion team.
Nobody wants to be the first to lose to us. That's just cold, hard
NFL reality. Whoever loses to us, all their friends will be calling
and saying, 'You lost to those guys?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Uppermost in Zeus Brown's mind are his earliest days in
Baltimore. He remembers players walking around the locker room in
Browns gear for lack of anything more appropriate. Center Steve
Everitt even wore a Browns bandana under his helmet during a game,
infuriating Modell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what Art's thinking right now,'' Langham said. ``I'm
sure this is a game he doesn't want to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Five current Ravens played for the Browns in 1995 _ defensive
end Rob Burnett, safety Stevon Moore, kicker Matt Stover, special
teamer Bennie Thompson and defensive tackle Larry Webster. And
there are other connections. Ozzie Newsome, a Hall of Fame tight
end who played for the Browns from 1978-90, is vice president of
player personnel for the Ravens. Plus, Billick and Browns coach
Chris Palmer each interviewed for the job the other got.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are not as pumped up here as they are in Cleveland,''
Burnett said. ``But it's good for Baltimore that Cleveland has the
Browns back because that makes people in Baltimore feel like (the
Ravens) are Baltimore's team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens, who took the field in 1996, have yet to post a
winning season. They are 16-33-1 since the move, but are 12-point
favorites to beat the Browns. A Cleveland victory in the Nov. 7
rematch at Cleveland Browns Stadium might be more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Art Modell, who hasn't been back to Cleveland and
says he can't visit the city without fearing for his safety,
Orlando Brown said, ``I think it's wise for him to stay away. The
last time I saw him, I thanked him for getting me started in the
NFL and I said, `Don't come to Cleveland.'''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Knowledge is power, in the stock market as well as
other places. And until recently, regulation had assured that
anywhere in America that major stocks were traded _ whether on the
New York Stock Exchange or in some competitive market _ investors
could learn almost immediately about the size and price of each
trade.
</P>
<P>
   But something very important has been lost in the current
environment, which is reminiscent of the Maoist slogan, ``Let A
Hundred Flowers Boom.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of new places to trade has brought benefits. The
costs of executing a trade are lower than they have ever been, and
part of the reason is competition between markets for orders in the
same stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But as the number of trading markets proliferates, one important
benefit of the old system _ the visibility of trading information
to everyone interested _ has been put aside. Everyone agrees that
such visibility is a good idea, but it has not been a priority.
</P>
<P>
   In the prepared taxt of his speech on market structure at
Columbia Law School Thursday night, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, posed the following
rhetorical question: ``Today, is there `fragmentation' in the sense
that there are separate, isolated markets with reduced liquidity in
normal trading hours?'' His answer: ``I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is, although it has not become very important
yet. In its zeal to encourage competition for established markets,
the SEC has allowed the new electronic communications networks, or
ECNs in the jargon, to begin trading without having any way to
distribute their quotes to public investors in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the essential part of Levitt's question was the phrase
``in normal trading hours.'' Outside those hours, the market
fragmentation is real and troubling. After hours, the ECNs are the
only markets open to the public. If late trading catches on _ so
far, there has been more talk about it than actual trading _
investors may find themselves at a serious disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before he delivered his speech Thursday, Levitt
said he was determined to arrange for such disclosures. But he
seemed surprised by the idea that the SEC should not have allowed
such trading to proceed until disclosures were assured.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the delay is the way the system of distributing
quotes grew. The consolidated tape, which handles trades from most
exchanges, and the NASDAQ tape, which handles its trades, are a
vital source of income to the exchanges and NASDAQ. Some exchanges
would be in financial trouble without the income they get from
selling the information on the tapes to companies and individuals.
The new exchanges want to get in on that money, and the old
exchanges are not eager to let them in. In any case, the tape is
not open during some of the hours that after-hours trading now
takes place.
</P>
<P>
   While the arguments continue over how to distribute the
information, and over who will profit from it, the trading is
taking place without dissemination. It is the investors who may be
the losers.

SEPARATING CYNICISM AND SHOCK: THE REAL COSTS OF AN ART DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MUSEUM-GIULIANI)  
(lh) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So the culture wars continue unabated, tragedy long
ago having turned to farce. This time Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is
playing the role of stern dad to a group of British artists whom he
seems to regard as naughty teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing Wednesday that he would seek to cut off all city
subsidies to the Brooklyn Museum of Art if it did not cancel
``Sensation,'' a show of contemporary British art scheduled to open
next week, the mayor was reacting with a number of individuals and
groups, including the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brooklyn and the
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, consisting of works belonging to Charles
Saatchi, the London advertising executive and collector, includes a
collage of the Virgin Mary with cutouts from pornographic magazines
and several shellacked clumps of elephant dung, which particularly
offended the league.
</P>
<P>
   One may be excused for initially regarding the entire incident
with skepticism. We have young artists doing what young artists
always do to get attention. We have a museum undertaking the show
in the knowledge that a publicity circus makes for good box office.
</P>
<P>
   In London, where it was first shown two years ago, ``Sensation''
caused the predictable protests and attracted record crowds to the
Royal Academy of Arts, which organized it. The Brooklyn Museum,
hoping to generate similar excitement, has announced that children
under 17 must be accompanied by an adult in the exhibition, which
the museum is also promoting with a warning that it ``may cause
shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what is in the show would not shock anyone, least of all
a teen-ager. Some of it is remarkably clever and strangely
beautiful. A lot of it is absolutely forgettable. Curiously,
several of the more startling works in it, like the multiply
genitaled mannequins by Jake and Dinos Chapman, have so far gone
unmentioned by the mayor or any other objectors. The Chapmans, like
several artists in the exhibition, have been showing their work in
New York for years, to little effect outside art circles. The New
York art world, priding itself on its inability to be shocked, was
expecting, if anything, that ``Sensation'' would pass without
enough fuss, since it is already old news to insiders. The shock is
that it actually has caused such a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   The culture wars having devolved, in part, into a cynical
exercise, they engender cynical reactions. So we note that the
Brooklyn Museum, jealous of the Brooklyn Academy of Music as a
destination for the chic, has taken on an exhibit that plays to a
fashionable crowd.
</P>
<P>
   We also note that a year ago, the mayor did not threaten to
withdraw city money when the Catholic League protested a production
at City Center, a city-supported institution, of Terrence McNally's
play ``Corpus Christi,'' involving a gay character fashioned after
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might wonder whether that was because last year he was
not absorbed by a race for the Senate. Thursday, the mayor stepped
up his threats to the museum. He insists that he is personally
offended by the art in ``Sensation,'' and he has a history of
trying to rout whatever offends him from the city. But is it unfair
to wonder if his sudden interest in contemporary British art (he
has not seen the show, by the way, just the catalog) involves the
potential political capital to be gained in a Senate campaign by
appealing to conservative Roman Catholic voters? If nothing else,
he is certainly putting his potential rival, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, in the position of having to say whether she supports
public money for the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   We also note that the mayor seemed to misspeak, provocatively,
when, in explaining his action Wednesday, he said, ``You don't have
a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's
religion.'' The mayor's remark will certainly resonate in a
polyglot city where, for more than a century, the line of
permissible speech has tended to be drawn, rightly or not, at
attacks on people of another race or religion.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Ofili, the artist of ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' is
himself a Roman Catholic, and his work, although clearly meant to
be provocative, may be regarded as a genuine, if not particularly
brilliant, stab at a subject involving his own upbringing. He has
described seeing paintings of the Virgin Mary and noticing ``how
sexually charged they are,'' an observation that is perfectly fair.
His cutouts of buttocks from pornographic magazines are allusions
to naked putti in Old Master paintings. Times change. Naked
children in Old Master paintings become putti. One's man blasphemy
is another's faith.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth recalling that Paolo Veronese, a devout Catholic,
was called before the Inquisition in 1573, his Venetian
interrogators complaining that a version he had painted of the
``Last Supper'' contained details that seemed to them sacrilegious.
The offending parts included several liveried black pages and two
soldiers in German dress. In the end, Veronese simply changed the
title of the picture to ``Feast in the House of Levi,'' which is
now one of the revered landmarks of the Italian Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months ago, the city celebrated the Lincoln Center
Festival's staging of ``The Peony Pavilion,'' the Chinese opera
that officials in Shanghai had tried to stop. New York was not
going to be deterred by the remarks of Chinese authorities who said
they considered the production pornographic. It was said here that
the real issue was local politics in Shanghai. Telling the
difference between offensive content and political maneuvering can
sometimes be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's threat guarantees the inevitable polarized
reactions. An all-too-familiar piety play is now restaged. Artists
and art institutions must defend the show and the museum on the
grounds of freedom of expression, even if, privately, they may not
like the work or endorse the museum's motives. Having learned from
the bitter experience of places like the Corcoran Gallery in
Washington, which backed out of a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition a
decade ago in the face of congressional pressure, then found itself
even more vigorously attacked by other museums, the Brooklyn Museum
has little choice but to proceed with the show, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it did not anticipate that in New York City, the great
cultural capital, any mayor would go so far as to shake the
security of a major, historic institution that has one of the
nation's premier art collections and serves an ethnically diverse
population. Playing on the implication of cultural elitism, the
mayor has threatened one of the least elitist of the big cultural
institutions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The effect of a decadelong culture war is, among other things,
to have savaged the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts,
which for years had provided the country with money to support
local museums, orchestras, educational programs and much else that
offended no one and benefited many. For the mayor potentially to
withhold money from the Brooklyn Museum is to have the practical
effect of making some of the great works of Egyptian, Asian,
American, American Indian and European art unavailable, or at least
less available, to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It is rarely the provocateurs or the politicians who end up
getting hurt in the war; they end up getting publicity. It's
everyone else who is wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there can be no underestimating the genuine pain
that works like those in ``Sensation'' can cause people, most
particularly Christians who may find the art world's refined
justifications for Ofili and his colleagues inadequate, if not
callous. Roman Catholics, Italian-Americans and white Anglo-Saxon
Protestants, among others, sometimes argue that they are treated by
artists as acceptable targets while other groups are taboo. It is a
fair question: Would the defenders of art react the same if the
image were of Rosa Parks rather than the Virgin Mary?
</P>
<P>
   But no race or issue is actually untouchable in the arts. In
another time, Michelangelo offended the church with his ``Last
Judgment.'' From the sublime to the absurd, Mel Brooks, a Jew,
famously made light of the Holocaust and slavery in ``The
Producers'' and ``History of the World, Part I.'' Maybe we should
all lighten up.

RYDER CUP GETS DREAM MATCHUP: WOODS VS. GARCIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Clearly, the golf gods are in agreement with
the general public. They, too, want to see Tiger Woods play Sergio
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup matchup that most fans were hoping to see came
spilling out of the respective captains' envelopes yesterday, when
the names of the two youngest players at The Country Club were both
listed in the second alternate-shot match of today's morning
session.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 23, will be paired with U.S. teammate Tom Lehman. Garcia,
19, will join forces with European teammate Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time for Woods and Garcia, the top two
finishers at the 1999 PGA Championship, to be paired in the same
group during competition. Ben Crenshaw, the U.S. captain, said he
was pleased to see the pairings _ decided independently and turned
in simultaneously by the respective captains _ fall the way they
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two of the most exciting people in the world to watch
play golf,'' Crenshaw said. ``It's something people want to see.
It's got the other players excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Garcia said they are enthused about the matchup, but
stressed that each must depend on a teammate during today's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one-on-one,'' Woods said. ``It's alternate shot, and
you only have to hit half the shots. It's not necessarily
head-to-head.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's close enough to generate added intrigue for today's
second match.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said: ``I'm excited. I wanted to play against Tiger.
Probably more people will be watching our game because it's a good
match. They are strong, but we are strong, too.'' \Nsubheds:Major
champs sit In announcing today's alternate-shot pairings, three
players who have won major championships were left off the list.
Sitting out the morning matches will be U.S. players Justin Leonard
(1997 British Open) and Mark O'Meara (1998 British Open, 1998
Masters), as well as Europe's Jose Maria Olazabal, a two-time
Masters champ.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara and Olazabal have been struggling with their games in
recent weeks and shared that insight with their respective
captains. Leonard, a Dallas resident, was a captain's decision by
Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough one,'' Crenshaw said. ``But I told him to be
ready for the afternoon matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, the biggest surprise was Olazabal. On a European
team that features seven rookies, Olazabal (14-8-3) and Colin
Montgomerie (9-6-3) are the only golfers with winning records at
the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, however, asked to be held out of the alternate-shot
competition because his driving has been erratic in practice
sessions. European captain Mark James obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, he's perfect,'' said Sam Torrance, the assistant
captain for the European team. ``But his drive has been off ... and
he told Mark, `I'm not quite ready.' I think that's awesome he
would do that. That's being honest.'' \Nsubheds:Europeans amused by
U.S. boasts Several U.S. players have uttered bulletin-board
material in advance of the Ryder Cup, with Payne Stewart saying:
``On paper, they shouldn't even be caddying for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the comment that has drawn the greatest response from the
European contingent was Jeff Maggert's claim that the U.S. team
consisted of ``the 12 best players in the world.'' To be precise,
U.S. players hold down nine of the top 14 spots in the world golf
rankings. Maggert, a Houston resident and former Texas A&AMP;M golfer,
is No. 16, behind Europeans Colin Montgomerie (No. 3), Lee Westwood
(No. 5) and Jesper Parnevik (No. 15).
</P>
<P>
   Told that Maggert believed the United States had the world's top
12 players, European captain Mark James smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they?'' James said. ``I've always said the world rankings
are wrong. I'm glad Jeff agrees with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood shrugged off Maggert's statement as Texana bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only from Jeff Maggert. And he's from Texas,'' Westwood
said. \Nsubheds:Briefly Europe's Jarmo Sandelin has changed caddies
for the Ryder Cup, benching girlfriend Linda Lundberg in favor of
European Tour regular Tim King. ``I thought it might save some
shots,'' Sandelin said. ``She's behind me. We both agree the team
is the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson, 87, was among the past U.S. Ryder Cup captains who
attended yesterday's opening ceremonies. He was the only one who
received a standing ovation.

SOWARD: HE'S STILL CENTRAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Linebacker Markus Steele has barely been a Trojan
for one month, but that's more than enough time to recognize the
most delicate issue always confronting the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't block him out of your head because R. Jay is R.
Jay,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday afternoon, Steele talked to wide receiver R. Jay
Soward, who wasn't in the best mood after being limited to a pair
of receptions in USC's 24-21 victory over San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Everything the demonstrative and explosive Soward does gets
magnified and he is nearly impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   If Soward has a big game, everyone knows it. If he catches just
two passes, as against San Diego State, everyone wonders what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He got ripped by college football analyst Bob Griese for not
trying harder to catch a ball that was intercepted and returned for
a touchdown by San Diego State. Soward was also criticized for
running off the field and throwing his helmet to the ground after a
teammate caught a touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   The question, as USC prepares for its third game of the season
Saturday night at Oregon, is : Does the attention and scrutiny
surrounding every move Soward makes become a distraction to the
Trojans?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know R. Jay. He's just frustrated because things
are not going his way,'' Steele said. ``He gets a little mad, but
he doesn't have a bad attitude. The Hawaii game, he didn't worry
about (his stats), but the San Diego State game, you saw a
different R. Jay.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steele didn't necessarily like the things he saw in that
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't even chase the cornerback that intercepted the
ball,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has been mostly silent this week, declining to offer an
opinion on his quiet start. But it's clear most of his teammates
are usually aware of his unique presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in his own world doing his own thing,'' offensive tackle
Travis Claridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who has caught 11 passes in
USC's first two games _ six more than Soward _ realizes his awkward
position after stealing the spotlight in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say he's upset with me or mad at me,'' Kelly said.
``No one should be upset with me. I don't have anything to do with
that. R. Jay's a senior and should get all the balls, but I guess
he can't get all the balls now that I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly doesn't believe a feud will develop between the receivers
and has actually credited Soward with helping him learn USC's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Windrell (Hayes), they're role models. They help me,''
Kelly said. ``They've been looking after me. I really didn't know
the system too well.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players believe Soward serves another purpose for Kelly
and USC's other two freshmen receivers (Marcell Allmond and Steve
Stevenson).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can be a positive if they see him do things they
shouldn't,'' Claridge said. ``Then they know how they should act.''
</P>
<P>
   If Soward is frustrated, he's probably wondering why he had such
a limited role against San Diego State. The answer depends on who
you ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been numerous plays called in his direction, but
whether it be coverage or execution, it doesn't quite happen the
way it should,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``He's probably had
less production than any of us thought he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consistency in his play is lacking. He needs to be a more
consistent route runner and performer in order to step up his
game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coaches have also pointed to San Diego State's double
coverage, which prevented Soward from having a breakout
performance. But even that theory has some holes in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he got too much double coverage,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   That would add fuel to the speculation that Soward continues to
be punished for skipping summer workouts at USC, while about 70
percent of the team attended every scheduled workout. Even
Hackett's answers at his weekly press conference seemed to allude
to that touchy topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``R. Jay is still feeling his way with (quarterback) Carson
Palmer,'' Hackett said. ``The quarterback and receiver have to be
on the same page. Carson and Windrell were together in the summer
and have been on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the 13 games Soward played with Palmer last season
didn't help much.
</P>
<P>
   If the San Diego State game served any purpose, it seems to have
raised the level at which Soward is practicing this week. There
have been far fewer drops and more spectacular catches than any
previous week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he has a different attitude,'' free safety David
Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   The test comes Saturday night. Hayes, who has a sprained ankle,
is expected to miss the game. That leaves Soward as the only
experienced receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the experience of R. Jay needs to come to the
forefront,'' Hackett said. ``I think it's time for R. Jay to do
what we all know he's capable of doing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa _ ``In Soweto,'' a tour guide named Chris
Gumbi said, ``we have one of the most popular cars, the German car,
the BMW. We have many names for it. You can say: Beat My Wife.
Break My Window. Bob Marley and the Wailers. Bicycle of Soweto. It
is the easiest car for the mafias to have.''
</P>
<P>
   He was perhaps pandering a bit to the crowd: Gumbi, 29, once
fought with the African National Congress' army, but these days he
takes rich tourists around South Africa's most famous black
township, the spring for the uprisings that finally drowned
apartheid, and the home that Nelson Mandela returned to after
prison.
</P>
<P>
   And so the tourists expect something edgy. What most of them
probably do not know is that five years after black rule began in
South Africa, Soweto is not so adventurous anymore: It has become
one of the nation's most popular tourist destinations, with visits
there rising even as tourism slackens in South Africa in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people coming to South Africa, Soweto is a must for any
itinerary,'' said Jenny Briscoe, executive director for Gold Reef
Guides, which provides and trains licensed tour guides around the
country. ``It has been a must for the last year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Soweto is still very poor and at times violent. But each day as
many as 1,700 tourists, most of them whites from Europe or America,
come here. They wander around squatter camps with their fancy
cameras, give money to street children and _ the locals hope _
learn how terrible South Africa was and, in the poorest places, can
still be.
</P>
<P>
   Soweto's success has encouraged at least one other well-known
black township, Alexandra, to train its own tour guides. Alexandra,
considered more dangerous than Soweto, has nothing to rival
Mandela's old house (he lives now in Houghton, a Johannesburg
suburb), or the current homes of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela or
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, both in Soweto.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexandra does have the room where Mandela lived when he
first moved to Johannesburg as a young man, now next door to the
home of Emily Bopape, a woman known as Ma who is famous in her own
right for her home-brewed pineapple beer.
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, Soweto _ once Southwestern
Township _ is now the 16th-most popular place among tourists in
South Africa. Mandela's home, just down Villagazi Street from
Tutu's house, opened to the public in December 1997, and that
appears to be responsible for part of the rise in interest.
</P>
<P>
   Ngugi Githuka, who gives tours of the little house where Mandela
lived before his 27 years in prison and where Winnie Mandela, now
his ex-wife, escaped many attempts on her life, said this past year
was the busiest ever. He said that he, like many people in Soweto,
is both pleased and heartened by the number of foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world needs to be educated so this kind of history doesn't
happen again,'' said Githuka, who is married to one of Mandela's
nieces. ``People actually get shocked at what was perpetrated here.
It's good to open people's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Soweto do not have much bad to say about the tourists.
Tour operators say they have had no cases of tourists being robbed
or hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Mawela, a 28-year-old Soweto resident, said it is a
shame that some tourists are cheated by people who claim to run
orphanages and ask for money. But all in all, she said, it is good
to have outsiders see ``our life story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect them,'' she said, warming her hands over a charcoal
stove in a squatter village as a family of slightly uncomfortable
British tourists wandered by. ``They respect us as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme for the tours seems to be: Soweto, the Good, the Bad
and the Ugly. Gumbi and Ms. Briscoe, who do not know each other,
both used that slogan. Gumbi, a guide for Max Maximum Tours, hews
cheerily to the theme with a patter and timing perfected in five
years of leading Soweto tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I make a deal?'' he asked his passengers in a beat-up
minibus early in the tour. ``I will give you a free tour _ you
don't pay at all _ if we see less than 20 BMWs. But we see more,
you have to pay me double.''
</P>
<P>
   BMWs are in fact everywhere. Not all of them, he said, were
acquired legally. He pointed out a library and mentioned offhand:
``There is something strange about it. There are no books inside
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a tour of Mandela Village, a tattered squatter camp with
six water taps and 90 toilets for 11,000 people, one tourist, an
elderly German woman, broke down weeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very sorry, ma'am,'' Gumbi said. ``That is part of the
living of Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the way, the bad merges with the good.
Across roads from tin shacks are the brick mansions of the wealthy
and the modest homes of the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   One popular site is the memorial to Hector Peterson, a
12-year-old boy killed by South African policemen in 1976 at the
beginning of the uprisings that many historians say were the
beginning of the end for apartheid. Gumbi marveled that two Nobel
Peace Prize winners, Mandela and Tutu, lived on the same street in
one poor part of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   On that street Sergio Guzman, 47, a Texan and development worker
who moved to South Africa only this summer, brought his wife and
two children to see Mandela's house. He was glad he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's touching,'' he said. ``This is history.''

LEHMAN SHAKES OFF '98 WOES AND REPORTS STRONG EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just one year after rumors of its impending demise
swept around trading desks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. is on its way to its most profitable year.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize investment banking firm reported third-quarter
earnings that were nearly double its profits in the period a year
earlier, when a sudden selloff in global financial markets slashed
the value of bonds Lehman held and stirred speculation about the
firm's solvency. Lehman executives fought hard last fall to quell
that speculation and, analysts said, the firm's performance this
year proves them out.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months that ended Aug. 31, Lehman posted a 92
percent increase in net income, to $290 million, or $2.20 a diluted
share, up from $151 million, or $1.10 a share, in the third quarter
of 1998. Those results exceeded the $2.01 a share expected by
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   But the news provided no lift to Lehman shares, which closed at
$53.375, down $1.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's profitability, as measured by its return on
stockholders' equity, rose substantially to 22.1 percent from 13.1
percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management of Lehman has really had the last laugh on the
investment community,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. ``What people don't really recognize is the substantial
makeover in its business mix that Lehman has successfully pulled
off.''
</P>
<P>
   That shift was never so evident as in the last quarter when
strong gains in Lehman's growing businesses in investment banking,
stock sales and trading easily offset weakness in its bond
businesses, which are shrinking in importance for Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, revenue from investment banking rose just 1 percent to
$498 million last quarter, from $493 million a year earlier. But
those totals include changes in the value of merchant-banking
investments; excluding them, Lehman's investment banking revenue
rose more than 12 percent from the 1998 period, John Cecil,
Lehman's chief financial officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil said the firm had its best quarter ever in stock sales and
trading, a business that traditionally is more profitable than the
bond businesses Lehman once specialized in. The bond businesses now
account for only about one-third of Lehman's revenue, down from
about 60 percent just five years ago, Cecil said.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Lehman's revenue for the quarter declined 20 percent,
to $4.77 billion from $5.96 billion. That drop reflects some of the
changes Lehman has made since last year's market tumult, including
its decision to reduce the risks it takes in global bond markets
and to shrink its overall balance sheet, Cecil said.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banking and stock sales and trading combined
contribute about two-thirds of Lehman's revenue. Cecil said that 77
percent of the firm's revenue growth over the last four years has
come from those two areas.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has also made a push to expand its advisory operations in
the mergers and acquisitions that are rolling across Europe, where
it competes with bigger investment banks, like Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group. Among Lehman's successes
there last quarter was a lead role in advising Olivetti on its
hard-won acquisition of Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Kraushaar estimates that Lehman now derives about 40 percent of
its earnings from Europe. ``Their position in Europe is
extraordinarily good,'' he said.

 &HT;    Spreading it around
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After Jeff Gordon won a NASCAR record-tying 13 races
last year, race fans complained about a select few drivers
dominating the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been as much to gripe about this season, especially
during the last two months. Winston Cup parity, if it ever exists,
seems to be at an all-time high. Seven different drivers have won
the last seven races, including Joe Nemechek's unexpected victory
at New Hampshire last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid rotation in victory lane causes NASCAR to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I think it's great,'' said Kevin Triplett,
NASCAR's director of operations. ``We never said that we were going
to have 30 winners a year. All we said is that we have 30 teams
capable of winning _ and we really believe that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens (often) is you get nine to 12 teams that have
really good years, and they are the ones that win the majority of
races. We feel like the competition has always been there, and it
is even greater now than it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Races have been won by 11 different drivers, including Gordon
and Jeff Burton with five each. That hasn't happened since 1994.
With eight races remaining, the decade's high of 14 (in both 1990
and '91 seasons) is within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NASCAR is incredibly competitive,'' Burton said.
``There are a number of teams who every week have a chance to win
at any given track. It takes a tremendous amount of focus week-in
and week-out to perform at the level we are expected to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why NASCAR is so successful. You don't know at the
beginning of a race who is going to win, and more often than not,
you don't know until the checkered flag. I know I've been involved
in a number of races where, on the final lap, the race could've
gone to a number of different drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte was headed for the winner's circle at Bristol
before being spun out on the final lap by Dale Earnhardt. A
rain-shortened event at Darlington prevented a race-ending showdown
between brothers Jeff and Ward Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around and think there are maybe three or four teams
that should win all the races,'' Ward Burton said. ``And you look
around again and you think maybe there are 10 or 15 teams that are
capable of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Week in and week out, there are a lot of teams capable. When
it's your turn, you'd better be ready to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemechek took advantage of his opportunity at New Hampshire,
winning his first Cup race in 180 career starts. With rookie Tony
Stewart winning at Richmond the week before, the circuit had
back-to-back first-time winners for the first time since the 1970
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the hardest thing in the world to win a Winston
Cup race,'' Nemechek said, ``but I do feel like the competition is
getting closer and closer every race. Anything can happen on any
given day in this sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stewart: ``The fans love to see the driver's emotions when
he wins for the first time. I think they like seeing all the
different winners. It's refreshing for the fans, the drivers and
NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemechek's victory is being mentioned _ with Derrike Cope's at
the 1990 Daytona 500 _ as one of stock car racing's biggest
surprises. It has given hope to a lot of other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what (Nemechek) did, there are a lot of us thinking
about a win,'' Steve Park said. ``Not that we weren't thinking
about it before, but when someone goes out and shows it can be
done, then it makes it a little bit more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be a frustrating business. But the thing about this
business is that it can all turn around in a hurry, and Joe showed
how you do that.''

 &HT;    Irvan taking a seat
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The recently retired Ernie Irvan was inducted into the
Court of Legends at Charlotte, N.C.'s Lowe's Motor Speedway, where
he was known for more than just his driving skills.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Irvan could be found welding grandstand seats
in turn 1, and he achieved almost legendary status among his
co-workers for being able to construct a thousand seats per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I needed a job,'' said Irvan, who showed at the
induction announcement that he remembered how to weld seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at my dad's house trying to build a race car without a
lot of money, and my dad didn't have a whole lot of money, so I
went to work,'' he said. ``I guess that's what I've done most of my
life. And again, nobody's gonna hand you anything on a silver
platter; you have to work for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, who was named one of NASCAR's 50 all-time greatest
drivers, retired on Sept. 3 after 15 years of racing. He had 15
career victories
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HE SAID
</P>
<P>
   ``Dover's tough. Dover is Bristol on steroids. You've got those
big, high banks, and driving into them kind of looks like you're
driving into a concrete wall. Your mind kind of fools you for
little while, and you sit there and think, 'Now, that track does
turn left up there, doesn't it?''' _ Kyle Petty
</P>
<P>
   REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Bobby Labonte to provide his own report card for the
No. 18 team. ``I think we've had an A+ year,'' said Labonte, who
has moved ahead of Mark Martin for second place in the Winston Cup
points standings. ``I don't think we're out of it (catching leader
Dale Jarrett). We're not going to back off or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC LOVERS
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt may be ``The Intimidator'' at the race track, but
he is no tough guy when it comes to his taste in music. ``I like a
whole bunch of stuff, like Natalie Merchant, or Sarah McLachlan,
Sheryl Crow and even Mozart,'' Earnhardt told Inside NASCAR
Magazine. Jeff Gordon fessed up to owning a Barry Manilow CD, and
Dale Jarrett has listened to the Spice Girls and N'SYNC _ only
because his two daughters and wife often control the radio.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING A POINT
</P>
<P>
   A look at point totals earned since the July 3 Pepsi 400 in
Daytona:
</P>
<P>
   1. Tony Stewart. . . 1,422
</P>
<P>
   2. Dale Jarrett. . . 1,298
</P>
<P>
   3. Jeff Gordon. . . 1,274
</P>
<P>
   4. Mark Martin. . . 1,260
</P>
<P>
   5. Dale Earnhardt. . . 1,233
</P>
<P>
   6. Bobby Labonte. . . 1,221
</P>
<P>
   7. Jeff Burton. . . 1,157
</P>
<P>
   8. Rusy Wallace. . . 1,110
</P>
<P>
   9. Steve Park. . . 1,064
</P>
<P>
   10. Wally Dallenbach. . . 1,027
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S HOT
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Benson had a season-best finish of seventh at New
Hampshire and climed from 25th to 22nd in the point standings.
Making the top 20 is critical for Benson, who is seeking a ride for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S NOT
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Wallace (left) is the only driver that has competed in
every race this season and has yet to lead a lap.... Terry Labonte
has finished 17th or worse in four or the last five races.

 &HT;    Sticking by a decision
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Felix Sabates is man of many words, but he stands by them.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken race-team owner told Joe Nemechek months ago that
he would not be retained after this season. Nemechek provided Team
Sabco with a rare victory at New Hampshire last last Sunday, but
Sabates is sticking by his word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision, and you can't look back on the decision
you make,'' Sabates said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin will drive the No. 42 car next year, with an
announcement expected at the season-ending Atlanta race. Nemechek,
who has yet to find a new ride, should expect a fancy farewell
gift. The last time Sabates had a driver make it to victory lane _
Kyle Petty in 1995 _ he bought him a Rolls-Royce and motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so much confidence (at the beginning of this year), I
went out and bought five Rolexes,'' Sabates said. ``I figured we'd
either win five races or five poles or a combination of the two. So
far, we've used three of five and we've got eight races to go. Now,
it looks like those Rolexes won't spoil.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitable breakup
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon and Ray Evernham have been working together since
1992, longer than any other current Winston Cup combination of crew
chief and driver. However, Evernham has told his crew he'll
discontinue his duties soon, most likely at the end of the season.
His plans probably are to move into a management role over all the
Hendrick Motorsports teams; to develop a full-time team at
Gordon-Evernham Motorsports; or to join Cal Wells with the new
Tide-sponsored Cup team next year....
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, Tony Stewart and Bill Elliott were a few of the
Cup drivers scheduled to participate in the Jeff Gordon-DuPont
Motorsports Golf Classic in Dover on Thursday. Money was raised for
the Leukemia Society of America. ``When your crew chief's son (Ray
Jr.) and your team owner (Rick Hendrick) are both affected by this
terrible disease, it hits home,'' Gordon said....
</P>
<P>
   With three career victories at Dover, Rusty Wallace is excited
about returning to the concrete track this weekend. Wallace's gas
man, Bob Tracey, is not as thrilled. Tracey broke his foot in two
places during a pit stop at the May race. ``Hey, I'm going by the
theory that lightning never strikes twice in the same place,''
Tracey said. Bristol crackdown
</P>
<P>
   Bristol Motor Speedway has put warnings for scalpers on the back
of its tickets for the 2000 season. The August night race at
Bristol is the sport's hottest ticket. The track sold out 12,700
new grandstand seats in three hours earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   BUSCH SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Herman Sadler takes ride
</P>
<P>
   Hermie Sadler, brother of Cup driver Elliott Sadler, will
operate the No. 47 Chevy for the remaining six Busch races of the
season. Ward Burton filled in for the team at Richmond after Andy
Santerre abruptly resigned because of personal reasons.... Lance
Dieters, former crew chief for Adam Petty, has been hired to work
with driver Mike Dillon and Richard Childress Racing's No. 21 car
for next year.

MORGAN STANLEY IS ORDERED TO PRODUCE BIAS-SUIT FILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. has lost a round in
its legal battle with an employee who complained to the federal
government that the investment banking company discriminated
against her and other women.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Manhattan ruled that Morgan Stanley must turn
over to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission all formal
complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination that have been
filed since Jan. 1, 1995, by the firm's employees in the United
States. Those records could include complaints filed by employees
of the firm's Dean Witter brokerage arm as well as its various
businesses that cater to institutional clients.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, is an early
victory in what could be a long fight for Allison K. Schieffelin, a
securities saleswoman for Morgan Stanley who filed a complaint
against the investment banking firm with the commission late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schieffelin, 38, who continues to work for Morgan Stanley,
contends that she was repeatedly denied promotions because she is a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will enable the EEOC to take a look at the whole company
and not just one division,'' said Wayne Outten, a lawyer who
represents Ms. Schieffelin. ``It will help them determine whether
there's a pattern and practice of discriminating on the basis of
gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Grossman, a lawyer handling the case for the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, declined to comment on the
matter because the commission has not yet decided whether to file
suit against Morgan Stanley or to let Ms. Schieffelin file her own
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The commission took up Ms. Schieffelin's cause and began a broad
investigation of Morgan Stanley, issuing a subpoena for a variety
of documents that might help to prove her assertion that other
women have been victims of discriminatory practices at Morgan
Stanley. Ms. Schieffelin complained that Morgan Stanley excluded
her and other women from firm-sponsored outings, including trips to
golf resorts and visits to strip clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter
Thursday. But the judge's ruling refers to papers that the firm has
filed in the case, which counter that ``at least two outings in
1994 and 1995 were open to male and female employees and that the
`entertainment at topless bars was, at most, infrequent.'''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley resisted the commission's efforts to investigate
and went to court to try to head it off. At a court hearing on Aug.
31, the judge ruled that Morgan Stanley should turn over all the
internal complaints. The firm's lawyers appealed that decision,
arguing that the commission was asking for data that were not
relevant to Ms. Schieffelin's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge denied that request, writing in her order that
``the formal complaints the EEOC seeks may `cast light' on
Schieffelin's allegations regarding the existence of the
discrimination she has allegedly experienced as well as the
existence of the class-wide discrimination she describes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two sides are scheduled to meet again next week
to resolve the remaining issues concerning what information Morgan
Stanley will have to make available to the commission as it
conducts its investigation.

MILKEN-SUPPORTED LIBEL SUIT AGAINST A WRITER IS DISMISSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A State Supreme Court justice dismissed a $35 million
libel lawsuit against the best-selling author James B. Stewart on
Thursday. The suit, which had been pursued for seven years, had
been subsidized in part by the brother of the fallen junk bond
investment banker, Michael Milken.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit centered on one paragraph in Stewart's book ``Den of
Thieves,'' which explored Wall Street's insider trading scandals of
the 1980s and the roles of Milken and his brother, Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Michael F. Armstrong, a criminal defense lawyer
who represented Lowell Milken, filed the suit in 1992 against
Stewart, his research assistant and his publisher, Simon &AMP;
Schuster. Armstrong argued that the book wrongly accused him of
preparing a false affidavit for a witness to sign to exonerate
Lowell Milken on charges of violating security laws.
</P>
<P>
   Milken was not a party to the lawsuit, but in a unique
arrangement he and his wife set up a general partnership to lend
Armstrong and his law firm up to $1.6 million for legal expenses,
with the understanding that the loan would not have to be repaid if
the lawsuit failed.
</P>
<P>
   In his written opinion, issued Thursday in Manhattan, Justice
Barry A. Cozier found that the passage in the book concerning
Armstrong was substantially true. It described Armstrong's efforts
to prepare an affidavit supporting Lowell Milken with information
from an in-house lawyer, Craig M. Cogut, who read over the material
and refused to sign it because ``the facts weren't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong argued earlier this summer in an interview that the
offending paragraph made it appear that ``I prepared a bunch of
lies, gave it to my client, and he didn't sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Cozier wrote, ``The testimony demonstrates that
as the book portrayed, Armstrong prepared an affidavit, exonerating
Lowell Milken, which Cogut rejected because it contained
significant inaccuracies and Cogut, upset about the drafting
process, was eventually compelled to retain new counsel to assist
him in drafting an accurate affidavit, which was the only one he
would agree to sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Eugene Licker, an attorney for Armstrong, said that
his client intended to appeal the decision dismissing the lawsuit.
But Simon &AMP; Schuster praised the judge's decision and the
publisher's lawyer, Bob Cusumano, vowed to counter any attempt to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just continue to fight, but at some point I would hope
that Mr. Armstrong _ who is himself a lawyer _ would have some
respect for the First Amendment and let it go,'' Cusumano said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who recently published ``Blind Eye,'' a best-selling
book about a physician accused of killing patients, said he
welcomed the end to a ``nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that it will inspire other journalists to persist
even if they are writing about wealthy and powerful subjects,'' he
said. ``I've always thought that the main purpose of this lawsuit
was to discourage coverage of the Milkenses in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Milken, chairman of the Milken Institute in California,
did not respond to calls Thursday for comment about the dismissal
of the lawsuit.

BANDITS: THE SAGA OF A CRIMINAL BAND OF RUNAWAY MUSICIANS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(rk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reminiscent of ``Thelma and Louise,'' the German-language film
``Bandits'' is a celebration of liberated sisterhood and the
rebellious, anarchic spirit of youth that animates the best of
rock'n'roll.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the liberation is literal, because the four
heroines of ``Bandits'' are prison inmates who overpower a drunken,
boorish guard and escape with a police van while on an outing to
perform as a band at a policemen's ball.
</P>
<P>
   Part chase, part road movie, part music video, part fantasy,
part social comedy, ``Bandits,'' directed by Katja von Garnier and
based on a screenplay she wrote with Uwe Wilhelm, sags slightly as
it nears its conclusion. But its winning cast, spirited music and
mordant view of establishment figures, from the police to
cocaine-sniffing record industry executives, make ``Bandits'' a
stylish, buoyant entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The runaway band consists of the tough, volatile Luna (Jasmin
Tabatabai), serving time for robbery; the alluring Angel (Nicolette
Krebitz), in prison for bigamy and fraud, and the older,
philosophical Marie (Jutta Hoffmann), who poisoned her husband. At
the outset of the film, they are two guitarists and a keyboardist
in search of a drummer.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to their quest turns out to be a new inmate, an
aloof, repressed, intelligent former music student, Emma (Katja
Riemann), who shot a man in a jazz band who beat her.
</P>
<P>
   Once they escape, the musicians, who call their ensemble the
Bandits, become the object of a search led by a police inspector,
Schwartz (Hannes Jaenicke), who boasts that he never fails to wind
up a case before he finishes a pack of cigarillos.
</P>
<P>
   When television and newspapers fail to report the women's
escape, they agree to an interview that prompts a recording
executive who has previously rejected their tapes to pay them
$21,000 for rights to their music.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the Bandits make their way toward Hamburg, where they
have arranged passage aboard a ship bound for Guyana, they find
their faces plastered on billboards, their CDs flying off the
shelves and a new status as cult idols. Eluding capture and
performing as they go, they make a not-so-reluctant hostage of
West, a good-looking young American tourist (Werner Schreyer), a
character analogous to Brad Pitt in ``Thelma and Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   With their well-defined personalities, growing self-confidence
and lively music, revealed by Ms. von Garnier in deft cinematic
style, the Bandits remain good company right to the familiar
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandits'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes uninhibited language and scenes of
seduction and sex.

NFL'S LATEST CAMPAIGN STACKS ITS LEGENDS AGAINST TODAY'S STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J.)   (af)  
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an effort to rally fans, the National Football
League is bringing together its past and present as the 80th
professional football season gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans and rookies are the focus of the league's
multimillion-dollar advertising barrage for the 1999-2000 season.
The goal of the campaign, which carries the theme ``Feel the
Power'' for the fourth year, is what the NFL calls fan development:
reinforcing ties with so-called core fans, most of whom are men,
and gaining the attention of those known as casual fans, many of
whom are women, children, teen-agers and 20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious advertising and marketing effort is emblematic of
the intensifying effort to sell sports programming to viewers even
when surveys show that fans continue to anticipate coming seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that we're doing across the fan development side of
things is about getting people to spend more time viewing our
games, increasing their inclination to attend our games,'' said
Howard Handler, senior vice president for marketing and fan
development at NFL Properties in New York.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Properties, the league's in-house marketing unit, is
responsible for the campaign along with NFL Films in Mount Laurel,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The message this year, Handler said, is that NFL football offers
``a timeless passion that brings people together,'' delivered in a
way ``to give people an understanding that the stars of today are
relative to the legends of yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   In extensive research that included consumer focus groups,
Handler said, the league kept hearing that fans wanted to
understand how football gained its reputation and status as an
American classic and ``where the teams and the players and the
styles of today stack up relative to'' what came before.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the core of the campaign will be four
commercials, named the ``Time Warp'' series, to be introduced
throughout the season. Handler said the spots aimed to create ``a
virtual scrapbook.''
</P>
<P>
   The first spot, which began running last week, is called
``Styling.'' The humorous commercial, reminiscent of a scene in the
Eddie Murphy hit film ``Coming to America,'' presents an endless,
passionate debate between two barbers and their customers about who
was the greatest running back ever.
</P>
<P>
   The vignettes start in the 1960s with Gayle Sayers then continue
with Walter Payton (1970s and '80s), Barry Sanders (1980s and '90s)
and Ricky Williams (1999).
</P>
<P>
   The twist is that the customers, all in carefully re-created
period costumes and hair styles, are contenders for that honor,
too: Eric Dickerson, Franco Harris, Marcus Allen and Tony Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in the spot is ``what we want to try to instigate
because that's what football is about,'' Handler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is this unifying shared experience,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of the remaining three Time Warp commercials will
be: team loyalty and the bonds between fathers and sons; football
as a constant down through the decades as a family celebrates
Thanksgiving, and the coming of age of the female football fan.
</P>
<P>
   All are intended to play up watching football on television,
Handler said, because, ``the television experience is really the
heart and soul of the NFL experience for the majority of our
fans.'' About 113 million Americans watch football on any given
Sunday and Monday night; about a million people attend games on an
average Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To complement the Time Warp series, there will be spots called
Common Denominator that are also centered on players both
contemporary and long ago. One, titled ``Hair,'' set to the
Broadway tune of the same name, contrasts the tonsorial styles of
stars like L.C. Greenwood, with ``75'' shaved into his head; John
Riggins, with a Mohawk haircut; Warren Sapp, sporting beads, and a
bald Garo Yepremain.
</P>
<P>
   Another commercial, ``32,'' set to the song ``32 Flavors'' by
Ani DiFranco, features players who all wear or wore that number,
including Jim Brown, Walt Garrison, Ottis Anderson, Ricky Watters
and Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm ... no mention of the most notorious player to wear 32 _
O.J. Simpson. The league said there were plenty of other players to
choose from and he was excluded for obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A third spot, ``Joe,'' set to ``Hi, My Name Is'' by Eminem _ who
was just named best new artist at the MTV Video Music Awards _
features players like Joe Montana, Joe Theisman, Mean Joe Greene,
Joe Gibbs and Joe Morris. Others present footage of star players in
their early days and players saying ``Hi, mom'' from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on music in those spots is no accident. The tunes,
particularly the hip contemporary ones, make the commercials
broadly appealing not just to the core fans but also to casual fans
as well as random viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials will run on ABC, CBS, ESPN, ESPN2, Fox
Broadcasting and a satellite package on DirecTV. They appear in
addition to the myriad campaigns the networks run to promote their
own coverage of NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Feel the Power'' theme will also be featured in radio
spots, ads promoting charitable and social causes, a print campaign
primarily devoted to stimulating sales of licensed products like
apparel, commercials encouraging children aged 6 to 11 to play
football, and on banners and signs decorating stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will be expanded for this season to the Internet,
as nfl.com offers previews of the commercials and chat sessions
with the players in the spots.

SEEKING A POSITION IN CAMPAIGN, BAUER CALLS FOR A FLAT TAX
</HEADLINE>
   (This story eliminated earlier is now restored) 
(rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gary Bauer called Thursday for a flat tax on
incomes and sought to stake out a conservative populist position in
his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, saying
that his plan would make the Republicans the party ``for the
working American, blue collar and white collar, not just for the
big corporate interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I propose that we take power out of the hands of Washington,''
Bauer said in a speech at the National Press Club, ``and return it,
not to huge corporations and Wall Street investment managers, but
to America's families, to the people who built this great country
and who alone are responsible for its prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Republican candidates, Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan,
have also called for a flat tax, which would eliminate most
deductions while establishing a single rate for families and
businesses. But Bauer's target was clearly Forbes, who has made the
flat tax a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's plan calls for a rate of 16 percent (the same as
Buchanan's and one percentage point lower than Forbes') and the
elimination of all deductions except mortgage interest and
charitable donations.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer would also reduce the capital gains tax to 16 percent and
abolish the inheritance tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he favored reducing Social Security taxes, now about
7 percent, by 20 percent and allowing taxpayers to spend the money
however they wished _ in retirement investments, in their
children's educations or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   He would reduce the Social Security tax by another 20 percent on
young people as they entered the work force to invest the money in
retirement plans or to spend if they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said most Americans would invest the tax savings in their
retirements. When asked at the press club if the government would
not have to support people who retired without saving enough, Bauer
answered, ``People will have to deal with the consequences of the
choices they make.''

ODDS WORSEN IN HUNT FOR LOW-INCOME RENTALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sad side-effect of the robust economy, more
people with low incomes are struggling to find rental housing that
they can afford, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1997, the number of ``struggling renter
households'' increased by 3 percent, to almost 8.9 million from
about 8.6 million, the department said. A struggling household was
defined as one whose income was at or below 30 percent of the
median income for its region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the supply of affordable rental units for such
households has declined. Using the latest figures available, the
department said affordable rental units decreased by about 5
percent, for a drop of 372,000 units, from 1991 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad truth is that more and more people working at low-wage
jobs, as well as older Americans living on fixed incomes, are being
priced out of the housing market as rents rise,'' Housing Secretary
Andrew M. Cuomo said. ``We felt that the rental situation was
getting worse. These numbers document that in a painful way.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said rents had been rising for several years as
landlords charged what they thought the market would bear in times
of prosperity. In 1997 and 1998, rents rose twice as face as
general inflation, Cuomo said. The rent-rate increase was 3.1
percent nationwide in 1997, compared with a 1.6 percent rise in the
Consumer Price Index; in 1998, the respective figures were 3.4
percent and 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the report was based primarily on data from the
Census Bureau's latest survey of American housing trends. He said
the release was not timed for political reasons, though he seized
upon the report as supporting the need for the 100,000 new
rental-assistance vouchers called for in President Clinton's budget
for the fiscal year that begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates the nationwide median family income at
$47,900: that is, half of American families have incomes over that
figure, and half under. In or near big cities with high housing
costs, incomes tend to be higher, and therefore the gap between
``struggling households'' and people with enough money to live
comfortably is wider.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the ``struggling household'' ceiling for a
family of four is $16,000, the report said, meaning that $16,000 is
about 30 percent of the median income for a New York family of
four.
</P>
<P>
   The department said about 116,000 people are on waiting lists to
live in public housing in New York City, and about 203,000 are on
lists to get rental-assistance vouchers. The wait for each category
is about eight years, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that it could not immediately determine how
much the New York waiting lists had increased in the last two
years, but that a nationwide survey of 40 big-city housing
authorities showed waiting-list increases of 10 percent to 25
percent over that time.  &QL;

RANGERS FACE ATHLETICS IN AL WEST SHOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Shovel? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only a sweep this weekend stands between the Rangers and
finally burying those pesky, won't-go-away-soon-enough Oakland
Athletics once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   It begins tonight with the first of three games between the two
at The Ballpark in Arlington. The Rangers' magic number is at six
with 10 games remaining. Time grows short for the visiting
overachievers no one expected to contend.
</P>
<P>
   With a wild-card berth probably out of reach, the A's have
turned their attention to the Rangers and the American League West
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their only chance is to come in here and sweep us and win the
division,'' Rangers reliever Tim Crabtree said. ``I'm sure that's
the way they're thinking. It's almost like the last stand at the
Alamo. It's their last chance, but you know what? I think our boys
will answer the bell come Friday night.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Rangers have struggled of late, they aren't the
ones who are really on the ropes. But ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by far from being over,'' Crabtree said. ``I think this
series is that big.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom suggests that the Rangers need only to avoid
being swept by the Athletics to maintain their level of comfort in
the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers play their final seven games against Seattle and
Anaheim, and ``those guys would love nothing more than to knock us
around and out of the playoffs,'' Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will attempt to avoid such a position by putting the
Athletics far back in their rearview mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no room for error,'' second baseman Mark McLemore
said of the A's. ``They've got to play flawless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers can clinch their third division title as early as
Sunday, but that will require more than they've shown since
returning home Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost four of their five games to the sub-.500 Tampa
Bay Devil Rays and Baltimore Orioles, and manager Johnny Oates
witnessed ``nothing'' to suggest that his ballclub appears close to
shaking its recent tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   That could be attributed partially to too many trying too hard
to clinch this division title, Oates said. That could be part of
the reason the Rangers hit .118 (2-for-17) with runners in scoring
position in their past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating would be the best way to describe it,'' Oates
said. ``They want to make it happen right now. We want to hit the
five-run homer or turn the quadruple play.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there some concern in the Rangers' clubhouse? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Panic? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good team,'' designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro said.
``We will come out of it. We'll get in _ somehow, some way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not expect to face Oakland pitchers Tim Hudson
(10-2, 3.25 earned-run average) or Omar Olivares (7-1, 4.11 ERA
since being acquired from Anaheim).
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers will send Aaron Sele, their hottest pitcher, to
the mound tonight. Sele is 10-2 with a 3.94 ERA in his past 14
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to take the field like a first-place team,''
Rangers first baseman Lee Stevens said. ``We're in first place.
Let's play like it. Oakland has to come out and beat the
first-place team to even have a chance. That puts more pressure on
them than us.''

EDITORIAL: THE MAYOR AS ART CENSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Guiliani has expressed his personal outrage by
publicly criticizing the contents of an exhibition called
``Sensation,'' a collection of recent British artworks scheduled to
open at the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Oct. 2. The show contains
highly controversial works by Damien Hirst, including a partially
decomposed shark and a bisected pig preserved in formaldehyde, as
well as a dung-stained, faux-naive portrait of the Virgin Mary by
Chris Ofili. After seeing the exhibition catalog, Giuliani called
these works ``sick stuff,'' which, indeed, is a phrase that may
have been uttered by many of the visitors _ critics and ordinary
art-lovers alike _ who saw the exhibition in London or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor has also threatened to withhold city financing
from the Brooklyn Museum unless it cancels the exhibition. In doing
so, Giuliani has grossly distorted the First Amendment, whose very
purpose is to insure freedom of speech without intrusion by legally
constituted authority. ``If somebody wants to do that privately and
pay for that privately, well, that's what the First Amendment is
all about,'' the mayor said about the exhibition. ``But to have the
government subsidize something like that is outrageous.'' This has
been the classic point of division over the sponsorship of
controversial art in the past decade, the reflexive response of
almost anyone who is offended by artwork displayed at an
institution that receives public money.
</P>
<P>
   Government has no obligation to finance art. But the Supreme
Court, while upholding the right of Congress to legislate
``advisory'' standards of decency, has nonetheless affirmed that
once government decides to provide funding, it has no right to
impose ``a penalty on disfavored viewpoints.'' Clearly, this action
amounts to such a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's rationale derives from the fact that the city owns
the Brooklyn Museum of Art and provides nearly a third of its
operating budget. He also argues that the city's lease with the
museum requires the institution to remain open to the public,
including schoolchildren, unless the mayor grants permission to
close part of it. As it turns out, the exhibition is not closed to
anyone. Children under 17 will be admitted to ``Sensation'' if
acccompanied by an adult. Hanging his stance on an access issue
merely reveals the weakness of the mayor's argument.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's threat plainly violates the tenor of the 1998
Supreme Court ruling in a case brought by several artists. If he
persists in stopping payments to the Brooklyn Museum, he will have
succeeded mainly in engendering another losing lawsuit that the
city will be required to defend at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani will also have done serious harm to New York's
reputation as a world center of culture. The mayor's threat implies
that all city-financed art in New York exists only with the tacit
approval of his office and at the discretion of his own
sensibility. It implies that he believes he has the power to shut
down a museum's entire operation, including all of its exhibitions
and educational programs, at will. This is intolerable at any level
of government and in any place, but it seems especially egregious
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons to be skeptical about ``Sensation,''
reasons that have as much to do with the politics of the art world
as they do with esthetics. But ``art'' is not an honorific title.
It is not given only to works that confirm or assuage the outlook
of a busy, pugnacious, campaigning politician. Art is the name of a
perpetual human struggle with the limits of perception. The mayor's
most valuable esthetic role is to defend the autonomy and artistic
freedom of the city's museums. This week he is failing dramatically
in that role in a fashion that makes him and the city look
ridiculous.  &QL;

MARRIED OR DIVORCED? BRIBERY CASE LEAVES HUNDREDS IN LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hundreds of New York couples whose divorces are the
focus of an investigation into bribes accepted by Manhattan's chief
divorce court clerk may not know for months whether they are, in
fact, legally married or legally divorced, court officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Yee, a spokeswoman for the court system, said Thursday that
as many as 2,000 divorces potentially tainted by bribes will not be
certified as valid by the courts until Manhattan prosecutors and
court system auditors conclude their reviews of the cases.
Prosecutors said Thursday that their inquiry could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Singer, the chief divorce court clerk in Manhattan,
pleaded guilty on Tuesday to three counts of taking bribes in
exchange for expediting divorce papers. Prosecutors said that the
bribes, largely paid by low-cost, high-volume law offices and
businesses known in the industry as ``divorce mills,'' totaled tens
of thousands of dollars and involved hundreds of cases dating to
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Singer's guilty plea prompted several people to call the court
system to see if their divorces were valid, court officials said.
``We are reassuring them, to the extent we can,'' said John Werner,
chief clerk of the civil branch of Manhattan state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
that divorces in which one of the spouses is found to have forged
the other's signature, for example, or to have known of the bribes
to Singer, would be invalid. Exactly how many of the divorce
lawyers paid bribes without telling their clients was not known,
but court officials said that in those cases the divorces were
likely to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors fear that in some cases a husband, for instance, may
have forged his wife's signature on divorce settlements that
involved only paltry child-support payments and then had his lawyer
bribe Singer to get the papers through the system. Poor or
immigrant women unaware of state laws that typically give them a
percentage of their spouse's income in child support may have been
victimized.

   The British, who love a spy scandal, have not had a good one for
years. Now they do. In the last two weeks, eight Britons, of whom
six are still alive, have been described in the press or on the BBC
as agents for the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The source of
most of these revelations is a new book co-written by a former
archivist for the KGB, Vasily Mitrokhin, who defected to England in
1992, carrying six trunkloads of sensitive documents.
</P>
<P>
   An entire generation of Americans is growing up with only dim
memories of the Cold War, which must appear, even to those now in
college, as a distant clashing of ideologies and rattling of
weapons that evaporated during the Bush administration. The latest
revelations are a reminder of the deep passions that attached to
that struggle.
</P>
<P>
   They are also a reminder that postwar Britain seemed to produce
an unusual number of turncoats _ or, in the spyspeak popularized by
John le Carre, moles. Britain's rigid class system, which provoked
a particularly virulent leftism among upper-class intellectuals in
the 1930s, may have been partly to blame. Whatever the reason, the
KGB found plenty of ideological soulmates _ not only prominent,
well-educated spies like Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald
Maclean, who rose to high station in British intelligence and had
access to useful information, but clerks and obscure professors who
knew very little. In those days, no scrap of information seemed too
trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the most captivating of the latest batch of spies is an
87-year-old great-grandmother named Melita Norwood, a secretary in
the British nuclear-weapons research program during the 1940s who
copied documents that she said ``appeared interesting'' and sent
them to Moscow. Mrs. Norwood may have been as harmless then as she
appears now, but in nearly all respects but one _ her lowly station
_ she resembles far more notorious spies like Philby, Burgess and
Maclean.
</P>
<P>
   Like them, she was radicalized in college _ Southampton, in her
case, not Cambridge. Like them, she believed that Britain badly
mistreated its poor, that Moscow's social model was infinitely
better and that the Soviet Union was Hitler's only reliable
opponent. Like them, she fervently believed that Moscow should have
the atomic bomb as a counterweight to the West. And like nearly all
of them, she is unrepentant. ``In the same circumstances,'' she
told reporters, ``I know I would do the same thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that anything Mrs. Norwood did seriously
compromised her country or hastened Moscow's development of the
bomb. British authorities decided years ago not to prosecute her.
Indeed, given the Cold War's outcome, her efforts, in hindsight,
seem empty, even a bit quaint. But at the time they were matters of
great moment, as they were to Philby and the others. They were in
fact matters of treason.

A RESIGNATION IS EXPECTED FROM CHRYSLER'S PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (af)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just 10 months after the trans-Atlantic merger that created
DaimlerChrysler AG, the president of Chrysler is about to resign in
the wake of a bruising management clash, company executives
confirmed Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Thomas T. Stallkamp, who was the top American
executive in charge of integrating Chrysler into its new German
parent, will be announced Friday after a meeting of
DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board in Frankfurt, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of a larger shake-up of DaimlerChrysler's
management board, which will be reduced to 13 people from 17 and
comes at a time when the company's stock has been slumping badly.
</P>
<P>
   The shuffle has shocked employees at Chrysler, and reports of
the move rattled investors. DaimlerChrysler's shares plunged
$3.9375, or 5.6 percent, to $66.25 Thursday, mainly on worries
about management turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But the departure of Stallkamp also signals serious tensions
between Daimler's American and German executives and perhaps over
basic strategic issues as well.
</P>
<P>
   Though it remains unclear exactly what led to his resignation,
it is clear that Stallkamp clashed with Daimler's chairman, Jurgen
Schrempp, and that his departure was not on friendly terms.
</P>
<P>
   German company executives said Schrempp wanted to create a
``stronger'' and a ``younger'' management board. They also argued
that Stallkamp's effectiveness as a chief executive had been
exaggerated by his American supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Though rumors of Stallkamp's departure have been gathering
strength for the week, it is a big surprise and a puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp was the leading American executive in charge of
integrating the operations based in Stuttgart with those in Auburn
Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler executives acknowledged Thursday night that he had been
successful in that role. Stallkamp also represented one of
Chrysler's biggest strengths: its system for purchasing parts.
Before becoming president of Chrysler, he had been the head of
procurement and built up a system that was more cost-effective and
efficient than Daimler's.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said Thursday night that Stallkamp would be
replaced by James P. Holden, who is now head of sales and marketing
for the North American brands.
</P>
<P>
   Several other executives, some from Daimler, will lose their
positions on the management board as well. Kurt Lauk, head of
Daimler's truck division, is expected to step down along with
Heiner Tropitzsch, Daimler's personnel chief. Theodore Cunningham,
a Chrysler executive who is currently in charge of Latin American
sales, will also lose his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives say Schrempp, who has been extremely
frustrated at the steep decline in DaimlerChrysler's stock this
year, was determined to inject new blood into top management and
make it less unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 members, Daimler's management board has been one of the
biggest in Germany. The board was supposed to reflect the idea that
Daimler and Chrysler had formed a ``merger of equals,'' even though
Schrempp put himself in charge from the first moment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Eaton, the former chairman and chief executive of
Chrysler, shares the title of co-chairman with Schrempp. But Eaton
insured a subordinate position for himself at the time of the
merger by announcing that he would only serve for three years
before retiring and letting Schrempp serve as the sole chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans also outnumber Americans, 14 to 6, on the supervisory
board, which controls who sits on the management board.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior American executive, Thomas Gale,
DaimlerChrysler's executive vice president for design, may leave
the company as soon as this winter but is not likely to depart in
the management shuffle Friday, those close to the company's
deliberations said. Gale has been unhappy with Chrysler's loss of
autonomy, they said, and rival auto makers are planning to woo him.
</P>
<P>
   Gale, one of the industry's best-regarded designers, has
overseen the development of innovative automobiles like the PT
Cruiser, which will go on sale next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The departures of Stallkamp and possibly Gale would leave
DaimlerChrysler with few of the executives who rebuilt Chrysler
after the 1991 recession, turning it into one of the most
profitable auto makers. Robert A. Lutz, Stallkamp's predecessor as
DaimlerChrysler's president, retired last year.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of so many top executives makes it more likely that
their proteges in the next layer of management will also leave,
said Greg Salchow, an auto analyst at Roney &AMP; Co., a Detroit
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with reporters just before the formation of
DaimlerChrysler, Stallkamp may have foreshadowed his own
difficulties when he contended that ``acquisitions are easier than
mergers, and we're running this one as a merger.''

BASIL RODZIANKO, 84, BISHOP IN ORTHODOX CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop Basil Rodzianko, a retired Bishop of the Orthodox Church
in America who was known for the broadcasts on religious topics
that he made from Britain and the United States to what is now
Russia for more than three decades, died last Friday at his home in
Washington. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasts by the bishop, whose first name was originally
Vladimir, were first transmitted by the British Broadcasting Corp.
during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   That was after he arrived in Britain, having been imprisoned in
Yugoslavia for two years for ``illegal religious propaganda.'' He
and his family moved there from their native Russia after the
Bolshevik Revolution, and he earned a theological degree there.
</P>
<P>
   He made his broadcasts in a mellow voice in Russian, giving news
and commentary and, later on, exploring theological themes.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter part of his broadcasting career, his radio talks
were transmitted by the Voice of America and Radio Vatican. He kept
on broadcasting after he retired from his episcopal duties in 1984
and moved to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, he broadcast on Russian television during
visits to Russia. He had been born in Ukraine while it was part of
the Russian empire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he was promoted to his last post, that of the Bishop of
the Diocese of San Francisco, which includes much of the western
United States.
</P>
<P>
   He had served for a short time as Auxiliary Bishop _ with the
title of Bishop of Washington, D.C. _ to the Primate of the
Orthodox Church in America, Metropolitan Theodosius, who still
holds that office.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church in America is an independent daughter church
of the Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   Basil's wife, the former Maria Kolyubayev, died two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include two sons, Vladimir and Peter, who both
live in Britain, and three grandsons.

 PUTTING HAPPY FACE ON SAN FRANCISCO'S TROUBLED TRANSIT SYSTEM
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID LAZARUS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Maggie Lynch is Muni's chief apologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't call me an apologist,'' she says. ``My job is to change
the way the public perceives Muni.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. We'll start again.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Lynch is Muni's community and public relations director _
its spokeswoman. It is her job to represent San Francisco's
much-maligned transit system at public forums and to field calls
from irate riders (not to mention pesky reporters).
</P>
<P>
   When there's an accident or when the trains come to a standstill
in the Muni Metro tunnel, Lynch is usually the one who calls Mayor
Willie Brown and breaks the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   When there's trouble brewing within Muni's ranks, Lynch tries to
be on the scene, acting as a cheerleader for the system (and as the
eyes and ears of her boss, Muni czar Michael Burns).
</P>
<P>
   Some might wonder what Lynch, 41, did wrong in a past life to
now be responsible for improving the image of an almost-universally
despised institution.
</P>
<P>
   She has only been on the job since June, so she still is
learning the ropes. But as a Muni rider for the past 20 years,
Lynch readily admits that the system has plenty of problems and
that, as its mouthpiece, she has her work cut out for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can wear you down,'' she says. ``We're trying to turn
around 15 years of neglect. It's not going to happen overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat apprehensively, she agreed to be shadowed for a day.
</P>
<P>
   8:30 A.M.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch joins other senior managers for the daily briefing with
Burns, who took over Muni's top spot in April.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Mancini, Muni's chief operating officer, confirms that a
news conference scheduled for later in the day has been called off.
The event, at which the mayor was to have unveiled new color-coded
signs in the Metro, was scrubbed at the last minute because Muni
officials realized that the signs didn't turned out as well as
hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good effort,'' Mancini allows, ``but it wasn't good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing,'' Burns says. ``Good enough is no longer
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a full-blown, face-the-cameras event, he instructs
Lynch to simply come up with a press release announcing the new
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Other topics discussed include a proposal for decals on buses
and streetcars, thanking people for riding Muni, &LR;  and signs
reminding passengers that it is a crime to assault drivers.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Lou Johnson, deputy general manager of Muni's
operating division, trails Lynch back to her office. He says he is
a little worried about a death threat he has received from a
recently fired driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got out of his seat, hit a passenger,'' Johnson explains.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who previously worked in the district attorney's office,
promptly calls up a police captain she knows. She asks if the
transit cops are sufficient to keep order at the driver's upcoming
arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging up, she assures Johnson that he should be all right.
</P>
<P>
   9:05 A.M.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch takes a seat at a large conference table for the weekly
``recovery meeting,'' where progress is reviewed after the
disastrous meltdown of the Metro system in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   John Lovegrove, who heads the team of high-priced consultants
from Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton trying to improve service in the Metro,
reports that about 10 of the older, Boeing-manufactured streetcars
keep breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boeings are killing us,'' he says. ``They're dogs. If we
could pull these out of service, we may all be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Not least among Lovegrove's worries is that the chronic
mechanical troubles could prevent the Metro from reaching 90
percent on-time performance this month, one of the goals necessary
for Booz-Allen to receive a bonus payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something radically changes, I don't expect anything
better than 82, 83 percent,'' he warns. ``The Boeings are the No. 1
issue. They keep breaking down in the tunnels.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch tells the group that announcements to Metro riders are
still being made only sporadically when things go haywire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to come up with a standard procedure,'' she says. ``It
makes a huge difference about how disgruntled the rider gets when
we have a delay.''
</P>
<P>
   A discussion breaks out about who should be responsible for
making such announcements _ central control, station agents or
drivers. Burns suggests that Muni ask Bay Area Rapid Transit
officials how they handle their announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' he says. ``We're struggling with this. They
do a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting is adjourned, Lovegrove complains that it took a
lot of effort to spruce up Embarcadero Station for the now-canceled
news conference. ``We pulled a lot of strings to get the station
looking this good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should look this good all the time,'' Lynch counters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Lovegrove replies, ``and the trains should run on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   10:35 A.M.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch fields calls in her office. One is from a PR firm that has
an idea for an image-building campaign to show that Muni drivers
are just ordinary folks.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch likes the sound of that and schedules a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   She says after the call that she really wants the public to have
a deeper appreciation for what Muni drivers go through. ``I used to
think you couldn't pay me enough money to be a cop,'' she says.
``Now I know you couldn't pay me enough to be a Muni driver.''
</P>
<P>
   As the system's spokeswoman, she pulls down about $35 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It's pointed out that if some drivers weren't so sullen and
surly in their dealings with passengers, people might be more
respectful.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch nods her agreement. ``There's a real morale problem,'' she
concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Then she relates a recent experience on a bus that stalled at
Van Ness and McAllister streets. Lynch, who was a passenger at the
time, called central control on her mobile phone and asked what the
problem was. She passed along the information to her fellow riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people are all pigs!'' a woman yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the drivers have a siege mentality,'' Lynch says.
``They're dealing with that all day.''
</P>
<P>
   11:10 A.M.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch arrives at the Muni maintenance yard at Indiana and 22nd
streets to inspect a new paint scheme for city buses. To help
combat graffiti, the buses will be painted entirely white, with
splashes of familiar orange and gold along the top.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that the buses will be easier to repaint once they
are tagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' Lynch tells Jack Blanchfield, Muni's general
superintendent of motor coaches. ``It's clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti, needless to say, is one of Muni's biggest headaches,
along with the unsavory practice among some vandals of etching
directly onto glass windows. No one has much of an idea as to how
to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bus can get tagged six times a day, seven days a week,''
Blanchfield says. ``All we can do is try to remove all graffiti
within 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch says she doesn't want to say anything bad about her former
employer, District Attorney Terence Hallinan, but proceeds to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graffiti is a huge problem _ huge,'' she says. ``The D.A.'s
office just doesn't prosecute graffiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's tag-along visitor says he noticed back at the recovery
meeting that it seemed like a lot of cooks were stirring the soup.
Muni management had one perspective, Booz-Allen another and
employee representatives yet another.
</P>
<P>
   How can the system be fixed when its various components seem to
be pulling in different directions?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem,'' Lynch admits, and proceeds to enumerate the
ways that Burns has taken charge. She laughs when accused of being
a ``true believer.''
</P>
<P>
   12:20 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting over lunch, it becomes clear that Lynch is no stranger
to the art of spin.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from her previous gig with the D.A. and an earlier job
with Kevin Shelley, a former supervisor (and now state
assemblyman), Lynch underwent a trial by fire with the press when
her then-husband, Jimmy Smyth, faced extradition to Ireland in 1992
for the attempted murder of an off-duty Belfast prison guard.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth escaped from a Northern Ireland prison with 37 other
inmates in 1983 _ the biggest breakout in the United Kingdom's
history _ and subsequently settled in San Francisco, where he
worked as a house painter. He married Lynch in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lynch and Smyth had separated before his arrest by FBI
agents, she played an active role in a lengthy, highly publicized
court battle prior to his eventual extradition in 1996. They
divorced in 1997. Smyth was freed by Irish authorities last year
under an early release program for political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to discuss certain details of the episode, Lynch
says the experience taught her that ``you may not win all the
battles, but you can still win the war.''
</P>
<P>
   She is asked if she's something of a crusader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess so,'' Lynch says, brushing back the shock of bleached
hair framing her square face. ``I make my choices.''
</P>
<P>
   1:25 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch stops by central control above West Portal Station. The
surprisingly small nerve center of the Metro system flickers with
video monitors and computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys did a great job with the announcements this
morning,'' Lynch tells the half-dozen or so men running the
hardware. ``It's making a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The men nod their appreciation but don't look all that
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Back outside, Lynch concedes she isn't sure how Muni workers can
be encouraged to be more upbeat about their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be trained to understand that we're in the
customer-service business,'' she says. ``Without riders, we're all
out of work.''
</P>
<P>
   6:05 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   After an afternoon of routine business and some schmoozing with
friends in City Hall, Lynch heads off to a community meeting in the
Richmond District.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, she comes across a 5 Fulton bus blocking the
intersection at Arguello Boulevard. It has come loose from the
overhead wires, and the driver can't get it reconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch gets out of her car and helps direct traffic around the
marooned vehicle until help arrives.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sweet irony to Lynch _ Muni's spinmeister _ trying to
keep things moving around a stalled bus as if nothing were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just an ordinary day,'' she says.

<P>
   So instead of watching the meter run, riders can check e-mail,
trade stocks or use Internet mapping systems to find a quicker
route for the taxi to take _ something every driver is sure to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the cabs _ which are decked out in Yahoo's
signature purple and yellow colors _ took to the streets Thursday,
picking up passengers and garnering more than a few stares.
</P>
<P>
   Nine additional Yahoo taxis will hit the road over the next nine
days, though they won't have Internet access for a few weeks. The
first cab is part of a pilot program, according to a Yahoo
spokeswoman, and the company wants to work out any kinks before
installing the laptops in the rest of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the company hopes to roll out Internet taxis in
cities across the country. It's not disclosing how much it pays
Luxor for the rights to wrap the cabs and outfit them with laptops.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, passengers who hail a Yahoo taxi won't have to
pay extra for the ride or for the Internet access. They will,
however, have to endure quizzical looks _ and a few Yahoo yodels _
from people on the street unaccustomed to seeing a taxi wrapped in
a candy-color advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo officials said they think the idea of an Internet taxi is
long overdue _ especially in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers don't want to be limited to their homes or offices
to get on the Internet,'' said Luanne Calvert, a spokeswoman for
Yahoo. ``They want to be able to get access everyplace they go.''
</P>
<P>
   While Thursday was just the kickoff, Mizan Rahman, who's driving
the first Internet taxi for Luxor, said passengers seemed keen on
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning I took a guy to the airport and he was making
stock trades,'' Rahman said. ``I don't know if he made or lost
money ... but he gave a good tip.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rahman is Net savvy, Calvert said the drivers won't really
be involved in helping passengers get online.
</P>
<P>
   Riders who hop in are greeted by a sign informing them it's an
Internet taxi _ just in case they didn't grasp that from the cab's
exterior _ and can pick up the laptop that sits on the armrest next
to the driver. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With a wireless modem from Ricochet that rests on the dashboard,
passengers can access the Net at about 28.8 kilobits per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great idea for people who are going to the airport or
who are running late,'' Rahman said. ``They can check to see if a
flight's delayed or send an e-mail to a person they are supposed to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   But won't the laptop computer invite more than a few would-be
thieves into his cab? Rahman said he's not concerned, pointing to
the thick band of cable that attaches to the computer at one end
and is bolted to the floor at the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Net taxis are the first of their kind in the nation,
according to Yahoo, and company officials said they think it will
have broad consumer appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's going to want to try this,'' Calvert said. ``We're
the first in the country to get this, but over time, people are
going to realize that it's just practical to be able to get
information wherever you are _ even in a taxi.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't have any luck hailing a Yahoo taxi,
consumers can request one from Luxor Cab.

 BLUE CROSS CALLED BEST PLAN IN CALIFORNIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Blue Cross of California was named the best health
plan in the state, and two local medical groups and two Bay Area
hospitals were honored Thursday by the Pacific Business Group on
Health.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's PBGH negotiates insurance rates for 21 of
California's largest corporations, influencing overall insurance
costs _ which have risen an average of 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The group's awards coincide with the fall ``open enrollment''
period, when people who have a choice among different employer-paid
insurance plans can stick with their current provider or try a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   ```HMOs in California are not all created equal,'' observed PBGH
manager Tama Donaldson. This is the third time the group has picked
the top HMO in California. PacifiCare won the last contest and
Kaiser the time before.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20 HMOs judged in this latest competition, PBGH rated
Blue Cross tops in terms of cost, member satisfaction and other
factors like preventive health care programs, Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   PBGH derived its key data from a survey mailed to 75,000
consumers. About 40,000 people completed and returned the
questionnaire, which asked about their experiences with their
health plan and their medical group.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those survey results, PBGH named Hill Physicians
Medical Group in San Ramon the best medical group in the state. Of
the 150 groups in the competition, Brown &AMP; Toland Medical Group in
San Francisco also garnered a blue ribbon for excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Physicians and Brown &AMP; Toland are Independent Practice
Associations, or IPAs. Such associations play a vital but
little-understood role in health care delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Each IPA is comprised of hundreds of individual doctors or small
medical groups, which band together to negotiate with health plans.
The insurers pay the IPA a flat monthly fee to take care of each
patient. It is up to the IPA to make sure it has enough money at
the end of the month to pay the doctors or specialists that
patients see.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when patients have trouble getting approval to see a
specialist or get a medical test, it's often a money-strapped IPA
and not the HMO that makes that decision.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cost, quality and preventive care considerations,
PBGH found Hill Physicians and Brown &AMP; Toland among the best
medical groups in the state when it came to satisfying patients in
the areas of referrals and tests.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time PBGH has judged doctors, and it's the
second consecutive year Hill Physicians and Brown &AMP; Toland have
finished in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, PBGH also picked the cream of the
state's hospitals, using data based on the outcomes of operations
performed at each hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 520 hospitals studied, only two Bay Area hospitals made
the list of seven that won blue ribbons for excellence. They are
the California Pacific Medical Center and Mills Peninsula Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA Medical Center led the list of Southern California
hospitals that won honors. Absent from the list were Northern
California's medical centers at the University of California at San
Francisco, and Stanford University, which have been beset with
financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   PBGH President Patricia Powers announced the awards Thursday
night at a banquet held at the Golden Gate Yacht Club.

 POT GETS HIGH BID ON EBAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ARTHUR M. LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Someone offered to sell 500 pounds of marijuana on the eBay auction
site this week, and the bidding got as high as $10 million during a
24-hour period before the company shut the auction down.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a series of bizarre incidents on eBay,
where sellers _ in earnest and jest _ have recently put up for sale
Elvis Presley's dental X-rays, artwork and poems by serial killers,
live babies and dead fetuses, not to mention human kidneys, hearts
and private parts.
</P>
<P>
   EBay of San Jose, Calif., quietly removed the marijuana auction
from its Web site around 9 p.m. Wednesday. It had gone up on the
site at 8:42 p.m. the night before and was scheduled to expire at
8:42 p.m. on October 1.
</P>
<P>
   The auction attracted seven successively higher bids _ the last
for $10 million, or $2 million more than the previous high.
</P>
<P>
   EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said the company was alerted to
the auction Wednesday by ``an eBay user.'' EBay ``closed it down
immediately and notified the authorities,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove wouldn't say which authorities were notified. An
employee of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in San
Francisco said the agency does not comment on investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The offer may have been a hoax, said Andre Neumann-Loreck, chief
operating officer of AuctionWatch.com, a San Bruno, Calif., Web
site that monitors Internet auction sites and publishes articles
about trends and developments.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the seller _ identified only by the screen
name `'Killpeople'' _ appears to have no history on eBay. People
who have bought or sold on eBay normally receive feedback from
those they deal with, and the comments are posted on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The high bidder, identified as `'rdmustang,'' has 11 feedback
comments, among them ``great customer,'' ``super-fast payment'' and
``thoughtful and courteous.''
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the auction was listed as ``Ownedville, Florida,''
but there appears to be no such town.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the top bid was far out of proportion to the street
value of marijuana, which police estimate at $1,000 to $1,200 per
pound. That would make a 500-pound stash worth only $500,000 to
$600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that amounts to more than $60 per ounce _ nearly
one-fourth the price of gold. That's gold the metal _ not to be
confused with Hanoi Gold, the controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann-Loreck said the marijuana auction was discovered by one
of his company's engineers, Steve Shapery, shortly before eBay
yanked it. A photo of the auction offering was reproduced on
AuctionWatch.com.
</P>
<P>
   The offering shows a photograph of three men posing with about
70 white packages. Two have their faces blotted out, but the one in
the middle, with dark hair and a mustache, appears to be
undisguised.
</P>
<P>
   The seller described the merchandise as '`the best marijuana
Holland has to offer. This is a good deal for this much marijuana.
Street value is off the charts! Please don't e-mail me about free
samples, sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Neumann-Loreck noted that other auction sites, such as Amazon
and Yahoo, also have been hit with hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay gets hit hardest, not only because it has an
overwhelming majority share of the Internet auction market, but
also because weird things that happen on eBay attract the most
notoriety.

STRATTON DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE SEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice of Gil Stratton.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if it's some classic sportscaster baritone. But
hearing it immediately stops you, taking you back to a time when
Los Angeles television sports-anchoring was much simpler and
probably meant more to the local viewers than they realized at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there was ESPN's ``The Big Show,'' there was KNXT
Channel 2's ``The Big News,'' on which Stratton's friendly,
straightforward sports segments hardly called attention to himself.
He was always there, forever credible, told you what happened, and
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe we can't go back in time. But when the Pacific Pioneer
Broadcasters honor him this afternoon at the Sportsman's Lodge in
Sherman Oaks with the Diamond Circle Award for his more than 40
years of work on television and radio, Stratton's voice will remind
us of the way it was.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as he did then, Stratton calls 'em as he sees 'em, his
trademark phrase that reflects on nine years working as a
professional umpire in the Pacific Coast League. And in all
honesty, the 77-year-old long-time Studio City resident isn't
pleased about what's passed before his eyes in sports TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit to being old-fashioned,'' said Stratton, his voice now
sounding more disappointed than bitter, ``but I do think the old
days were better.''
</P>
<P>
   What he calls the ``greed and arrogance'' so often found in
today's ``hired-gun'' athlete first off makes Stratton almost
thankful he doesn't have to do interviews, something he hasn't had
to think about since he retired a year and a half ago from KNX-AM
(1070) after working there for about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He's also turned off by the fact ``now you've got to be a
comedian'' to deliver sports, and ``this isn't a putdown on anyone,
but these guys aren't qualified to give scores and be funny. It's
unrealistic. Even Jerry Seinfeld has writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he buy into the national-news approach that cable has
brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a big fan of ESPN because I've always thought
sports is a local product,'' said Stratton, who also did Rams
play-by-play on the radio. ``I can't sit through highlights of a
St. Louis-Cincinnati game to see how the Dodgers did. This is all
overkill to me. Maybe they're not to the sports junkies _ the
fantasy players _ but to me, they're not the average sports fan.''
</P>
<P>
   But then local sportscasts, to Stratton, aren't compelling
enough to watch, either. The latest change _ KTLA Channel 5's
removal of Ed Arnold and replacing him with Claudio Trejos _ left
Stratton feeling ``hurt and shocked. . . . I think it's been an
insult to the whole media.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratton instead loves to follow English League soccer, a sport
he learned to enjoy when he started broadcasting games for the Los
Angeles Aztecs of the old North American Soccer League in the early
1980s. He and his son travel to England once a year to see a week's
worth of games.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his time is spent on the golf course or doing voiceover
work. In the Hollywood community, he's remembered for his acting in
the '40s and '50, when he crossed paths with legends like Judy
Garland and Mickey Rooney (in ``Girl Crazy''), Marilyn Monroe (in
``Dangerous Years'' and ``Monkey Business'') and Marlon Brando (in
``The Wild One''). His role of Cookie the narrator in Billy
Wilder's World War II prison-camp classic ``Stalag 17,'' with
William Holden in 1953, is the highlight in Stratton's acting
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in New York as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan, Stratton's
first love was sportscasting since he was 8 years old, and Bill
Stern was his idol. Acting was a means of getting there.
</P>
<P>
   And today, Stratton is afraid he'd have to rely too much on his
acting skills if he were to do a believable sportscast. Because his
heart probably wouldn't be in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that's true,'' he said again with that
one-of-a-kind voice.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ryding out the storm: NBC Sports' research department figures
40 million Americans will watch all or part of the network's Ryder
Cup coverage this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   To watch all of it, by the way, would be committing to 16{ hours
of live TV. Or 28 hours if you throw in the coverage NBC will
produce to show tape-delayed here on USA Network today from 7:30
a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But for something like this, a true golf fan will find a way to
master this unprecedented coverage by a network that doesn't have
NFL broadcasts and has its lone college football team (Notre Dame)
off this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the kind of viewer who tunes in to the last few
minutes of a basketball or football game, that's fine, then (for
this) look in at midday and late in the day because that's when
you'll see a completed match,'' said course reporter Roger Maltbie.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Maltbie nor his broadcast partners, who've been
instructed to remain neutral with their comments in the
U.S.-vs.-Europe format, would necessarily endorse that viewing
method.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about the Ryder Cup is that every
point is just as important as the others,'' said course reporter
Mark Rolfing. ``The first match Friday morning could be the one
that wins it. Anytime anybody tunes in, it'll be something
meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC won't skimp on hardware, either. It has pulled out 36
cameras of various shapes and sizes for this, including a
``limb-stick'' camera for the sixth hole. It can almost put out its
own team to compete _ eight talking heads _ with Dick Enberg and
Johnny Miller keeping it tied together starting at 5 a.m. Saturday
and 7:30 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's additional hours on The Golf Channel, which
Thursday carried the opening ceremonies and the news conference
that announced the pairings. It will also have the closing
ceremonies Sunday at 2 p.m., when NBC's coverage ends, as well as
coverage of press conferences Saturday and Sunday after the matches
are completed. And it also has taped historical Ryder Cup essays
from Ben Wright, the former CBS golf analyst trying to get back
into broadcasting after he was fired in 1995 for lying about making
derogatory comments about LPGA players.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, the Cup will runneth well over. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Each network reports a jump in NFL ratings over last year. We
like to think it's because L.A. can remain the Switzerland of pro
football _ neutral yet intested in what everyone else is doing as
long as they keep banking with us. &QL; 
__ Keith Jackson is paired with Dan Fouts for ABC's regional
coverage (which includes this area) of the Washington-Colorado
football game Saturday at 12:30 p.m. The matchup of No. 4 Michigan
and Ron Dayne and Wisconsin is a pay-per-viewer at the same time
that will include former L.A. sportscaster Leslie Gudel in her
first game for the network as a sideline reporter. Gudel has become
something of a Philadelphia celebrity since working at the
all-sports cable channel for the last two years. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Fox will purposely give Terry Bradshaw a day off from the NFL
pregame show on Sunday, Nov. 7. It is sending him to Cypress
Gardens, Fla., and teaming him with Bob ``The Bobber'' Brenly to
cover the $3.5 million Ranger Millennium M1 Bass Fishing
Tournament. &QL; 
__ Why Joe Morgan still probably has to flinch every time he has to
come to L.A. to do a baseball game. At a time when the Los Angeles
Police Department continues to come under fire for improper
conduct, Morgan, the ESPN baseball analyst and Hall of Fame second
baseman, recounts the incredible mistaken-identity incident with
the LAPD in 1988 during the 20 Questions feature of Playboy's
October issue.

PALMER DEALT NEW HANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The loss of Windrell Hayes for the Oregon game
might deplete USC's receiving corps, but don't expect quarterback
Carson Palmer to let it affect his decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said it doesn't matter if he sees a true freshman or a
senior at wide receiver, he feels the same as long as the player is
wearing a cardinal jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to make my reads. I've got to throw to who's open,''
Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, Palmer spent extra time after practice
Thursday with freshmen receivers Marcell Allmond and Steve
Stevenson, trying to get more comfortable with the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every chance I get, I try to throw to a new guy,'' Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer will be throwing to a lot of new guys. Despite some
hopeful signs earlier in the week, Hayes' sore ankle has not
recovered enough for him to make the trip to Oregon, USC coach Paul
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes sprained his right ankle against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very tempted to take him, but I decided not to,'' Hackett
said. ``I don't want to get tempted. Right now, he's doing great.
We're going to let him rest and prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes isn't the only Trojan missing the trip. Tailback Malaefou
MacKenzie (hamstring), fullback Chad Pierson (ankle), defensive
lineman Darren Collins (ankle) and defensive back Tanqueray Clark
(hamstring) will stay home.
</P>
<P>
   One player who is OK is linebacker Markus Steele, whose sore
elbow is better, although he remains bothered by the cramps that
forced him to miss part of the third quarter against San Diego
State. Steele is taking salt tablets.
</P>
<P>
   __ McShane sits: After 14 straight games, senior center Matt
McShane saw his playing streak end last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Junior center Eric Denmon, who split time with McShane last
season, played the entire San Diego State game and has become
entrenched at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those games,'' offensive line coach Steve
Greatwood said. ``I thought we had control early and things started
to slide and I hesitated to put in a new group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Matt ready to go. The flow of the game was so
herky-jerky, I never felt comfortable with fresh faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatwood said in retrospect that he would have substituted more
along the line, because the starters got tired. And he plans to use
McShane and some other reserves Saturday against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always maintained that I have confidence in both of them,''
Greatwood said. ``The time needs to be more equal.''
</P>
<P>
   The line will be bolstered this week by the return of Trevor
Roberts, who injured his ankle in training camp. Roberts will back
up left tackle Brent McCaffrey, who suffered a hip flexor against
San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Losing sleep: Palmer is against the use of loudspeakers in
practice, which the Trojans used Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst thing ever,'' Palmer said. ``You can't even
sleep afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Need tickets: Linebacker Troy Polamalu will have at least 15
family members at the Oregon game. Polamalu is from Roseburg, about
45 minutes south of Eugene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to find 30 tickets,'' Polamalu said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rule violation: Defensive end Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed did
not start last Saturday because he was late for a team bus.

EDITORIAL: THE MAYOR AS ART CENSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS spelling of Giuliani in 1st graf) (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has expressed his personal outrage by
publicly criticizing the contents of an exhibition called
``Sensation,'' a collection of recent British artworks scheduled to
open at the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Oct. 2. The show contains
highly controversial works by Damien Hirst, including a partially
decomposed shark and a bisected pig preserved in formaldehyde, as
well as a dung-stained, faux-naive portrait of the Virgin Mary by
Chris Ofili. After seeing the exhibition catalog, Giuliani called
these works ``sick stuff,'' which, indeed, is a phrase that may
have been uttered by many of the visitors _ critics and ordinary
art-lovers alike _ who saw the exhibition in London or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor has also threatened to withhold city financing
from the Brooklyn Museum unless it cancels the exhibition. In doing
so, Giuliani has grossly distorted the First Amendment, whose very
purpose is to insure freedom of speech without intrusion by legally
constituted authority. ``If somebody wants to do that privately and
pay for that privately, well, that's what the First Amendment is
all about,'' the mayor said about the exhibition. ``But to have the
government subsidize something like that is outrageous.'' This has
been the classic point of division over the sponsorship of
controversial art in the past decade, the reflexive response of
almost anyone who is offended by artwork displayed at an
institution that receives public money.
</P>
<P>
   Government has no obligation to finance art. But the Supreme
Court, while upholding the right of Congress to legislate
``advisory'' standards of decency, has nonetheless affirmed that
once government decides to provide funding, it has no right to
impose ``a penalty on disfavored viewpoints.'' Clearly, this action
amounts to such a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's rationale derives from the fact that the city owns
the Brooklyn Museum of Art and provides nearly a third of its
operating budget. He also argues that the city's lease with the
museum requires the institution to remain open to the public,
including schoolchildren, unless the mayor grants permission to
close part of it. As it turns out, the exhibition is not closed to
anyone. Children under 17 will be admitted to ``Sensation'' if
acccompanied by an adult. Hanging his stance on an access issue
merely reveals the weakness of the mayor's argument.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's threat plainly violates the tenor of the 1998
Supreme Court ruling in a case brought by several artists. If he
persists in stopping payments to the Brooklyn Museum, he will have
succeeded mainly in engendering another losing lawsuit that the
city will be required to defend at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani will also have done serious harm to New York's
reputation as a world center of culture. The mayor's threat implies
that all city-financed art in New York exists only with the tacit
approval of his office and at the discretion of his own
sensibility. It implies that he believes he has the power to shut
down a museum's entire operation, including all of its exhibitions
and educational programs, at will. This is intolerable at any level
of government and in any place, but it seems especially egregious
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons to be skeptical about ``Sensation,''
reasons that have as much to do with the politics of the art world
as they do with esthetics. But ``art'' is not an honorific title.
It is not given only to works that confirm or assuage the outlook
of a busy, pugnacious, campaigning politician. Art is the name of a
perpetual human struggle with the limits of perception. The mayor's
most valuable esthetic role is to defend the autonomy and artistic
freedom of the city's museums. This week he is failing dramatically
in that role in a fashion that makes him and the city look
ridiculous.  &QL;

WILLIAM ECKERT, 73, MEDICAL SLEUTH IN MAJOR CASES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., N.J., Kan., Germany, Brazil)  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. William Eckert, a forensic pathologist who worked on major
and often bizarre murder cases including the assassination of Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy and the re-examination of Jack the Ripper's
killings, died on Sept 17 at a hospital in New Orleans. He was 73
and lived in Terrytown, a suburb of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A world-renowned authority on the application of clinical
medicine and pathology to the investigation of sudden, suspicious
or violent death, Eckert founded the International Organizations of
Forensic Medicine and the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and
Pathology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Founding an international organization and a journal lent
stature to the profession,'' said Edmund Donoghue, president of the
National Association of Medical Examiners.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing that Kennedy had been assassinated in Los Angeles,
the coroner of Los Angeles County, Dr. Thomas Noguchi, immediately
summoned Eckert to serve as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Dr. Eckert had handled a number of difficult cases, and
I knew that the Warren Commission had raised questions about the
handling of the assassination of President Kennedy five years
before,'' Noguchi said. ``So I wanted to make sure that every
aspect of this case would be handled properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckert's fascination with history, which was his major at New
York University, led him to become involved in a number of unusual
cases. In the 1980s, he speculated that criminal profiling, a
discipline that was then new, might be helpful in discovering the
identity of Jack the Ripper, the serial killer of London
prostitutes from August to November in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   Others also became captivated by the challenge, and eventually
Eckert became a consultant to a group that studied the evidence and
concluded that a butcher with criminal leanings was the culprit.
The investigation was the subject of a television program in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Eckert served as a consultant to the multinational team
that traveled to Sao Paulo, Brazil, to identify the remains of
Josef Mengele, the chief doctor at the Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz. The remains had been buried under another name.
</P>
<P>
   Born on July 23, 1926, in Union City, N.J., William Eckert
graduated from New York University and served in the Army during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He then earned a medical degree from New York
University-Bellevue Medical School, completed a residency at Tulane
Medical School and worked at the Public Health Hospital in New
Orleans and the New Orleans Parish coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of his career in Wichita, Kan., first as a deputy
coroner in Sedgwick County and later as an independent consultant,
before retiring to Terrytown.
</P>
<P>
   Eckert and his wife, Haroldine Laugel Eckert, founded the
Helpern Center for Forensic Sciences, a library and research center
that was started in Wichita and later moved to the Jefferson Parish
Forensic Center in Harvey, La.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Eckert is survived by a son, William
H., of New Orleans; a daughter, Mary Ellen Potucek of Simi Valley,
Calif.; a brother, Frederick Eckert of Pennsylvania, and four
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Conrad Taeuber, who directed the federal census in 1960 and
1970, died on Sept. 11 in a nursing home in Nashua, N.H., where he
had been living for several years. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Taeuber, a demographer by training, worked at the Federal Bureau
of the Census from 1951 until 1973, becoming associate director for
demographic programs in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, after teaching at the University of
Wisconsin and Mount Holyoke College, Taeuber examined rural
problems and migration at the Federal Emergency Relief
Administration and the Federal Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the
Census Bureau, Taeuber strove to improve the reliability of
demographic data. He also taught at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote several books, ``People of the Drought States,'' with
Carl Taylor (1937), ``Rural Migration in the United States,'' with
C.R. Lively (1939), ``The Changing Population of the United
States,'' with his first wife, Irene Taeuber (1958), and ``People
of the United States in the 20th Century,'' also with Mrs. Taeuber
(1971).
</P>
<P>
   Taeuber was born on June 15, 1906, in Hosmer, S.D. He received
his bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate from the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Taeuber died in 1974. Taeuber's second wife, Dorothy
Harris, died in 1998. He is survived by two sons, Richard of
Salisbury, Md., and Karl of Madison, Wis.; three stepdaughters,
Carolyn Wiljanen of Chelmsford, Mass., Joanne Harrington of Lenox,
Mass., and Marilyn Clements of Reading, Mass.; a stepson, Robert
Harris of Florida; a sister, Emmy Anderson of San Rafael, Calif.;
14 grandchildren, and 27 great-grandchildren.

STRATTON OAKMONT EXECUTIVES ADMIT STOCK MANIPULATION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two former principals of Stratton Oakmont Inc., a
defunct Long Island brokerage firm, have admitted that they oversaw
a vast seven-year scheme to manipulate the stocks of at least 34
companies, costing investors hundreds of millions of dollars,
federal prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan R. Belfort, 37, and Daniel M. Porush, 42, who served as
chairman and president, respectively, of Stratton Oakmont, pleaded
guilty to 10 counts of securities fraud and money laundering. The
guilty pleas involved companies that Stratton Oakmont helped to
raise money in public stock offerings from 1990 through 1997, the
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the shares sold to the public by Stratton Oakmont
are now worthless. The firm, which was based in Lake Success, N.Y.,
and labeled by one prosecutor as ``the most infamous boiler-room
brokerage firm in recent memory,'' was banned from the brokerage
industry in 1996 and has since closed.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty pleas, which were announced Thursday by Loretta E.
Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, had
been held under seal for as long as nine months. During that time,
Porush and Belfort cooperated with the authorities in their
investigations of several other brokerage firms and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   That cooperation could reduce the sentences faced by the two
men, which could exceed 15 years in prison and fines of hundreds of
thousands of dollars, said Joel M. Cohen, an assistant U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn. Sentencing will be scheduled before Judge
John Gleeson in the Eastern District.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their guilty pleas, Belfort and Porush have forfeited
property worth at least $16 million, which will be used to
establish a fund to compensate defrauded Stratton Oakmont
investors, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stillman, a lawyer representing Porush, said the guilty
plea ``is Dan's effort to close a chapter in his life.'' He
declined further comment. Gregory O'Connell, who represented
Belfort, declined to comment on the pleas.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the two men were indicted and charged with
orchestrating the manipulation from 1993 through 1995 of the shares
of the Dollar Time Group and the Aquanatural Co., whose stock
offerings were underwritten by Stratton Oakmont. They were also
charged with laundering $5 million of the proceeds of those
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty pleas announced Thursday greatly expanded the scope
of those indictments to include charges that the two men
manipulated the stock prices of at least 34 companies Stratton
Oakmont underwrote. These included such companies as Judicate Inc.,
Master Glazier's Karate International, M.H. Meyerson &AMP; Co. and
Solomon-Page Group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, the manipulations followed a pattern
in which the two men agreed to help a company raise money only if
they were given control of a substantial amount of the company's
stock. They would then sell the stock to Stratton, which in turn
sold it at higher prices to Stratton's customers. Once the shares
were in the individual investors' accounts, the prices usually
collapsed, leaving the shareholders with nearly worthless
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guilty pleas represent the successful prosecutions of
the two principal owners of perhaps the most infamous boiler-room
brokerage firm in recent memory,'' Ms. Lynch said. ``As recent
prosecutions by this office and others have shown, the demise of
Stratton in December 1996 unfortunately did not end the
infiltration of our securities markets by its corrupt principals
and brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Porush and Belfort had cooperated with prosecutors in
several recent cases, including one that resulted in the indictment
last month of four former Stratton brokers who are said to have
used an Internet site and an e-mail operation to defraud investors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two men participated in the investigation of
Duke &AMP; Co., a brokerage firm, now defunct, that was indicted in
May, along with its chairman, Victor Wang, and 17 former employees.
Wang founded Duke &AMP; Co. after working as a broker and executive at
Stratton.
</P>
<P>
   Porush also pleaded guilty to charges that he participated in a
conspiracy to engage in insider trading in 1994 and 1995 in
connection with the proposed acquisition by the ITT Corp. of
Caesars World.

MIGNON GARLAND DIES AT 91; DISCIPLE OF ISADORA DUNCAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn.)  (rk) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mignon Garland, a dancer and teacher who played a major role in
keeping Isadora Duncan's legacy alive in the United States, died on
Sept. 15 at her home in San Pablo, Calif. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   After Duncan's death in 1927, her repertory and ideas as a
pioneer of modern dance were passed directly to Miss Garland and
other disciples by the pupils Duncan had trained in Germany and
called her adopted daughters. Two of them, Anna Duncan and Irma
Duncan, were Miss Garland's teachers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She, in turn, taught many of the fourth- and fifth-generation
Duncan dancers performing today, including her granddaughter, Amy
Baird Garlin, and Lori Belilove, well known for her concerts in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   As founder and director of the Isadora Duncan Heritage Society,
Miss Garland was often consulted by scholars and performers.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Garland, born in Brooklyn, studied ballet and other forms
of dance as a child and was 13 when she performed at Town Hall.
After seeing a performance by Anna Duncan in 1927, she decided to
devote her life to Duncan dancing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, she toured internationally with the Minneapolis
Symphony as a member of Irma Duncan's company. After a U.S. tour,
the pupils of the Russian school founded by Duncan invited Miss
Garland to study and dance with them in Moscow in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   After her return in 1933, Miss Garland helped found the New
Duncan Dancers and was dance editor of New Theater magazine. In
1942 she formed the Contemporary Duncan Dancers with two other
prominent Duncan disciples, Hortense Kooluris and Julia Levien. The
group performed at Carnegie Hall in 1944 with the National Symphony
Orchestra conducted by Leon Barzin. In 1952 the original members of
Irma Duncan Dancers marked the 25th anniversary of Duncan's death
with a concert at Carnegie Recital Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Isadora Duncan's legend remained alive, but
performances of her works became infrequent after the 1950s until
Miss Garland helped promote the current Duncan revival that began
with the 1977 centenary of the dance pioneer's birth.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Berkeley, Calif., in 1957, Miss Garland lived
for many years in San Francisco at 501 Taylor Street, the site of
Duncan's birth, which Miss Garland marked with a bronze plaque in
1973 at a ceremony attended by Irma Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Mayor George Moscone proclaimed May 26 as Isadora
Duncan Centenary Day, and Miss Garland's company, the San Francisco
Duncan Dancers, performed in Colonial Concert Hall. In 1988 Miss
Garland succeeded in having a street renamed Isadora Duncan Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Garland was also trained as an elementary school teacher at
the Maxwell Training School in Brooklyn and like her parents, she
was active in social and political causes. Her mother, Rose Heiman
Halpern, helped Margaret Sanger open a birth control clinic in
Brooklyn in 1916; her father, William Halpern, was defeated as a
candidate for the New York state Assembly. Miss. Garland was denied
a permanent teaching license in New York City. According to her
son, Victor Garlin, the reason was ``her political organizing for
improved schools in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   After moving to California, Miss Garland taught Duncan's dancing
under the auspices of the San Francisco Art Commission Neighborhood
Arts Program and in private schools. She opened her own studio in
1973 and gave her last major recital with her students in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her son, of Berkeley, she is survived by a
sister, Paula H. Gould of New York, and two granddaughters.

 &HT;    Floyd snatches away center of Bahamian town; volunteers reach
outlying areas
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOX TOWN, Bahamas _ Everybody in this town of 500 near the
northwestern tip of Little Abaco Island knows Millie McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, she and husband Merlin, pastor at the Zion Baptist
Church, owned and operated the hotel-restaurant-gas station along
the water's edge that was the center of life for townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   They came for Millie's cracked conch and for her lobster. They
came to meet and work for the South Florida fishermen who filled
the eight rooms, at $60 each. The townspeople went to the McIntosh
restaurant to catch up on local gossip about each other, of which
there was always plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place was all that I ever got going,'' said Millie
McIntosh. ``I keep thinking I'm going to look and see it again. But
it's never there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hurricane Floyd tore through Fox Town. Some of its
wind gusts were clocked at 210 mph. It was the worst storm McIntosh
had seen in her 63 years here.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd blew for two hours, and when it left, the McIntosh
business was gone.
</P>
<P>
   All that remained of the gas station was a 2,000-gallon tank
that had been buried underground but was pushed like a cork to the
surface by the surging sea.
</P>
<P>
   All that remained of the restaurant was the stainless steel meat
cutter. Two hotel rooms were left, flooded and leaning precariously
toward the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has ever happened here as dangerous as this,''
McIntosh said. ``I've been through all the storms, but this was the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Town is 60 miles from Marsh Harbour, the heart of the
Abacos, far enough to keep relief from arriving until this week.
Churches from Freeport sent small boats with food and bottled water
for the people here.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected source Thursday brought promises of help on a
larger scale. A Palm Beach County firefighter arrived to assess the
damage and told the McIntosh family the cavalry was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get a truck up here for you filled with plywood and
roofing materials so you can patch up your homes,'' said
Fire-Rescue Lt. Joe Bartlett. ``This is not just talk. We can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, federally trained in disaster assessment, was one of
five county firefighters who landed here Wednesday, the first wave
of volunteers who are coming at the request of the Bahamian
government. About 60 private airplanes will take off from Stuart
and Boca Raton, Fla., on Saturday to deliver supplies throughout
the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days after Floyd's eye tracked over the length of the
Abacos, little recovery has occurred in the outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen homes were destroyed in Fox Town, and another 20 were
stripped of their roofs. Electricity is down and power lines lay
like spaghetti between the bright blue clapboard houses.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian District Administrator James Ferguson said tents are
urgently needed for 130 whose homes are uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe shelter is our number one problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge gasoline tank displaced by the sea and a dozen propane
tanks tossed on the beach concerned relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gas tank was half-full, and the vapors inside are what can
really cause trouble,'' Bartlett said. ``We'll get the oil company
to come handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham visited Marsh Harbour on
Thursday and told residents that the government was increasing
efforts to move aid to the Abacos.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Fox Town are in shock right now,'' Ferguson said.
``They don't fully understand what has happened to them. Many
people will need counseling to get over this. They have been
independent their whole lives, now suddenly they are not.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is for Millie McIntosh. She said she hopes her insurance
is enough to cover most of her loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle of all this is that no life was lost,'' she said.
``What can we do but rebuild?''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the guests who have stayed in the McIntosh hotel over
the last 30 years were from Palm Beach County, she said. Some were
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said he would return to Fox Town today, and that he
expects the truckload of building supplies will follow him by the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a place that needs us now,'' he said.

FAIRPLEX TITLE WOULD HELP HIM HONOR GONZALEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ The cubicle next to Martin Pedroza's in the
Fairplex Park jockeys' room still bears the pen-on-masking-tape
label ``J.C. Gonzalez.'' The spot where Gonzalez suited up for his
last ride has been converted into a humble shrine, with saddle,
stirrups and goggles, a Jesus statue and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that every day makes it hard for Pedroza to forget about
the Sept. 9 accident that killed the 23-year-old Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to put it out of my mind,'' Pedroza said as he got ready
for his first race Thursday. ``(But) I'm sure it's going to be
there for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's memory is helping to motivate Pedroza as the
34-year-old Panamanian pursues the riding title at the 18-day Los
Angeles County Fair season that concludes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The champion will receive the first J.C. Gonzalez Memorial
Jockey Award from Fairplex officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I don't really care about whether I win this title,''
said Pedroza, who is the fair's No. 2 jockey all-time with 261
victories but led the meet only in 1989, when he finished in a
three-way tie with Corey Black and David Flores. ``But this year it
means a lot to me. I'll dedicate it to (Gonzalez).''
</P>
<P>
   Pedroza didn't ride in the fifth race on opening day. He watched
the accident on TV in the jocks' room. He knew it was bad when he
saw the replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't best friends, but we were close friends,'' he said.
``That day, we were talking, and he asked me about my children.
When it (the accident) happened, it touched me even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedroza skipped his scheduled mounts the following day but has
made up for lost time by winning 24 races (24 percent) to lead Iggy
Puglisi by seven and Matt Garcia by eight.
</P>
<P>
   He had faced a suspension for the last three days of the meet
before securing a stay in Los Angeles Superior Court, making him a
near lock for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, I've had a good meet,'' said Pedroza, who
moved into second on the all-time Fairplex wins list with 262.
</P>
<P>
   It continues a strong summer for Pedroza. He finished an
encouraging ninth in the Del Mar standings after spending most of
the Hollywood Park meet in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Pedroza left his California base in April because he thought his
business had gone sour here. It turned out HE had gone sour.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking among the leaders at Hawthorne Park near Chicago seemed
to revive the rider whose aggressive style and reliable touch with
2-year-olds had made him a bettors' favorite here.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Richie Silverstein and trainer Jack Carava talked him into
coming home after Pedroza, divorced two years ago, realized he
missed his children and California friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I came back with a new attitude,'' Pedroza said. ``I
told Chris (McCarron) I wish there was 18 races a day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely noticed a difference,'' said Black, a four-time
Fairplex leader. ``I've always said the difference between the No.
1 rider and the No. 10 rider on the circuit is 90 percent
confidence. It (success in Illinois) might have been exactly what
he needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedroza rides D. Wayne Lukas-trained Numero Uno in today's Las
Madrinas Handicap for fillies and mares, Cowboy Ballad in
Saturday's Pomona Derby, and Kona Wind in closing day's Ralph M.
Hinds Pomona Invitational Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   __ Golden moment: Today's ninth race is unofficially named the
Mel Stute Purse as Fairplex commemorates the 50th anniversary of
the trainer's first Los Angeles County Fair victory.
</P>
<P>
   Stute, the fair's all-time leader with 153 wins, saddled his
first Sept. 24, 1949. The horse was Cobweb and the jockey Richard
Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   Stute, 72, is best known for 1986 Preakness winner Snow Chief.
But the Glendora native is at home at the track once known simply
as Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of trainers were sitting around Hollywood Park one
day, and we were talking about which race is the greatest to win,''
Stute said. ``One guy said the Arc de Triomphe, a couple said the
Kentucky Derby, and another said the Breeders' Cup Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Stute said the Pomona Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I was kidding, but I was dead serious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stute has won the race _ now called the Ralph M. Hinds Pomona
Invitational _ the past two years with Score Quick and will have
Kona Wind in the $100,000, 1[-mile event on Sunday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
__ Fairplex Park leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Martin
Pedroza, 23 wins; Iggy Puglisi, 17; Matt Garcia, 15; Victor
Espinoza, 11; Isaias Enriquez, 9. Trainers: Paul Aguirre, 7; Barry
Abrams, Leonard Duncan and Clifford Sise, 5. &QL; 
__ Handicapper helper: Bettors at the Oak Tree meet, which opens
Wednesday at Santa Anita, likely will find Del Mar form more
reliable than Fairplex form. During opening week at Oak Tree in
1998, horses coming out of Del Mar victories won 7 of 31 starts and
produced a 7 percent profit on win bets; horses coming out of
Fairplex victories went 0 for 8. Horses coming out of Fairplex
races _ regardless of their finishes _ went 6 for 85 and showed a
32 percent loss. &QL; 
__ On the stakes schedule: At Fairplex Park: today, $100,000 Las
Madrinas Handicap, fillies and mares 3 and up, 1 1/16 miles;
Saturday, $100,000 Pomona Derby, 3-year-olds, 1[ miles; Sunday,
$100,000 Ralph M. Hinds Pomona Invitational Handicap, 3-year-olds
and up, 1[ miles. At Santa Anita: Wednesday, $100,000 Sen. Ken
Maddy Handicap, fillies and mares 3 and up, about 6{ furlongs on
turf. At Bay Meadows: Saturday, $100,000 Bay Meadows Breeders' Cup
Derby, 3-year-olds, 1[ miles on turf; Sunday, $100,000 William P.
Kyne Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1[ miles. At Belmont Park:
Saturday, $250,000 Vosburgh, 3-year-olds and up, 7 furlongs. At
Turfway Park: Saturday, $500,000 Kentucky Cup Classic, 3-year-olds
and up, 1[ miles, and other Kentucky Cup grass races; Sunday,
$300,000 Kentucky Cup Turf, 3-year-olds and up, 1{ miles, and other
Kentucky Cup races. &QL; 
__ Mileposts: David Hale, for years a welcome face in the press box
as owner and operator of the photo-finish equipment at Santa Anita,
Hollywood Park and Del Mar, was killed Tuesday when his motorcycle
was struck by a truck that crossed the center line of a highway
near Bishop. He is survived by his wife, Julie, a long-time
Hollywood Park executive secretary who works for the Shoemaker
Foundation, and their two children. Hale was 49. . . . Jockey Pat
Valenzuela, licensed to ride for the first time in nearly two years
starting Wednesday at Santa Anita, hired Nick Cosato as his agent.
. . . Chicago-area Arlington Park, closed by a 1997 political
dispute, will reopen May 14, 2000. Illinois officials awarded 100
racing days to the Arlington Million host. . . . Bevo, upsetter of
More Than Ready in Sunday's Belmont Futurity, will miss the rest of
his 2-year-old season after having surgery Tuesday to remove a bone
chip from his left knee. The Billy Badgett-trained son of
Prospectors Gamble will take a 4-for-5 record into the Kentucky
Derby prep season. . . . River Keen's Woodward Stakes victory
didn't earn him a top-10 ranking in the weekly NTRA media poll. But
it helped Bob Baffert barnmate General Challenge climb from seventh
to fifth below No. 1 Behrens. General Challenge beat River Keen in
a Pacific Classic performance that some voters had underrated. . .
. Jockey David Gall, 57, who announced his retirement last week,
finished his career Saturday at Fairmount Park near St. Louis with
7,369 victories, fourth behind Hall of Famers Bill Shoemaker
(8,833), Laffit Pincay and Pat Day. . . . Vic Stauffer, voice of
the Northern California fairs, was named announcer at Gulfstream
Park, the Miami-area track that opens its 2000 season on Jan. 3.

COMMENTARY: FALLING UNDER THE THRALL OF RONALD REAGAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BRENT STAPLES 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edmund Morris' ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' has yet to
reach its publication date and is being embargoed by Rottweilers at
Random House _ but has already become the most reviled political
biography in recent memory. Fair-minded people will read the book
before deciding whether or not to call for the author's literary
head. But it is clear from portions of ``Dutch'' being secreted
around Manhattan that something went terribly wrong between Morris
and the president whose ``authorized'' biography this was meant to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Morris has taken the eyebrow-raising step of inserting into this
``biography'' fictional characters _ including one that seems
loosely based on himself. This device should get ``Dutch''
classified as a novel instead of a nonfiction book. Anything less
amounts to literary fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But the device was necessary, Morris hinted, to create solid
ground in an ethereal personality that provided too little
substance for a traditional biographer. But even a partial reading
of ``Dutch'' shows that the reverse is true. The trouble was not
too little Reagan, but way too much, experienced at too close a
range.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that Reagan's personality was too thin to make a
biography is disproved by the fact that several writers have
written good ones _ without the help of fictional invention. Lou
Cannon did it in ``President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime,''
Haynes Johnson did it in ``Sleepwalking Through History,'' and the
Jesuitical Garry Wills did it most penetratingly in ``Reagan's
America,'' which showed in eery detail how Reagan came to mistake
the world of movies for the one in which he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House chief of staff Donald Regan captured the boss
well in his memoir, saying that the White House staff conceived of
the Gipper's as a presidency of good camera angles with Reagan as a
``sort of supreme anchorman whose public persona was the most
important element of his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous actors have a brighter personal radiance than the rest of
us _ which is why we call them ``stars,'' and why a frisson runs
through a restaurant when stud muffin Brad Pitt waltzes in to eat.
The star power that lights up the diners almost inevitably becomes
impenetrable, keeping the star from seeing out and the rest of us
from discerning what lies within. This two-part deception _ between
the star and himself and the star and his ``public'' _ was nowhere
more pronounced than in the reign of Ronald Reagan, the actor
turned president.
</P>
<P>
   The Gipper in his political prime was Brad Pitt cubed. His
camera-ready radiance kept them swooning in the aisles and made him
politically immune to blunders, lies and the revelation that he
could no longer distinguish between things he had seen in movies
and things that he had lived. Bill Kovach, chief of The Times'
Washington bureau during the Reagan years, said that stories that
revealed Reagan's addled mind failed to get ``traction'' in the
court of public opinion because his persona was too seductive. This
legacy, by the way, has passed on to Bill Clinton, who has survived
storms that would have left less charming men broken on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was clearly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the
material he collected, collated _ and re-re-collated _ in 14 years
on this book. Every writer of nonfiction can empathize with the
problems posed in lending shape to mountains of information. But
what jumped at me in reading the pages where the fictional Morris
appears was the extent to which the author seems overwhelmed, cast
in shadow, and fairly put under by the magnitude of the Reagan mass
and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   This fictional witness describes Reagan as a gigantic asteroid
whose magnetism and gravity pulled the grain-of-sand biographer in
its wake. This is couched in the language of irony, but it still
seems that the writer has been blinded by the very persona he is
trying to spoof. The effect is somewhat like watching children
watch television _ knowing they cannot differentiate between the
characters and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I am eager to read the whole of ``Dutch.'' But the sense I get
from the pages with the now-famous invented Morris is that the
writer was hypnotized by the brightest light in Washington and came
away with fading evanescence instead of a palpable story. The moral
of this tale, boys and girls, is that when you encounter a bright,
bright light, put on sunglasses and take several steps back.

AUTHORITIES RECAPTURE ESCAPED KILLER OF 16-MONTH-OLD TODDLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ The 38-hour manhunt for the killer of a 16-month-old
toddler ended early Thursday when authorities recaptured Scott Adam
in Council Grove and returned him to the Morris County Jail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old man was wearing the clothes he had on Tuesday
afternoon when he went over a 10-foot-tall chain-link fence topped
with razor wire just behind the sheriff's office in Council Grove. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty tired, maybe a little dehydrated,'' said Morris
County Sheriff R.J. Meierhoff. ``My impression was he was living in
the open.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A local resident spotted Adam crossing a road in a hilly, wooded
area about a half-mile south of the Morris County Courthouse.
Authorities dispatched tracking dogs and a helicopter equipped with
a searchlight to look for him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dogs picked up Adam's scent and followed it into Council
Grove, where he was found in a local residence. He was not armed
and surrendered without resistance about 5 a.m.. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meierhoff declined to say who owned the home and whether anyone
else was in the home at the time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say at this time I don't think he was receiving
any outside help,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KBI Special Agent Scott Teeselink said the flood of law
enforcement officers that swept into Council Grove to help with the
around-the-clock manhunt kept Adam from fleeing the area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the manpower, we had him contained,'' Teeselink
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now back in a jail cell, Adam was being monitored with a
closed-circuit TV camera. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He'll make a first appearance this afternoon on a new charge of
aggravated escape, which carries a maximum penalty of an additional
20 months in prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The escape came a few hours after a district judge handed Adam a
prison sentence of more than 41 years for killing Timothy Post, the
son of his former girlfriend, Jessica McAuley Post, by shaking him
so hard that his brain swelled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was double the usual state-prescribed sentence for
second-degree murder. The judge, David Platt of Junction City,
imposed the stiff sentence because of the vulnerability of the
boy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adam had been charged with first-degree murder but pleaded
guilty to a second-degree murder charge before his trial began. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Adam had been convicted of another second-degree murder
charge, this one stemming from the 1993 stabbing death of a
19-year-old Kansas State University student. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Supreme Court ordered a new trial in 1995. Adam then
was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and paroled a short time
later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adam was in the jail's outdoor recreation area when deputies
were called away to a traffic accident shortly before 3 p.m.
Tuesday. That's when Adam went over the fence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meierhoff said office policy had been violated when the
recreation area was left unsupervised. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said he would look into internal issues surrounding
the escape and would review policies and scrutinize equipment used
at the jail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to have him back in custody,'' the sheriff said. ``It
was a safety issue. There are a lot of other issues left to be
resolved.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT CASE MUDDIES PICTURE OF TEMPORARY WORKERS, EXPERT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people rail at Microsoft for stifling personal computer
competition. Others complain about its bundled software. Kathie
Hanratty-Masi deals with a different gripe: the federal court case
involving Microsoft's ``permatemp'' employees.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's employment of temporary workers _ some of whom have
worked at the company for years _ was challenged in federal court
by temps who wanted access to Microsoft's employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Hanratty-Masi says the high-profile case has given the
temporary-staffing industry a public relations headache. And when
the industry hurts, Hanratty-Masi, president of the National
Association of Temporary and Staffing Services, takes the medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut woman spent part of National Temporary Help Week
last week jetting around the country, including a trip to Kansas
City. In part, she worked to distance the Microsoft case from the
kind of temporary employment experienced by about 3 million
Americans on any given day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is about Microsoft workers being misclassified,''
she said, referring to about 10,000 long-term Microsoft workers who
are or have been employed at Microsoft through temporary-staffing
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the permatemps' lengthy tenures, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled this summer that the permatemps should be
considered common-law employees. Thus they would be eligible for
employee benefits, such as the right to buy Microsoft stock at a
discount through the company's employee stock-purchase plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hanratty-Masi said the case muddied the picture of temps in the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of permatemps in the Microsoft case account for
one-tenth of 1 percent of all U.S. workers,'' she said. ``It's a
very, very small percentage. ... Clearly 99 percent-plus of the
work force is not victimized by being denied benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Most temporary workers, Hanratty-Masi said, are in mutually
beneficial work arrangements: The employer benefits by staffing up
or cutting back on payroll on an as-needed basis without having to
lay off employees, and the temps benefit from the flexibility in
workdays, hours and locations that temporary staffing offers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanratty-Masi said there was no evidence that temp workers were
``stealing jobs from full-time employees.'' Rather, she contended,
temp spots typically are add-ons to the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hanratty-Masi said temp pay generally was equal to or
better than what company employees made in the same jobs. In
addition, reputable temp agencies give their workers employee
benefits and provide training.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that people interested in temp work look for
staffing agencies that are members of her national association. The
organization represents about 1,400 companies that operate staffing
services.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 1,400 member companies operate multiple offices, but
they don't run all of the 20,000 temporary-staffing offices in the
United States, she said. So, she advised, it is wise to investigate
the credentials of staffing companies before committing to a work
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Hanratty-Masi spoke to members of the Heart of
America Staffing Services Association.

MOVE TO LEGALIZE GAMBLING DEVICES FOR NONPROFIT GROUPS IS PUT ON
HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plans to ask Missouri voters next year to legalize slot machines
and other video gambling devices operated by charitable, fraternal
and religious groups have hit a snag.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Secretary of State Rebecca Cook on Thursday certified
initiative petition language for gathering signatures aimed at
placing the proposed constitutional amendment before voters in
2000. If approved, groups such as the American Legion and the Elks
could provide one machine for each 50 members at their nonprofit
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul LePage, a Jefferson City American Legion member and
spokesman for the petitioning group, said late Thursday that the
petition language approved by Cook would be withdrawn by the group
Monday. New language will be submitted for approval within 30 days,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be back,'' LePage said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sponsoring organizations are various Missouri veterans
groups and Eagles, Elks and Moose clubs, LePage said.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative effort to put a similar question on the ballot
died in the General Assembly earlier this year without coming to a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said LePage's group would need to gather about
90,000 valid signatures by May 7 to place the issue on the Nov. 7,
2000, ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current proposal, groups that offer such gambling must
have been in existence for 10 years. The games would be regulated
by the Missouri Lottery Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But LePage said one change under discussion would set regulation
by the Missouri Gaming Commission, which also oversees riverboat
casinos and charitable bingo.

SCIENCE GROUPS REFUSE TO LET KANSAS USE WORDING FROM THEIR
DOCUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three national science groups dealt a blow to Kansas' new
science standards Thursday by denying the state permission to use
wording from their science education documents.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the National Research Council, the
National Science Teachers Association and the American Association
for the Advancement of Science said the Kansas standards do not
``embrace the vision and content'' of the national documents.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the national groups comes more than a month
after the state board voted 6-4 to de-emphasize evolution in the
state science standards, which determine what students will be
tested on.
</P>
<P>
   ``By deeming that only certain aspects of the theory of
evolution should be taught, the State Board of Education adopted a
position that is contrary to modern science...,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Biles, the board's attorney, said the groups' decision to
refuse copyright permission just means more rewriting of a document
already in its sixth draft.
</P>
<P>
   But board critics said the statement underscores the dim view
that most scientists take of the Kansas board's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people didn't realize it before, it is very obvious from
this statement that the scientific and educational community is
very disturbed by the Kansas board's decision,'' said Eugenie
Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science
Education in Berkeley, Calif. ``It flies in the face of 10 years of
science education reform.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves said he hoped the
board ``would use this opportunity...not to repeat the decision
that was previously made.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the Kansas standards, initially written by a 27-member
committee of science teachers and professors, relied heavily on
three documents: the National Science Education Standards from the
National Research Council; Pathways to the Science Standards from
the National Science Teachers Association; and Benchmarks for
Science Literacy from the American Association for the Advancement
of Science.
</P>
<P>
   The council is an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. The
teachers' group has more than 53,000 members. The association is a
professional organization to which more than 148,000 scientists
belong.
</P>
<P>
   The writing committee a year ago sought and received tentative
approval from the three groups to use their documents, said John
Staver, a Kansas State University professor and co-chairman of the
writing committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in late July, three state board members tinkered with the
writing committee's work, taking out references to the age of the
Earth and ``macroevolution'' _ the theory that living things have
common ancestors and have changed over time.
</P>
<P>
   When Staver learned what the board members had done, he notified
the three national science organizations of the possibility of
copyright infringement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, the three groups said the modified standards
did not reflect the intent of the national documents, although they
still contain passages taken word-for-word from those documents.
The groups asked the Kansas board to remove those passages and any
reference to their documents from the Kansas standards.
</P>
<P>
   The board plans to consider changes in its standards at its
October meeting in De Soto. Biles, the board's attorney, said he
thought most of the revisions to copyrighted material would be in
the standards' introduction.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the writing committee disagree. The structure and
foundation of the Kansas standards came straight from the national
standards, said Steve Case, director of the Kansas Collaborative
Research Network at the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the structure isn't copyrighted, many of the teaching
examples also came straight from the other documents, said Ken
Bingman, a Shawnee Mission West High School teacher. He estimated
that about half of the Kansas standards were drawn from the
national standards, including the entire 12th-grade section on
genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Schell, a science specialist with the Kansas Department of
Education, speculated that the board's final revision of the
standards happened so quickly that board members might not have
considered all the repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was changed was done very quickly over a two-week period
and passed over a two-week period,'' Schell said. ``I'm just not
sure how far ahead the board has thought.''

OZ THEME PARK PROMISES LITTLE RISK, BIG GAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Say this for The Wonderful World of Oz folks: They give good
dog-and-pony shows.
</P>
<P>
   After taking in a midweek presentation on the economic and
fiscal effect of their proposed theme park and resort, it's easy to
understand why so many local business and political leaders have
been captivated of late by their vision. The meeting was one of a
series being held by Oz Entertainment Co. to nurture community
support for its $763 million project on the site of the old
Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant.
</P>
<P>
   Oz needs all the good PR it can get, because it has suffered
from a less-than-distinguished history going back to a failed
initial effort in Wyandotte County in the early '90s. When
developers began attempts to revive their World of Oz dream in
Johnson County, they were slow to reacquaint themselves up close
and personal. Before long, a lot of people they needed to impress
were asking, ``Who are these guys?''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been more skepticism about this deal than it
deserves. Concerns abound, and many of them are valid. Financial
markets are souring, labor markets are tightening, estimates of the
site's environmental cleanup costs are soaring and the economic
expansion is slowing. Another concern is the extent to which
taxpayers will become unwilling conscripts.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's one of those public-private ventures, but this
is hardly unusual. The proposed scope of actual taxpayer exposure,
however, is modest compared with many such deals getting done
nowadays. Considering the benefits to be expected from the
project's success, the public's relative downside risk if it falls
short of expectations appears small.
</P>
<P>
   The primary impression gleaned from the economic overview is
that these guys aren't flying by the seat of their pants. They've
already raised more than $20 million in equity capital, and it's
going to obvious good use on designing the project, planning and
assessing economic viability.
</P>
<P>
   The hired guns give their predictable rosy scenarios, but they
need not be pooh-poohed just because such outcomes are expected.
Those doing the workups have at least as much credibility as the
skeptics quick to express doubt about the project's soundness.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in were the Mid-America Regional Council, Salomon Smith
Barney and Economics Research Associates. Their analyses of the
financial and economic particulars were reassuring, but numbers are
for number-crunchers.
</P>
<P>
   What average community members must keep in mind when thinking
about Oz is what they might get if the enterprise is successful.
For relatively small financial risk, the community not only gets an
opportunity to resolve the Sunflower site's environmental problems,
but also the chance to create an economic asset of considerable
value and potential.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, local skeptics may see it as a long shot, but so
what? As a practical matter, this is more legitimately a concern of
the developers and their investors than of the community that
stands to benefit from their success.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, perceptions of Oz boil down to the
question of whether anyone else has a better plan promising a more
beneficial outcome at less cost to the taxpayers. If anyone out
there fits this bill, he or she haven't been heard from.

YOUNG MAN HOPES TO TESTIFY AGAINST SUSPECT HE THINKS KILLED HIS
FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a bond between the older Polish-born woman and the
young Mexican man that spanned cultural and age differences. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both came to America for a better life. Sophia Szymczak arrived
a few years after World War II and Fredy Arzaga about eight years
ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship began three years ago over casual conversation
at an eatery and grew to a house-sharing arrangement. For eight
months, she provided him shelter in her tidy home near Truman and
Topping. He kept her yard mowed and did odd jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that routine changed on Sept. 3 when he returned home, found
her dead and saw an intruder in the home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arzaga chased a knife-wielding intruder through the
neighborhood. Along the way, Arzaga suffered stab wounds, but his
determined pursuit won him praise from a neighborhood leader and
others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Arzaga is the chief witness against the man accused of
killing Szymczak in one of Kansas City's most unusual murder cases
in recent years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had to pay her back. I feel sorry for her
because she was a nice lady,'' Arzaga said this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Farris is the man charged with strangling 76-year-old
Szymczak and stabbing 31-year-old Arzaga. Prosecutors are
considering seeking the death penalty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the murder, Farris, 44, was accused of burglarizing
Szymczak's home. He was out on bond and was supposed to wear an
electronic monitor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in August he cut off his monitor. State probation officials
knew that for nearly a month before a judge received a request for
an arrest warrant. During those weeks, authorities held Farris for
a few days on an unrelated charge, but let him go because they did
not know he was a fugitive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case took another turn last week when immigration officials
were about to put Arzaga on a plane back to Mexico. But the
prosecutor's office intervened on behalf of their trial witness.
Now Arzaga may stay and work here at least a year or until he
testifies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a small corner house in the Northeast area where he now is
staying, Arzaga recalled the events which he said still give him
bad dreams. His story adds details to one already recounted in
court records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was surprised to discover the front door of Szymczak's house
chained from the inside during the noon hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled, `Sophia! Sophia!' I knew something was wrong,''
Arzaga said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peering through the crack in the door he saw his friend lying
face-up on the floor with a rag or towel around her neck. He also
saw a man heading toward the back door. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arzaga raced around back and pushed hard against the door to
keep the intruder inside, but the man burst out. Arzaga grabbed
hold of his shirt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's when the intruder pulled out a kitchen knife and swung
it. Arzaga felt the sting as the tip sank into his right forearm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want me to follow you, you'd better kill me
first!'' Arzaga screamed to his attacker. ``You already killed
Sophia!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The attacker told Arzaga that Szymczak was not dead, hoping his
pursuer would stop to check. But Arzaga had already seen that
Szymczak was not breathing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He stayed with the intruder during a furious foot chase that
covered more than a mile. Arzaga ended up with more stab wounds to
the right collarbone, the back of the head and the underside of his
left upper arm. At one point, he grabbed for the knife but the
attacker pulled it away, slicing the fingertips of Arzaga's right
hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one of the attacks the knife broke, but the man produced a
long screwdriver. Arzaga said he never was stabbed with the tool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dazed, bloody and winded, Arzaga said he followed the intruder,
thinking, ``You need to go to jail!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chase proceeded across Truman Road, along residential
streets, through back yards and down an alley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Arzaga stayed about 20 feet behind the
intruder, who would turn and threaten with the knife. But at least
twice Arzaga was able to hit the man, once bringing him to the
ground near the Centropolis Post Office on Truman Road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police were directed to the suspect by a woman with a cell
phone. Officers arrested Farris in the 900 block of Fuller Avenue.
Arzaga went to a hospital for treatment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now Arzaga has a work-permit card and is searching the want
ads for roofing jobs and similar work. He has to report monthly to
the immigration office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And he is looking forward to the day he'll testify against
Farris. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; He is uncomfortable with the question, maybe even
slightly embarrassed. It goes straight against his nature. But what
is Dr. Frank Jobe to do? Honesty and modesty are what he knows.
</P>
<P>
   So if Jobe cannot deny he has made a difference in the world,
neither does he particularly relish acknowledging it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think you have, and I do now sort of see it,''
Jobe said. ``But if you'd said that 15 years ago, I'd have said,
`Well, I'm just an ordinary doctor. I'm lucky.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is a monumental admission by the unpretentious Jobe, if an
almost painful one. Yet the good fortune went to those touched by
his remarkable gift, either directly or from the countless others
who adopted his innovative work. Surely, there has been nothing
ordinary about his career.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that during the past 25 years, no man has had
a greater impact on baseball than Jobe. Not some powerfully built
player with bat or executive with pen, but this gentle North
Carolina native with the deft scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Who else developed a pair of revolutionary surgeries that
enabled thousands of pitchers to avoid career-ending injury,
allowing them to continue to entertain, win games and make
millions? Who else used biomechanical engineering to pioneer motion
analysis on the act of throwing? Who designed a series of exercises
to avoid arm and shoulder injuries, now in common usage throughout
baseball and called the Jobe Exercises? Who has trained so many
other doctors and physical therapists at the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never sat and talked with him about his impact,'' said
veteran Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, who has known Jobe since he
became a team doctor 36 years ago. ``It's not the thing you do with
Frank, because he's just so self-effacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you think of all the people who have gone through
that clinic, his impact is amazing _ amazing. Then he's sending out
his disciples all over the country. Just remarkable. Yet through it
all, he's a very humble man. Frank is what Frank is. He's just a
beautiful man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe is the most famous and influential orthopedic surgeon of
his time. As with followers climbing the mountain in search of
wisdom, doctors come from all over the country, all over the world,
to Los Angeles to learn at the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly considered one of the premier fathers of modern
sports medicine,'' said Dr. James Andrews, the internationally
renowned orthopedic surgeon from Alabama. ``Without his influence,
baseball players' sports-medicine care would probably still be in
the dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Jobe rose to prominence when he came up with the
radical idea of transplanting a tendon and wrapping it into an
elbow ligament. The concept had been used on hands and to reinforce
joints on polio patients but never in the elbow, never on a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But 25 years ago on Sept. 25, baseball was forever changed when
Jobe performed the operation on Dodgers left-hander Tommy John.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now Dr. Jobe is going to give me a sterling-silver
ligament,'' John said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe told John at the time he had a ``one in one hundred''
chance of ever pitching again. John went on to win more games after
the surgery than before. Soon the operation became commonplace
throughout the country. Jobe estimates he's performed between 1,000
and 2,000 ``Tommy John'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy John surgery now is almost looked upon as an
improvement,'' said Mets right-hander Orel Hershiser. ``Guys who
come out of Tommy John surgery are throwing better than they did
prior.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was Jobe's second pioneering surgery. This time he
went from the elbow to the shoulder, designing a less-invasive
procedure that enabled him to reconstruct a shoulder that had
become unstable with stretched-out ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe had already performed the procedure on NFL quarterback Jim
McMahon and golfer Jerry Pate but never on a major-league pitcher
required to throw 90-mph fastballs some 100 times a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing he said at the beginning of our meeting was,
`I'm sorry,' so I knew it was really serious,'' Hershiser said.
</P>
<P>
   As with John, Hershiser _ then with the Dodgers _ knew his
choice was to take the chance or never pitch again. He didn't
hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation proceeded his advice on the surgery,''
Hershiser said. ``He probably prescribed the most radical thing
that could have happened to me and I didn't second-guess it all. I
didn't want a second opinion, I didn't need anybody else to tell me
what was wrong with me and how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser has now won more games since the surgery than before.
He's also earned himself another $20million in contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If Jobe had performed all his surgeries for a percentage of
future earnings _ instead of the workman's-comp fees normally paid
by clubs _ he would probably be the wealthiest physician in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he takes one percent from me, that's $200,000,'' Hershiser
said. ``Everyone else, he'd have $50million _ no, way more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He's made a lot of wealthy athletes a lot wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it, of course,'' Jobe said. ``But I think
most of them are very appreciative of what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe looks at athletes not by the uniform they wear, but the
help they need. It was a principle he learned as a medical staff
sergeant in the Army's 101st Airborne Division during World War II,
a stint that saw him briefly captured by Germans at Bastogne before
escaping. In war, doctors help anyone, even the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest feeling of satisfaction is going to a ballgame
and seeing people you've operated on play well,'' Jobe said. ``I'm
a fan of people who have been operated on, more than I am of
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Jobe attended a private junior college in
Tennessee. Then he decided to use the GI bill to go to college in
Southern California, studying at the University of Loma Linda
Medical School and doing a residency at Los Angeles County
hospital, where he met Dr. Robert Kerlan.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced three years as a family doctor in Westchester to
pay off school loans before returning to medical school at USC for
an orthopedic residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He delivered over a hundred babies,'' John said. ``Then he
started operating on the big babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerlan invited Jobe to join him, and on a handshake the
Kerlan-Jobe partnership was formed in 1964. Kerlan had already been
named the Dodgers' team physician, but Kerlan-Jobe would go on to
serve the Lakers, Angels, Kings, Ducks, USC, the PGA Tour and PGA
Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   And Jobe would go on to international acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there must have been someone looking after me,'' Jobe
said. ``I've been pretty lucky to get through the war, getting into
medical school, graduating, taking care of the Dodgers, the PGA
Tour _ all those things just seem to come to me without me hardly
knowing it, and they were there. They turned out to be wonderful
opportunities to do good for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 74, Jobe continues to work full time. He has cut back to
three days of surgery and now mostly assists. But he puts in full
days at the new Kerlan-Jobe Clinic in West Los Angeles, has another
year left on his contract with the Dodgers and hopes to sign
another.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Beverly, married for 40 years, have four
prosperous sons _ two doctors, an attorney and a banker. Through it
all, Jobe has remained remarkably unchanged. His success and fame
have had no outward impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not been touched by celebrity,'' Scully said. ``He's
like the great surgeon he is _ minimal scars.''
</P>
<P>
   For a revolutionary, he has almost a pacifist bearing. There is
a calmness about him, a pleasant peacefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is, Frank Jobe is probably one of the nicest,
kindest human beings that God ever put on this earth,'' John said.
``Not only is he a brilliant surgeon, he's just a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tollefson, the Mets physical therapist who worked at
Kerlan-Jobe for three years and spent five years with the Dodgers'
minor-league clubs, said he sometimes saw other doctors envious of
Jobe's medical standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some hostility and jealousy toward him in that
area,'' Tollefson said. ``But I've never seen him do anything but
act honorably in situations of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much respect for him. He always did the right thing
and was very gracious. He doesn't know everything. He doesn't get
it right all of the time. But he's obviously very good at what he
does. And he's one of the most honorable, humble, gracious men
around.''
</P>
<P>
   John understands he is doomed to be recognized more for more
than his actual career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be known more for the (elbow) surgery than I will for 288
wins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe would prefer to be known for the series of exercises he
developed to strengthen the arm and prevent injuries, but he, too,
recognizes that wish is futile.
</P>
<P>
   He was given a gift, and realized it early in his career. His
long, soft fingers know how to play no instrument save the scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jobe likens a gifted surgeon's ability to that of an
artist who must first visualize what it is he is trying to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgery is essentially the same thing,'' he said. ``You
know if you have a three-dimensional picture of the shoulder, you
know what's under the skin and where it is in relationship to the
other things, so you can do a lot of work where you don't actually
see it, but you know you're getting it right.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gotten most of it right throughout his 37-year career,
leaving a legacy matched by few before him. His has been a life of
success stories, an impact that will continue, whether he planned
his life out or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (things have) happened because I wasn't smart enough to
plan,'' he said. ``But things couldn't have happened any better if
I'd planned it. When I've thought, `How would I change it?' _ I
wouldn't change a thing.'' &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end! &QL;
