	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has granted the prestigious
annual Prince Mahidol Awards in medicine and public health to
doctors who revolutionized treatment for heart patients and who
stopped the outbreak of Hong Kong's lethal chicken flu.
	   The awards, which include dlrs 50,000, a medal and a
certificate, were announced Wednesday from among 59 nominations
from 31 countries whose medical and public health work the
committee felt had most benefited mankind.
	   Surgeon Dr. Rene Favaloro from Argentina jointly received the
prize in medicine with Dr. Harvey White of New Zealand.
	   Favaloro was the first to perform a coronary bypass operation,
on a 51-year-old woman in 1967 at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
Such surgery has since saved the lives of millions of people
worldwide.
	   White, a cardiologist, has carried out studies and research on
the treatment of myocardial infarction, the death of heart muscles
following the acute obstruction of the coronary artery. Among them
was a study on dissolving clots in the coronary artery, hence
saving lives.
	   In public health, the prize went to Dr. Kennedy F. Shortridge,
an Australian chairing the microbiology department at the
University of Hong Kong, and Dr. Margaret Chan, director of health
in Hong Kong, for stopping an epidemic of the lethal H5N1 influenza
virus.
	   Shortridge and his group identified the H5N1 virus in chickens
as the principal source of human infection that caused six deaths
in 18 patients. Chan was instrumental in stopping the outbreak from
spreading, though a million chickens and ducks had to be killed.
	   The Prince Mahidol Award Foundation was established in 1992 on
the 100th anniversary of the birth of the father of Thailand's King
Bhumibol Adulyadej. The king will present the awards Jan. 28 to the
winners.

	   AMRITSAR, India (AP) _ An express train slammed into another
passenger train that had derailed minutes earlier in the
northwestern state of Punjab on Thursday, killing at least 83
people and injuring 230 others, police and railroad officials said.
	   The Amritsar-bound Frontier Mail from New Delhi derailed between
Khanna and Payal villages and seven cars fell on the tracks.
Minutes later, the Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express coming from Jammu
on another track struck the derailed cars, according to Amrit Lal,
a police officer at Khanna.
	   The accident occurred at 3.35 a.m. (2200 GMT Wednesday), Lal
said in a telephone interview. The site is 250 kilometers (150
miles) northwest of New Delhi.
	   The engine and at least four cars of the express train were
crumpled like balls of paper in the impact, Lal said. Rescue
workers cut the cars with acetylene torches to extricate 83 bodies,
according to railroad officials at the site who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   More bodies were still lying in the cars and authorities called
for more acetylene torches, cranes and other equipment, Lal said.
	   Workers took 230 people to local government and private
hospitals, where 36 people were listed in serious condition,
according to S.K. Mirza, an officer at the state police control
room.
	   A passenger ran a few kilometers (miles) on the tracks which cut
through wheat fields to alert a railroad watchman, who stopped
trains in the area and called for help.
	   Hundreds of villagers of Khanna joined police to help remove
bodies, carry people to hospitals or provide food. Many of them
offered their own sweaters or shawls to the victims. Shops and
schools closed in Khanna as a mark of respect for the dead.
	   Private pharmacies donated medicine to help the small government
hospitals that were overwhelmed with victims and ran out of
supplies. The government prepared to bring in more doctors from the
state capital Chandiragh.
	   Traffic along the northern routes in Punjab was suspended to
allow workers to rescue passengers and remove the wreckage.

Singapore's leading small businesses say they won't cut pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's leading small-to-medium-sized
businesses have said they will not cut employee wages beyond
government-implemented pension reductions, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The government on Wednesday officially recommended a 5 percent
to 8 percent cut in regular pay on top of a reduction in employer's
contributions to the mandatory, state-run pension fund from 20
percent of a worker's salary to 10 percent.
	   But Singapore's most promising private, homegrown companies said
they will not trim their employees' regular salaries, according to
The Straits Times.
	   The five winners of the country's annual business awards for the
top 50 local enterprises will either freeze or raise pay slightly,
though they will reduce pension payments in line with government
recommendations, the report said.
	   Singapore's wage cut guidelines ``give companies the license to
adjust wages if they are not doing well,'' managing director
Patrick Chong of Luxasia _ one of the top five companies _ was
quoted as saying.
	   ``But those that are doing well shouldn't use it as an
opportunity to reduce wages,'' said Chong.
	   The pension cut ``is already quite substantial,'' added chairman
Richard Tay of YHI Holdings, which also placed among the leading
five. ``We are still profitable, so we don't think we will take
such a drastic measure'' of additional regular pay cuts.
	   The Singapore government plans to gradually reinstate the
pension fund contribution depending on the state of the economy.
The cut is effective for two years starting Jan. 1.
	   ``We will progressively restore the rate,'' Minister of Manpower
Lee Boon Yang said Thursday.
	   Lee said the government will be cautious about pension fund
rates and won't make any decisions with the first signs of economic
recovery. The government may not restore the level of contributions
to current levels, he added.
	   Since the last recession in the mid-1980s, employers have
contributed 20 percent of a worker's salary to the pension fund,
while employees have matched that amount.
	   These savings, which are managed by the Central Provident Fund,
are widely used prior to retirement for housing purchases,
education and certain approved investments.

 &UR; Maple Leafs 5, Canucks 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Toronto, the Maple Leafs continued their domination of
Western Conference teams, defeating the Vancouver Canucks in a
battle of the two highest scoring teams in the NHL.
	   The Maple Leafs, who are 9-1-1 against the Western Conference
since moving to the East this season, got two goals from Frederick
Modin and one each from Mike Johnson, Steve Thomas and Dimitri
Yushkevich.
	   Adrian Aucoin scored for the Canucks, who have lost three
straight and five of their last six.
	   Vancouver is the only Western Conference team to beat Toronto
this season.
 &UR; Islanders 4, Flyers 2
	   In Uniondale, New York, Tommy Salo stopped 44 shots as the New
York Islanders snapped the Philadelphia Flyers' four-game winning
streak.
	   The Islanders won despite managing only 14 shots to the Flyers'
46.
	   Bryan Berard scored the game-winner at 11:57 with a power-play
goal in the third period as the Islanders continued their home-ice
domination over the Flyers. The Islanders have a seven-game
unbeaten streak at home against Philadelphia (6-0-1) since a 6-2
loss on April 2, 1996.
 &UR; Predators 4, Flames 3
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Tom Fitzgerald had the game-winner in
the third period as the Nashville Predators scored three straight
goals to beat the Calgary Flames.
	   Fitzgerald fired a high shot from the slot off a pass from
behind the net by Vitali Yachmenev 10:23 into the third.
	   The Predators started their rally from a 3-1 deficit with a
power-play goal by Ville Peltonen with 34 seconds left in the
second period. Nashville defenseman Joel Bouchard, who had missed
the previous 11 games with an ankle injury, tied the game 3-3 on a
slap shot from the left point five minutes earlier.
 &UR; Devils 5, Stars 2
	   In Dallas, Brian Rolston, Jay Pandolfo and Sergei Brylin all
scored in the game's first 7:28 and the New Jersey Devils held off
a third-period Dallas rally to beat the Stars in a meeting of two
of the NHL's elite teams.
	   The Devils entered the game in first place in the Atlantic
Division and the Stars were in second place in the Pacific.
	   New Jersey won its fourth in a row and improved to 6-1-0 over
its last seven games.

Report: Indonesia may revoke forest and plantation licenses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian government is
considering revoking licenses issued under former President Suharto
for the conversion of forest into plantations, a local newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   The Indonesian Observer quoted Forestry and Plantation Minister
Muslimin Nasution as saying at least 84 percent of the licenses
issued to convert 9 million hectares (22 million acres) of forest
into plantation have not been realized.
	   He said the government planned to revoke those unrealized
licenses. He said they had been issued under former president
Suharto and benefited only conglomerates with close links to him.
	   Most of the licenses were held by three conglomerates: Astra
group, Sinar Mas group and Salim group.
	   He said the government is working on programs to help
small-holder farmers to develop the forestry and plantation
sectors.
	   Suharto quit last May after student protests and deadly riots.
	   A new wave of protests has emerged recently. Students are
demanding that Suharto be tried for corruption during his 32 years
in power.
	   The government has promised to set up a new inquiry into the
graft allegations after an earlier probe failed to find any
wrongdoing by the former leader.
	   Suharto has rejected allegations by opponents that he abused his
power to enrich his family and a clique of cronies.

Report: Officials asked mainland to spare Hong Kong convicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ As a reputed local crime boss fights his death
sentence in China, reports Thursday said Hong Kong officials had
previously asked mainland counterparts to consider sparing the
lives of territory residents convicted of capital offenses in
China.
	   ``We have asked whether it was possible that the death sentence
on convicted Hong Kong people would not be carried out,'' the South
China Morning Post quoted a source as saying.
	   The newspaper identified its source only as a senior Hong Kong
security official. It also reported the source would not disclose
China's response.
	   Hong Kong officials had been working with their mainland
counterparts on an agreement covering the transfer of fugitives,
mutual judicial cooperation in criminal cases and the return of
persons jailed abroad to serve sentences in local prisons, the
paper reported.
	   The lack of such an agreement was highlighted in the case of
Hong Kong gangster Cheung Tze-Keung, who was convicted this month
by a mainland court in a string of crimes and sentenced to death
along with four accomplices.
	   The Post said the Hong Kong-China talks took place before the
trial of Cheung, known by his alias ``Big Spender.'' Cheung's trial
was the first such high-profile cross-border case to be heard since
Hong Kong reverted from British rule to China last year.
	   Human rights groups, legal experts and some politicians have
criticized the Hong Kong government for not seeking a transfer of
the Cheung case to Hong Kong, which has a more open court system
and no death penalty.
	   Many of the alleged crimes were committed in Hong Kong, but the
defendants were tried behind closed doors in the southern Chinese
city of Guangzhou.
	   Meanwhile, Cheung's lawyers are pressing ahead with his appeal,
calling for two tycoons who were allegedly kidnapped to testify at
an appeal hearing, the Post said.
	   The tycoons, reportedly Victor Li, son of property magnate Li
Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman of blue-chip Sun Hung Kai
Properties, never reported any kidnappings to Hong Kong
authorities.
	   This is the main reason why the Hong Kong government did not
have enough evidence to press charges, Hong Kong security officials
have said.
	   Cheung's letter of appeal argues that Cheung cannot be guilty of
kidnapping if there are no victims.
	   ``There is no evidence of a victim reporting a criminal case.
And there is no evidence of someone being criminally harmed. There
are only defendant's statements,'' the Post quoted the appeal as
saying.
	   The Hong Kong government has said it was forwarding to China
clemency pleas for Cheung and one of his gang members on behalf of
their families.
	   The Guangdong Higher People's Court is expected to deliver its
ruling on the appeal by mid-February, the Post reported.

Guerrillas kill two Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas detonated a
roadside bomb next to an Israeli patrol near the border in southern
Lebanon overnight, killing two soldiers, officials said Thursday.
	   The bomb was apparently set off by remote control as the patrol
passed between the villages of Houla and Markaba in the
Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon, Lebanese security
officials.
	   Two Israelis, an officer and a soldier, were killed in the
bombing at 11:05 p.m. (2105GMT) Wednesday night, the officials
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman identified the dead
soldiers as Lt. Uriel Peretz, 22, and 1st Sgt. Nitzan Baldran, 19.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the bombing, which took place at about the same
area where three Israeli soldiers were killed in a similar attack
on Nov. 16.
	   The area is about three kilometers (1.8 miles) west of the
Lebanese border with Israel, and about 20 kilometers (12 miles)
southwest of Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied zone.
	   Flares fired by Israeli troops lit the night sky and helicopters
hovered over the attack scene. Israeli gunners also fired artillery
shells on suspected guerrilla hideouts, the Lebanese officials
said.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust about 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 allied
militiamen from the occupied zone that Israel carved out in 1985 as
a ``security zone'' to protect against cross-border guerrilla
attacks.

Cambodian strongman Hun Sen appointed prime minister

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen, who seized power
in a coup d'etat last year, can now boast of being his country's
legal and legitimate leader with his appointment as prime minister
by a royal decree announced Thursday.
	   The appointment by King Norodom Sihanouk, dated Wednesday, came
four months after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a
plurality in parliamentary elections.
	   Hun Sen had to allow longtime rival Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
leader of the royalist FUNCINPEC party, to become president of the
national assembly in order to win enough support to form a new
government.
	   Hun Sen had ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in last year's
coup, killing a number of Ranariddh's top aides in the process.
	   Legitimately or not, Hun Sen has been Cambodia's top political
figure for more than a dozen years.
	   He first became prime minister in 1985 at the age of 33, making
him the world's youngest leader at the time.
	   But Cold War politics denied Hun Sen's government wide
recognition. He led a Communist regime installed by the Vietnamese
in 1979 after Hanoi invaded Cambodia and ousted the brutal Khmer
Rouge from power.
	   With the United States, China and their allies supporting the
Khmer Rouge, the United Nations continued to recognize the Maoist
guerrillas as the legitimate leaders of Cambodia.
	   After the withdrawal of the Vietnamese from the country, the
United Nations organized elections in 1993 that were won by
Ranariddh's party, formed from a resistance force which had fought
against Hun Sen's government.
	   Hun Sen's party finished a close second in the polls, and with
its control of the army and other security organs, forced Ranariddh
into a coalition agreement that made the two rivals co-prime
ministers.
	   Their uneasy partnership, which Hun Sen dominated despite his
nominal status as junior partner, dissolved with last year's coup.
The prince fled Cambodia and did not return until a few months
before this year's election.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won July
parliamentary elections, but Ranariddh and his opposition ally Sam
Rainsy, alleging widespread fraud and intimidation during the
polls, refused to allow the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to
approve a new government.
	   The political deadlock ended Nov. 13 when Ranariddh bowed to
pressure from the international community and his father the king,
and agreed to enter a coalition government.
	   Hun Sen is to present his new Cabinet to the National Assembly
on Nov. 30 for approval. A constitutional expert argued Thursday
that Hun Sen should not be officially recognized as prime minister
until the Cabinet is accepted by parliament.
	   ``It would seem to be a bit premature. The king should merely
designate Hun Sen to form the government,'' Ira Dassa, a former
legal adviser to the National Assembly, said of Sihanouk's decree.
	   ``This is another watering down of the National Assembly and its
constitutional role,'' he said. ``The assembly is supposed to pass
a vote of confidence for every member of the royal government,
including the prime minister.''
	   The article of the constitution describing the procedures to
appoint the prime minister and the government is vague. Hun Sen
aide Prak Sokhon said Thursday that only the Cabinet is approved by
parliament, while the prime minister is selected by the king.

Mexico rebels blast government economic policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHILAPA, Mexico (AP) _ Leftist guerrillas in southwestern Mexico
criticized the government's economic program, claiming it is
pushing the poor toward starvation and misery.
	   The Popular Revolutionary Army, in a statement released
Wednesday, criticized President Ernesto Zedillo's 1999 budget
draft, claiming its tax increases would take from the poor to give
to the rich.
	   ``Millions of households are being robbed without mercy by the
economic program,'' while military spending grows ``to contain
popular discontent,'' the guerrillas said in the release signed by
``insurgent Col. Jose.''
	   It said the government was ``killing people with bullets of
hunger and misery.''
	   The Popular Revolutionary Army rose up in Guerrero state in
1996, demanding sweeping political reforms. It is not linked with
the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army based in southern
Chiapas state.
	   Zedillo's budget draft has been harshly criticized by
economists, business leaders, and legislators _ including those
from Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   In response to the budget proposal, which includes a 15-percent
hike in gasoline prices, the leaders of Mexico's largest unions
have called for a 22-percent increase in Mexico's minimum wage of
dlrs 3 a day.

Report: U.N., Myanmar in secret talks over Suu Kyi dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The United Nations and World Bank have
held out an offer of dlrs 1 billion in aid to Myanmar if the
military regime opens a dialogue with the opposition led by Aung
San Suu Kyi, the International Herald-Tribune reported Thursday.
	   Citing unidentified sources involved in the negotiations, the
newspaper said that the plan was initiated several weeks ago and
could represent the best chance yet to overcome the government's
reluctance to hold talks with the pro-democracy opposition.
	   The reported initiative comes amid a deepening deadlock between
the military and Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and
her National League for Democracy.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. It is one of the world's poorest countries and faces
economic and political sanctions by the United States and other
countries opposed to the government's poor human-rights record.
	   The plan would add some carrots to the arsenal of sticks the
international community is using to push for change in the country,
the IHT quoted a diplomat as saying.
	   Both sides reportedly responded well to the overture, but it
would have to overcome huge hurdles to succeed.
	   The reported plan calls for compromises from both government and
opposition. Progress would be rewarded by increasing amounts of
financial assistance and humanitarian aid, the IHT said.
	   The first step for a release of funds would be for the
government to free political prisoners, allow Suu Kyi freedom of
movement _ she is largely confined to her house _ and permit her
party to function, the paper said.
	   Those would amount to huge concessions by the government, which
released some prisoners two months ago but has since taken hundreds
more opposition members into custody in an effort to persuade them
to quit the party.
	   In exchange, the National League for Democracy would agree to
rescind calls to convene the opposition-dominated parliament that
was elected in 1990. The military has never allowed the parliament
to meet.
	   According to the IHT, the money would be funneled through the
World Bank with the bulk of the funds coming from Japan and
additional aid expected from Australia and Singapore.
	   If the plan succeeds, the United States would withdraw its
long-standing veto of any funding or assistance to Myanmar from the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the IHT said.
	   The plan was broached to both sides during the recent visit of a
U.N. special envoy, Alvaro de Soto, the IHT reported. Another
meeting is expected in the next eight weeks, it said.

Tyson plans to plead no contest to charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson
plans to plead no contest next week to charges he attacked two men
in August after they rear-ended his Mercedes-Benz at a traffic stop
in suburban Gaithersburg, Maryland.
	   The plea to the two assault charges means Tyson would not have
to admit or deny guilt.
	   But if a judge accepts the plea, Tyson would be sentenced as if
he pleaded guilty. Each second-degree misdemeanor charge carries a
maximum of 10 years in prison.
	   Defense lawyer Paul F. Kemp said he did not know whether the
plea would lead to a revocation of Tyson's probation in his 1992
Indiana rape conviction, which could send him back to prison for
the three years remaining on his sentence there.
	   Indiana does not offer no-contest pleas. ``It will be up to a
judge out there to decide what effect it has,'' Kemp said.
	   Tyson is to go to trial Tuesday in district court in Montgomery
County, Maryland. His sentencing will be set for a later date.
	   The two men swore in separate complaints that Tyson attacked
them. One said the boxer punched him and the other said Tyson
kicked him in the groin after a fender bender Aug. 31.
	   Through his lawyers, Tyson has denied striking the men.

Saudi Arabia deepens old dispute with Thais, pulls out of games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with organizers urging reconsideration, other
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from
the Asian Games left organizers scrambling Thursday to change
schedules and Thai diplomats mulling a decade of relations strained
by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats.
	   Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the
Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign
Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its
105-strong team to the games, which open Dec. 6.
	   ``We're not sure if this is related to the Saudi jewel
scandal,'' Bhichai told Thai radio. ``But regardless, we should not
mix sports with politics.''
	   In a letter to the Thai prime minister's office, reported
Thursday by Bangkok newspapers, Saudi sports authorities cited the
looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan and national centenary
celebrations as reasons for suddenly pulling out.
	   But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason was the
continued strain in relations since a Thai janitor stole precious
jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and fled home.
	   Thai police recovered the jewels and returned them, but many
were fakes _ leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers
and members of Thailand's power elite kept the loot. The real
jewels have never been recovered.
	   Tensions were aggravated in 1990 and 1991, when three Saudi
diplomats were murdered in Bangkok. In retaliation, the Saudis
barred new Thai guest workers and refused to renew the visas of the
thousands already in the desert kingdom. The killings remain
unsolved.
	   Saudi Arabia has said relations would only be normalized when
the two cases were solved.
	   Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said it would be
understandable if Saudi Arabia pulls out because of Ramadan
fasting.
	   ``If there is any other reason behind this, such as the jewelry
case and the murders, we will regret it very much because sports
should be separated from politics,'' Kobsak said.
	   Organizers noted that 10 other Muslim nations are sending teams.
Suggestions were made that in the future, the Olympic Council of
Asia should consider punishing last-minute withdrawals.
	   Organizers need to hold new draws for both handball and
basketball because of the pullout. The withdrawal is expected to
cost 30 million baht (dlrs 830,000) to cover the committee's
expenses on organizing programs, accommodation and television
schedules.
	   Officials said they would consult with the council, which
oversees the organization of the games, about the impact of the
Saudi withdrawal.

Williams stays with Yanks, Vaughn agrees with Angels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Red Sox out of bidding for Belle &QL; 
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even by U.S. Major League Baseball's megabucks
standards, this was a big deal: Bernie Williams stayed with the New
York Yankees for dlrs 87.5 million, Mo Vaughn moved to the Anaheim
Angels for dlrs 80 million.
	   It all came in a flurry Wednesday.
	   Vaughn, coming off a huge season for the Boston Red Sox, became
the highest-paid player in the game when he agreed to a six-year
contract with the Angels that averages dlrs 13.33 million per
season.
	   ``All I know is I'm just going to try and bring a winning
attitude to this club,'' Vaughn said at his home outside Boston in
Easton, Massachusetts. ``They've got a great bunch of guys. I kind
of just want to fit in and help their team.''
	   Only 45 minutes later, the World Series champion Yankees again
won big. They outbid Boston at the last moment and agreed with
Williams on a seven-year deal.
	   ``I'm very happy the whole thing is over with,'' said Williams,
who beat out Vaughn on the final day for the American League
batting championship.
	   ``It came down to the fact that I wanted to be a Yankee, I
wanted to remain a Yankee for the rest of my career,'' he said.
	   And the free-agent frenzy isn't finished, either.
	   Next up is pitcher Randy Johnson, expected to decide by the end
of the week between Texas, Arizona, Los Angeles or the Angels. On
deck behind the Big Unit are outfielder Albert Belle and pitcher
Kevin Brown, who spent the day meeting with Colorado.
	   The Red Sox, who had considered Belle as a power replacement for
Vaughn, are no longer in the running for him, a source told The
Associated Press early Thursday on the condition he not be
identified.
	   Baltimore and maybe Arizona remain possible new homes for Belle.
He must decide by Dec. 2 whether to remain a free agent or go back
to his contract with the Chicago White Sox, which guarantees him
dlrs 35 million for the next three seasons.
	   In another move Wednesday, Arizona agreed to a dlrs 5.25
million, two-year contract with pitcher Armando Reynoso. The
Diamondbacks recently signed Todd Stottlemyre.
	   Vaughn's deal, which includes a club option for 2005, has an
average annual value that tops the dlrs 13 million that Mike Piazza
will average under his new dlrs 91 million, seven-year contract
with the New York Mets.
	   If the option is exercised, Vaughn's deal would be worth dlrs 92
million for seven seasons.
	   Vaughn, 31 next month, hit .337 this year with 40 homers and 115
RBIs. Boston broke off contract talks Nov. 11 after the popular
first baseman rejected a dlrs 62.5 million, five-year offer.
	   With Vaughn, the Angels are expected to shift Darin Erstad from
first base to the outfield. That could prompt Anaheim to trade
either center fielder Jim Edmonds or right fielder Garret Anderson.
	   ``The signing of Mo Vaughn is an extraordinary event for our
ballclub,'' Anaheim manager Terry Collins said.
	   Having missed out on Williams, Boston's best option for offense
is Belle. He must decide by Dec. 2 whether to remain a free agent
or go back to his contract with the Chicago White Sox, which
guarantees him dlrs 35 million for the next three seasons.
	   The Red Sox seemed on the verge of signing Williams until the
Yankees overwhelmed their Gold Glove center fielder and cleanup
hitter with a late offer. Williams hit .339 with 26 home runs and
97 RBIs.
	   ``They were very aggressive,'' Williams said. ``Obviously they
showed I was the type of player they wanted to have on their
team.''
	   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, was pulled out of a meeting with
Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris at Coors Field in Denver to take a
telephone call from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to finalize
the deal.
	   On Wednesday morning, when Williams left for his home in Puerto
Rico and Boras headed to Colorado to meet with the Rockies on
Brown, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman thought there would be
no deal.
	   ``We thought it was dead and buried when they left here this
morning,'' Cashman said.
	   Boston had made a seven-year offer to Williams, who also drew
interest from Arizona and Baltimore. All along, the Yankees were
speaking to Belle, just in case.
	   The Rockies spent the day in a get-acquainted session with
Brown. General manager Bob Gebhard and new Rockies manager Jim
Leyland also attended the session. Brown was 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA
last season in helping pitch the San Diego Padres into the World
Series. He won a World Series ring in 1997 while with the Florida
Marlins, then managed by Leyland.

of Sulawesi island, said large groups of people had begun
protesting again on Thursday at several spots in the coastal town,
1,370 kilometers (856 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   ``Some are now gathering outside our station,'' said the
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Chants and shouts from the crowd could be heard clearly when the
officer spoke to The Associated Press by telephone.
	   On Wednesday protesters burned down the office of the district's
head, as well as the local parliament, law court and prosecutor's
office, the official Antara news agency said.
	   Police stopped one mob from setting fire to the town's prison
where four executives of the troubled cooperative are being held on
fraud charges.
	   No arrests or injuries were reported.

Vaughn gets dlrs 80 million, six-year deal from Angels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Boston dropping out of Belle bidding &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Mo Vaughn leapfrogged Mike Piazza to
become the highest-paid player in U.S. Major League Baseball.
	   One of the most powerful left-handed hitters and highly
respected players in the game, Vaughn agreed Wednesday to an dlrs
80 million, six-year contract with the Anaheim Angels.
	   ``All I know is I'm just going to try and bring a winning
attitude to this club,'' Vaughn said from his home outside Boston
in Easton, Massachusetts. ``They've got a great bunch of guys. I
kind of just want to fit in and help their team.''
	   Vaughn's contract, which includes a club option for 2005, has an
average annual value of dlrs 13.33 million, topping the dlrs 13
million Piazza will average under his new dlrs 91 million,
seven-year contract with the New York Mets. Piazza, however, still
has the most total guaranteed dollars.
	   If the option is exercised, Vaughn's deal would be worth dlrs 92
million over seven seasons.
	   ``This is obviously a huge day for the organization,'' general
manager Bill Bavasi said in announcing the team's most significant
free-agent signing since Reggie Jackson came to Anaheim after the
1981 season.
	   ``We've never been afraid to get into the market,'' Bavasi said.
``We've always been careful about what we do. There's a change in
action. I don't believe we've seen the players who were the right
fit. Guys like this don't come around very often. We are not here
to spend money foolishly. We feel like we made a great deal
today.''
	   The Angels probably aren't finished in the free-agent market.
They're among the contenders for pitcher Randy Johnson _ an area
where they really need help.
	   ``He's a tremendous addition to any ballclub,'' Vaughn said. ``I
think the way the Angels go about their business, they have a
pretty good chance.''
	   The first baseman who turns 31 next month, hit .337 this year
with 40 homers and 115 RBIs for the Boston Red Sox while earning
dlrs 6.6 million. He has a .304 career average with 230 homers and
752 RBIs in eight seasons and in the last five, he's averaged
nearly 37 homers and over 116 RBIs.
	   Vaughn had been negotiating off and on with the Red Sox for the
past year, but the team ended talks Nov. 11 after he rejected a
dlrs 62.5 million, five-year offer.
	   On the first day teams could make offers, the Angels gave Vaughn
a dlrs 72 million, six-year proposal, starting a three-week
negotiation.
	   ``The signing of Mo Vaughn is an extraordinary event for our
ballclub,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Mo is one of those
rare individuals whose presence will have a profound effect on the
players, the organizations and this community. Our ownership has
established its desire to take this team to the next level, and Mo
is the type of individual who relishes that challenge.''
	   Vaughn had been with the Red Sox organization since he started
his professional career in 1989.
	   Boston had sought to replace Vaughn's offense with Bernie
Williams, but the AL batting champion _ he beat out Vaughn on the
final day of the season _ went back to the New York Yankees on
Wednesday night for an dlrs 87.5 million, seven-year contract.
	   That left Albert Belle as Boston's best alternative, but Boston
dropped out of the bidding, a source said early Thursday on the
condition of anonymity.

Five students drown in southern Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Five 15-year-old students drowned when
their boat sank in southern Vietnam, a local government official
said Thursday.
	   La Trong Nguyen said nine students were on an excursion in Binh
Phuoc province when they took a boat belonging to a relative of one
of them out on the Saigon River. They did not realize that the boat
had a hole that was covered with a cloth.
	   Under pressure, the cloth pulled free and water poured in.
	   One student rescued two colleagues but drowned when he tried to
save others, Nguyen said. Two students were rescued by villagers.
	   At least a dozen drownings of students have been reported so far
this year nationwide.

Court turns down Allied POWs compensation suit

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Thursday rejected a demand for
compensation by a group of soldiers and civilians from several
countries held prisoner in Japan during World War II.
	   The lawsuit was filed in January 1995 by seven plaintiffs on
behalf of 20,000 members of veteran and civilian ex-prisoner
organizations from Britain, the United States, Australia and New
Zealand.
	   The decision was the first handed down in Japan in a legal suit
brought by former World War II POWs from Allied countries. The
plaintiffs said they would appeal.
	   The seven were outraged. One, Arthur Titherington of Britain,
said he left the court in anger and spit at two entrances of the
nearby Japanese Parliament.
	   ``That's how I feel about them,'' he said of Japanese leaders.
``I worked like a slave ... I want compensation.''
	   The plaintiffs demanded dlrs 22,000 each for what they claimed
were violations of their rights under international treaties and
conventions on the treatment of war prisoners. The total claim was
for dlrs 440 million.
	   The court ruled that the issue was resolved in 1951 with the
signing of the San Francisco peace treaty.
	   Presiding judge Shigeki Inoue said in his verdict that because
of the 1951 treaty, individuals or groups could not seek
compensation from the government. He said compensation issues must
be dealt with on the government-to-government level.
	   Japan forced POWs to work in shipyards, mines and jungles in
violation of international law. They were also beaten and some were
executed. The POWs' death rate at the Japanese camps was 27
percent, compared to a 4-percent rate at Allied camps.
	   A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Martin Day, said the ruling _ and
the court's refusal to consider testimony of the suffering his
clients endured _ were an insult to the former prisoners.
	   ``We have received a judgment that has been a kick in the
teeth,'' Day told reporters. ``I think the Japanese court today
should be ashamed of itself.''
	   Day said the plaintiffs were willing to take the case to the
Japanese Supreme Court. Gilbert Hair, representing the American
former prisoners, said his group was also considering suing for
compensation for slave labor under an international labor treaty
signed by the Japanese in the 1930s.
	   Hair said the plaintiffs could also try to sue their own
governments for compensation, arguing that those governments did
not do enough to further the former prisoners' cause, but he said
he would rather be compensated by the Japanese.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-afternoon currency, bond and closing stocks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar climbed against the yen Thursday as
Japanese mutual funds bought the U.S. currency to invest overseas.
Tokyo stocks rose moderately.
	   At mid-afternoon, the dollar bought 121.64 yen, up 0.80 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 121.73
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 134.30
points, or 0.89 percent, closing at 15,207.77. On Wednesday, the
Nikkei had slipped 91.17 points, or 0.60 percent.
	   The dollar rose in thin trading ahead of the Thanksgiving
holiday in the United States, propped up by regular month-end
purchases by Japanese mutual funds anxious to invest new money in
foreign markets, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices rose amid optimism
that recent moves to stabilize Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
government will prove beneficial to the ailing Japanese economy.
	   The main stock index has rallied about 800 points this week,
closing above 15,000 points Tuesday for first time since Aug. 25.
	   ``The market has broken out of its old trading range,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, general manger of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   Investors have been encouraged by an alliance between Obuchi's
ruling party and the minority Liberal Party, which has called for
suspending an unpopular sales tax and trimming the government
bureaucracy, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.91 points, or 0.95 percent, to 1,164.59. It
had edged down 1.93 points, or 0.17 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.055 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.970
percent, driving its price down to 106.46 yen from 107.25 yen.

	   AMRITSAR, India (AP) _ An express train slammed in to another
passenger train that had derailed minutes earlier in the
northwestern state of Punjab on Thursday, killing at least 86
people and injuring 250 others, police and railroad officials said.
	   Seven cars of the Amritsar-bound Frontier Mail from New Delhi
jumped the tracks between the towns of Khanna and Payal in the
wheat-growing district of Punjab. Minutes later, the Calcutta-bound
Sealdah Express coming from Jammu on a parallel track collided with
the derailed cars, said Amrit Lal, a police officer in Khanna.
	   The accident occurred in darkness at 3:35 a.m. (2200 GMT
Wednesday), Lal said in a telephone interview. The site is 250
kilometers (155 miles) northwest of New Delhi.
	   It was the worst train accident in three years in India.
	   The federal government ordered a railroad safety official to
conduct an inquiry into the accident. The Punjab state police chief
ruled out sabotage, the United News of India news agency reported.
Punjab was the center of a decade-long secessionist movement that
was crushed in 1984.
	   The engine and at least four cars of the express train were
crumpled like balls of paper in the impact, Lal said. Rescue
workers cut the cars with acetylene torches to extricate 86 bodies,
according to Paramjit Singh Sandhu, a police officer supervising
the rescue operation.
	   Sandhu said more bodies were still lying in the cars and the
death toll could pass 100. Authorities called for more acetylene
torches, cranes and other equipment, Lal said.
	   Workers took 250 people to local government and private
hospitals, where 36 people were listed in serious condition, said
S.K. Mirza, an officer at the state police control room.
	   A passenger ran a few kilometers (miles) on the tracks which cut
through wheat fields to alert a railroad watchman, who stopped
trains in the area and called for help.
	   Hundreds of residents of Khanna joined police to help remove
bodies, carry people to hospitals or provide food. Many of them
offered their own sweaters or shawls to the victims. Shops and
schools closed in Khanna as a mark of respect for the dead.
	   Police cars drove through towns and villages in the region,
urging people to help and to assist in identifying relatives who
may have been among the victims, said Shiv Kumar, a resident of
Khanna.
	   ``It looks like all the people of Khanna have gone to the
accident spot. ... It's about five kilometers (three miles) from
the town,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   Private pharmacies donated medicine to help the small government
hospitals that were overwhelmed with victims and ran out of
supplies. The government prepared to bring in more doctors from the
state capital Chandiragh.
	   Traffic along the northern routes in Punjab was suspended to
allow workers to rescue passengers and remove the wreckage.
	   Every year, about 300 accidents occur on India's railways, the
largest network under one management in the world. In January, 52
people were killed in a train collision on a foggy morning in the
northern city of Lucknow. Three years ago, two trains collided near
New Delhi, killing 358 people. Most of the past accidents have been
blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment.
	   Yet, considering the size of the Indian Railways, the accident
rate compares favorably with advanced nations, according to
statistics compiled by the government. The number of casualties is
often high because trains are crowded _ an average of 750
passengers per train.
	   More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India
every day on 67,000 kilometers (41,540 miles) of track stretching
from mountains to the coastal plains, through dense forests, arid
deserts and crowded cities.
	   The network was set up 145 years ago by India's British rulers
to transport minerals to port, and then by ship to England.
	   In recent years, the government has begun improving rail safety
by automating much of the procedures, installing better warning
systems and improving training. All train engineers now undergo
refresher courses every three years and must be certified sober
before each journey.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan welcomed Chinese President Jiang Zemin on
Thursday with all the grandeur of a state visit, but an audience
with the emperor and an honor guard salute were overshadowed by
suspicions of lingering tension over old wounds.
	   Jiang is the first Chinese head of state to visit Japan since
World War II, and his meeting with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was
trumpeted as an opportunity to lay a foundation for friendlier ties
between the major Asian powers in the 21st century.
	   In a bid to help warm often frosty relations, Obuchi was
expected to offer the Chinese leader an apology for Japan's
invasion and brutal occupation of China earlier this century _
something Jiang was keen to secure during his trip.
	   But instead of the unequivocal apology sought by the Chinese,
Obuchi was widely expected to offer an oral expression of remorse
accompanied by a more indirectly worded expression of regret in a
formal joint statement.
	   Neither leader will actually sign the statement, something which
the Japanese press reported as a highly irregular move.
	   Last month, Obuchi offered visiting South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung a similarly worded expression of remorse for Japan's
1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula. But Obuchi and
Kim also signed that joint statement.
	   Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu
Nonaka, said Thursday that a signing ceremony was simply an option
that both China and Japan agreed to forgo, noting no standard
exists for formalizing political declarations.
	   While it marks the fullest expression of sorrow to date, the
decision not to sign the document appeared to underscore Chinese
disappointment and Japan's reluctance to offer an explicit apology
that could trigger renewed demands for compensation by victims of
atrocities.
	   Portions of the document dealing with wartime issues had not
been completed as of early Thursday, Japan's Kyodo News agency
reported.
	   The statement, due to be released later Thursday, also calls for
the establishment of a hot line for urgent communications between
Tokyo and Beijing, along with a pledge to increase the frequency of
visits by high-level officials, Kyodo said.
	   After arriving late Wednesday, the Chinese leader attended a
welcoming ceremony Thursday along with dozens of other dignitaries
at the Akasaka State Guesthouse in central Tokyo, where he will
stay for part of his six-day visit.
	   Standing on a red carpet next to Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko, Jiang and his wife looked on under a bright sun as a
Japanese military band performed both countries' national anthems
and a formal salute.
	   Jiang then met briefly with the emperor on the grounds of the
Imperial Palace before returning to the ornate guesthouse, styled
after France's Versailles, for talks with Prime Minister Obuchi.
	   Earlier, Jiang held a breakfast meeting with six former Japanese
leaders, including Obuchi's immediate predecessor, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who visited China while serving as prime minister last
year.
	   In their meeting Thursday, Jiang and Obuchi were also expected
to discuss expanding economic ties. China is Japan's second-largest
trading partner and Japan is China's largest, with annual trade
volume of more than dlrs 60 billion.
	   For Japan, a stronger Chinese economy and closer ties to Beijing
would anchor stability in a region where North Korea is still a
wild card and Southeast Asia is caught in financial and political
turmoil.
	   Another major issue is Taiwan, which China claims as a renegade
province. Japan recognizes Beijing as the sole government of China,
but has flourishing trade ties with Taiwan.
	   Jiang plans to meet with business leaders, civic groups and
students at a major university before leaving Tokyo Saturday for
visits to two northern Japanese cities, Sendai and Sapporo.

Ex-Zimbabwe president disappears ahead of verdict on gay sex
</HEADLINE>
charges &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Lawyers for former President Canaan
Banana, tried on sodomy and homosexual assault charges in June,
said they couldn't find him for a verdict hearing Thursday.
	   Lawyer Josephine McNally said she had no information on a report
in the state-controlled Herald newspaper that Banana, 62, facing a
possible jail term, escaped across the western border into
neighboring Botswana.
	   Banana's family said he traveled over the weekend to his home
area near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's western provincial capital,
according to the lawyer.
	   Banana, 62, a Methodist minister, professor of theology and a
former diplomat, was tried on 11 criminal charges of sodomy and
homosexual assault, alleged mostly to have happened when he was
president after independence in 1980 until 1987.
	   He was scheduled to appear in the High Court in Harare Thursday,
where Judge Godfrey Chidyausiku was to deliver a verdict on the
charges.
	   ``We haven't been able to reach him. I don't know where he is,''
McNally said an hour before the scheduled hearing.
	   She said a hearing would go ahead ``but it's up to the judge's
discretion as to what to do next.''
	   Homosexual sex is illegal in Zimbabwe. Prosecutors alleged
Banana used his authority as the nation's titular president to
force a bodyguard and other members of his presidential staff into
homosexual acts.
	   The disclosures deeply embarrassed President Robert Mugabe, who
has insisted homosexuality is foreign to African culture and was
brought to the continent from the West. He has launched an
outspoken campaign against homosexuality, describing same-sex
partners as ``lower than pigs and dogs.''
	   Banana's presidency after the former British colony of Rhodesia
became independent Zimbabwe was a ceremonial post, but he was
constitutional head of Zimbabwe when Mugabe, the nation's only
political ruler, was prime minister.
	   Banana was brought to trial after a police inspector shot dead a
colleague who taunted him as ``Banana's wife.''
	   Jefta Dube, serving a 10-year prison term for that murder, said
he was forced into a three-year sexual relationship with Banana
between 1984 and 1986.
	   In his court defense in June, Banana said the charges were an
attempt to destroy his character and political standing amid rumors
he was planning a political comeback.
	   The Herald newspaper said Thursday Banana might be seeking
political asylum on those grounds.

New twist delays Anwar trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A surprise twist delayed the sex
and corruption trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
on Thursday when the chief prosecutor was called away to testify in
a related criminal case.
	   Abdul Gani Patail, who is leading the prosecution against Anwar,
had been subpoenaed to take the stand against Anwar's former tennis
partner, who faces the death penalty for alleged illegal possession
of live bullets.
	   Anwar's trial was to resume later Thursday, however. The other
trial ended up being recessed until Jan. 25 to give a new lawyer on
the defense team time to make his preparations.
	   In Anwar's case, now in its 14th day in court, prosecution
witness Amir Junus, a former deputy chief of police intelligence,
was to continue his testimony.
	   Amir had testified Wednesday that Anwar, when in power, had
ordered him to use scare tactics to force retractions from Ummi
Hafilda Ali and Azizan Abu Bakar, both of whom had accused Anwar of
sexual misconduct.
	   The prosecution is trying to prove that Anwar abused his power
by ordering police to arrest and obtain retractions from people who
had written to authorities alleging his sexual misconduct.
	   Ummi, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, had accused Anwar
of having sex with her brother's wife. Azizan, the politician's
former chauffeur, claimed he was sodomized by his boss.
	   Anwar, 51, has repeatedly denied the 10 corruption and sex
charges against him, saying they were fabricated to eliminate his
political challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Last month, Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah said that once
Anwar's current trial ends, more sex-related charges would be
leveled against him based on new evidence against Anwar and his
former tennis partner, S. Nallakarruppan, commonly known as Nalla.
	   Nalla, a businessman, was indicted shortly before Anwar's
arrest.
	   Charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live
ammunition, Nalla faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted.
	   The bullets were said to have been found in Nalla's house during
a police investigation of allegations published in the book ``Fifty
Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while Anwar was finance and deputy prime minister.
	   Nalla and Anwar have vehemently denied the allegations, and
Anwar has accused authorities of conspiring to destroy his
political career.
	   One of Nalla's lawyers, Manjeet Singh Dhillon, said earlier this
week he planned to drop out of the case to take the stand as a
defense witness and reveal information relating to Anwar's case.

Oscar De La Hoya sued by 18-year-old woman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Oscar De Lay Hoya's promoter believes a story
in the Los Angeles Times prompted a woman to sue the unbeaten WBC
welterweight champion, alleging he raped her when she was 15 years
old.
	   The lawsuit, filed in San Bernardino County Superior Court,
alleges De La Hoya raped the woman, who turned 18 in September, in
a hotel room in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in June 1996.
	   The complaint also charges De La Hoya with assault, battery,
false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional
distress.
	   Promoter Bob Arum on Wednesday said he was ``absolutely
outraged'' by the suit, and believes it is the direct result of a
story in the Times three months ago about De La Hoya's fun-loving
behavior in Cabo San Lucas last Easter.
	   ``This is a total and complete crock,'' Arum said from his Las
Vegas office. ``Two and a half years after the alleged event, this
complaint is filed. There never, ever, ever was a complaint made to
the authorities in Cabo or to the hotel where the incident
allegedly took place.
	   ``It's an attempt to extort money and to use the legal system to
extort money, and it's an absolute outrage because nothing ever
happened. Nothing, nothing. He wouldn't know this girl if she
walked into the same room with him.''
	   The lawsuit asks for actual and punitive damages, and attorney
Lisa L. Maki said her side has what she called ``ample evidence.''
	   ``I think we can get more than (dlrs 10 million) based on the
evidence we have and the research I've done,'' Maki said at a
Wednesday news conference at her law office in suburban Bel-Air.
``I believe we can get double that.''
	   Maki said she was told by De La Hoya's attorney the boxer didn't
remember her client, and has slept with 500 women since the time of
the alleged incident.
	   De La Hoya's lawyer, Martin Castillo, didn't return a telephone
call Wednesday.
	   Maki said she was contacted by the woman approximately two years
ago.
	   ``My client is terrified,'' Maki said. ``I can't discuss the
factual allegations.''
	   Maki said Mexican authorities were contacted about six months
ago but were ``unwilling to help.''
	   ``Our only remedy at this point is civil,'' Maki said, adding
that her client was damaged emotionally and physically.
	   When asked if the suit was financially motivated, Maki replied,
``Unfortunately, the American system is set up that way. That's the
only way victims can be compensated.''
	   The plaintiff has only been identified as Jane Doe, a caucasian
U.S. citizen. Maki would not say where her client lived, and said
the suit was filed in San Bernardino County because De La Hoya
lives and trains in the community of Big Bear, located in the
county.
	   Maki said she didn't know when a trial might be held, guessing
it would take about 18 months.
	   Maki also wouldn't say if a settlement offer had been made.
	   ``She's doing OK,'' Maki said of her client. ``She's afraid. I
think any victim of rape has a certain amount of shame, a certain
amount of fear. She's not fully recovered. I don't believe anyone
fully recovers from this.''
	   Maki said the filing of a lawsuit was put off until after her
client turned 18 and until she was strong enough physically and
emotionally to go through litigation.
	   De La Hoya, who grew up in East Los Angeles and has a 29-0
record with 24 knockouts, is scheduled to defend his title against
Ike Quartey of Ghana on Feb. 13 in Las Vegas.

Court turns down Allied POWs compensation suit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Thursday rejected a demand for
compensation by a group of Allied soldiers and civilians held
prisoner by Japanese troops during World War II.
	   The lawsuit was filed in January 1995 by seven plaintiffs on
behalf of 20,000 members of veteran and civilian ex-prisoner
organizations from Britain, the United States, Australia and New
Zealand.
	   The decision was the first handed down in Japan in a legal suit
brought by former World War II POWs from Allied countries. The
plaintiffs said they would appeal.
	   The seven were outraged. One, Arthur Titherington of Britain,
said he left the court in anger and spit at two entrances of the
nearby Japanese Parliament.
	   ``That's how I feel about them,'' he said of Japanese leaders.
``I worked like a slave. ... I want compensation.''
	   The plaintiffs demanded dlrs 22,000 each for what they claimed
were violations of their rights under international treaties and
conventions on the treatment of war prisoners. The total claim was
for dlrs 440 million.
	   The court ruled that the issue was resolved in 1951 with the
signing of the San Francisco peace treaty.
	   Presiding Judge Shigeki Inoue said in his verdict that because
of the 1951 treaty, individuals or groups could not seek
compensation from the government. He said compensation issues must
be dealt with on the government-to-government level.
	   Japan forced POWs to work in shipyards, mines and jungles in
violation of international law. They were also beaten and some were
executed. The POWs' death rate at the Japanese camps was 27
percent, compared to a 4 percent rate at Allied camps.
	   A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Martin Day, said the ruling _ and
the court's refusal to consider testimony of the suffering his
clients endured _ were an insult to the former prisoners.
	   ``We have received a judgment that has been a kick in the
teeth,'' Day told reporters. ``I think the Japanese court today
should be ashamed of itself.''
	   Day said the plaintiffs were willing to take the case to the
Japanese Supreme Court. Gilbert Hair, representing the American
former prisoners, said his group was also considering suing for
compensation for slave labor under an international labor treaty
signed by the Japanese in the 1930s.
	   Hair said the plaintiffs could also try to sue their own
governments for compensation, arguing that those governments did
not do enough to further the former prisoners' cause, but he said
he would rather be compensated by the Japanese.

Students protest again for ex-President Suharto be put on trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Troops blocked about 200 student
protesters Thursday from staging a sit-in protest at the attorney
general's office to demand a trial of former President Suharto on
corruption charges.
	   In a protest Wednesday, police in a provincial town beat other
students who were also demanding that Suharto be brought to trial,
the official Antara news agency reported. At least 54 demonstrators
were injured.
	   Student activists who helped oust Suharto in May have stepped up
their demands that the former army general be held accountable for
official wrongdoing during his 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, announced last week
that he would set up a new inquiry into his former mentor's wealth.
	   A previous investigation by Attorney General Andi Muhammad
Ghalib turned up no evidence of wrongdoing and critics labeled it a
whitewash.
	   On Thursday, several busloads of students arrived at Ghalib's
office to press their demands. Security forces prevented them from
entering.
	   Earlier this week, hundreds of students occupied the attorney
general's office before army negotiators urged them to leave and
military trucks ferried them back to their campuses.
	   A clash in the provincial capital of Semarang broke out after
students gathered at the regional military headquarters. They
scuffled with security forces. Many of the injured were hit with
sticks or kicked, and three were hospitalized.
	   Semarang, the capital of Central Java province, is 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Meanwhile, angry residents gathered for a second day of protest
in a northeastern town Thursday, a day after mobs burned local
government buildings, according to police and witnesses.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of depositors of a troubled finance
cooperative burned government offices after they failed to get
their money refunded.
	   The violence occurred in Pinrang, on the southern end of
Sulawesi Island, 1,370 kilometers (856 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   As many as 31 people have been killed in demonstrations and
riots in Jakarta in the past two weeks. The total includes at least
nine students who were killed when security forces opened fire as
protesters, demanding democratic reforms, tried to march on the
Parliament Nov. 13.
	   The U.S. State Department has urged Indonesia to carry out its
pledge to fully investigate the shootings.
	   Indonesia should bring to justice those responsible for the
killings and other abuses, spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday.
	   The upsurge in student protests comes as Indonesia grapples with
its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   But despite the wave of unrest, there are signs of improving
financial activity.
	   By lunch time Thursday, the main index of the Jakarta Stock
Exchange had risen 7.870 points, or 2 percent, to 395.253 points.
	   The rebound followed a 7.8 percent dip Tuesday that resulted
from widespread profit taking.

DiMaggio celebrates birthday with some positive health news
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARV SCHNEIDER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio, recuperating from lung cancer
surgery, had special reason to celebrate his 84th birthday.
	   Not only had DiMaggio survived at least one brush with death,
but the news from one of his doctors was upbeat.
	   ``The prognosis for his recovery is good,'' said Dr. Earl
Barron, the lead doctor on a team of six physicians who have been
treating the Hall of Fame outfielder.
	   DiMaggio's birthday gathering began about 6 a.m. Wednesday when
he was joined in his hospital room by his brother Don, also a
former big league outfielder; his sister-in-law, Emily;
granddaughter, Paula, and her husband, Jim; his friend and lawyer,
Morris Engelberg, a couple of nurses and Barron.
	   Although they did not sing ``Happy Birthday'' or have cake, they
shared a few quiet words and a lot of smiles.
	   The outlook was brighter than it had been in more than a month.
	   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Barron for
the first time confirmed DiMaggio had a cancerous tumor removed
from his right lung Oct. 14, two days after entering Memorial
Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida.
	   Because of his age, DiMaggio's progress is ``guarded,'' Barron
said, but he added that the New York Yankee great's condition was
very good, compared to what it had been.
	   ``For a while, it was touch and go, but he has been showing
steady improvement,'' Barron said.
	   When asked if DiMaggio's positive prognosis referred to the
cancer or the complications that followed the surgery, the
cardiologist answered, ``Both.''
	   After the surgery, DiMaggio suffered severe postoperative
complications, including a major lung infection that affected his
breathing.
	   The worst setback came on Nov. 16, as Engelberg was making his
usual early morning visit.
	   ``It was a tremendous drop in blood pressure and it scared the
life out of me,'' said Engelberg, who has been acting as DiMaggio's
spokesman.
	   Engelberg became so concerned that a Roman Catholic priest was
summoned to give DiMaggio last rites.
	   ``But I came in the next morning and there he was, shaving
himself,'' said Engelberg. ``He's amazing.''
	   The main problem was a buildup of fluid in DiMaggio's lungs as
the result of an infection, and at one point, an opening was made
in his trachea to help his breathing.
	   Although DiMaggio was still on a respirator, the setting was
about half of what it was at the height of the crisis that nearly
took his life.
	   DiMaggio, who retired in 1951 after 13 seasons with the Yankees,
had been a smoker for years, starting in his youth in San
Francisco.
	   Throughout the years, DiMaggio has closely guarded his privacy,
and Engelberg said the center fielder was upset about erroneous TV
reports earlier this week about his condition.
	   ``Joe was angry when he saw on television that he had had a
heart attack,'' Engelberg said. ``I asked Dr. Barron, `Did Joe have
a heart attack?' and Barron told Joe, `No, you didn't have a heart
attack.'''
	   Engelberg said DiMaggio had instructed him not to divulge any
medical information about his condition, but because of recent
erroneous TV reports, DiMaggio agreed to allow Barron to speak with
the AP.

Saudi Arabia deepens old dispute with Thais, pulls out of games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS organizers upset over Thai-Qatar soccer brawl, no
punishment for players, last four grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from
the Asian Games left organizers scrambling Thursday to change
schedules and Thai diplomats mulling a decade of relations strained
by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats.
	   Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the
Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign
Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its
105-strong team. The games open Dec. 6.
	   ``We're not sure if this is related to the Saudi jewel
scandal,'' Bhichai told Thai radio. ``But regardless, we should not
mix sports with politics.''
	   In a letter to the Thai prime minister's office, reported
Thursday by Bangkok newspapers, Saudi sports authorities cited the
looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan and national centenary
celebrations as reasons for suddenly pulling out.
	   But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason was the
continued strain in relations since a Thai janitor stole precious
jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and fled home.
	   Thai police recovered the jewels and returned them, but many
were fakes _ leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers
and members of Thailand's power elite kept the loot. The real
jewels have never been recovered.
	   Tensions were aggravated in 1990 and 1991, when three Saudi
diplomats were murdered in Bangkok. In retaliation, the Saudis
barred new Thai guest workers and refused to renew the visas of the
thousands already in the desert kingdom. The killings remain
unsolved.
	   Saudi Arabia has said relations would be normalized only when
the two cases were solved.
	   Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said it would be
understandable if Saudi Arabia pulls out because of Ramadan
fasting.
	   ``If there is any other reason behind this, such as the jewelry
case and the murders, we will regret it very much because sports
should be separated from politics,'' Kobsak said.
	   Organizers noted that 10 other Muslim nations are sending teams.
Suggestions were made that in the future, the Olympic Council of
Asia should consider punishing last-minute withdrawals.
	   Organizers need to hold new draws for both handball and
basketball because of the pullout. The withdrawal is expected to
cost 30 million baht (dlrs 830,000) to cover the committee's
expenses for organizing programs, accommodation and television
schedules.
	   They said they would consult with the council, which oversees
the organization of the games, about the impact of the Saudi
withdrawal.
	   Officials, meanwhile, expressed shock over a brawl that erupted
Tuesday during a friendly soccer match between Thailand and Qatar.
	   The scoreless match was suspended without further play after
players from both sides kicked, punched and body-slammed each other
for about 10 minutes. Several suffered light injuries.
	   ``As a host, surely the melee will have an impact on the image
and reputation of Thailand,'' said Santiparb Tejavanija, chairman
of the administrative committee. ``Nobody wanted that incident to
happen.''
	   Officials said that forgiveness was a better option than
punishment and that both sides would be admonished not to let a
repeat brawl occur.

Chile puts pressure on British government after Pinochet loses
</HEADLINE>
immunity bid &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add Straw asking for more time to consider Spain's
extradition request in grafs 4; edits throughout to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Fearful for its fledgling democracy, Chile is
stepping up pressure on Britain to release Gen. Augusto Pinochet
following a ruling by this nation's highest court that the former
Chilean dictator cannot claim immunity from prosecution.
	   A Chilean delegation was to visit Home Secretary Jack Straw on
Thursday to urge him to use his discretion to block Spanish
extradition proceedings against Pinochet.
	   Straw has until Wednesday to decide whether to follow up the
House of Lords ruling by allowing Spain's extradition bid to go
before the courts _ or to let Pinochet return home. But the Home
Office announced Thursday that Straw was asking the courts for a
one week extension.
	   A backlash is sure to follow a decision by Straw either way, and
the pressure was already mounting from human rights organizations,
Chilean groups and Spanish prosecutors. Chilean President Eduardo
Frei ordered Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza to fly to London
and Madrid to represent his government's position ``at all
levels.''
	   ``We would like a quick decision,'' said Chilean Ambassador
Mario Artaza, who was organizing the visit to the Home Office. ``It
will be like an open wound festering, so we have to close it
quickly.''
	   Pinochet, recovering from back surgery in Britain, was arrested
Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant listing charges of genocide, terrorism
and torture. A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people
were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police
during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew Salvadore
Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   In a 3-2 vote Wednesday which Pinochet watched delivered live on
television, the panel of five senior judges overturned an earlier
decision giving the former dictator immunity from arrest. The
ruling brought a mix of celebration and anger in Chile and
worldwide, and dashed Pinochet's hopes of leaving for home
Wednesday on his 83rd birthday.
	   Now if Straw gives the go-ahead, British magistrates will begin
acting on the Spanish extradition request. Under British law,
Pinochet can appeal at each stage _ potentially dragging the case
out for months
	   If Straw allows Pinochet to return home on ``compassionate''
grounds, he would be overturning what human rights groups see as a
great international precedent.
	   Straw said he will act in a quasi-judicial manner _ not
politically _ and has refused to comment. This spring, Straw
blocked the extradition of an IRA suspect to Germany citing the
woman's frail medical condition which he contended would make it
``unjust and oppressive'' to extradite her.
	   On Wednesday, Pinochet is due to appear in Bow Street
Magistrate's Court, a formality required of anyone facing an
extradition order.

Rebels attack bus in northern Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels opened fire on a bus and truck in
northern Uganda, killing three people, and then attacked another
bus in the same location the following day, newspaper reports said
Thursday.
	   The independent newspaper The Monitor said that rebels of the
Lords Resistance Army, which operate in the north, opened automatic
weapon fire on Tuesday on a bus and truck driving through the
village of Ancholi Bur, 320 kilometers north of the capital
Kampala.
	   The Monitor said the rebels flattened the bus tires, but the
driver was able to continue to the town of Kitgum, 17 kilometers
(10 miles) to the north.
	   The rebels also fired on a civilian truck behind the bus,
killing three people, including a policeman and a soldier, the
newspaper said.
	   Several reports said the LRA attacked the same bus line
Wednesday in the same location, forcing passengers to flee into the
bush.
	   There were no reports of injuries in Wednesday's attack, though
the tri-weekly newspaper The Crusader said many of the passengers
who scattered following the gunfire were abducted by the rebels.
	   Minister of State for Defense Stephen Kavuma could not confirm
the attack, saying he had yet to receive a report from the north.
	   The government-owned New Vision daily quoted Marshal Odur,
police commander in the north, as saying the Wednesday ambush was
carried out by rebels mid-morning and the bus had been destroyed.
	   The LRA, which has its bases in government-held areas of
southern Sudan, has been fighting an 11-year insurgency in northern
Uganda, targeting mostly civilians.
	   The group often abducts children and young adults to use as
bearers or sex slaves.

Six Pakistanis expelled from Russia for preaching fundamentalist
</HEADLINE>
Islam &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian security officials on Thursday expelled
six Pakistani missionaries who were accused of fomenting tension
and preaching fundamentalist Islam.
	   The missionaries are Wahhabis, a fundamentalist movement that
Russian authorities have blamed for recent violence in several
parts of the former Soviet Union.
	   While preaching Wahhabism in the Bashkortostan region in the
southern Ural Mountains, the Pakistanis ``made anti-Russian remarks
aimed at fueling ethnic and religious hostility and offending the
dignity of other religious groups,'' the Federal Security Service
office said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The FSB, the main successor of the Soviet KGB, also accused the
six preachers of trying to recruit men to fight in the regional
conflicts.
	   The Pakistanis had visas valid until January and planned to
visit several regions in southern Russia, including restive
Dagestan, a republic bordering the breakaway region of Chechnya.
But they were barred from going and were sent home on Thursday, the
report said.

Veteran dissidents clash over leadership of illegal party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Highlighting the divisions in China's embattled
democracy movement, two of the country's most prominent dissidents
are clashing over control of an illegal opposition party.
	   Ren Wanding and Xu Wenli were friends when they began
campaigning together for democracy 20 years ago. But they have
since fallen out, and on Thursday Ren issued a long angry statement
accusing Xu of being power hungry.
	   The dispute centers around the China Democratic Party, which
dissidents have been trying to establish since June to challenge
the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Dissidents
throughout the country have tried to register the party as required
by law, all without success.
	   Police have detained many party supporters, usually for short
periods.
	   China's dissidents both at home and in exile have long been
divided over tactics and personal affiliations. Ren's attack marked
the first time a split has broken into the open among supporters of
the would-be opposition party.
	   Ren accused Xu of ``political profiteering'' in ``a plot'' to
take command of the party's efforts to set up a branch in Beijing.
He said Xu was ``stepping on others'' in trying to gain power and
``raping'' the would-be party.
	   Ren claimed about 50 people in his own group had been trying to
establish the party long before Xu this month announced the
creation of his own party branch. Ren said Xu previously had been
opposed to the creation of an opposition party, and in his
statement referred to him as a ``non-member.''
	   In response, Xu said in a telephone interview that Ren had said
publicly he would not continue attempts to organize the opposition
party after police interrogated him in September and warned him to
stop.
	   ``These are brazen actions,'' the work of a ``weak person,'' Xu
said.
	   Both Xu and Ren served long periods in prison after taking part
in the Democracy Wall movement in the late 1970s.
	   Ren and fellow dissident Wei Jingsheng, also a Democracy Wall
leader, received the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Award
in 1994. Both were in prison at the time. Wei was given a medical
parole last year and went into exile in the United States.
	   Ren spent 11 of the last 19 years in prison. He finished a
seven-year term in 1996 for making speeches during the Tiananmen
Square democracy demonstrations in 1989.
	   Xu spent 12 of the last 17 years in prison, much of them in
solitary confinement. Since his release in 1993, he has been
detained frequently.

Sri Lankan army kills 16 Tamil rebels

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan troops killed 16 Tamil
Tiger rebels in two separate clashes in the north, the Defense
Ministry said Thursday.
	   Twelve rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were
killed and seven soldiers were wounded when troops overran a rebel
fortification northwest of the town of Mankulam on Wednesday, said
Brig. Sunil Tennekoon.
	   Also Wednesday, soldiers destroyed a guerrilla base at
Paranthan, near Mankulam, killing four rebels. Five soldiers were
wounded. The clashes occurred about 250 kilometers (155 miles)
north of Colombo, the capital.
	   For the last 15 years, militants among Sri Lanka's Tamils have
been fighting for a homeland in the north and east of the island
nation, claiming Tamils are discriminated against by the Sinhalese
majority.

Students protest again for ex-President Suharto be put on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with protest near Suharto's home &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In what has become an almost daily
ritual, troops blocked about 200 students Thursday from marching on
the home of former President Suharto.
	   About the same number of protesters were stopped from staging a
sit-in protest at the attorney general's office.
	   Both groups demanded that Suharto be put on trial for
corruption. There were no reports of arrests.
	   In a protest Wednesday, police in the provincial city of
Semarang beat other students who were also calling for Suharto to
be tried, the official Antara news agency reported. At least 54
demonstrators were injured.
	   Student activists who helped oust Suharto in May have stepped up
their demands that the former army general be held accountable for
official wrongdoing during his 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, announced last week
that he would set up a new inquiry into his former mentor's wealth.
	   A previous investigation by Attorney General Andi Muhammad
Ghalib turned up no evidence of wrongdoing and critics labeled it a
whitewash.
	   Students have tried repeatedly in recent days to march to
Suharto's heavily guarded home.
	   On Thursday, they were blocked by dozens of security personnel
armed with bamboo shields and sticks.
	   The standoff was in a park adjacent to the U.S. ambassador's
house about one kilometer (one half mile) from Suharto's home,
where the former leader lives as a virtual recluse.
	   Earlier, several busloads of students arrived at Ghalib's office
to press their demands. Security forces prevented them from
entering.
	   Earlier this week, hundreds of students occupied the attorney
general's office before army negotiators urged them to leave and
military trucks ferried them back to their campuses.
	   The clash in Semarang broke out after students gathered at the
regional military headquarters. They scuffled with security forces.
Many of the injured were hit with sticks or kicked, and three were
hospitalized.
	   Semarang, the capital of Central Java province, is 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Meanwhile, angry residents gathered for a second day of protest
in a northeastern town Thursday, a day after mobs burned local
government buildings, according to police and witnesses.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of depositors of a troubled finance
cooperative burned government offices after they failed to get
their money refunded.
	   The violence occurred in Pinrang, on the southern end of
Sulawesi Island, 1,370 kilometers (856 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   As many as 31 people have been killed in demonstrations and
riots in Jakarta in the past two weeks. The total includes at least
nine students who were killed when security forces opened fire as
protesters, demanding democratic reforms, tried to march on the
Parliament Nov. 13.
	   The U.S. State Department has urged Indonesia to carry out its
pledge to fully investigate the shootings.
	   Indonesia should bring to justice those responsible for the
killings and other abuses, spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday.
	   The upsurge in student protests comes as Indonesia grapples with
its worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Opposition to challenge registration procedures in SAfrica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The opposition National Party
said Thursday it will sue to make it easier for South Africans to
register to vote.
	   The announcement came a day before the nation was to begin
registering eligible voters ahead of next year's election, the
first time such a comprehensive roll has been established in the
country.
	   Lawyers for the party that ruled under apartheid hoped to have a
hearing in Cape Town High Court Friday or early in the week, party
leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk told reporters in the southern city.
	   The African National Congress government and election officials
say only the latest generation of ID cards, which have a bar code,
are valid to register and vote.
	   Most blacks rushed to convert their restrictive apartheid-era
documents with the fall of white minority rule. Thus, a greater
proportion of blacks have the new cards than whites, the main base
of support for the National Party.
	   Van Schalkwyk wants the old form of IDs also to be valid to
register.
	   Surveys suggest as many as 5 million South Africans lack the new
IDs, but the Home Affairs Ministry has disputed the figure, saying
the number is in the hundreds of thousands.
	   Registration was to begin Friday, Saturday and Sunday in five
northern provinces and resume Dec. 4-6 for the rest of the country.
Other dates will be set in January and February.
	   The election is expected to take place in May, but no date has
been set.

Japanese stocks advance, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late afternoon currency, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks advanced Thursday on continued
hopes that plans to bring an opposition party into a governing
coalition would bring more economic stimulus measures. The dollar
climbed against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 134.30
points, or 0.89 percent, closing at 15,207.77. On Wednesday, the
Nikkei had slipped 91.17 points, or 0.60 percent.
	   The dollar bought 121.92 yen in late afternoon, up 1.08 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 121.73
yen overnight.
	   It ranged between 121.34 yen and 122.05 yen in thin trading
ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, propped up
by regular month-end purchases by Japanese mutual funds anxious to
invest new money in foreign markets, traders said.
	   Share prices rose amid optimism that recent moves to stabilize
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government will prove beneficial to
the ailing Japanese economy.
	   Investors have been encouraged by an alliance between Obuchi's
ruling party and the minority Liberal Party, which has called for
suspending an unpopular sales tax and trimming the government
bureaucracy, traders said.
	   The main stock index has rallied about 800 points this week,
closing above 15,000 points Tuesday for first time since Aug. 25.
	   ``The market has broken out of its old trading range,'' said
Kunihiro Hatae, general manger of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.91 points, or 0.95 percent, to 1,164.59. It
had edged down 1.93 points, or 0.17 percent, the previous day.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 499 million shares,
down from 505.13 million Wednesday. Advances outnumbered retreats
826 to 372, with 105 issues unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.055 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.970
percent, driving its price down to 106.46 yen from 107.25 yen.

U.N., Myanmar in secret talks over Suu Kyi dialogue: Report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Myanmar government, World Bank reaction, grafs
3-4; Suu Kyi position, last two grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The United Nations and World Bank have
held out an offer of dlrs 1 billion in aid to Myanmar if the
military regime opens a dialogue with the opposition led by Aung
San Suu Kyi, the International Herald-Tribune reported Thursday.
	   Citing unnamed sources involved in the negotiations, the
newspaper said that the plan was brought several weeks ago by a
U.N. envoy, Alvaro de Soto, and may represent the best chance yet
to overcome the government's reluctance to hold talks with the
opposition.
	   World Bank officials in Bangkok referred queries for more
details to headquarters in Washington. A Myanmar government
official said in a fax to The Associated Press in Bangkok that
there was much ``speculation'' over de Soto's visit.
	   ``It seems like everybody is taking a cautious wait-and-see
stance before giving any official comment on the issue,'' the
official said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   The initiative comes amid deepening deadlock between Suu Kyi,
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and her National League for
Democracy, and the military.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. It is one of the world's poorest countries and under
economic and political sanctions by the United States and other
countries upset by the government's poor human rights record.
	   The plan would add some carrots to the arsenal of sticks the
international community is using to push for change in the country,
the IHT cited a diplomat as saying. Both sides reportedly responded
well to the overture, but it would have to overcome huge hurdles to
succeed.
	   The plan calls for compromises from both government and
opposition. Progress would be rewarded by increasing amounts of
financial assistance and humanitarian aid, the IHT said.
	   The first step for a release of funds would be for the
government to free political prisoners, allow Suu Kyi freedom of
movement _ she is largely confined to her house _ and permit her
party to function.
	   Those would amount to huge concessions from the government,
which released some prisoners two months ago but has since taken
hundreds more opposition members into custody to persuade them to
quit the party.
	   In exchange, the NLD would agree to rescind calls to convene the
opposition-dominated parliament elected in 1990. The military has
never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   According to the IHT, the money would be funneled through the
World Bank, with the bulk of the funds would come from Japan and
additional aid expected from Australia and Singapore.
	   If the plan succeeds, the United States would withdraw its
longstanding veto of any funding or assistance to Myanmar from the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the IHT reported.
	   The plan was broached to both sides during the recent visit of
de Soto, the IHT reported. Another meeting is expected in the next
eight weeks.
	   Asked at a news conference Monday what her position was on the
envoy's visit, Suu Kyi replied: ``Neutral.'' She said that she and
the United Nations had agreed to make no comment on the meeting.
	   In response to another question, Suu Kyi said she had no
intention of withdrawing her call to convene parliament.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's machinery-maker Hitachi Ltd. suffered a net
loss of 142.23 billion yen (dlrs 1.17 billion) for the first half
of this fiscal year ending in September due to drops in chip prices
and in sales at home.
	   Hitachi had posted a profit of 37.67 billion yen (dlrs 309.68
million) for the same period the previous year.
	   ``We had figures which we've never experienced before,'' Yoshiki
Yagi, Hitachi's senior executive managing director, said Thursday.
	   Hitachi said sales dropped 6 percent to 3.897 trillion yen (dlrs
32.04 billion).
	   Yagi said the company's cost-cutting efforts couldn't catch up
with the steep decline in sales that included chips, color display
tubes and liquid crystal display products.
	   Sales in its electric and industrial equipment also fell on
declining investments at plants, as companies cut back to cope with
the nation's slowing economy. Sales of home appliances also fell,
it said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's leading small-to-medium-sized
businesses have said they will not cut employee wages beyond
government-implemented pension reductions, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The government on Wednesday officially recommended a 5 percent
to 8 percent cut in regular pay on top of a reduction in employer's
contributions to the mandatory, state-run pension fund from 20
percent of a worker's salary to 10 percent.
	   But Singapore's most promising private, homegrown companies said
they will not trim their employees' regular salaries, according to
The Straits Times.
	   The five winners of the country's annual business awards for the
top 50 local enterprises will either freeze or raise pay slightly,
though they will reduce pension payments in line with government
recommendations, the report said.
	   The Singapore government plans to gradually reinstate the
pension fund contribution depending on the state of the economy.
The cut is effective for two years starting Jan. 1.
	   ``We will progressively restore the rate,'' Minister of Manpower
Lee Boon Yang said Thursday.
	   Lee said the government will be cautious about pension fund
rates and won't make any decisions with the first signs of economic
recovery. The government may not restore the level of contributions
to current levels, he added.
	   Since the last recession in the mid-1980s, employers have
contributed 20 percent of a worker's salary to the pension fund,
while employees have matched that amount.
	   These savings, which are managed by the Central Provident Fund,
are widely used prior to retirement for housing purchases,
education and certain approved investments.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales of personal computers in Japan will likely
rise 8 percent next year, thanks in part to increased corporate
spending on information technology, an industry group said
Thursday.
	   The Japan Electronic Industry Development Association forecast
that PC shipments will climb to 7.8 million units in the fiscal
year starting in April, up from 7.2 million this year.
	   That follows an estimated 5 percent increase during the current
fiscal year, which ends in March.
	   The industry group attributed the higher demand to Japanese
companies' desire to upgrade their computer hardware following
government pledges to cut corporate taxes and implement other
measures to jump start the economy.
	   But demand for computer peripheral equipment such as printers
and scanners was expected to grow more slowly, it said.
	   Total sales of both PCs and peripheral devices were expected to
rise just 2 percent in the coming fiscal year to 6.12 trillion yen
(dlrs 50.61 billion).

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's national airline has
secured a 200 million ringgit (dlrs 52.6 million) loan from
domestic banks to help it buy a new Boeing aircraft, the national
news agency reported.
	   The loan from Perwira Affin and Bank of Commerce, announced on
Wednesday, will help Malaysian Airline System to finance the
delivery of its ninth Boeing 777-200 aircraft, Bernama news agency
said.
	   Despite posting a loss of dlrs 68 million this year, the airline
has stuck to its purchase commitments made in 1996, one year before
the region was hit by debilitating regional currency and stock
market turmoil.
	   The delivery of the aircraft is part of an order involving 10
Boeing 747-400 aircraft and 15 Boeing 777-200 aircraft, Bernama
said.
	   The loan to the ailing airline demonstrated the banks'
commitment to Malaysia's corporate recovery, Malaysia Airlines
chairman Tajuddin Ramli was quoted as saying.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine lawmakers are attempting
to prevent Hong Kong-based First Pacific Co. from taking a
controlling stake in the Philippines' biggest telecommunications
company.
	   Barely two days after the deal was struck, several Philippine
senators have filed motions calling for an inquiry into First
Pacific acquiring a sizable stake in Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co.
	   Separate motions were filed late Wednesday by Senators Juan
Ponce Enrile, Francisco Tatad, Vicente Sotto and Miriam
Defensor-Santiago, but all fear the deal creates a monopoly that
may harm the country's telecommunications industry.
	   The senators also fear that a foreign investor taking control of
PLDT could pose a threat to national security.
	   First Pacific, controlled by Indonesia's Salim Group, acquired
management control of PLDT earlier this week through a dlrs 749
million buy-in giving it an effective 17.2 percent stake in PLDT,
or 27.4 percent of the company's voting rights.
	   Manuel Pangilinan, First Pacific's managing director, will take
the helm of PLDT as president and chief executive officer.
	   In his motion, Enrile, who served as defense minister under the
late strongman Ferdinand Marcos, cited the need to ``safeguard the
interests of the people and of the national government'' in the
sensitive telecommunications sector.
	   Enrile asked a Senate committee to investigate the acquisition
for possible violation of the Foreign Equity Law, which limits
foreign ownership in certain protected industries such as
telecommunications to 40 percent of the company's total outstanding
stock.
	   Enrile and the other senators believe that First Pacific's stake
in PLDT, combined with shares owned by other foreign investors,
push the limit of overseas ownership in the company past the 40
percent ceiling.

Egypt hangs three Muslim militants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has hanged three Muslim militants for
plotting to assassinate top officials and blow up a major tourist
market in Cairo, security officials said Thursday.
	   The three, Adel Ali Bayoomi al-Sudani, Taha Abdul-Razak Ramadan
and Gamal Abu Rawash were hanged in a Cairo prison on Sunday, the
officials said. It was not clear why the announcement of the
executions was delayed.
	   Al-Sudani, a member of the Jihad group, was executed for his
role in an abortive 1995 plot to set off a truckload of explosives
in Khan el-Khalili, Cairo's leading tourist bazaar.
	   Abu Rawash and Ramadan, who belong to al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, were
hanged for their roles in assassination attempts against officials.
	   Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, is the strongest
militant group fighting to overthrow Egypt's secular government.
	   The deaths raised to 14 the number of Islamic militants executed
this year. The extremists have been waging a violent campaign to
destabilize the secular government of President Hosni Mubarak.
	   More than 1,200 people have died since 1992 in the insurgency by
Muslim militants. Most of the casualties have been police and
extremists.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Angry residents gathered for a second
day of protest in an Indonesian town Thursday, a day after mobs
burned at least eight local government buildings, police and
witnesses said.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of depositors of a troubled finance
cooperative went on the rampage after they failed to get their
money refunded.
	   An officer at the police station in Pinrang, on the southern end
of Sulawesi Island, said large groups of people had begun
protesting again Thursday at several spots in the coastal town,
1,370 kilometers (856 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   ``Some are now gathering outside our station,'' said the
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Chants and shouts from the crowd could be heard clearly when the
officer spoke to The Associated Press by telephone.
	   Dozens of police and troops were patrolling the town.
	   Other police said protesters had put up roadblocks made of rocks
and fallen trees on three roads leading into the town.
	   On Wednesday, protesters burned down the office of the
district's head, as well as the local parliament, law court and
prosecutor's office, the official Antara news agency said.
	   Police stopped one mob from setting fire to the town's prison,
where four executives of the troubled cooperative are being held on
fraud charges.
	   No injuries were reported.
	   Lt. Col. Syamsuddin Yunus, chief of the local police, was quoted
by the afternoon daily Suara Pembaruan as saying police arrested 13
people for looting shops.

Muralitharan in Sri Lanka's cricket squad for Australia tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan cricket officials have
included off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan in a 15-member squad that
will tour Australia, disregarding threats from an Australian umpire
that he will question his bowling action.
	   ``As far as we are concerned, the matter over Muralitharan's
bowling action is resolved for good,'' Thilanga Sumathipala,
president of Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, said
Thursday.
	   Reports from Australia said earlier this month that Hair
threatened to call Muralitharan for throwing if the bowler did not
sort out his bowling action before the January tour.
	   Muralitharan, one of the world's top off-spinners, was first
called for throwing by Ross Emerson, one of two Australian umpires,
during a tour of Australia in 1995. During the same tour, Hair
called Muralitharan for throwing seven times during a 3-over spell
in the second test.
	   Muralitharan suffers from a birth deformity in his right arm
that cannot be set right. To overcome the problem, he uses an
unusual double jointed wrist action.
	   Muralitharan underwent bio-mechanical tests in Hong Kong and
Australia that cleared him.
	   Three Australian cricket specialists, Daryl Foster, David Lloyd
and Angus Burnett of the University of Western Australia viewed
films of 24 delivers from six angles shot at 200 frames a second.
	   ``It is clear that this apparent straightening of the bowling
arm was a visual illusion,'' the team said in a report. The
International Cricket Council then cleared Muralitharan.
	   The 26-year-old bowler, who belongs to Sri Lanka's Tamil
minority, was not available for comment on his inclusion in the
team which besides playing against Australia will also take part in
a triangular tournament featuring England.
	   After Muralitharan demolished England's batting in the recent
one-off test, English coach David Lloyd's said he suspects
Muralitharan's action. It opened old wounds, but it was resolved.
	   The Sri Lankan team for the Jan.1-Feb.16 tour, which will be led
by Arjuna ranatunga, is loaded with four fast- or medium-pace
bowlers.

Red Cross says no evidence of massacre in East Timor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The International Red Cross said
Thursday it had found no evidence of a massacre by Indonesian
troops this month in the disputed territory of East Timor.
	   Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master, last week broke
off U.N.-sponsored peace talks with Indonesia in New York after
allegations surfaced of a massacre of dozens of civilians.
Negotiations resumed Wednesday.
	   A Red Cross team that visited the area where the massacre was
said to have occurred confirmed only four deaths, according to the
Jakarta office of the Geneva-based international aid organization.
	   Three Indonesian soldiers and one civilian were killed in
separate incidents in military operations that began Nov. 9, Red
Cross spokeswoman Sri Wahyu Endah said.
	   ``We don't see indications that there were widespread
massacres,'' Endah said.
	   Suspected rebels abducted 13 Indonesian soldiers and released
all but two of them, she said. Security forces arrested 13 people.
	   The violence occurred near the villages of Alas and Same, 25
miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Dili, East Timor's capital.
	   East Timorese rebels have been fighting for independence ever
since Indonesia invaded the territory in 1975 and annexed it a year
later. Hundreds of thousands of people died in fighting or of
disease and starvation in the late 1970s.
	   Indonesia has softened its stance on East Timor since former
President Suharto's authoritarian rule ended in May. His successor,
President B.J. Habibie, has offered a measure of autonomy in
exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over the land of
800,000 people.
	   Although momentum in peace talks has picked up, the controversy
surrounding the allegations of a massacre indicates how fragile
relations are between the two sides.
	   On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghafar Fadyl dismissed
the allegations as part of a misinformation campaign and questioned
Portugal's sincerity in the negotiations.
	   ``What were Portugal's motives for this fake information?''
Fadyl said. ``And it is not the first time. It's quite often.''
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has said that Portugal
has unilaterally suspended talks on East Timor three times since
1986.
	   Portugal, in turn, has accused Indonesia of reneging on pledges
to cut back on the number of troops in East Timor.
	   In suspending peace talks, Portugal cited reports of a massacre
received from East Timorese sources.
	   Two prominent East Timorese were among those who cited reports
that several dozen people had been killed. They were Mario
Carrascalao, a former governor, and Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos
Belo, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.

OPEC hopeful of price accord as delayed meeting opens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Venezuelan oil minister expressing
confidence an agreement can be reached Thursday. Will be led when
meeting begins, time uncertain. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ After pushing back the start of their
year-end meeting due to internal differences, OPEC ministers were
hopeful Thursday of agreeing on a plan on what to do to halt a skid
in oil prices.
	   Venezuelan oil minister Erwin Arrieta, speaking just before the
scheduled start of the formal session, said he was confident an
agreement could be reached by the end of the day. He did not
elaborate.
	   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is struggling
to find ways to boost prices after hitting snags about extending
production cuts and meeting compliance levels.
	   Ministers of the 11-nation cartel held six hours of informal
meetings Wednesday instead of an official conference as planned.
They declined comment on whether they had reached an accord.
	   Venezuelan officials reportedly told other OPEC delegates
Wednesday they were unable to pledge to extend output cutbacks
introduced in June because of upcoming presidential elections. The
June reductions were put in place in an effort to soak up the oil
glut on the world market and drive crude prices higher.
	   Iran also was a sticking point, delegates said.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the
group's biggest producer.
	   Saudi Arabia has drawn ire at the Vienna gathering, with some
members complaining the kingdom seized market share after Iraq's
departure from the oil market in 1990 and now won't let go. Iraq
has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990 invasion of
fellow OPEC member, Kuwait.
	   Under a special United Nations program, Iraq is able to sell
limited amounts of oil to earn money for food and other
humanitarian goods.
	   Traders in oil futures markets apparently don't expect much to
result from the meeting.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January was
trading in London at a 12-year low Wednesday, moving as low as dlrs
10.65 a barrel before settling at dlrs 10.90. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange, prices of sweet crude for delivery in January
reached a low of dlrs 11.63 a barrel, nearing its 12-year low of
dlrs 11.42 set in June.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Analysts said only fresh production cuts would raise the low
prices that are making gasoline cheap for consumers, but are
hurting economies in OPEC countries.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
favors new output reductions as do Algeria and Libya.
	   That probably won't happen, however.
	   Saudi Arabia believes further trims _ in addition to reductions
agreed to in June _ would be premature. It wants OPEC members to
comply with the overall 2.6 million barrels-a-day cut in June.
	   Qatari oil minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah said he
expects OPEC to convene again in March.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

Russia deports 45 Chinese fishermen who mutinied
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has deported 45 Chinese fishermen who
mutinied and took hostages aboard their boat to protest overdue
wages, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The Fufang-202, which carried a North Korean flag, arrived in
Russia's eastern port of Nakhodka about a month ago to unload cargo
and make repairs.
	   The Chinese workers, angry over unpaid wages, took the Taiwanese
shipowner and his son hostage and threatened to kill them if wages
totaling about dlrs 100,000 were not paid, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Russian police freed the hostages in an operation that left
several of the Chinese and one policeman wounded.
	   The dispute was later resolved through mediation. The Chinese
were promised their wages and were deported on Wednesday, the
report said.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ German Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping arrived Thursday on his first visit to Bosnia
since being elected a month ago.
	   During his one-day visit to the Bosnian capital, Scharping was
scheduled to meet members of the three-man federal presidency and
international officials to discuss the Bosnian peace process.
	   He also was to visit German soldiers serving in the NATO-led
peace force, based in the Sarajevo suburb of Rajlovac.
	   Germany currently contributes some 3,000 troops to the

Former prisoners not surprised at decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Surviving Australian prisoners-of-war
said Thursday they were neither surprised nor disappointed that a
Japanese court refused a claim for compensation.
	   Harry Nesbitt, head of the ex-Prisoners of War Association of
Australia, said a court victory would have done little for ex-POWs
because many were aged in their 80s and in poor health.
	   Three judges of the Tokyo District Court rejected the demand for
compensation made by representatives of 22,000 World War II
civilian POWs from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and
Britain.
	   The former civilian POWs had sought U.S. dlrs 20,000 each plus
legal costs in a huge group action initiated in early 1995.
	   Nesbitt, a veteran of the 8th Division captured in Singapore in
1942, said a major change was needed in Japanese society for it to
properly acknowledge the wrongs committed by its forces during
World War II.
	   ``They knocked back claims for the women sex slaves and I was
pretty sure the same thing would happen to us,'' Nesbitt said. ``We
have never received a proper apology from them at all.''
	   Harry Rynenberg, chairman of the Australian Civilian Japanese
War Prisoners Reparation Action Group, said his group would appeal
the decision.
	   Rynenberg said from Tokyo that lawyers for his group, which took
the legal action alongside groups representing American and British
civilian POWs, would begin work immediately on an appeal to a
higher court.
	   He said the Japanese judges did not accept the evidence of three
international legal professors the group had engaged.

French-made Mirages bolster Taiwan air defenses

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seeking to maintain air superiority over
mainland China, Taiwan on Thursday took delivery of the last of 60
Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters ordered from France.
	   ``As long as China continues to threaten to use force to swallow
us up, we must build up our deterrent force to preserve security in
the Taiwan Strait,'' said Chen Chao-min, commander in chief of
Taiwan's air force. Chen presided over a ceremony marking the
delivery of 18 Mirages at Hsinchu Air Force Base, 55 kilometers (33
miles) south of Taipei.
	   The fighters will form a third squadron of Mirages to be
formally established next June.
	   The military says the Mirages, along with 150 F-16 fighters
ordered from the United States, will give Taiwan air superiority
over China for years to come. Taiwan has already received more than
100 of the F-16s, with deliveries continuing through next year.
	   China considers Taiwan a renegade province to be reunified with
the mainland by force if necessary. Air power is considered crucial
to defending the island in any future conflict.
	   The Mirages, ordered in 1991 for more than U.S. dlrs 6 billion,
come with a complement of MICA mid-range air-to-air missiles and
Magic short-range air-to-air missiles.
	   They replace aging U.S. F-104 interceptors and F-5 jet fighters
now being mothballed or converted to reconnaissance duties.

Asian Games rehearsal closed to public; police warn fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police will arrest anyone trying
to bring weapons into the Asian Games, organizers have warned.
	   Meanwhile, next Tuesday's dress rehearsal for the opening
ceremonies was closed to the public as a security measure since
King Bhumibol Adulyadej and foreign dignitaries wish to be present.
	   The Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee announced Wednesday
that uniformed and plainclothes police will be deployed at all
sports venues to keep tight surveillance over fans during the
two-week games, which open Dec. 6. Bricks, sticks, knives and other
weapons will not be allowed.
	   ``Officials will have stringent inspections at the entrances and
those found with such materials will be arrested and legal action
taken,'' the committee said.
	   The final rehearsal for the ceremonies was to have been open to
the public, but organizers said they wanted to keep the pageant a
surprise and enhance security.
	   The ceremonies are proving problematic. Deputy Prime Minister
Bhichai Rattakul, chairman of the committee, withdrew 1,000 of the
top-line 5,000 baht (dlrs 140) tickets from sale to give to members
of Parliament and their aides.
	   But providing complimentary tickets to some of the country's
richest people in the midst of an economic crisis provoked a public
outcry. Leaders of the parliamentary opposition said they would
refuse them.

Death toll from floods in central Vietnam reaches 151
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The death toll from flooding in central
Vietnam has reached 151, local government officials said Thursday,
with Tropical Storm Elvis worsening the situation.
	   Provincial officials said water levels in rivers were rising
fast as Elvis dumped 100-150 millimeters (four to six inches) of
rain on one of the country's poorest regions between Wednesday
night and noon Thursday.
	   There was some relief, however, as Elvis weakened to a tropical
depression just before hitting land.
	   Low-lying areas where water had just receded from last weekend's
Typhoon Dawn were expected to be flooded again Thursday night,
officials said.
	   The Central Floods and Storms Control Department said Wednesday
that damage by flooding from Dawn _ the worst in some areas since
1964 _ is estimated at 420 billion dong (dlrs 30 million), but the
figure may rise.
	   The Vietnam Red Cross said it released dlrs 40,000 in aid to 11
provinces Monday and is providing another dlrs 67,000 from the
German Red Cross. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies said it was matching the dlrs 40,000
contribution.
	   The Quang Nam provincial floods and storms control committee
said Thursday that 39 people died in Dawn-spawned floods and damage
was estimated at 175 billion dong (dlrs 12.5 million). Danang
officials said 32 people died in the city, where damage was
estimated at 40 billion dong (dlrs 2.8 million).
	   Quang Ngai province reported 25 deaths and damage estimated at
138 billion dong (dlrs 10 million).
	   Central Vietnam is prone to typhoons, storms and floods. Two
previous floods in the last month killed 69 people and caused
damage of dlrs 22 million.
	   Until mid-August, the region was suffering from its worst
drought in at least half a century.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details on rescue effort, new quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By DEEPAK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMRITSAR, India (AP) _ An express train slammed in to another
passenger train that had derailed minutes earlier in the
northwestern state of Punjab on Thursday, killing at least 86
people and injuring 250 others, police and railroad officials said.
	   Seven cars of the Amritsar-bound Frontier Mail from New Delhi
jumped the tracks between the towns of Khanna and Payal in the
wheat-growing district of Punjab. Minutes later, the Calcutta-bound
Sealdah Express coming from Jammu on a parallel track collided with
the derailed cars, said Amrit Lal, a police officer in Khanna.
	   The accident occurred in darkness at 3:35 a.m. (2200 GMT
Wednesday), Lal said in a telephone interview. The site is 250
kilometers (155 miles) northwest of New Delhi.
	   It was the worst train accident in three years in India.
	   The federal government ordered a railroad safety official to
conduct an inquiry into the accident. The Punjab state police chief
ruled out sabotage, the United News of India news agency reported.
Punjab was the center of a decade-long secessionist movement that
was crushed in 1984.
	   The engine and at least four cars of the express train were
crumpled like balls of paper in the impact, Lal said. Rescue
workers cut the cars with acetylene torches to extricate 86 bodies,
according to Paramjit Singh Sandhu, a police officer supervising
the rescue operation.
	   The Press Trust of India and United News of India news agencies
quoted unnamed officials as saying the links snapped in the middle
of the 19-car Frontier Mail train and some of the rear cars
derailed. A total of 1,700 passengers were aboard both trains.
	   Sandhu said more bodies were still lying in the cars and the
death toll could pass 100. Authorities called for more acetylene
torches, cranes and other equipment, Lal said.
	   Workers took 250 people to local government and private
hospitals, where 36 people were listed in serious condition, said
S.K. Mirza, an officer at the state police control room.
	   Hours after the accident, many people were still trapped inside
the cars.
	   ``They are shrieking. Some are saying, 'Cut off my legs. Cut off
my hands. Just rescue me,''' said Shiv Kumar, a businessman who
joined the rescue effort. ``I saw one woman who is still trapped
inside. Her legs are dangling from the coach, but they are not able
to rescue her because the coach is at the bottom.''
	   Kumar said most of the dead appeared to be passengers in the
first four cars of the Sealdah Express.
	   Police rigged up loudspeakers to frequently announce that help
was on the way. Others were shouting words of encouragement to
those trapped inside, he said.
	   The first information about the accident reached a railroad
watchman from a passenger who ran a few kilometers (miles) on the
tracks which cut through wheat fields to call for help.
	   Residents of the wheat wholesale market town of Khanna organized
the first rescue effort, barely an hour after the accident.
	   Farmers shone headlights of cars or tractors on the wreckage.
Others offered tea, bread or blankets and sweaters since many
passengers were dressed in night clothes or had lost their
belongings, Kumar said.
	   ``The engine of the Sealdah Express is lying on the ground.
Three or four coaches are on top of it. They are all completely
mangled,'' he said.
	   Private pharmacies donated medicine to help the small government
hospitals that were overwhelmed with victims and ran out of
supplies. The government prepared to bring in more doctors from the
state capital, Chandigarh.
	   Police cars drove through towns and villages in the region,
urging people to help in the rescue effort and to identify
relatives who may have been among the victims, Kumar said.
	   Traffic along the northern routes in Punjab was suspended to
allow workers to rescue passengers and remove the wreckage.
	   Every year, about 300 accidents occur on India's railways, the
largest network under one management in the world. In January, 52
people were killed in a train collision on a foggy morning in the
northern city of Lucknow. Three years ago, two trains collided near
New Delhi, killing 358 people. Most of the past accidents have been
blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment.
	   Yet, considering the size of the Indian Railways, the accident
rate compares favorably with advanced nations, according to
statistics compiled by the government. The number of casualties is
often high because trains are crowded _ an average of 750
passengers per train.
	   More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India
every day on 67,000 kilometers (41,540 miles) of track stretching
from mountains to the coastal plains, through dense forests, arid
deserts and crowded cities.
	   The network was set up 145 years ago by India's British rulers
to transport minerals to port, and then by ship to England.
	   In recent years, the government has begun improving rail safety
by automating much of the procedures, installing better warning
systems and improving training. All train engineers now undergo
refresher courses every three years and must be certified sober
before each journey.

Leaney surprised to be leading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A mentally-drained Stephen Leaney
said Thursday he would have happily taken an opening par round of
73 in the 512,000 US dlrs ANZ Players Championship and ``gone back
to bed.''
	   Leaney, who was kept awake most of the night by recurring
nightmares about missing his U.S. tour card, walked off the par-73,
6,426-meter (7,027-yard) Royal Queensland course with a six-under
67, wondering just how on earth he was leading.
	   The West Australian managed just four hours sleep Wednesday
night after an overnight flight back from the U.S. Tour school,
where he missed gaining his card.
	   Fellow Australians David McKenzie and Rod Pampling, and New
Zealander Michael Long all shot five-under 68s to trail Leaney by a
shot.
	   Former U.S. Open champion Corey Pavin enjoyed the challenge
posed by Royal Queensland's postage-stamp greens, carding a
four-under 69. He was equal fifth with Australia's Peter Lonard and
Frenchman Jean-Louis Guepy on a packed first-day leaderboard.
	   Pavin, on his first visit to Australia, admitted he had been in
a form slump but said he scrambled well Thursday.
	   ``I missed too many greens, probably six or seven, but I missed
them in the right places,'' Pavin said.
	   Defending champion Greg Chalmers, also weary from contesting the
U.S. Tour school where he finished as the fourth-leading qualifier,
got to three under midway through his round before struggling home
for a par 73.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Human rights and opposition groups
accused police Thursday of beating up and illegally detaining an
anti-government activist who was arrested at a rally last week.
	   Tian Chua, chairman of the opposition Coalition of People's
Democracy, was picked up by plainclothes officers after police had
dispersed an anti-government demonstration Saturday. The protesters
were voicing support for ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   Six members of Tian's coalition, which groups about 20 human
rights and opposition political groups, met with a top Kuala Lumpur
police commissioner Thursday to protest Tian's detention. They
called it ``unconstitutional'' and ``motivated by malice.''
	   Tian and three others arrested at the rally have not yet been
charged despite a law requiring that charges be filed within 24
hours of arrest.
	   ``During and after the arrest, Tian was brutally beaten by the
police,'' the group said in the statement given to Deputy Police
Commissioner Foong Yee in a meeting that lasted more than an hour.
	   Witnesses at the anti-government rally said they saw police
manhandle and punch Tian at least twice.
	   S. Arutchelvan, the coordinator of SUARAM, a human rights group,
said Thursday that Tian told him in a brief meeting a day earlier
he had been beaten and punched several times while in police
custody.
	   ``I saw blood on his shirt and we are concerned for his
safety,'' Arutchelvan told reporters, adding that Tian's lip looked
torn up.
	   Arutchelvan said he went to see Tian on Wednesday when police
conducted a search of the detainee's home, where they confiscated
200 copies of an underground newspaper.
	   Police have arrested more than 300 people at street rallies
sparked by the Sept. 20 arrest of Anwar. Protesters have demanded
political reforms and an end to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year rule.
	   ``We believe that Tian Chua and all other people arrested for
their alleged involvement in the (reform) movement are not guilty
of any crime but are detained because of their political views,''
said the statement, calling for the release of those still
detained.
	   Meanwhile, four people, including a lawyer, were to face trial
for participating in a separate anti-government rally during a
Pacific Rim summit meeting last week, the Star newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The trial of the four, who were led handcuffed by police to a
magistrate's court Wednesday for their arraignment, was set for
Feb. 22. They pleaded innocent to charges of ignoring police
orders.
	   Another trial of 127 people arrested during a recent
anti-government demonstration was set for Feb. 2.
	   Conviction for disobeying police orders carries a maximum
penalty of one year in prison and a fine of 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,600).

Students protest again for ex-President Suharto be put on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number of protesters to 1,000, graf 1; ADDS protest
outside television studios, graf 13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In what has become an almost daily
ritual, troops blocked more than 1,000 students Thursday from
marching on the home of former President Suharto.
	   About 200 protesters were stopped from staging a sit-in protest
at the attorney general's office.
	   Both groups demanded that Suharto be put on trial for
corruption. There were no reports of arrests.
	   In a protest Wednesday, police in the provincial city of
Semarang beat other students who were also calling for Suharto to
be tried, the official Antara news agency reported. At least 54
demonstrators were injured.
	   Student activists who helped oust Suharto in May have stepped up
their demands that the former army general be held accountable for
official wrongdoing during his 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, announced last week
that he would set up a new inquiry into his former mentor's wealth.
	   A previous investigation by Attorney General Andi Muhammad
Ghalib turned up no evidence of wrongdoing and critics labeled it a
whitewash.
	   Students have tried repeatedly in recent days to march to
Suharto's heavily guarded home.
	   On Thursday, they were blocked by dozens of security personnel
armed with bamboo shields and sticks.
	   The standoff was in a park adjacent to the U.S. ambassador's
house about one kilometer (one half mile) from Suharto's home,
where the former leader lives as a virtual recluse.
	   Earlier, several busloads of students arrived at Ghalib's office
to press their demands. Security forces prevented them from
entering.
	   Earlier this week, hundreds of students occupied the attorney
general's office before army negotiators urged them to leave and
military trucks ferried them back to their campuses.
	   Also Thursday, dozens of students protested outside the studios
of Television Republik Indonesia, complaining about that network's
coverage of political events.
	   The clash in Semarang broke out after students gathered at the
regional military headquarters. They scuffled with security forces.
Many of the injured were hit with sticks or kicked, and three were
hospitalized.
	   Semarang, the capital of Central Java province, is 400
kilometers (250 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Meanwhile, angry residents gathered for a second day of protest
in a northeastern town Thursday, a day after mobs burned local
government buildings, according to police and witnesses.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of depositors of a troubled finance
cooperative burned government offices after they failed to get
their money refunded.
	   The violence occurred in Pinrang, on the southern end of
Sulawesi Island, 1,370 kilometers (856 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   As many as 31 people have been killed in demonstrations and
riots in Jakarta in the past two weeks. The total includes at least
nine students who were killed when security forces opened fire as
protesters, demanding democratic reforms, tried to march on the
Parliament Nov. 13.
	   The U.S. State Department has urged Indonesia to carry out its
pledge to fully investigate the shootings.
	   Indonesia should bring to justice those responsible for the
killings and other abuses, spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday.
	   The upsurge in student protests comes as Indonesia grapples with
its worst economic crisis in 30 years.

	   Banana faces a potential maximum prison term of 22 years.
Sentencing was set for Dec. 10.
	   The offenses, mostly involving bodyguards, a cook and a gardener
on his presidential staff, took place when he was president after
independence in 1980 until 1987.
	   Chidyausiku asked defense lawyer Chris Andersen to try to
persuade Banana to return to Zimbabwe.
	   ``I wish to afford the accused the opportunity to take part in
the sentencing procedures,'' he said.
	   Chikumira, the chief prosecutor, said Banana illegally left the
country Nov. 17 in anticipation of the verdict.
	   Prosecutors alleged Banana used his authority as the nation's
titular president to force a bodyguard and other members of his
presidential staff into homosexual acts.
	   In his court defense in June, Banana said the charges were an
attempt to destroy his character and political standing amid rumors
he was planning a political comeback.
	   The case deeply embarrassed Mugabe, who has insisted
homosexuality is foreign to African culture and was brought to the
continent from the West. He has launched an outspoken campaign
against homosexuality, describing same-sex partners as ``lower than
pigs and dogs.''
	   Banana's presidency after the former British colony of Rhodesia
became independent Zimbabwe was a ceremonial post, but he was
constitutional head of Zimbabwe when Mugabe, the nation's only
political ruler, was prime minister. The presidency was abolished
in 1987.
	   Banana was brought to trial after a police inspector shot dead a
colleague who taunted him as ``Banana's wife.''
	   Jefta Dube, serving a 10-year prison term for that murder, said
he was forced into a three-year sexual relationship with Banana
between 1984 and 1986.

Pakistan pumped to beat Zimbabwe

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani cricketers, buoyed by their
win over Zimbabwe in the international one-day series, said they
are confident of another win, this time in the Test series which
begins on Friday.
	   Pakistan also will be trying to redeem itself after last month's
humiliating loss to Australia.
	   ``Our main players struggled through injuries and we failed to
make a winning combination,'' said Aamir Sohail, Pakistan's
captain. ``But now with all the key players fit again, I hope to
achieve good results against Zimbabwe.''
	   Pace ace Waqar Younis, who has been dogged by a nagging elbow
injury, will be playing, giving Pakistan a big boost.
	   A veteran of 53 Test matches for 267 wickets, Younis injured his
elbow in July. He returned to play with Pakistan in the one-day
international against Zimbabwe.
	   Zimbabwe's captain Alistair Campbell, who is on his third tour
to Pakistan, was hoping for a win.
	   ``Pakistan is a very good Test side. They did not click against
the Australians and will definitely try to bounce back,'' he said.
``They have two quality Test bowlers (Waqar Younis and Wasim
Akram). Not many teams around the world have such a lethal pace
attack.''
	   The Zimbabwe captain said the wicket at the Arbab Niaz Stadium
in Peshawar was ''underprepared.'' He anticipated a low-scoring
match.
	   ``We do not have that much grass on the wickets at home,'' he
said. ``I don't think it's a 500 or 600 wicket.''
	   However, Sohail said the wicket will help seamers in the initial
two days until the grass settled down and then it will be a
batsman's wicket.
	   Lineups:
	   Pakistan (from): Aamir Sohail (captain), Saeed Anwar, Ijaz
Ahmed, Inzamamul Haq, Hasan Raza, Yousuf Youhanna, Salim Elahi,
Moin Khan, Azhar Mahmood, Wasim Akram, Mushtaq Ahmed, Saqlain
Muhtaq, Aaqib Javed, Waqar Younis.
	   Zimbabwe (from): Alistair Campbell (captain), Grant Flower, Neil
Johnson, Murray Goodwin, Andrew Flower, Craig Wishart, Heath
Streak, Paul Strang, Andrew Whittall, Gavin Rennie, Adam Huckle,
Henry Olonga, Mpumelelo Mbangwa.
	   Umpires: Athar Zaidi (Pakistan), George Sharp (England).
	   TV replays: Said Shah.
	   Match referee: Cammie Smith (West Indies).

Ice-breaking ship stuck in northeast Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A nuclear-powered ice breaking ship remained
stranded Wednesday and was unable to cut a channel for a tanker
taking badly needed fuel to Russia's northeast Chukotka peninsula,
news reports said.
	   The ship, Sovietsky Soyuz, and the Finnish tanker Uikku have
been icebound for two days some 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the
port of Pevek on Chukotka, a remote region that is running short of
fuel.
	   The tanker has 13,000 tons of diesel fuel that will be used in
the town's electric power station, Russian news agencies reported.
	   The tanker was to arrive on Nov. 18, but has been delayed by
storms and the thick ice.
	   Russia's financial crisis has disrupted shipping schedules, and
many isolated northern regions have not received a full allotment
of winter supplies.
	   Many areas are already running short on fuel though the worst
winter weather has yet to arrive. There are also concerns that food
shortages could arise in some regions, though supplies are adequate
for now.

Singapore government to boost tourism, exhibition industries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As visitor arrivals continue to dwindle,
Singapore has decided to spend about 40 percent more next year to
attract tourists to the tropical island republic, news reports said
Thursday.
	   An extra 30 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 18.3 million) has
been earmarked for the tourism drive next year to augment the
city-state's annual 80 million Singapore dollar (dlrs 48.8 million)
budget, The Straits Times said.
	   Before the regional economic crisis, Singapore used to enjoy 7
million to 8 million visitor arrivals a year, a figure more than
double its population.
	   Spending by these short-stay visitors, many stopping over on
wider Southeast Asian tours, created substantial revenue for
resource-poor Singapore.
	   But visitor arrivals in the first three quarters of 1998 plunged
about 17 percent from January-September last year to 4.6 million
people.
	   ``Besides this decline, Singapore has also been losing market
share'' to other Asia-Pacific destinations, Trade and Industry
Minister Lee Yock Suan said Wednesday.
	   The additional government money will go mostly for advertising
and promotional activities during Singapore's tourism drive to
celebrate the new millennium, the newspaper said.
	   The government also will try to attract more business
exhibitions and other conferences, Trade Development Board chief
Barry Desker said Thursday.
	   In addition to granting tax incentives for exhibition organizers
who stage approved events and other promotional schemes, Singapore
will open a 60,000-square-meter (648,000-square-foot) exhibition
complex in early 1999.
	   Total indoor exhibition space will exceed 100,000 square meters
(1.08 million square feet) once the giant Singapore Expo is
completed, said Desker.

Taiwan's vice president to visit disaster-stricken Central America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Vice President Lien Chan next month will
visit disaster-stricken Central American allies that provide Taiwan
with a crucial bulwark against China's diplomatic isolation, the
presidential office said Thursday.
	   Beginning Dec. 6, Lien will visit Nicaragua, Honduras, El
Salvador and Guatemala, all countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch
when it swept across the region late last month.
	   Taiwan already has promised U.S. dlrs 2.6 million in emergency
relief to those countries, where up to 10,000 people died in
flooding and mudslides and hundreds of thousands more were left
homeless.
	   The four countries are among a dwindling number of nations that
recognize Taiwan, claimed by China as a breakaway province without
right to international recognition.
	   Seven of Taiwan's 27 allies are in Central America and Taiwan is
careful to maintain healthy relations by providing them with aid
and investment.

Chinese expert says South China tiger may be extinct in wild
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The South China tiger may have disappeared from
the wild and those in captivity may be too few to save the species
from extinction, a Chinese wildlife expert said Thursday.
	   The last wild South China tiger was shot by poachers in Hunan in
1994, and since then scientists have found no sign that others are
left in their natural habitat, said Wang Menghu, deputy
secretary-general of the China Zoo Protection Association.
	   Only 53 tigers remain, all of them in Chinese zoos. Only about
half of them are the right age for breeding, Wang said in a
telephone interview.
	   ``There's research we should do but can't because we don't have
the proper equipment,'' he said. ``We need funds but have no
source.''
	   Wang said there was still hope that the extinction of the South
China tiger could at least be forestalled, especially if China can
get the population up to 100 in a few years.
	   In the 1950s, China had more than 4,000 tigers in the southern
provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Fujian. Poaching _ mainly
to cull their remains for traditional Chinese medicine _ and loss
of habitat from economic development have killed them off.
	   In May 1996, a report by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature said
fewer than 50 South China tigers were estimated to remain in the
wild. Throughout Asia, tigers were possibly dying out at a rate of
one per day and as few as 4,600 remained in the wild, it said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices rallied Thursday, pulled
higher by market heavyweight HSBC Holdings.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 57.93 points, or 0.5 percent,
closing at 10,778.92. The Hang Seng has gained 8.4 percent over the
past two weeks.
	   The catalyst for the rally was HSBC, Hong Kong's largest
capitalized stock, which gained 5.00 Hong Kong dollars, or 2.5
percent, closing at 204.00 _ its highest level in more than six
months.
	   The likely merger of Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust boosted
HSBC shares, prompting investors to ``focus on Europe,'' where HSBC
has a strong presence, said Kenny Tang of Tung Tai Securities Co.
	   Turnover fell to 5.94 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 761
million) from 8.62 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 1.1 billion) in
the previous session as investors were reluctant to push prices any
higher.
	   Investors were cautious over the expiration of the November
futures contract and the release of Hong Kong's final third-quarter
economic data, both on Friday, said Dickson Au of Sassoon
Securities Ltd.
	   Other gainers were Bank of East Asia, which rose 0.70 to 15.20;
Henderson land, 0.50 to 41.40; and conglomerate Swire Pacific A,
0.10 to 36.70.
	   Major losers were Cheung Kong Holdings, which fell 0.50 to
58.50; Cheung Kong Infrastructure, down 0.35 to 19.25; and Shanghai
Industrial, down 0.65 to 16.90.
	   Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific fell 0.05 to 8.10.

OPEC hopeful of price accord as delayed meeting opens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting begun; comment from Iranian delegate on
output level, extended cuts; Indonesian minister says no to more
cuts, calls for transparent oil industry &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A divided OPEC opened its year-end
ministerial meeting a day behind schedule Thursday, with some
delegates saying the organization would agree to extend production
cuts to the end of 1999.
	   That is the bare minimum analysts say is needed to prop up
rock-bottom oil prices, and doesn't promise a boost for prices,
flirting with 12-year lows.
	   A 2.6 million barrel-a-day cut that OPEC set in June to run for
six months could be extended to the end of 1999, an Iranian
delegate said.
	   Ministers had pushed back the start of the meeting, originally
scheduled to begin Wednesday, because of deep differences over the
issue of extension and disagreements over production levels.
	   Iran acknowledged it was facing criticism over its output level,
but called that unfair and said it isn't overproducing.
	   ``Others are blaming Iran,'' a senior Iranian delegate told The
Associated Press, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The figure which other countries maintain Iran should cut _
3.623 million barrels a day _ ``is not reflecting the new
refineries that came on stream at the time'' in February, he said.
	   Two more refineries that came on line then added 310,000 barrels
a day to production that the figures, based on secondary sources,
don't take into account, he said.
	   ``This is a matter of technical explanation, detailed
explanation, justification of domestic consumption. Some people are
convinced, some people are not,'' the delegate said.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level.
	   It says it is being made a scapegoat for Saudi Arabia, which
seized market share after Iraq's departure from the oil market in
1990 and now won't let go. Iraq has been barred from exporting
crude since its 1990 invasion of fellow OPEC member, Kuwait.
	   Indonesian oil minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said he didn't
favor fresh cuts, but did favor an extension, in what seems to be a
consensus view.
	   He also said Indonesia was undergoing a legal review of its
domestic oil arrangements after the fall of long-time ruler
Suharto.
	   ``We want to have a competitive sector, oil and gas, a sector
that is effective and transparent, in terms of an open market
downstream and an effective market upstream,'' Mangkusubroto told
The Associated Press.
	   Venezuela threw a late spanner in the works when Oil Minister
Erwin Arrieta told ministers during preliminary talks he could not
guarantee an extension due to a change of government there in
February, an OPEC delegate said.
	   World oil prices are hovering around 12-year lows, pushed down
by a world oil glut caused by a decision last winter to boost
production.
	   That coincided with Asia's economic crisis which cut demand
growth in the region by about half.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, is pushing for better
compliance with June's cuts, saying there is no point to further
cuts until full compliance is achieved.
	   Venezuela's Arrieta, speaking just before the scheduled start of
the formal session, said he was confident an agreement could be
reached by the end of the day. He did not elaborate.
	   Under a special United Nations program, Iraq is able to sell
limited amounts of oil to earn money for food and other
humanitarian goods.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January was
trading in Singapore at a 12-year low of dlrs 10.90.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
favors new output reductions as do Algeria and Libya.
	   Qatari oil minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah said he
expects OPEC to convene again in March.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

U.S. rapper Coolio on trial for theft, assault in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Grammy-winning U.S. rapper Coolio
appeared in court Thursday to face theft and assault charges almost
one year after his arrest for allegedly punching a saleswoman
during a European tour.
	   Police officials say Coolio and six members of his group left a
boutique in a Stuttgart suburb last Nov. 20 without paying for
clothing worth 3,500 marks (dlrs 2,000). The rapper is accused of
hitting the saleswoman in the stomach when she confronted the
group.
	   German lawyer Georg Prasser was representing Coolio at the
trial, expected to last four days.
	   Coolio has denied the charges. He and the group had gone to the
boutique to pick up free outfits promised them by a clothing
company, according to Coolio's German manager, Juergen Sauer. The
group later returned the clothes, but that did not constitute an
admission of guilt, Sauer said.
	   Police arrested Coolio in Frankfurt, 90 miles to the north. The
group was released after posting 250,000 marks (dlrs 167,000) bail
and was allowed to finish its tour. None of the group members is on
trial.
	   Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., won a Grammy for
best rap solo in 1996 for ``Gangsta's Paradise,'' which was
featured in the film ``Dangerous Minds.''
	   He was arrested in September in Los Angeles for carrying a
concealed weapon and possession of marijuana after police pulled
him over for driving on the wrong side of a street.

China urges Japan to make an explicit apology over WWII
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With its president in Tokyo for a summit, China
urged Japan anew Thursday to set a smooth course for future
relations by making an explicit apology for the Japanese occupation
during World War II.
	   The appeal from China's Foreign Ministry underscores how the
past persists in upsetting relations between Asia's powers, one an
economic giant, the other a would-be superpower.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang noted that some
Japanese, ``including some political figures or senior officials,''
``deny and whitewash the history of aggression.''
	   ``These moves hurt the feelings of the people in Asia including
the Chinese people,'' Tang said at twice-weekly media briefing.
``On this issue Japan should adopt a correct attitude, explicitly
oppose these kinds of erroneous words and practices and adopt a
correct historical perspective to educate its young people so they
can have a correct understanding of history.''
	   ``Only in this way can we further promote relations between
China and Japan,'' Tang said.
	   Making the first visit ever to Japan by a Chinese head of state,
President Jiang Zemin was hoping to receive from Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi the most forthright apology Japan has given China to
date for wartime atrocities.
	   Japan seized much of northeast China in 1931, and in 1937 the
Imperial Army began a brutal invasion and occupation of China
proper. In the eight years before Japan's 1945 surrender, China
estimates 35 million of its people were killed or wounded.
	   China has continually urged Japanese leaders to make a proper
apology and also repeatedly criticized them for falling short. The
rebukes have been so common, some have accused China of using
wartime guilt to wrest concessions from its biggest investor.
	   ``It is wrong to say that China would like to prolong this
historical issue,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang said.
	   ``In history the atrocities were committed by the Japanese
militarists. So the important thing to do is for the Japanese side
to face up to history and recognize history and to adopt a correct
attitude on history,'' he added.
	   In a sign of the difficulties of negotiating an apology,
Japanese media reported neither China nor Japan would sign the
final statement.
	   Tang denied anything was amiss. He said signing such statements
was decided case by case and noted that China has not signed
recently issued joint statements with the United States, Russia,
Britain and France.
	   ``The key is not the signature. The key is how to implement the
letters and spirit of the document,'' Tang said.

Rebels attack bus in northern Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels fired on a bus and a truck in
northern Uganda, killing three people, then attacked another bus in
the same location the following day, newspaper reports said
Thursday.
	   Rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army on Tuesday shot at a bus
and truck driving through the village of Ancholi Bur, 320
kilometers (200 miles) north of the capital Kampala, The Monitor
reported.
	   The independent newspaper said the rebels flattened the bus
tires, but the driver was able to continue to the town of Kitgum,
17 kilometers (10 miles) to the north.
	   The rebels also fired on a civilian truck behind the bus,
killing three people, including a policeman and a soldier, the
newspaper said.
	   Several reports said the LRA attacked the same bus line
Wednesday in the same location, forcing passengers to flee into the
bush.
	   There were no reports of injuries in Wednesday's attack, though
the tri-weekly newspaper The Crusader said many of the passengers
who scattered following the gunfire were abducted by the rebels.
	   Minister of State for Defense Stephen Kavuma could not confirm
the attack.
	   The LRA, which has bases in government-held areas of southern
Sudan, has been fighting a 12-year insurgency in northern Uganda,
targeting mostly civilians.
	   The group often abducts children and young adults to use as
bearers, fighters or sex slaves.

Philippine stocks fall on profit-taking; index down 1.9 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell Thursday as
investors continued to cash in on gains registered in recent
sessions, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 37.61 points,
or 1.9 percent, to 1,920.93 after losing 2.71 points Wednesday,
also on profit-taking.
	   Before Wednesday's downturn, the main index had risen
consistently since Nov. 20, piling up gains totaling 142.24 points,
or 7.8 percent.
	   ``The market has reached overbought levels, so the correction
was expected,'' said Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president of
Diversified Securities Inc.
	   Telecommunication stocks dominated trading after the recent
buy-in by Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. into Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. The purchase of a controlling interest in
PLDT, the country's largest telecommunications company, has led to
speculation that the sector is poised for a further consolidation,
with industry players merging to fortify their operations.
	   PLDT shares fell 25 pesos, or 2.4 percent, to 1,000 pesos, while
shares of Metro Pacific, the local flagship of First Pacific,
dropped 22 centavos, or 10 percent, to 1.90 pesos.
	   Garcia said investors also took profits Thursday ahead of the
U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and a long weekend, as Philippine markets
close Monday for a national holiday.
	   Investors were also wary of getting caught holding Manila shares
when the government releases third-quarter economic data Friday, he
said.
	   ``People are expecting the economic data to be negative, so they
sold shares ahead of the data's release,'' said Garcia.
	   Economists fear the government may report flat growth or another
contraction in the economy, which would officially put the country
in a recession. An economic recession is normally defined as two
successive quarters of contraction.
	   In the second quarter, the country's gross national product
contracted by 0.7 percent, while its gross domestic product
declined by 1.2 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the peso weakened against the dollar in slack trading
as participants stayed on the sidelines ahead of the U.S. holiday
and because of a lack of dollar inflows, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.462 pesos for the day, up from
Wednesday's average of 39.381 pesos. It stayed in a thin range of
39.390 pesos to 39.510 pesos and was last traded at 39.490 pesos.
	   Traders said a lack of market-moving news caused most
participants to hold off any currency purchases, with many having
covered their peso and dollar requirements in previous sessions.
	   The central bank wasn't active on the spot market. It held its
overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.500 percent and 15.500
percent, respectively.

Police detain Palestinians after confrontation with Jewish settlers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers on Thursday blocked
Palestinian school children enroute to a field trip, touching off
scuffling between Palestinians and Israelis, according to
witnesses.
	   Israeli police said they detained four Palestinians, including
the school principal and a student, for questioning. A dozen girls
were taken to the hospital, but no injuries were reported.
	   The confrontation began at 8 a.m. when pupils aged 6 to 14 from
the Kurtouba Preparatory School gathered to board a bus to go to
Jerusalem. Palestinian witnesses said about 20 settlers from the
nearby Beit Haddasah enclave confronted the girls and began pushing
them back into the school, which is located in the
Israeli-controlled part of the city.
	   ``We were planning to go on a trip, and two female settlers
blocked us and started shouting and cursing. More settlers came,
and then the police came and pushed us back to school. We were so
scared,'' said 10-year-old Ula Natshe.
	   Palestinian residents say that in recent weeks Israeli troops
and settlers have harassed Palestinians who walked by the Jewish
settler enclave.
	   Ofir Sivan, spokesman for Israeli police in the West Bank
district, said the scuffle broke out after some 40 students led by
their principal, Firial Abu Hekal, refused orders to end a protest.
	   Sivan said the Palestinians were protesting what they believed
to be continued harassment of the school girls by the settlers.
	   Five pupils were carried away in Palestinian ambulances after
fainting, and the hospital later reported 12 were seen by doctors.
	   Palestinian officials said Israeli police detained a 13 year-old
student and school Superintendent Taysir Maswadah in addition to
the principal. Two parents were also detained after attempting to
get into the school to get their children.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Former President Canaan Banana was
convicted Thursday of 11 counts of sodomy and homosexual assault,
and prosecutors confirmed he had fled the country.
	   Banana, a Methodist minister, was asking for political asylum in
neighboring Botswana after leaving the country Nov. 17 ahead of the
verdict, said Chief Prosecutor Augustine Chikumira. Zimbabwe will
seek extradition, he said.
	   The guilty verdict on all counts came after a three-week trial
in June. Banana faces an estimated maximum sentence of 22 years in
prison at sentencing Dec. 10.
	   Judge Godfrey Chidyausiku issued an arrest warrant and ordered
bail revoked. Banana had been free on bail of 20,000 Zimbabwe
dollars (dlrs 600), and had surrendered his passport and deed to
his mansion in the exclusive Mount Pleasant suburb of Harare.
	   The judge urged defense lawyer Chris Andersen to try to persuade
Banana to return to Zimbabwe for sentencing.
	   The case has deeply embarrassed President Robert Mugabe, who
insists homosexuality is foreign to African culture and was brought
to the continent from the West. He has launched an outspoken
campaign against homosexuality, describing same-sex partners as
``lower than pigs and dogs.''
	   The stance in southern Africa is not unusual. Government
officials of nearby Namibia and Zambia have made similar anti-gay
statements. South Africa has bucked the trend and recently
decriminalized gay sex.
	   The offenses attributed to Banana mostly involved bodyguards, a
cook and a gardener on his presidential staff. They took place when
he was president after independence in 1980 until 1987.
	   Prosecutors alleged Banana used his authority as the nation's
titular president to force the individuals into homosexual acts.
	   In his court defense in June, Banana said the charges were an
attempt to destroy his character and political standing amid rumors
he was planning a political comeback.
	   Banana's presidency after the former British colony of Rhodesia
became independent Zimbabwe was a ceremonial post, but he was
constitutional head of Zimbabwe when Mugabe, the nation's only
political ruler, was prime minister.
	   The ceremonial presidency and prime minister's position were
abolished in 1987, and Mugabe assumed the mantle of executive
president.
	   Banana was brought to trial after a police inspector shot dead a
colleague who taunted him as ``Banana's wife.''
	   Jefta Dube, serving a 10-year prison term for that murder, said
he was forced into a three-year sexual relationship with Banana
between 1984 and 1986.

Russian bank offers dlrs 100,000 for information on killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLAIDMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A leading Russian bank has offered a dlrs 100,000
reward for information that could help solve the killing of a
prominent liberal lawmaker, the bank president said in an interview
published Thursday.
	   Galina Starovoitova, 52, was gunned down by unidentified
assailants on the stairs of her apartment building in St.
Petersburg last week, and was buried Tuesday in a ceremony attended
by thousands of mourners.
	   ``If this crime goes unpunished, it would deal an enormous blow
to peoples' attitude to the state,'' Mikhail Friedman, the head of
the Alpha-Bank, said in an interview published in the business
daily Kommersant. ``It would leave no hope that the government is
capable of caring for ordinary citizens, since it's unable to care
for even the leading members of the society.''
	   Friedman said his bank would pay dlrs 100,000 from its charity
fund to any person or group that provides information to help solve
the crime.
	   ``When we learned about this gruesome murder, we consulted our
partners and colleagues and decided that we must take part despite
the current difficult financial situation,'' Friedman said.
	   Starovoitova's slaying had all the trademarks of a contract
murder, which have become common in Russia and are rarely solved.
Still, her death has provoked outrage among many Russians.
	   Many of the killings are related to business disputes, but
Starovoitova had no known business interests and was perhaps the
most prominent female political figure in the country.
	   Police have not announced any major breakthroughs in the case.
However, the Russian media has speculated that the killing was
linked to Starovoitova's role in local elections in St. Petersburg
set for Dec. 6.
	   A number of reports have claimed that local mobsters might have
been tempted to kill Starovoitova because her liberal election
bloc, the Northern Capital, is expected to make a strong showing.
Starovoitova was not on the ballot, but was campaigning for her
allies, who have often spoken out against corruption.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said Thursday that
detectives had received some clues from Starovoitova's aide,
27-year-old Ruslan Linkov. He suffered serious head wounds but has
recovered enough to speak with police.
	   His testimony along with other witness accounts should allow
police to make sketches of the attackers, Stepashin said.

Threat of smoking to children underemphasized, activists say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Even though the health dangers of
smoking are well known, tobacco's threat to children is greatly
underemphasized, anti-smoking activists said Thursday.
	   Representatives of the World Health Organization, the Thai
public health sector, UNICEF and a worldwide coalition of private
organizations spoke at a news conference announcing the Asian
launch of a ``Declaration on Growing Up Without Tobacco.'' The
launch, part of a wider anti-smoking campaign, came at an
international meeting about tuberculosis and lung disease.
	   ``The WHO estimates that about 250 million children alive today
will eventually be killed by tobacco if, in the future, children
continue to take up smoking at the same rate as today's adults and
adolescents,'' said Neil Collishaw of the U.N. health agency.
	   ``As the profits from sales in Asia grow, the importance of
Asia's youth market grows, and marketing to young people will not
abate,'' said Karen Slama of the International Non-Governmental
Coalition Against Tobacco.
	   ``It is not only the effects of the marketing onslaught and the
growing prevalence of tobacco use that is playing havoc with the
future of children in Asia,'' she said. ``With little protection
from the smoke from others' cigarette use in addition to other
pollutants, children and young people have more severe respiratory
health problems more often.
	   ``But the omnipresence of tobacco marketing gives people the
idea that exposure to tobacco smoke is not a problem,'' she said.
	   Maternal and paternal smoking both pose significant health risks
to the fetus and newborn child, said Rudolf Knippenberg, a regional
adviser in UNICEF's East Asian and Pacific office.
	   An expectant mother's smoking causes carbon monoxide and
nicotine to pass into the placenta and into the bloodstream of the
fetus, he said.
	   The results include lower birth weight _ 200 grams (7 ounces) on
average _ which has an adverse effect on future health and growth.
	   They also include a 25 percent higher risk of miscarriage and a
30 percent increase in premature deliveries, stillbirths and
perinatal deaths, he said.
	   The effects of secondhand tobacco smoke on pregnant women are
also passed to the fetus, Knippenberg said.
	   Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke all day is the same as
smoking two to three cigarettes a day, and studies suggest that the
level of tobacco products in the fetus are the same as in the
mother, he said.
	   Infants born to mothers exposed to passive smoke also experience
decreased birth weights, averaging 30-40 grams (1-1.5 ounces), he
said.
	   The effects of secondhand smoke on young children include more
respiratory infections, aggravation of asthma and more school days
lost to sickness than among children from non-smoking families, he
said.
	   Asian countries have made great strides in reducing mortality
rates among children under 5 years of age, said Knippenberg, but
they risk losing the investment made to achieve this by neglecting
to give serious attention to the dangers tobacco poses to children.

Cease-fire committee halts fighting in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) _ A cease-fire committee on Thursday
halted five days of sporadic fighting between soldiers and Muslim
rebels in the southern Philippines that left at least five people
dead and 23 wounded.
	   The committee, headed by a Roman Catholic priest and military
and Muslim rebel representatives, went to the battle site near the
town of Datu Piang in Maguindanao province to prevent the fighting
from escalating.
	   It ordered the two sides to maintain a distance of five
kilometers (three miles), which was agreed upon during earlier
talks.
	   ``It's quiet now and fighting has stopped,'' said army battalion
spokesman Capt. Onting Alon. ``We will remain on guard because the
enemy is still around. It is too early to say it is safe.''
	   Each side accuses the other of starting the fighting, which
began Saturday. It led to fierce exchanges of mortar and automatic
weapons fire in sporadic clashes that spread to three towns in
Maguindanao, 910 kilometers (570 miles) southeast of Manila.
	   Maj. Gen. Rolando Bautista, the army's area commander, said
stray bullets killed a woman visiting a nearby ranch Tuesday in
Datu Piang and an old man Wednesday in nearby Sharif Aguak town.
	   Bautista said soldiers recovered the body of a Muslim rebel and
that 18 soldiers were wounded in the fighting.
	   He said the rebels took 20 civilians hostage in a village
Tuesday to prevent soldiers from attacking their positions, and
continued to hold them.
	   Al-haj Murad, spokesman for the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, said two other rebels died and five were wounded.
	   Bautista said the rebels were trying to expand areas under their
control and the military was holding them back.
	   But Shariff Julabbi, an MILF spokesman, accused government
troops of starting the fighting by bombarding rebel positions with
105mm howitzers. He said the rebels retaliated with mortar fire.
	   Muslim rebels claim they have 48 camps, including 13
strongholds, in southern Mindanao, the country's second largest
island, but the government has yet to recognize any of these camps.
	   The fighting closed a road linking Cotabato to the nearby city
of General Santos, a major fishing port.
	   The MILF is the bigger of two Muslim rebel groups still fighting
the government. The main rebel group, the Moro National Liberation
Front, signed a peace pact with the government in September 1996.

Anwar's lawyers to seek bail again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for jailed politician
Anwar Ibrahim said Thursday they would ask a court to free him on
bail because he was not well.
	   Attorney Sankaran Nair said an application for bail had been
filed in court and would be heard Saturday.
	   ``Normally in cases like these, medical conditions are always a
basis to ask for bail,'' Nair told reporters.
	   Anwar's bail application has been turned down by a lower court
once and an appeal against it also failed. Trial Judge Augustine
Paul said Anwar's lawyers weren't able to prove that he would not
tamper with witnesses if released on bail.
	   Anwar suffers from a stomach disorder that causes intense
heartburn, family members have said. Although he does not appear to
be in physical pain during his court appearances, his lawyers say
his condition has worsened.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under a special security law only
hours after organizing a mammoth rally in the capital. During that
protest, he called for sweeping government reforms and the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
finance minister after deeming him morally unfit to lead the
Southeast Asian country.
	   Anwar currently is standing trial on charges of abuse of power
and sexual misconduct, charges he denies and calls politically
motivated.

Russia's missile force chief backs START II treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's nuclear weapons are reaching the end of
their service life, leaving Moscow no alternative but to ratify the
START II arms reduction treaty with the United States, a senior
military official said.
	   Fifty-eight percent of Russia's strategic missiles are past
their expiration date, Gen. Anatoly Perminov, the chief of staff of
Russia's strategic missile forces, said in an interview with the
military daily Krasnaya Zvezda, or Red Star.
	   Military satellites, which monitor missile sites and collect
intelligence data, are also growing old, with nearly 70 percent of
them past their service life, he said.
	   Perminov said the military was carrying out a modernization
program that would allow it to extend the life of 200 missiles
until the year 2007.
	   However, that wouldn't solve the force's overall problem and he
stressed that Russia must build new single-warhead Topol-M missiles
to preserve its nuclear potential.
	   The general said Russia must ratify the START II treaty, which
would allow the country to reduce spending on its nuclear forces.
	   ``There is no alternative to strategic arms reduction,''
Perminov said. ``Because of that, the START II treaty will be
ratified sooner or later.''
	   Other military officials have sounded a similar note, saying
most Russian ballistic missiles won't be reliable in coming years
regardless of whether the country signs the treaty.
	   START II, which was signed in 1993, would halve Russian and
American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads each.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led
opposition in the Russian parliament has balked, claiming that
dismantling strategic weapons would harm Russia's security and be
too expensive.
	   There's been some progress in recent weeks, and President Boris
Yeltsin's government has made a renewed push to convince lawmakers
to ratify the document. The Duma has agreed to speed up preparation
for the debate, and many lawmakers have voiced optimism that the
treaty can be ratified.

Unions want more welfare spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Labor unions want the government to spend
more money next year on welfare, education and the civil service,
Labor Minister Longin Komolowski said he would tell Thursday's
Cabinet meeting.
	   Komolowski spoke after a meeting Wednesday with the tripartite
commission of government, business and labor leaders.
	   Earlier this month, Komolowski acknowledged the government
formulated its 1999 spending plan without consulting Poland's
powerful labor unions, but he said changes could be made by
amendments from the tripartite commission.
	   At Wednesday's meeting, major labor groups said spending
priorities should be changed.
	   Solidarity, the conservative labor backbone of the major partner
in the governing alliance, believes the budget must be
recalculated, officials said after the meeting.
	   They said the budget fails to provide welfare payments for
increased energy charges, cover the cost of bringing civil service
wages in line with the private sector, or increase education
spending.
	   Stefan Kubowicz, the Solidarity education spokesman, said the
education budget was based on this year's spending, which was too
low. He noted some schools were unable to pay December salaries.
	   The biggest trade union federation, the left-leaning OPZZ, also
called for more spending on social needs. But Ryszard Lepik, one of
the OPZZ's deputy leaders, said the federation doubted the
government would change the budget.
	   Poland has implemented market-led economic reforms that include
stringent fiscal discipline to create strong growth after decades
of centrist communist rule. Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz,
the main proponent of the reforms, has warned repeatedly against
overspending or increasing public debt.
	   Balcerowicz, who also is deputy prime minister, this week
complained the union movement is too strong after Transport
Minister Eugeniusz Morawski resigned in a dispute over reforming
the strapped state railway company.
	   Morawski, who belongs to Balcerowicz's Freedom Union in the
governing alliance, quit over what he called the government's delay
in proceeding with railway reforms because of union opposition.
	   Balcerowicz said the resignation showed a ``great weakness of
the Polish political system _ the excessively strong political role
of trade unions, which is dangerous for the development of the
country.''

Students protest again for ex-President Suharto be put on trial

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 students taunted
troops who blocked them Thursday from marching on the home of
former President Suharto to press demands that he be prosecuted for
corruption.
	   Another 200 were stopped from staging a sit-in protest at the
attorney general's office.
	   The peaceful demonstrations in the capital contrasted with a
clash between police and students in the provincial city of
Semarang on Wednesday.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that at least 54
demonstrators were injured.
	   Student activists who helped oust Suharto in May have stepped up
their demands that the former army general be held accountable for
official wrongdoing during his 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, announced last week
that he would set up a new inquiry into his former mentor's wealth.
	   A previous investigation by Attorney General Andi Muhammad
Ghalib turned up no evidence of corruption and critics labeled it a
whitewash.
	   Students have tried repeatedly in recent days to march to
Suharto's heavily guarded home.
	   On Thursday, they were blocked by dozens of security personnel
armed with bamboo shields and sticks.
	   The standoff was in a park adjacent to the U.S. ambassador's
house about one kilometer (one half mile) from Suharto's home,
where the former leader lives as a virtual recluse.
	   Many students held up pictures of Suharto dressed as a bandit.
	   Several members of one Muslim student group carried posters of
the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, and
its current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   ``We want a charismatic leader like Khomeini. This would inspire
Indonesians,'' said one protester, who identified himself by the
single name of Budi.
	   Some jeered and made fun of the soldiers blocking them.
	   Earlier, several busloads of students arrived at Ghalib's office
to press their demands. Security forces prevented them from
entering.
	   Earlier this week, hundreds of students occupied the attorney
general's office before army negotiators urged them to leave and
military trucks ferried them back to their campuses.
	   Also Thursday, dozens of students protested outside the studios
of Television Republik Indonesia, complaining that network coverage
of political events was biased in favor of the government.
	   They later tried to drive to the nearby Parliament, but were
blocked by security personnel.
	   Meanwhile, angry residents gathered for a second day of protest
in a northeastern town Thursday, a day after mobs burned local
government buildings, according to police and witnesses.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of depositors of a troubled finance
cooperative burned government offices after they failed to get
their money refunded.
	   The violence occurred in Pinrang, on the southern end of
Sulawesi Island, 1,370 kilometers (856 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   As many as 31 people have been killed in demonstrations and
riots in Jakarta in the past two weeks. The total includes at least
nine students who were killed when security forces opened fire when
protesters, demanding democratic reforms, tried to march on the
Parliament Nov. 13.
	   The U.S. State Department has urged Indonesia to carry out its
pledge to fully investigate the shootings.

OPEC hopeful of price accord as delayed meeting opens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with start of meeting; comment from Iranian delegate
on output level, extended cuts; Indonesian minister says no to more
cuts, calls for transparent oil industry &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A divided OPEC opened its year-end
ministerial meeting a day behind schedule Thursday, with some
delegates saying the organization would agree to extend production
cuts to the end of 1999.
	   That is the bare minimum analysts say is needed to prop up
rock-bottom oil prices, but it doesn't promise a boost for prices,
flirting with 12-year lows.
	   A 2.6 million barrel-a-day cut that the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries set in June to run for six months
could be extended to the end of 1999, an Iranian delegate said.
	   Ministers had pushed back the start of the meeting, originally
scheduled to begin Wednesday, because of deep differences over the
issue of extending the production cuts and disagreements over
production levels.
	   Iran acknowledged it was facing criticism over its output level,
but called that unfair and said it isn't overproducing.
	   ``Others are blaming Iran,'' a senior Iranian delegate told The
Associated Press, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The delegate said that when OPEC was determining Iran's
production capacity it did not take into account two new refineries
that came on line in February. He said Iran had been asked to cut
too much.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the
group's biggest producer.
	   Saudi Arabia has drawn ire at the Vienna gathering, with some
members complaining the kingdom seized market share after Iraq's
departure from the oil market in 1990 and now won't let go.
	   Iraq has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990
invasion of fellow OPEC member, Kuwait, but is now allowed to sell
limited amounts of oil under U.N. supervision to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods.
	   Indonesian Oil Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said he didn't
favor fresh cuts, but did favor an extension, in what seems to be a
growing consensus view.
	   He also said Indonesia was conducting a legal review of its
domestic oil industry after the fall of long-time ruler Suharto.
	   ``We want to have a competitive sector, oil and gas, a sector
that is effective and transparent, in terms of an open market
downstream and an effective market upstream,'' Mangkusubroto told
The Associated Press.
	   Venezuela threw a late spanner in the works when Oil Minister
Erwin Arrieta told ministers during preliminary talks that with a
new government taking over in February it could not commit to an
extension of the existing production cuts.
	   But Arrieta, speaking just before the scheduled start of the
formal session, said he was confident an agreement could be reached
by the end of the day. He did not elaborate.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, is pushing for better
compliance with June's cuts, saying there is no point to further
cuts until full compliance is achieved.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January opened
in London Thursday at a record low of dlrs 10.88.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
favors new output reductions as do Algeria and Libya.
	   Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah said he
expects OPEC to convene again in March.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

Pinochet wept when he got the bad news: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Augusto Pinochet broke down and cried upon
learning he faces the threat of extradition to Spain and trial on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism, Spanish newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Half an hour before a five-judge panel of Britain's House of
Lords announced Wednesday that Pinochet has no immunity from
prosecution, a government interpreter went to the London hospital
where the former Chilean dictator is staying under police guard and
broke the news to him.
	   The interpreter read the ruling to Pinochet in Spanish, and
repeated it once at Pinochet's request. Then Pinochet, who turned
83 on Wednesday, held his head in his hands and wept, El Pais
reported from London, quoting sources close to the Pinochet affair.
	   Another paper, El Mundo, also reported that Pinochet sobbed when
he got the news.
	   Earlier in the day Pinochet supporters tried to make his
birthday as festive as possible at the Grovelands Priory hospital,
delivering a cake they'd kept fresh in a large portable
refrigerator.
	   Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish warrant in London on Oct. 16
as he recovered from minor back surgery.
	   In Madrid, the judge who issued that warrant and has requested
his extradition reacted to the Lords' ruling with the silence that
has become his trademark.
	   Baltasar Garzon, dubbed Super Judge for taking on a string of
high profile cases in Spain, made no public statement on the
ruling. Even in the privacy of his office he did not so much as
express satisfaction because he feared this would show bias, El
Pais said, quoting sources close to Garzon.
	   Garzon wants Pinochet to stand trial in Spain over the deaths or
disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his regime.
	   Spanish newspaper editorials welcomed the British Lords' ruling
as a precedent-setting one that should send shivers down the spine
of retired despots around the world.
	   ``As of yesterday, dictators who have lost power will no longer
enjoy freedom of movement outside their country. They will have to
stay home, or risk being arrested,'' El Pais said.
	   The center-right daily El Mundo added: ``The foundations of what
can and should be justice without borders are being laid.''

Government, church plan giant Orthodox cathedral in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's government and its main
church plan to build a huge, multimillion-dollar cathedral in
central Bucharest despite criticism of the large public expense
involved.
	   ``Romania needs such a church and I think Romanians deserve
it,'' Prime Minister Radu Vasile said late Wednesday in announcing
the Romanian Orthodox Church project, called ``The Salvation of the
People.''
	   Almost 90 percent of Romanians are Christian Orthodox. But some
criticized the planned new church as an expensive public relations
exercise in a country with an average monthly wage of 1.2 million
lei (dlrs 120).
	   ``There are villages without churches and hundreds of historical
monuments in ruins,'' said journalist Valentin Neagu. ``To
construct such a megalomaniac building means the government wants
to leave a reminder of its transitory rule.''
	   The cathedral will cost at least 50 billion lei (dlrs 5
million). Funding will come from the government and private
sponsors.
	   It will hold 2,000 worshipers with space for another 20,000 on a
platform outside, said Patriarch Teoctist, head of the church.
	   Government officials said the building will have a surface of
two hectares (almost five acres), reach a height of 50 meters (165
feet) and have an underground three-level car park. It will connect
to the capital's subway and a shopping mall.
	   The cathedral is planned for the same district as a giant palace
built by former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu which was called the
``House of the People.'' Ceausescu, an atheist, knocked down
churches to make way for apartment buildings.

Joe Ozaki takes first-round lead in Casio World Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IBUSUKI, Japan (AP) _ Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki shot a 5-under-par
67 Thursday and took a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the
Casio World Open, while most of the gallery followed Tiger Woods.
	   With Woods playing his first regular tournament in Japan, more
than 5,000 spectators turned out. The American star shot four
birdies against one bogey and was two shots behind the leader at
69.
	   Ozaki, the youngest of three Ozaki brothers on the Japan PGA
Tour, sank six birdies against one bogey on the 7,105-yard
(6,467-meter), par-72 Ibusuki Golf Club course.
	   Joe, a regular on the U.S. tour, is in contention for his first
victory this season and 26th overall.
	   Hidemichi Tanaka, the Japan Open winner last month, had a round
of five birdies and a bogey and shared second place at 68 with
Mamoru Osanai and American Paul Stankowski.
	   Woods was tied at 69 with fellow American Brian Watts,
Toshimitsu Izawa, Nobumitsu Yuhara, Yoshinori Kaneko and South
Korean Kim Jong-duk.
	   Japanese superstar Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, Joe's eldest
brother, and Americans Brandt Jobe and Todd Hamilton shared 11th at
70 with four others in the 150 million yen (dlrs 1.25 million)
tournament.

Fire bombing damages justice minister's private office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two propane gas canisters exploded on
Thursday at the private office of Greece's justice minister, police
said.
	   A security guard who tried to extinguish the fire was slightly
injured.
	   Police said there was minor damage caused to minister Evangelos
Giannopoulos' office located in downtown Athens.
	   There was no warning call prior to the explosion. No group has
claimed responsibility so far, police said.
	   The attack was similar to more than 200 other blasts this year,
including one earlier this month at a government labor office. Most
have been claimed by obscure leftist groups and have targeted cars,
government offices, policemen and foreign businesses.

Bank run eases after consortium provides emergency funds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Panicked depositors pulled 40 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.2 billion) out of a troubled bank, but
calm was restored Thursday as branches reopened with plenty of cash
displayed on the counters.
	   The run on Taichung Business Bank was the worst in Taiwan's
history, and some branches stayed open into the early hours of
Thursday, after depositors had lined up all day Wednesday to get
their money.
	   The government sacked the bank's chairman and other directors
Wednesday over alleged improper loans, and ordered a consortium to
come up with emergency funds to pay off depositors.
	   It was reported that the ousted chairman, Tseng Chen-jen, had
gotten into financial troubles during a property slump several
years ago, but he bailed himself out by going to a Las Vegas casino
where he won U.S. dlrs 30 million. The report in the United Daily
News could not immediately be verified.
	   This time, Tseng's luck is not holding up so well.
	   On Thursday, authorities barred Tseng from leaving Taiwan
pending investigations into allegations that he abused his position
of trust at the bank in Taichung, 120 miles (200 kilometers) south
of Taipei.
	   Tseng, who is head of the Kuang Shan business conglomerate, was
appointed as the Taichung Business Bank's chairman Oct. 31. Just
days later, the bank approved loans of 7.4 billion Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 227 million) to six shaky investment and property
companies believed to have ties to Tseng.
	   After Tseng was ousted, the run on Taichung Business Bank became
the worst in Taiwan's history. Depositors took out four times as
much money as they did three years ago at the Changhua Credit
Union, where the manager had embezzled money to play the stock
market.
	   A consortium of nine banks provided the troubled bank funds
totaling 60 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion), and the
run by depositors finally ended, Vice Finance Minister Sean Chen
said.
	   Tseng started out as a property developer, and later expanded
his interests into department stores and banking.
	   His sensational troubles were the latest in a spate of financial
woes for Taiwanese business groups.
	   At a Cabinet meeting Thursday, Premier Vincent Siew said the
government will be able to maintain financial stability and stamp
out any irregularities.
	   Siew blamed the recent financial troubles on a younger
generation of entrepreneurs who are preoccupied with making quick
profits.
	   ``They appear to be more interested in tinkering with finances
than running their businesses,'' he said.
	   Many of the companies that have gotten into trouble reportedly
have good ties with politicians.
	   Antonio Chiang, publisher of the Taiwan Daily News, said the
government let the troubles come into the open rather than quietly
bailing out the companies in an effort to clean up entangled
relations between businesses and politicians ahead of the Dec. 5
legislative elections.
	   If politicians backed by those business groups are elected, they
could help their corporate friends gain contracts by threatening
otherwise to block government-proposed bills, Chiang said.

Pollock causes West Indies to flutter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo JOH101 &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Shaun Pollock struck three
times in the first hour Thursday to reduce the West Indies to 89
for three at lunch on the first day of their first test match
against South Africa.
	   The game at Wanderers Stadium marks the first time the two teams
have met in a full series, and the first time they have met in a
test in South Africa. The West Indies made the surprise move of
selecting replacement legspinner Rawl Lewis for their team, even
though he had only flown into South Africa Thursday morning.
	   Pollock, newly elevated to the vice-captaincy of the South
Africans, settled down into a rhythm immediately. Although he
dropped Philo Wallace off a sharp caught-and-bowled chance in his
first over, he soon struck with an edge off Clayton Lambert,
snaffled up for eight runs by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher after the
West Indies openers had started very briskly, especially against
Allan Donald.
	   With Donald being slammed out of the attack after just four
overs, his line was bad, his length awful and Pollock gained in
confidence, slipping one through Wallace's defenses to send his off
stump cartwheeling, and dismissing him for 16.
	   Lara, in the meantime, had looked in good form, striking Donald
to the boundary with a beautiful cover drive, and pulling him in
front of square to show that the pitch is slower than has been the
case at the Wanderers in recent years. But he fell to a delivery
which pitched wide, nipped back slightly, clipped the inside edge
and destroyed his stumps. He scored just 11.
	   Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Carl Hooper set about rebuilding the
innings, and were undefeated on 21 and 31 at lunch. Hooper,
however, injured himself while losing his footing pushing forward
to a Jacques Kallis delivery, and has had his range of movement
restricted. He has also called for a runner.
	   South Africa's only new cap, David Terbrugge, was given the ball
45 minutes before lunch, and answered the call with a great spell
of five over for just 3 runs, and made the batsmen play every ball
with some surprising pace as well as a great line.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with OPEC president's opening remarks in new grafs
4-5; tightens &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A divided OPEC opened its year-end
ministerial meeting a day behind schedule Thursday, with some
delegates saying the organization would agree to extend production
cuts to the end of 1999.
	   That is the bare minimum analysts say is needed to prop up
rock-bottom oil prices, but it doesn't promise a boost for prices,
flirting with 12-year lows.
	   A 2.6 million barrel-a-day cut that the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries set in June to run for six months
could be extended to the end of 1999, an Iranian delegate said.
	   OPEC president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, who also is the United
Arab Emirates' oil minister, acknowledged in an opening speech to
delegates that a ``strong bearish sentiment has set in'' on the
world market.
	   Oil-producing nations, he said, ``are deeply concerned about the
serious problems facing the world's oil industry at the present
time, with weak international prices and an underlying feeling of
insecurity about future prospects'' in the near term.
	   Ministers had pushed back the start of the meeting, originally
scheduled to begin Wednesday, because of deep differences over the
issue of extending the production cuts and disagreements over
production levels.
	   Iran acknowledged it was facing criticism over its output level,
but called that unfair and said it isn't overproducing.
	   ``Others are blaming Iran,'' a senior Iranian delegate told The
Associated Press, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The delegate said that when OPEC was determining Iran's
production capacity it did not take into account two new refineries
that came on line in February. He said Iran had been asked to cut
too much.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the
group's biggest producer.
	   Saudi Arabia has drawn ire at the Vienna gathering, with some
members complaining the kingdom seized market share after Iraq's
departure from the oil market in 1990 and now won't let go.
	   Iraq has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990
invasion of fellow OPEC member, Kuwait, but is now allowed to sell
limited amounts of oil under U.N. supervision to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods.
	   Indonesian Oil Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said he didn't
favor fresh cuts, but did favor an extension, in what seems to be a
growing consensus view.
	   He also said Indonesia was conducting a legal review of its
domestic oil industry after the fall of long-time ruler Suharto.
	   ``We want to have a competitive sector, oil and gas, a sector
that is effective and transparent, in terms of an open market
downstream and an effective market upstream,'' Mangkusubroto told
the AP.
	   Venezuela threw a late wrench in the works when Oil Minister
Erwin Arrieta told ministers during preliminary talks that with a
new government taking over in February it could not commit to an
extension of the existing production cuts.
	   But Arrieta, speaking just before the scheduled start of the
formal session, said he was confident an agreement could be reached
by the end of the day. He did not elaborate.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, is pushing for better
compliance with June's cuts, saying there is no point to further
cuts until full compliance is achieved.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January opened
in London Thursday at a record low of dlrs 10.88.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
favors new output reductions as do Algeria and Libya.
	   Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah said he
expects OPEC to convene again in March.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

Blockbuster to buy failed Hong Kong video chain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Style on Ernst and Young uses ampersand &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ U.S. entertainment giant Blockbuster said
Thursday it wants to move into the Hong Kong market by purchasing
its top video chain, which failed this month in a highly visible
example of the territory's economic woes.
	   Blockbuster would not disclose how much it might pay for KPS
Retail Stores Ltd., saying it needed to take a thorough look at the
business before closing on the deal.
	   The 38 KPS stores in Hong Kong were shut Nov. 6, the morning
after bankers called in receivers from the accounting firm of Ernst
and Young to take control.
	   The stores, which employed 430 people, will remain closed until
KPS is sold, according to Blockbuster and Ernst and Young.
	   Ernst and Young partner Wilf Timso, one of the receivers, said a
number of other companies had been interested in KPS but he would
not name them.
	   Blockbuster's deal with the receivers gives it a 30-day period
of exclusivity to complete its negotiations.
	   Blockbuster's president for worldwide operations, Nigel Travis,
said the deal would be ``contingent upon our ability to renegotiate
rental agreements with landlords of a critical number of KPS
stores, and supplier arrangements, as well as the successful
completion of license agreements on certain assets.''
	   Travis said Blockbuster had been looking for some time at
entering Hong Kong's video rental market. Buying KPS would give
Blockbuster an instant customer base of 230,000 people who are
registered to rent videos from its stores.
	   KPS was forced on to the auction block after going broke when
its sales and cash video rentals failed to meet projections in the
summer, as Hong Kong struggled through recession. The company
angered many of its customers when it announced it would stop
honoring prepaid coupons for video rentals, and some people sued.
	   Timso said he was unable to comment on the company's debts.
	   Dennis Smith, a director of CV Consumer Services Ltd., which
owns KPS, also blamed pirate videos that are widely available in
Hong Kong.
	   KPS also may have been hurt by a recent law that permitted the
importation of videos, books and music only from authorized
distributors, which left Hong Kong residents with fewer choices
about which entertainment they could buy or rent.
	   Maybe Blockbuster can spruce up the selection?
	   ``It might even bring some decent movies to town,'' Timso said.
	   Blockbuster Inc. is a subsidiary of Viacom Inc., a big
entertainment and publishing concern based in New York.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Vatican comment, graf 15 and Yad Vashem comment,
 &UR; Israel calls for opening of international Holocaust archives
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is calling for the opening of
international Holocaust-era archives and has published a list of
repositories that officials say have put obstacles in the way of
researchers.
	   In a letter released this week, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's adviser on Diaspora affairs named a dozen archives in
Europe and Russia that ``have refused or have been uncooperative in
sharing information,'' wrote Bobby Brown.
	   ``We appeal to each institution listed to open their files so
that we may learn why civilized society failed in its basic
commitment to ensure the safety, lives, liberty and property of our
people,'' said the Nov. 22 letter addressed to the head of Israel's
delegation to an upcoming Washington conference on Holocaust
assets.
	   The publication of the letter, which did not give details of
non-cooperation, drew fire from a number of the institutions named.
It also attracted critics who questioned whether Israel, itself the
victim of boycotts, should be engaging in issuing black lists.
	   ``Black lists are something that we as a people should shy away
from,'' said Abe Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League,
who told The Associated Press the singling out of archives was
``irresponsible and counter-productive.''
	   Officials at some of the archives listed expressed dismay.
	   ``We had an impression that our cooperation with institutions
representing Jewish communities was going on with the satisfaction
of both sides,'' said Daria Nalecz, head of the Polish State
Archives, which was on the list.
	   The controversy arose in advance of a four-day conference on
Holocaust-era assets that will open Monday in Washington, D.C. Some
57 delegations from 44 nations will convene to discuss looted art,
insurance, communal property and the opening of files belonging to
private companies and public agencies.
	   Brown said Israeli and German officials met to discuss
unresolved issues from the Holocaust era. These included the
opening of private archives to document the use of slave labor in
Nazi-run factories.
	   The state institutions named in the letter included the Vatican
archives, the French National Archives, the files of the British
Custodian of Enemy Property, the MI5 intelligence agency and the
central state archives and Prague Jewish Museum in the Czech
Republic.
	   ``We've given them everything they wanted, every single
document,'' Interior Ministry spokesman Jan Decker said, adding
Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust museum still owed dlrs 4,600 for
microfilmed documents that were provided by the Jewish Museum.
	   Brown said the British custodian had allowed historians to look
at World War II-era bank accounts but not records of safe deposit
boxes and that MI5 had not provided all the material from secret
British agencies from that period.
	   In London, a Home Office spokesman said on condition of
anonymity that MI5 was ``currently reviewing its World War II
archive, but to the best of our knowledge there is nothing on MI5
files that is relevant to the Holocaust.''
	   Philippe Delaval, head of the French National Archives, said he
was ``astonished'' the the archives were accused of restricting
access. He said the archive recently welcomed a delegation from the
Holocaust Museum in Washington. Israeli officials said, however,
that the archive would not allow documents to be copied or taken
out of the country.
	   The Vatican, which offered no official comment except to say
that they have made available everything that they could, has been
involved in a long-running dispute with scholars over access to all
its archives. Israeli officials said interest focused in particular
on the documents of Pope Pius XII whose silence during World War II
has been questioned by Jews.
	   Brown also said that the Tripartite Gold Commission, set up in
1946 by the United States, Britain and France and which recently
wrapped up its work, should turn over what information it has on
the gold stolen from Jews - including teeth and jewelry that was
melted down and sold as gold bars by the Nazis.
	   ``Jews were not only the victims of murder and robbery, but lost
most of our history, and we need it back,'' he said in an
interview. ``All the archives should be open to scholars and
individuals who want to now what happened.''
	   He said the problems were varied and that files were not
available for a variety of reasons: ``some by design, some because
of bureaucracy and some because they do not have enough funding.''
	   Brown said the archives of the former Soviet KGB intelligence
agency and the military archives in Podolsk were effectively closed
while the Federal Archives in Russia charged exorbitant rates to
foreign researchers.
	   Yelena Palshina, who oversees use of documents at the archive in
Moscow said access to documents was free. The archive was forced to
charge one dollar to copy a page however ``because we are very
poor,'' adding the institution got only 40 percent of its budget
from the state.
	   Roni Stauber, an expert on the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University,
said pressure needed to be applied to free up documents but that
the government should not compile black lists or criticize
publicly.
	   ``It's possible that government pressure will not be productive
because it could become a political matter instead of a research
matter,'' he said.
	   Iris Rosenberg, spokeswoman for Yad Vashem, Israel's National
Holocaust Memorial, said that while opening the archives was
essential for uncovering the historic details of the Holocaust
period, it remained unclear how the government's action would play
out.
	   ``We don't know if political intervention will be useful but we
will have to wait and see,'' Rosenberg said.
	   Brown said he believed that publicity would help free up
information from the Holocaust before it was lost forever, adding
that he was not publishing a ``dirty list.''

Drug legalization at issue in new Swiss vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Last year, the traditionally cautious Swiss
achieved a world first and approved state distribution of heroin to
hardcore addicts. But a proposal to legalize all drugs is likely to
be too much to swallow.
	   The electorate votes Sunday on a proposal which would insert a
clause into the constitution that ``the consumption, cultivation or
possession of drugs, and their acquisition for personal use, is not
punishable.''
	   The government opposes the plan fearing it would turn the
orderly Alpine nation into a haven for drug tourists and
traffickers. Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors
and other professionals working with addicts are also against it.
	   Its backers _ a loose left-wing coalition which gathered the
necessary 100,000 signatures to force a referendum _ claim it would
kill the street market in drugs.
	   ``Only prohibition has made a huge business of a substance (hard
drugs) which has little value in itself,'' they say.
	   Stefan Wunderlin, a member of the organizing committee, concedes
that objections to legalizing hard drugs will likely mean the
proposal is rejected.
	   But he expects the result to send a signal that ``legalization
of cannabis could be approved today.''
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts, one of
Europe's highest rates. In contrast to many other countries, the
death toll is falling _ from a peak of 399 in 1994 to 241 last
year.
	   An experiment with government-authorized distribution of heroin
to long-term addicts began in 1994 and led to a huge cut in crime,
misery and death associated with the hard-core scene.
	   In a referendum last year, the Swiss overwhelmingly voted for
the experiment to be put on a permanent legal footing _ and this
was finally approved by parliament last month.
	   Even though the government policy has won praise at home and
abroad, it still hasn't stamped out trafficking.
	   Around Geneva's railway station, dealers _ often ethnic
Albanians _ lurk in the evening shadows in wait for potential
clients. Similar scenes occur in other cities.
	   Police say that as soon as one dealer is arrested in the nightly
cat-and-mouse game, another moves in to take his place.
	   Seizures of hard drugs have continued apace in the run-up to
Sunday's vote. And last month, police carried out their
biggest-ever raid on illegal cannabis producers.
	   More than 5.8 tons of homegrown cannabis with a street value
between 20 and 30 million Swiss francs (dlrs 14.5 and 21.7 million)
was seized and 20 foreigners arrested, including a German suspected
of running the operation.
	   Cannabis legalization activists claimed the swoop was
politically motivated.
	   Ruth Dreifuss, the minister responsible for drugs policy, calls
the project's promises of an end to illicit dealing ``naive.'' She
defends the current policy of helping hardened addicts and trying
to get tough with dealers as ``honest and pragmatic.''
	   Swiss narcotics police chief, Valentin Roschacher, fears drug
legalization would make working with the country's European Union
neighbors hugely difficult.
	   No other European nation is contemplating such a sweeping move.
Even in the liberal Netherlands, the government has never legalized
the possession or sale of any drugs and has no plans to do so.

Israeli troops, Palestinians clash in two West Bank locations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers on Thursday shot
rubber-coated bullets into a crowd of about 100 Palestinians who
threw stones at their outpost during a demonstration to demand
freedom for Palestinian prisoners.
	   One Palestinian was wounded in the leg, and another was struck
in the arm. Both were taken away in private cars to a hospital.
	   About 500 protesters marched through the West Bank town of Jenin
to the District Coordinating Office, where Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police are posted to coordinate security.
	   The demonstrators marched behind a white cloth banner showing
prisoners hands chained and bleeding. ``No peace without release of
all prisoners,'' it said.
	   More than 2,500 Palestinians are in Israeli jails, and the issue
is very sensitive among Palestinians, many of whom had a relative
jailed during the three-decade occupation by Israel.
	   During the clash, one Israeli soldier could be seen on a tower
inside the compound, alternately ducking and shooting.
	   Palestinian police looked on from their post inside the joint
compound but did not get involved in the confrontation. After
warnings from Israeli officers, Palestinian security police arrived
a half-hour after the violence began to persuade the protesters to
pull back.
	   The Jenin demonstration was organized by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's own political faction Fatah.
	   In recent weeks, there have been a series of Palestinian
protests lobbying for the release of security prisoners held by
Israel.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January.
	   Palestinians complained that most of the 250 prisoners freed in
the first phase were criminals and not political activists as
promised.
	   ``Free the fighters, not the criminals,'' the protesters
shouted.
	   Awad Kenami said his son Ahmed, 37, a founder of the Black
Panther faction that fought Israeli occupation, was jailed two
months after the Oslo peace agreement was signed in September 1993.
	   ``My son was a soldier in a war led by Yasser Arafat; now Yasser
Arafat is a leader of peace, and so my son and his comrades must be
freed as soldiers for peace,'' Kenami told a reporter.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not
release prisoners with ``blood on their hands'' or members of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, which has rejected the peace process.
	   Also on Thursday, Jewish settlers in the divided West Bank town
of Hebron blocked Palestinian school children enroute to a field
trip, touching off scuffling between Palestinians and Israelis,
witnesses said.
	   Israeli police said they detained four Palestinians, including
the school principal and a student, for questioning. A dozen girls
were taken to the hospital, but no injuries were reported.
	   Palestinian residents say that in recent weeks Israeli troops
and settlers have harassed Palestinians who walked by the Jewish
settler enclave.

Takeda leads first round in Meiji Nyugyo Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SADOHARA, Japan (AP) _ Hisako Takeda fashioned a 5-under-par 67
Thursday for a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the 60
million yen (dlrs 500,000) Meiji Nyugyo Cup, the Japan LPGA Tour's
season-ending tournament.
	   Takeda, a non-winner in seven years as a pro, shot five birdies
in a bogey-free trek over the 6,379-yard (5,805-meter), par-72
Hibiscus Golf Club course.
	   Tied for second at 68 were Kaori Higo, winner of two tournaments
this season, South Koreans Ko Woo-soon and Lee Oh-soon, Aiko
Takasu, Michie Oba and Taiwan's Tseng Hsiu-feng.
	   Another stroke back at 69 came Kaori Harada, Taiwan's Cheng
Mei-chi, South Korean Lee Young-me, Hiromi Takamura, Fumiko
Muraguchi and Mieko Nomura.
	   Michiko Hattori, who has secured her first Japan LPGA Tour money
earnings title, shot a 70.
	   Defending champion Akiko Fukushima struggled to a 74.

Mets, Phillips and former employee resolve potential suit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Steve Phillips can put the threat of a sexual
harassment lawsuit behind him
	   A former New York Mets employee withdrew her threat of a sexual
harassment suit against the team and the general manager,
apparently for a payment.
	   The threat of a suit caused Phillips to take an eight-day leave
of absence earlier this month. When Phillips returned Nov. 16, a
lawyer for the woman, who once worked in the team's Florida office,
threatened to file suit within 24 hours.
	   Management of the team had maintained no harassment occurred.
The woman left the Mets about a year ago.
	   ``While the organization's position has not changed, we felt it
was best for all concerned to put the matter behind us,'' Mets
senior vice president David Howard said Wednesday.
	   In taking the leave of absence, Phillips acknowledged he had an
affair with the woman but said it was consensual. He also admitted
having other affairs.
	   Neither the Mets nor the woman's lawyer, Dominic Barbara,
disclosed details of the settlement other than to say there will
not be a lawsuit.
	   A baseball official familiar with the case, speaking on the
condition he not be identified, confirmed the sides had been
discussing a payment to head off a suit.
	   Phillips and the Mets would not comment on the settlement, team
spokesman Jay Horwitz said. Barbara also would not discuss it, his
office said.

Report: Algerian authorities find six bodies in orchard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algerian authorities have found six
bodies in an orchard on the outskirts of Algiers and suspect they
were killed by Islamic militants, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Five of the cadavers were discovered in a well in the orchard
and a sixth was dug up nearby, the New Republic newspaper said,
publishing a picture of the bones.
	   According to the La Tribune daily, the number of bodies in the
unused wells could be in the dozens, while the El Watan newspaper
said there could be at least 200 bodies.
	   El Watan said the victims had been killed by the Armed Islamic
Group, the GIA, the most radical insurgency movement trying to oust
the military-backed government.
	   Algerian authorities began searching the area on the southeast
periphery of Algiers, near near Meftah, on Wednesday. The
investigation was to continue on Thursday.
	   The bodies were found by local residents who were alerted by a
terrible smell coming from the well.
	   Meftah, located 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the center of
Algiers, was long an area controlled by the GIA which had installed
bomb-making workshops, printing facilities, a makeshift hospital in
villas abandoned by their owners.
	   The GIA reportedly had a cemetery there for its own adherents.
The group left the Meftah area in 1997 after government security
forces moved in to clear out the militants.
	   GIA activity is now scattered between western Algeria and the
Kabylie region, to the east of the capital.
	   Algeria has been locked in a cycle of violence since 1992, when
the army canceled legislative elections that the now-banned Islamic
Salvation Front was poised to win. That triggered the insurgency.
	   An estimated 75,000 people _ civilians, soldiers and insurgents
_ have been killed in the violence.

Lend me your ears: Indonesian student protesters appeal to zoo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; With BC-Indonesia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ If the government won't listen,
student protesters say, maybe zoo animals will.
	   In a piece of political theater, busloads of frustrated
activists showed up at the Jakarta zoo Thursday. Their captive
audience? Monkeys, tigers and crocodiles.
	   ``Protesting in front of humans is a waste of time. Men won't
listen to the people's interests,'' the newspaper Terbit quoted one
of the 350 demonstrators as saying.
	   Indonesia's student movement, which helped oust authoritarian
leader Suharto in May, complains the new government won't heed
their demands.
	   They want Suharto put on trial and the military banned from
involvement in politics. Protesters fought deadly battles with
soldiers Nov. 13 near Parliament.
	   Sadly for the students at the zoo, the animals showed little
interest in their cause.
	   At a similar protest Wednesday, 300 students rallied at the zoo
in the historical city of Yogyakarta. They barked slogans against
the military before a rapt audience of three elephants, three
monkeys and one camel, the newspaper Jawa Pos reported.
	   Earlier this week, students who occupied the office of Attorney
General Andi Muhammad Ghalib gave him a chicken. They said it
symbolized his lack of resolve in investigating Suharto.

Ukrainian activists criticize president for seeking death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A human rights group criticized President
Leonid Kuchma on Thursday for saying that he would support the
execution of a man accused of dozens of killings, if he is
convicted.
	   Ukraine has imposed a moratorium on capital punishment, but the
issue is once again a hot topic due to the case of Anatoliy
Onoprienko, 39, who is on trial for 52 killings that took place
from 1989-96.
	   Despite the moratorium, Kuchma said he was ready to appeal to
the Council of Europe about the possible execution of Onoprienko if
he's found guilty.
	   ``As a man ... I see no other punishment,'' Ukrainian newspapers
quoted Kuchma as saying earlier in the week. ``For me as a
president, it's a very complex question. There is no place for such
non-humans on our land.''
	   The Ukrainian branch of Amnesty International, the human rights
group, said Kuchma's statement could influence the outcome of the
trial because of Ukraine's ``weak system of guarantees for court
independence.''
	   The group demanded an independent psychiatric assessment of
Onoprienko and noted that at least one suspect, Yuriy Mosol, was
arrested and allegedly tortured in 1996 on suspicion of carrying
out the murders, and later died in police custody.
	   ``Considering the high risk of judicial mistakes, the widespread
practice of torture, Amnesty International views the usage of the
death penalty in Ukraine as absolutely inadmissible,'' the
statement said.
	   ``Amnesty International insists on the full and unequivocal
adherence of Ukraine to its international human rights obligations,
including those on abolishing the death penalty.''
	   Ukraine agreed to abolish capital punishment in 1995 when it
joined the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
organization. The council, which promotes democracy, human rights
and the rule of law, forbids members from executing criminals.
	   However, 180 convicted criminals were executed before the former
Soviet republic introduced a moratorium on death penalties in March
1997, replacing executions with life imprisonment. Amnesty
International said Ukraine was second only to China in the use of
capital punishment in 1996.

Discord evident before key meeting of sports federations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Sports federations agree on the
need to fight doping but can't seem to agree on how to do it.
	   The latest attempt to bring uniformity to the war against
performance-enhancing drugs comes Friday when 35 international
sports federations meet with International Olympic Committee
leaders in Lausanne.
	   The IOC wants the 28 Olympic summer sports and seven winter
sports to fall into line and endorse a single medical code
embracing common anti-doping rules, procedures and sanctions.
	   Olympic leaders are intent on getting agreement from the sports
federations on the key issues before the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping
summit in Lausanne.
	   But already there are signs of discord.
	   Top Olympic officials admit the medical code is not acceptable
to everyone and that it will be impossible to get every federation
to agree to the same sanctions. Some criticize the proposed new
drug penalities to be presented Friday as flawed.
	   An IOC working group has drawn up a package of proposals that
divides doping offenses into different categories with different
sanctions _ including maximum punishments of life bans and dlrs 1
million fines.
	   The panel defines doping as one or both of the following:
	   _ ``use of an expedient substance or method potentially harmful
to health and capable of enhancing the athlete's performance''
	   _ ``the presence in the athlete's body of a substance or
evidence of a use of a method where such substance appears'' on the
IOC's list of banned substances.
	   The proposal divides doping offenses into ``regular'' and
``aggravated'' cases.
	   In so-called regular cases, the range of suspensions are from
one to six months for stimulants and from six months to two years
for more serious drugs.
	   For aggravated cases, the proposal calls for suspensions of two
years to eight years, and life bans for certain ``intentional
doping'' offenses.
	   Fines of up to dlrs 100,000 are proposed for minor drug
offenses, with dlrs 1 million penalties for serious infractions.
	   ``I'm afraid, unfortunately that the proposal is complicated,''
said Gunnar Werner, Swedish secretary of the international swimming
federation and a member of the IOC panel. ``For me as a lawyer, I
understand the discussion, but it won't be so easy to apply it for
those non-lawyers.''
	   The previous IOC guidelines recommended a maximum two-year
suspension for a first steroid offense. There was no provision for
fines.
	   A key figure Friday will be Primo Nebiolo, the president of the
International Amateur Athletic Federation and head of the
association of all summer Olympic bodies.
	   ``We believe we should have a strong minimum sanction, like two
years,'' he said. ``We could also have a clause allowing
federations to act differently if they have `exceptional
circumstances.'''
	   FIFA, world soccer's world governing body, has always gone its
own way and looks unlikely to bend to pressure to comply with
common sanctions.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter is skipping the Lausanne meeting and
will be represented by one of his aides. Blatter chose to travel to
South Africa to receive an award from President Nelson Mandela.
	   ``We would certainly be prepared to look at a concerted
effort,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``But each sport has to
deal with the problem according to its own disciplinary rules. The
federation has its prime responsibility and it would be foolish to
toe in the international line if in your heart of hearts you feel
that it's to the detriment of your sport.''
	   The international cycling union, whose sport was rocked by drug
scandals during the Tour de France, will be under pressure to
accept the IOC's doping rules.
	   Some Olympic officials, including IOC vice president Dick Pound
of Canada, say federations which don't fully comply with the
anti-doping fight should be dropped from the Olympics.
	   ``I think some of the federations have to say, `You know, if
we're going to be part of the Olympic movement, we've got to buy
into this. If we don't, maybe some sports will sit out,''' Pound
said. ``I think that would be an important statement on behalf of
the Olympics.''
	   But Prince Alexandre de Merode, head of the IOC medical
commission, said it would be a ``fatal mistake'' to threaten
federations with expulsion from the games.
	   ``We can only come up with guidelines,'' he said. ``We don't
have the power to impose rules on the federations. They have their
own autonomy. The IOC should point the way and let the federations
evolve.''
	   De Merode says complete harmonization of doping sanctions is
unrealistic, describing it as an ``intellecutal dream.''
	   He advocates the scrapping of fixed sanctions in favor of a
flexible range of minimum and maximum penalties.

Libyan television airs footage of Gadhafi assassination attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan television has broadcast for the
first time footage of what it said was a 1996 assassination attempt
against Moammar Gadhafi organized by the British secret service.
	   The footage aired Wednesday showed a faint object flying through
the air as the Libyan leader mingled with a crowd. Gadhafi's
bodyguards quickly surrounded him and hustled him away.
	   The television named the assailant as Abdullah Radwan. The
report was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   The London-based Arab satellite television channel ANN broadcast
similar footage in September.
	   One frame of that video, frozen and examined closely, showed
what appeared to be a painting of a grenade imposed on the hand of
the alleged assailant
	   Libyan television described the alleged assassination attempt as
``a plot set up by the British secret services.''
	   The British government has denied the claim.
	   Libyan television said the attack took place in Tobruk, in
eastern Libya. Earlier reports said it was staged in Fezzan, in the
south. There was no immediate explanation for the differences.

Slovenia names temporary defense minister amid political standoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Premier Janez Drnovsek named a
temporary defense minister Thursday, more than a month after
corruption allegations toppled the former minister in this
NATO-hopeful nation.
	   Drnovsek said Science Minister Lojze Marincek will take the
defense portfolio until politicians name a permanent successor.
	   The former minister, Alojz Krapez, was forced to resign Oct. 20
after opposition leaders revealed he accepted an apartment reserved
for uniformed soldiers.
	   Political parties within the government have been arguing since
over who will replace him.
	   Slovenia, which joined NATO's Partnership for Peace Program
after seceding from Yugoslavia in 1991, hopes to be named a
candidate for NATO enlargement at the organization's summit in
Washington next year.
	   Earlier this week, the Slovene People's Party, the second
largest force in Cabinet, suggested as defense minister Marija
Ribic, who works in the defense ministry's finance department.
	   But Drnovsek is expected to reject Ribic due to her lack of
military experience. Drnovsek said he prefers a military
professional in the post.

Many Kosovo Serbs becoming disillusioned with Milosevic

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A decade ago, Kosovo Serbs appealed
for protection of their rights. Help came in the form of Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   One of the Kosovo Serb politicians who helped bring the Serbian
leader to power, Momcilo Trajkovic, sums up Milosevic's rule over
the troubled province harshly: ``Human life has never been cheaper
in Kosovo.''
	   Many Kosovo Serbs agree about the need for the Belgrade
government to assert control over the overwhelmingly ethnic
Albanian province, an impoverished but striking land of snow-capped
mountains and rich agricultural valleys.
	   But after years of turbulence that exploded this year into war,
they are increasingly disillusioned with Milosevic and fear Kosovo
may be lost to them for good.
	   While critical of the Albanians' quest to break Kosovo away from
Serbia, they blame the Serbian president for radicalizing the
situation.
	   ``Milosevic never did anything to keep the Albanians in
Serbia,'' said Dusko Celic, an assistant law professor at Pristina
University in the Kosovo capital. ``Now, blood has been spilled and
it might be too late.''
	   The fighting that has torn former Yugoslavia apart has its roots
here, in the Kosovo Serbs' cause. Milosevic rose to power in
Kosovo, stirring up Serbian nationalism and later triggering wars
in Croatia and Bosnia.
	   But while others have moved on to independence, Kosovo's
minority Serbs feel they are being left out _ squeezed by ethnic
Albanian separatism, a corrupt regime and a world unsympathetic to
their plight.
	   Serbs consider Kosovo the heart of their statehood. In medieval
times, their state was based here. More than 1,000 Serbian Orthodox
churches and monasteries are still situated in this province of
Serbia, the main republic in what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who claim to be descendants of the ancient
Illyrians who settled Kosovo, say this is their land. They now make
up an estimated 90 percent of the population.
	   In communist-era Yugoslavia, Kosovo was part of Serbia but with
broad autonomy which gave the ethnic Albanians full control. Back
then, it was the Serbs who complained about lack of rights and
harassment.
	   In 1989, Milosevic abolished Kosovo's autonomy and introduced a
heavy-handed police and military rule. The ethnic Albanians moved
away from the state institutions completely, forming their own
parallel society. Most backed an independence movement.
	   Years of repression, combined with corruption and lawlessness,
led ethnic Albanians to armed rebellion against Serbia earlier this
year, provoking a counteroffensive by Serb police and the Yugoslav
army. Hundreds of people have died and some 300,000 were displaced
by the fighting.
	   No one knows how many Serbs are left in Kosovo, but their number
was in decline when the last census put the total at 215,000 in
1991, and is still dropping. The ethnic Albanian population,
meanwhile, has more than tripled in the last half-century _ from
fewer than a half-million in 1948 to 1.6 million in 1991.
	   Large numbers of Serbs, especially in rural areas, still support
Milosevic, blaming their problems on the Albanians or a world they
believe supports their enemy. Others are merely confused.
	   ``The whole world is against us, helping the Albanians. There is
nothing Milosevic could do with Americans on their side,'' said
Blagoje Spasic, 49, a farmer from Gracanica, a Serb-populated
village outside Pristina.
	   World leaders almost unanimously oppose granting independence to
Kosovo, as the ethnic Albanians demand. But Kosovo's Serbs are
upset that a U.S.-proposed peace plan would sever most ties between
the province and Serbia, envisioning self-rule by the Albanian
majority.
	   Celic said the American plan ``gives the Serbs a choice between
packing or assimilating.''
	   ``The world is trying to solve only the Albanian problem, giving
up multi-ethnic principles,'' said Trajkovic, who in recent months
has toured world capitals to promote the Kosovo Serb cause.
	   A few pockets of relative tranquillity in Kosovo show the way
Serb-Albanian relations used to be before passions became inflamed
by politics.
	   At Gracanica, the Serb village outside Pristina, residents say
there have been no clashes even though it lies next to the ethnic
Albanian village of Susice. Residents say Serbs and Albanians in
Kosovo have always lived isolated from each other, but treated each
other with tolerance and respect.
	   All that is in jeopardy now, the Serbs say.
	   ``This is a dirty war where the politicians are pushing people
against each other,'' said Sister Teodora, a nun in the
14th-century Gracanica monastery. ``The innocent people suffer.''

Sugar, meat production down in Ukraine, milk production stable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Sugar and meat production were down in
Ukraine this year compared to 1997, but milk production was stable,
officials said Thursday.
	   Over the first 10 months of this year, Ukraine produced 1,814
million tons (1,995 million tons) of sugar, compared to about 2
million metric tons (2.2 million tons) over the whole of 1997,
noted the National Association of Sugar Producers.
	   Producers have completed their production for the year, and the
final figures are not expected to change substantially. The
decrease has been attributed to a lack of fuel and sugar beets.
	   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Ministry reported that the production
of meat and meat products was down by more than 30 percent.
	   The ministry attributed the decline to the dwindling supply of
cattle for meat-producing plants, the independent UNIAN news agency
reported.
	   Despite the decrease in the number of cows, Ukraine's milk
production remained stable, amounting to about 12 million metric
tons (13.2 million tons) over the first 10 months of 1998, while
production of butter and cheese was slightly up, the ministry said.
	   Ukraine's economy, including the agriculture sector, has been in
sharp decline since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Latvian government wins approval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) - Legislators on Thursday voted in a new
minority government that will be headed by Vilis Kristopans of the
centrist Latvia's Way, and include another centrist party and a
rightwing group.
	   The vote by the Saeima parliament ended nearly two months of
negotiations. President Guntis Ulmanis had strongly pushed for
forming a majority government, but an agreement could not be
reached.
	   The new government leaves out the People's Party, which got the
largest number of seats in Oct. 3 national elections. Party leader
Andris Skele is strongly disliked by many other politicians and no
way could be found to include the party in the government.
	   The three-party government, consisting of Latvia's Way, the New
Party and the rightwing fatherland and Freedom, holds just 46 of
the 100 seats in the Saeima.
	   The government drew support from the leftwing Social Democrats
in Thursday's vote, even though that party will have no ministerial
posts. Fatherland and Freedom had rigidly refused to consider
having the Soial Democrats in government.
	   Kristopans will take over as prime minister from Guntars Krasts
of Fatherland and Freedom.
	   The only votes against the government came from the People's
Party, while the far-left National Harmony Party's 16 legislators
abstained.

Israeli troops, Palestinians clash in two West Bank locations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers on Thursday shot
rubber-coated bullets into a crowd of about 100 Palestinians who
threw stones at their outpost during a demonstration to demand
freedom for Palestinian prisoners.
	   One Palestinian was wounded in the leg, and another was struck
in the arm. Both were taken away in private cars to a hospital.
	   About 500 protesters marched through the West Bank town of Jenin
to the District Coordinating Office, where Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police are posted to coordinate security.
	   The demonstrators marched behind a white cloth banner showing
prisoners' hands chained and bleeding. ``No peace without release
of all prisoners,'' it said.
	   More than 2,500 Palestinians are in Israeli jails, and the issue
is very sensitive among Palestinians, many of whom had a relative
jailed during the three-decade occupation by Israel.
	   During the clash, one Israeli soldier could be seen on a tower
inside the compound, alternately ducking and shooting.
	   Palestinian police looked on from their post inside the joint
compound but did not get involved in the confrontation. After
warnings from Israeli officers, Palestinian security police arrived
a half-hour after the violence began to persuade the protesters to
pull back.
	   The Jenin demonstration was organized by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's own political faction Fatah.
	   In recent weeks, there have been a series of Palestinian
protests lobbying for the release of security prisoners held by
Israel.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January.
	   Palestinians complained that most of the 250 prisoners freed in
the first phase were criminals and not political activists as
promised.
	   ``Free the fighters, not the criminals,'' the protesters
shouted.
	   Awad Kenami said his son Ahmed, 37, a founder of the Black
Panther faction that fought Israeli occupation, was jailed two
months after the Oslo peace agreement was signed in September 1993.
	   ``My son was a soldier in a war led by Yasser Arafat; now Yasser
Arafat is a leader of peace, and so my son and his comrades must be
freed as soldiers for peace,'' Kenami told a reporter.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not
release prisoners with ``blood on their hands'' or members of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, which has rejected the peace process.
	   Also on Thursday, Jewish settlers in the divided West Bank town
of Hebron blocked Palestinian school children en route to a field
trip, touching off scuffling between Palestinians and Israelis,
witnesses said.
	   Israeli police said they detained four Palestinians, including
the school principal and a student, for questioning. A dozen girls
were taken to the hospital, but no injuries were reported.
	   Palestinian residents say that in recent weeks Israeli troops
and settlers have harassed Palestinians who walked by the Jewish
settler enclave.

Fans `hell-bent on causing mayhem' return to British soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Soccer hooligans ``hell-bent on causing mayhem''
are on the rise again in British soccer.
	   A report released Thursday by the National Criminal Intelligence
Service said hooliganism showed a ``marked increase'' in the first
month of this season and listed a wide array of violent incidents
including smashing up pubs and missile throwing.
	   Among the worst were:
	   _ a police charge against Glasgow Rangers fans.
	   _ a CS-spray attack on Norwich fans by Birmingham rivals.
	   _ fighting on a London to Sheffield train between Sheffield
United, Chesterfield and Nottingham fans that included robberies
and assaults on officers.
	   ``Although it is too early to say whether the overall downward
trend for football related arrest figures over the past five years
is being reversed, the signs are not encouraging,'' said Bryan
Drew, head of the NCIS Strategic and Specialist Intelligence
Branch.
	   Drew said unlike the ``dark days'' of the 1970s and early 1980s,
hooliganism now takes place away from pitch.
	   The warning came just a day before the government was to unveil
a package of measures to clamp down on hooligans including bans
from travel abroad for know troublemakers.
	   ``This season that ugly face of football hooliganism has
continued to make its very unwelcome presence felt,'' Drew said.
	   ``The numbers of people involved do remain comparatively small
but it is a hard-core, well organized and hell-bent on causing
mayhem, that is using football matches as a cover for its criminal
activities.''

OPEC hopeful of price accord as delayed meeting opens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with OPEC president's opening remarks &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A divided OPEC opened its year-end
ministerial meeting a day behind schedule Thursday, with some
delegates saying the organization would agree to extend production
cuts to the end of 1999.
	   That is the bare minimum analysts say is needed to prop up
rock-bottom oil prices, but it doesn't promise a boost for prices,
flirting with 12-year lows.
	   A 2.6 million barrel-a-day cut that the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries set in June to run for six months
could be extended to the end of 1999, an Iranian delegate said.
	   OPEC president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, who also is the United
Arab Emirates' oil minister, acknowledged in an opening speech to
delegates that a ``strong bearish sentiment has set in'' on the
world market.
	   Oil-producing nations, he said, ``are deeply concerned about the
serious problems facing the world's oil industry at the present
time, with weak international prices and an underlying feeling of
insecurity about future prospects'' in the near term.
	   Ministers had pushed back the start of the meeting, originally
scheduled to begin Wednesday, because of deep differences over the
issue of extending the production cuts and disagreements over
production levels.
	   Iran acknowledged it was facing criticism over its output level,
but called that unfair and said it isn't overproducing.
	   ``Others are blaming Iran,'' a senior Iranian delegate told The
Associated Press, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   The delegate said that when OPEC was determining Iran's
production capacity it did not take into account two new refineries
that came on line in February. He said Iran had been asked to cut
too much.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the
group's biggest producer.
	   Saudi Arabia has drawn ire at the Vienna gathering, with some
members complaining the kingdom seized market share after Iraq's
departure from the oil market in 1990 and now won't let go.
	   Iraq has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990
invasion of fellow OPEC member, Kuwait, but is now allowed to sell
limited amounts of oil under U.N. supervision to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods.
	   Indonesian Oil Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said he didn't
favor fresh cuts, but did favor an extension, in what seems to be a
growing consensus view.
	   He also said Indonesia was conducting a legal review of its
domestic oil industry after the fall of long-time ruler Suharto.
	   ``We want to have a competitive sector, oil and gas, a sector
that is effective and transparent, in terms of an open market
downstream and an effective market upstream,'' Mangkusubroto told
The Associated Press.
	   Venezuela threw a late spanner in the works when Oil Minister
Erwin Arrieta told ministers during preliminary talks that with a
new government taking over in February it could not commit to an
extension of the existing production cuts.
	   But Arrieta, speaking just before the scheduled start of the
formal session, said he was confident an agreement could be reached
by the end of the day. He did not elaborate.
	   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, is pushing for better
compliance with June's cuts, saying there is no point to further
cuts until full compliance is achieved.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January opened
in London Thursday at a record low of dlrs 10.88.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
favors new output reductions as do Algeria and Libya.
	   Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah said he
expects OPEC to convene again in March.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

Slovenia introduces VAT, one of EU requirements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenia moved Thursday to introduce
a value-added tax next July 1, fulfilling a long-standing
requirement needed for its bid to join the European Union.
	   The VAT, already in use in all neighboring countries, would
replace the wide range of taxes on trade and service, ranging from
zero to 25 percent.
	   Parliament adopted the two VAT rates: 8 percent for food,
textbooks and hotel services and 19 percent for all other
transactions and goods. There are no exemptions.
	   Slovenia, a country of 2 million people which proclaimed
independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991, has already started
talks on EU membership. But the organization's leaders have
recently criticized it for being too slow in making its legislation
conform to western European standards.
	   Among other measures, the EU has for years insisted that
Slovenia introduce VAT.
	   The Finance Ministry acknowledged that it expected to raise a
significant amount of money from VAT. But opposition deputies and
business associations warn that the tax will make life more
difficult and more expensive for both private companies and Slovene
citizens.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Proclaiming the start of a new partnership between
Tokyo and Beijing, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi apologized
Thursday for his country's wartime aggression and pledged to
support China's claims to Taiwan.
	   But in sign that significant differences remain, a joint
statement originally to be released after Obuchi's talks with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin was held up, reportedly as the two
sides wrangled over wording.
	   Emerging from almost two hours of talks with the Chinese
president, Obuchi said they had agreed to broad cooperation to
promote regional stability and ease Asia's year-old economic
crisis.
	   The joint statement, which news reports said was intended to
herald the beginning of ``a friendly partnership to advance peace
and development,'' still had not appeared hours after the meeting
ended.
	   Even as Jiang and Obuchi sat down for a state dinner given by
Japanese Emperor Akihito, Japanese and Chinese officials continued
last-minute negotiations over the statement's content, Japan's
public NHK television reported.
	   Bitter memories of the war and decades of Cold War division
still weigh on relations between Asia's two most powerful
countries. Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese head of state
since World War II, has been heralded as an effort to put these
issues to rest.
	   Japan wants the final version of the statement to express
Tokyo's regret that it had ``at a time in the past invaded China
and inflicted enormous losses on the Chinese people,'' Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   But the Chinese are seeking a more clearly worded apology, such
as the one offered to visiting South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
during his visit to Tokyo last month. Japan gave its fullest
apology yet for its 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean
Peninsula.
	   In another sign of possible trouble, neither leader will sign
the statement after its release. While diplomatic officials for
both sides said this was common practice, Japanese media called it
a highly irregular move.
	   In their talks, Obuchi reportedly gave the Chinese president
such a clear-cut spoken apology.
	   ``I would like to once again express remorse and our apologies''
for Japan's wartime aggression, NHK television quoted Obuchi as
telling Jiang.
	   NHK said Jiang replied by telling Obuchi he had a hard time
understanding how conservative Japanese politicians could keep
making inflammatory claims, such as denying atrocities by Japan's
army.
	   Beijing has criticized what it calls Tokyo's reluctance to face
up to its wartime deeds. While Japanese prime ministers and the
emperor have begun to offer apologies in recent years, Japan
remains petrified that too many expressions of remorse could
trigger renewed demands for compensation by victims of atrocities.
	   Among the other key points in Thursday's talks was Japanese
support for China's claim to Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a
renegade province.
	   Obuchi agreed not to support Taiwanese independence or
membership in international organizations reserved for sovereign
countries, NHK television said.
	   Jiang also reportedly pressed Obuchi to promise that recently
updated defense cooperation guidelines with the United States would
not require Tokyo to join any U.S. military actions around Taiwan.
Obuchi merely replied that the guidelines were ``defensive'' in
intent, NHK said.
	   The statement was also expected to announce the opening of a hot
line for urgent communications between Tokyo and Beijing, along
with a pledge to increase the frequency of visits by high-level
officials.
	   Economic ties also figured prominently in Thursday's talks.
China is Japan's second-largest trading partner, and Japan is
China's largest, with annual trade volume of more than dlrs 60
billion.
	   For Japan, a stronger Chinese economy and closer ties to Beijing
would anchor stability in a region where North Korea is still a
wild card and Southeast Asia is caught in financial and political
turmoil.
	   Jiang plans to meet with business leaders, civic groups and
students at a major university before leaving Tokyo Saturday for
visits to two northern Japanese cities, Sendai and Sapporo.

Free gifts at new store causes greedy mob to go out of control

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Hundreds of Norwegians shed their usual
placidity Thursday, rushing a new Ikea furniture store that was
offering 1,000-kroner (dlrs 135) gift certificates to the first 100
customers.
	   Dozens of people had camped out overnight at the store and
hundreds more showed up in the morning.
	   Just after Oslo Mayor Per Ditlev-Simonsen and entertainer
Synnoeve Svaboe completed the opening ceremony, the crowd stormed
in, chanting ''100 more gift certificates,'' breaking merchandise
and causing some minor injuries.
	   ''It seemed a little dramatic,'' Svaboe was quoted as saying by
the Norwegian news agency NTB.

DiMaggio celebrates birthday with some positive health news
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to ``Dom'' sted ``Don'' in 4th graf; UPDATES with
Engelberg saying DiMaggio could be home by Christmas, tumor hasn't
spread to other organs. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARV SCHNEIDER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio, recuperating from lung cancer
surgery, had special reason to celebrate his 84th birthday.
	   Not only had DiMaggio survived at least one brush with death,
but the news from one of his doctors was upbeat.
	   ``The prognosis for his recovery is good,'' said Dr. Earl
Barron, the lead doctor on a team of six physicians who have been
treating the Hall of Fame outfielder.
	   DiMaggio's birthday gathering began about 6 a.m. Wednesday when
he was joined in his hospital room by his brother Dom, also a
former big league outfielder; his sister-in-law, Emily;
granddaughter, Paula, and her husband, Jim; his friend and lawyer,
Morris Engelberg, a couple of nurses and Barron.
	   Although they did not sing ``Happy Birthday'' or have cake, they
shared a few quiet words and a lot of smiles.
	   The outlook was brighter than it had been in more than a month.
	   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Barron for
the first time confirmed DiMaggio had a cancerous tumor removed
from his right lung Oct. 14, two days after entering Memorial
Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida.
	   Because of his age, DiMaggio's progress is ``guarded,'' Barron
said, but he added that the New York Yankee great's condition was
very good, compared to what it had been.
	   ``For a while, it was touch and go, but he has been showing
steady improvement,'' Barron said.
	   When asked if DiMaggio's positive prognosis referred to the
cancer or the complications that followed the surgery, the
cardiologist answered, ``Both.''
	   After the surgery, DiMaggio suffered severe postoperative
complications, including a major lung infection that affected his
breathing.
	   The worst setback came on Nov. 16, as Engelberg was making his
usual early morning visit.
	   ``It was a tremendous drop in blood pressure and it scared the
life out of me,'' said Engelberg, who has been acting as DiMaggio's
spokesman.
	   Engelberg became so concerned that a Roman Catholic priest was
summoned to give DiMaggio last rites.
	   ``But I came in the next morning and there he was, shaving
himself,'' said Engelberg. ``He's amazing.''
	   The main problem was a buildup of fluid in DiMaggio's lungs as
the result of an infection, and at one point, an opening was made
in his trachea to help his breathing.
	   Although DiMaggio was still on a respirator, the setting was
about half of what it was at the height of the crisis that nearly
took his life. Engelberg was quoted in Thursday's editions of the
Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale as saying DiMaggio could be home by
Christmas.
	   ``They tell me three to five weeks,'' Engelberg said, adding
that the tumor had not spread to other organs. Engelberg was unsure
if it had reached the lymph nodes.
	   DiMaggio, who retired in 1951 after 13 seasons with the Yankees,
had been a smoker for years, starting in his youth in San
Francisco.
	   Throughout the years, DiMaggio has closely guarded his privacy,
and Engelberg said the center fielder was upset about erroneous TV
reports earlier this week about his condition.
	   ``Joe was angry when he saw on television that he had had a
heart attack,'' Engelberg said. ``I asked Dr. Barron, `Did Joe have
a heart attack?' and Barron told Joe, `No, you didn't have a heart
attack.'''
	   Engelberg said DiMaggio had instructed him not to divulge any
medical information about his condition, but because of recent
erroneous TV reports, DiMaggio agreed to allow Barron to speak with
the AP.

Myanmar moves detained foreign tourists from border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ Three tourists who strayed into
Myanmar last week have been moved from the border area where they
were detained farther into the country for more questioning.
	   A Myanmar government official said Thursday that the three were
found inside Myanmar's territory without legal permission and had
been brought to Taunggyi, about 175 kilometers (110 miles) from
where they were detained.
	   An investigation by immigration officials was under way, said
the official, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity
	   In Thailand, a military intelligence officer who monitors the
border identified the tourists as American citizen Michael John
Raedeke, 40; a Canadian resident of Hong Kong, Joseph Frank, 34;
and Dirk Rommeswinkel of Germany. Myanmar authorities have not
confirmed the identities.
	   The Thai officer, who also requested anonymity, said the Myanmar
border troops who detained the tourists confiscated a global
positioning device, used for identifying grid coordinates on maps.
	   The three were seen riding rented motorcycles in the rugged
border region around Thailand's western Mae Hong Son province last
week. Thai troops saw them drive across the frontier at Ban Mai Kai
On Pass but were unable to get their attention.
	   Motorcycle trekking is popular with tourists in the region, but
the Thai army fears the trio might be charged with spying by
Myanmar because they had the GSP device, the Thai officer said.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, is governed by the military and
has strict security measures in the border regions. Armed rebel
groups have been active in some areas.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Yangon was closed for the Thanksgiving
holiday. Diplomats from other embassies in Yangon were not
immediately available for comment.

Parliament speaker: Yeltsin's government `squishy as cabbage'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of the parliament's upper house on
Thursday spoke for stronger parliamentary powers, citing the
growing feebleness of President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   ``The government is as squishy as cabbage in the fall,'' Yegor
Stroyev, the speaker of the Federation Council said in an interview
published in the daily Komomolskaya Pravda.
	   Stroyev is normally a reliable ally of Yeltsin. But Stroyev
joined a growing number of presidential supporters who have
distanced themselves from Yeltsin in recent days. Stroyev, a
moderate, said that weakened president was not able to use the
extensive powers granted him under the Russian constitution.
	   ``There is a flow of accusations against the president for
having sweeping powers unrivaled by any other president, but these
powers end at the Kremlin walls,'' Stroyev said.
	   Yeltsin remained hospitalized Thursday, undergoing treatment for
pneumonia, the latest in a series of illnesses that have turned him
into a part-time president and fueled concern about his ability to
serve out the remainder of a term that runs until mid-2000.
	   The Kremlin released no new details Thursday on the president's
condition.
	   Meanwhile, Valentin Pokrovsky, a doctor and the president of the
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, who has examined Yeltsin in
the past, said Thursday that the president seems ``rather tired and
not quite healthy.''
	   He added, though that he didn't have any information about
Yeltsin's latest illness. Yeltsin's inability to govern must be
certified by doctors, and ``since the issue isn't raised, it means
the doctors don't think it necessary,'' Pokrovsky said at a news
conference.
	   The Communist-led opposition in parliament's lower house has
pushed for a bill that would require a medical check-up of the
president, with the results made public. So far, the move has
failed.
	   Stroyev didn't touch upon Yeltsin's health in his interview, but
spoke for a check on presidential powers and a corresponding
increase of the parliament's authority.
	   ``No reasonable man doubts that the constitution needs
revision,'' Stroyev said. ``The parliament's functions have been
unreasonably reduced.''

Aid group gives 10,000 quilts, medicine to China quake victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Survivors of a pair of powerful earthquakes in
southwest China are thronging damaged hospitals and spending nights
of freezing rain in shelters of twigs, an aid group reported
Thursday.
	   The quakes, followed by mighty aftershocks, killed five people,
injured more than 4,000 and left 25,000 homeless last week in the
mountains along the boundary of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces,
Doctors Without Borders said in a statement.
	   The group said its China-based workers had just completed a tour
of the disaster area and found the following conditions:
	   Hospitals, mostly small and some damaged by the quake, were
besieged by daily visits from hundreds of sick and wounded people.
Patients were being housed in small shelters next to the damaged
clinics.
	   In mountain villages, the homeless are sleeping under shelters
of branches or out in the open through freezing nights and sleet.
Many have no blankets or warm clothing.
	   Paris-based Doctors Without Borders will send 10,000 padded
quilts, medicine, plastic sheeting and water containers to the area
over the weekend.

Israel calls for opening of international Holocaust archives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Vatican and Yad Vashem comment &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is calling for the opening of
international Holocaust-era archives and has published a list of
repositories that officials say have put obstacles in the way of
researchers.
	   In a letter released this week, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's adviser on Diaspora affairs named a dozen archives in
Europe and Russia that ``have refused or have been uncooperative in
sharing information,'' wrote Bobby Brown.
	   ``We appeal to each institution listed to open their files so
that we may learn why civilized society failed in its basic
commitment to ensure the safety, lives, liberty and property of our
people,'' said the Nov. 22 letter addressed to the head of Israel's
delegation to an upcoming Washington conference on Holocaust
assets.
	   The publication of the letter, which did not give details of
non-cooperation, drew fire from a number of the institutions named.
It also attracted critics who questioned whether Israel, itself the
victim of boycotts, should be engaging in issuing black lists.
	   ``Black lists are something that we as a people should shy away
from,'' said Abe Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League,
who told The Associated Press the singling out of archives was
``irresponsible and counter-productive.''
	   Officials at some of the archives listed expressed dismay.
	   ``We had an impression that our cooperation with institutions
representing Jewish communities was going on with the satisfaction
of both sides,'' said Daria Nalecz, head of the Polish State
Archives, which was on the list.
	   The controversy arose in advance of a four-day conference on
Holocaust-era assets that will open Monday in Washington, D.C. Some
57 delegations from 44 nations will convene to discuss looted art,
insurance, communal property and the opening of files belonging to
private companies and public agencies.
	   The state institutions named in the letter included the Vatican
archives, the French National Archives, the files of the British
Custodian of Enemy Property, the MI5 intelligence agency and the
central state archives and Prague Jewish Museum in the Czech
Republic.
	   ``We've given them everything they wanted, every single
document,'' Czech Interior Ministry spokesman Jan Decker said,
adding Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust museum still owed dlrs 4,600
for microfilmed documents that were provided by the Jewish Museum.
	   Brown said the British custodian had allowed historians to look
at World War II-era bank accounts but not records of safe deposit
boxes and that MI5 had not provided all the material from secret
British agencies from that period.
	   In London, a Home Office spokesman said on condition of
anonymity that MI5 was ``currently reviewing its World War II
archive, but to the best of our knowledge there is nothing on MI5
files that is relevant to the Holocaust.''
	   Philippe Delaval, head of the French National Archives, said he
was ``astonished'' the the archives were accused of restricting
access. He said the archive recently welcomed a delegation from the
Holocaust Museum in Washington. Israeli officials said, however,
that the archive would not allow documents to be copied or taken
out of the country.
	   The Vatican, which offered no official comment except to say
that they have made available everything that they could, has been
involved in a long-running dispute with scholars over access to all
its archives. Israeli officials said interest focused in particular
on the documents of Pope Pius XII whose silence during World War II
has been questioned by Jews.
	   ``Jews were not only the victims of murder and robbery, but lost
most of our history, and we need it back,'' Brown said in an
interview. ``All the archives should be open to scholars and
individuals who want to now what happened.''
	   He said the problems were varied and that files were not
available for a variety of reasons: ``some by design, some because
of bureaucracy and some because they do not have enough funding.''
	   Brown said the archives of the former Soviet KGB intelligence
agency and the military archives in Podolsk were effectively closed
while the Federal Archives in Russia charged exorbitant rates to
foreign researchers.
	   Yelena Palshina, who oversees use of documents at the archive in
Moscow said access to documents was free. The archive was forced to
charge one dollar to copy a page however ``because we are very
poor,'' adding the institution got only 40 percent of its budget
from the state.
	   Roni Stauber, an expert on the Holocaust at Tel Aviv University,
said pressure needed to be applied to free up documents but that
the government should not compile black lists or criticize
publicly.
	   ``It's possible that government pressure will not be productive
because it could become a political matter instead of a research
matter,'' he said.
	   Iris Rosenberg, spokeswoman for Yad Vashem, Israel's National
Holocaust Memorial, said that while opening the archives was
essential for uncovering the historic details of the Holocaust
period, it remained unclear how the government's action would play
out.
	   ``We don't know if political intervention will be useful but we
will have to wait and see,'' Rosenberg said.
	   Brown said he believed that publicity would help free up
information from the Holocaust before it was lost forever, adding
that he was not publishing a ``dirty list.''

Blair makes first speech by British leader to Irish parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comment, color from speech &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Britain and Ireland must not be
``prisoners of our history,'' Tony Blair told Irish lawmakers
Thursday _ the first time a British prime minister had addressed
Dublin's parliament since the Irish Republic won independence 76
years ago.
	   The prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland received lengthy standing ovations before and
after his 25-minute speech, a scene of Anglo-Irish warmth that
would have been unimaginable only a few years ago.
	   Blair's historic speech emphasized how their two traditionally
hostile countries had ``so much shared history, so much shared
pain,'' but were now enjoying an age of unprecedented harmony, as
best expressed through their joint commitment to brokering peace in
Northern Ireland.
	   ``What I welcome above all is that, after keeping us apart for
so long, Northern Ireland is now helping to bring us closer
together,'' Blair said.
	   He emphasized that Britain and Ireland were led by new
generations who appreciated each other's increasingly common
cultures, and were enthusiastic about cooperating as equals in the
wider European Union.
	   ``We need not be prisoners of our history,'' he said. ``My
generation in Britain sees Ireland differently today, and probably
the same generation here in Ireland feels differently about
Britain. ...
	   ``Our theaters are full of Irish plays. Our television is full
of Irish actors and presenters. Your national football team has a
few English accents too,'' he said, triggering laughter along the
lawmakers.
	   Blair thanked Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern for leading a
successful referendum campaign to abolish the republic's
territorial claim to Northern Ireland, which he called an essential
ingredient in April's compromise accord.
	   He warned that the agreement was facing ``a difficult
juncture,'' with Protestant politicians refusing to form a new
coalition government envisioned in the agreement until the Irish
Republican Army started disarming.
	   He called for both sides ``to live up to their commitments,''
placing equal weight on the need for the new government to be
formed and for the outlawed IRA to start destroying its hidden
weapons stocks.
	   ``I am not asking anyone to surrender,'' he said in apparent
reference to the IRA and its allied Sinn Fein party, which wants
two posts in any new Northern Ireland administration. ``I am asking
everyone to declare the victory of peace.''
	   He appealed at length to his audience _ mostly lawmakers
committed to achieving the peaceful unification of Ireland _ to
appreciate the values and fears of the north's Protestant majority.
	   ``Just as we must understand your yearning for a united Ireland,
so too must you understand what the best of (Protestant) unionism
is about,'' he said.
	   ``They are good and decent people, just like you. They want to
remain part of the UK _ and I have made it clear I value that wish.
They feel threatened. Threatened by the terrorism with which they
have had to live for so long. Threatened _ until the Good Friday
agreement _ that they would be forced into a united Ireland against
the will of the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   He noted that the Protestant demand for Northern Ireland's
continued union with Britain, and the Catholic demand for Northern
Ireland's abolition, were both ``reasonable'' positions.
	   ``Those urges to belong, divergent as they are, can live
together more easily if we, Britain and the Irish Republic, can
live closer together too.''

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ This weekend's registration of
millions of voters for South Africa's second all-race elections

first time voter lists have been established in South Africa's
history.
	   Some civil servants who are supposed to register voters for the
1999 elections have not appeared for training. Leaflets telling of
the registration dates and procedures haven't been distributed to
all households as planned. And some voter registration equipment
has disappeared, said chief electoral officer Mandla Mchunu.
	   Mchunu called for patience, saying election officials were
feeling their way.
	   ``It's a maiden voyage for them,'' he told a news conference.
``They've got to learn to deal with problems.''
	   In a statement, the IEC said, ``We believe that the registration
process will not be perfect, but it will be good enough.''
	   The National Party, which ruled during apartheid, threw a
potential monkey wrench into the works when it announced Thursday
it plans to go to court to make it easier for mostly white South
Africans to register.
	   The governing African National Congress and IEC have decreed
that South Africans can only use the latest generation of identity
cards, which have a computer bar code, to register and vote.
	   Most blacks rushed to convert their restrictive apartheid-era
documents with the fall of white minority rule, so a greater
proportion of blacks have the new cards than whites, the National
Party's main support base.
	   The party wants old IDs also to be valid to register and wants a
hearing on the matter in Cape Town High Court, party leader
Marthinus van Schalkwyk told reporters in the southwestern city.
	   Surveys suggest as many as 5 million South Africans lack the new
IDs, but the Home Affairs Ministry which issues the cards says the
number is in the hundreds of thousands.
	   Mchunu also acknowledged there was controversy about the
thousands of soldiers who will help voters register in schools,
churches and community centers across South Africa's northern
provinces on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Registration in the south
will be held Dec. 4-6, and other dates will be set for January and
February.
	   Although the elections chief said some South African voters
still harbor fear of ``the state'' because of abuses committed by
apartheid governments, he said he would not insist soldiers wear
civilian clothes when helping register voters, as other officials
had suggested.
	   The soldiers will be unarmed, Mchunu said, and will provide
tents and electricity in rural areas for registration sites. Army
helicopters were already flying voter registration materials to
isolated areas.
	   Long lines and some confusion were apt to occur when
registration begins at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT), but will hopefully smooth
out, Mchunu said. Registration points close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT),
and reopen Saturday morning.
	   The election itself is expected to take place around May. No
date has been set.

Swiss vote on financing for Alpine rail project

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Train-loving Swiss voters are expected to approve
government plans to spend 30.5 billion francs (dlrs 22.1 billion)
over 20 years modernizing the national rail network and linking it
to high-speed lines in neighboring countries.
	   The plan centers on building two huge new tunnels through the
Swiss Alps to provide a route for north-south European cargo
traffic between Germany and Italy and to provide speedy passenger
train service.
	   The public already has approved the tunnels. But the government
needs approval to finance the modernization package, claiming that
failure to do so could lead to spending cuts in other areas.
	   The trucking lobby and other critics denounce the finance
package as a ``multibillion hole,'' gobbling money better spent on
local transport. Mountainous Switzerland can never realistically
have a high-speed rail network, they say.
	   ``Yes: Rail for all,'' counter rival banners plastered over
railroad stations.
	   The slogan has a big audience. The Swiss are far-and-away
Europe's leaders in train travel. On average, a Swiss resident took
38.6 train trips in 1996, the most recent statistics available.
Denmark was in second place with 27.6 train trips per capita.
	   The tunnels will be partly funded by a controversial new
pollution tax on heavy trucks, narrowly approved in September in
the face of fierce opposition from truckers and anti-Europeans.
	   Opinion polls point to another yes vote in Sunday's referendum,
although many voters are still undecided.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's biggest stock markets ended higher
Thursday, with Tokyo blue chips climbing on optimism that plans to
bring a Japanese opposition party into a governing coalition would
bring more economic stimulus measures.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 134.30
points, or 0.89 percent, closing at 15,207.77. The Nikkei has
rallied about 800 points this week, closing above 15,000 points
Tuesday for first time since Aug. 25.
	   The dollar bought 121.92 yen in late afternoon, up 1.08 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 121.73
yen overnight.
	   Investors have been encouraged by an alliance between Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party and the minority Liberal
Party, which has called for suspending an unpopular sales tax and
trimming the government bureaucracy.
	   In Hong Kong, shares were pulled higher by market heavyweight
HSBC Holdings, which gained 5.00 Hong Kong dollars, or 2.5 percent,
closing at 204.00 _ its highest level in more than six months.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 57.93 points, or 0.5 percent,
closing at 10,778.92. The Hang Seng has gained 8.4 percent over the
past two weeks.
	   The likely merger of Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust boosted
HSBC shares, prompting investors to ``focus on Europe,'' where HSBC
had a strong presence, said Kenny Tang of Tung Tai Securities Co.
	   Volume was thin in many markets. The U.S. Thanksgiving holiday
had the New York Stock Exchange closed, so traders in Asia were
unable to take any clues from Wall Street.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Shares rose only slightly as the U.S. holiday put a
damper on trading. The STI closed up 0.19 points, or 0.01 percent,
at 1,390.70.
	   BANGKOK: Shares fell as investors cashed in on blue-chip stocks,
pulling down the rest of the market. The SET Index fell 8.81
points, or 2.3 percent, closing at 382.20.
	   MANILA: Shares dropped as investors continued to cash in on
gains made in recent sessions. The PSE Index fell 37.61 points, or
1.9 percent, to 1,920.93.
	   TAIPEI: Shares rose after the government moved in to solve
problems at Kuang San Construction Group, boosting investor
confidence. The Weighted Price Index rose 164.36 points, or 2.3
percent, to 7,377.86.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares dropped as investors cashed in on recent
gains. The Composite Index fell 3.46 points, of 0.7 percent, to
498.69.
	   JAKARTA: Shares rose on positive macro-economic indicators. The
JSX Composite Index closed 7.295 points, or 1.9 percent, higher at
394.678.
	   SEOUL: Shares fell 3.8 percent Thursday on massive selling by
local institutional investors to hedge against the futures market.
The benchmark KOSPI dropped 17.42 points to 446.59.
	   SYDNEY: Shares rose on rumors of imminent takeovers in the
banking sector, pulling the entire market upward. The All
Ordinaries index rose 22.6 points, or 0.82 percent, closing at
2,772.0.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares fell for the second consecutive session as
market sentiment weakened over a fall in blue-chip Telecom Corp. of
New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 19.39 points, or
0.97 percent, to 1,962.35.

Top hospital's woes underline Sweden's medical system problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo STO101 &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The doctors at Stockholm's
world-respected Karolinska Hospital are struggling to fight off a
malady that may be getting the better of them _ severe
overcrowding.
	   Emergency-room patients are waiting up to 16 hours for
treatment, doctors are quitting in frustration and the hospital
that once basked in admiring media attention endures photographers
recording its troubles.
	   Karolinska, affiliated with the institute that awards the Nobel
Medicine Prize, long had been regarded as a model of the
sophisticated universal medical care provided by the Swedish
welfare state. It is now a model of the misfortunes plaguing the
system.
	   Forced in the 1990s to come to grips with the fact that the
welfare state was putting the country into deep debt, the
government _ under conservative and socialist prime ministers _
imposed budget cuts that pushed social services to their limits.
	   Sweden charges most patients only nominal fees for medical
treatment, with about 80 percent of the funding coming from public
coffers, and reining in the national budget imposed severe
hardships on hospitals.
	   In 1985, there were about 63,000 hospital beds throughout the
country of 8.8 million people, but the budget cuts have reduced the
number to about 38,000 now, according to the National Health and
Welfare Board, which monitors the health-care system but does not
run it.
	   In the early 1990s, Karolinska's emergency room already was
serving more than the 30,000 patients a year that it had been
designed for. But the cuts resulted in the closing of another
Stockholm hospital, and Karolinska ended up with many more
emergency patients.
	   The hospital's emergency room treats 65,000 people a year, ``an
unheard-of burden,'' said emergency room chief Stefan Engqvist.
``It is extremely stressful.''
	   Karolinska's unwelcome role as exemplar of the fraying medical
system was underlined Monday, when officials of the state Labor
Inspectorate toured the hospital and said they would demand
solutions from its directors.
	   ``The facilities aren't suitable. They don't suffice for today's
techniques and for how one should take care of people,'' inspector
Gunni Ekdahl said after the tour, which received intense attention
by local news media.
	   That coverage could be seen as embarrassing to a once-proud
facility, but Engqvist sounded almost relieved.
	   ``Maybe all this attention will help us,'' he said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``I can't influence the county
authorities'' responsible for hospitals.
	   If there are changes, they will come too late for doctor Jessica
Fryckstedt, who resigned from Karolinska in protest of the
conditions.
	   ``Sometimes when we go on night duty at 9:30 we have to take
over 10 patients who have been sitting since 2 because the doctors
had too much to do,'' she said in an interview with the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter. ``When it's at its worst we can't eat, drink or go
to the toilet.''
	   At another Stockholm hospital, Soedersjukhuset, it's the
overburdened maternity ward that is of particular concern:
according the newspaper Aftonbladet, the infant-mortality rate
there is 9 in 1,000; by comparison, the rate for all of the United
States is about 7.5 in 1,000.
	   ``I'm not surprised. We have problems,'' maternity ward chief
Peter Thoamssen was quoted as saying by the newspaper when
confronted with the figure. He described conditions on the ward as
extremely stressful.
	   ``Nobody paid attention. It was like a factory where you come in
on a moving belt,'' Agneta Johansson told the newspaper of giving
birth at Soedersjukhuset.
	   The troubles come as local authorities in Stockholm debate the
privatization of hospitals, seeing that as the best way to improve
services.
	   The hospital rated by many as Stockholm's best-run, Sankt
Goeran's, already is privately run _ although as an independent
subsidiary operation under the supervision of the county, rather
than as a profit-making company. Local authorities are considering
selling it and at least two medical-services companies have
expressed strong interest.
	   But privatization is resisted by many who have grown used to a
benign welfare state and who fear that privatization could mean
worsening services for those with lower incomes.
	   ``I hope that people will assess this very thoroughly, and never
go through with the sale,'' said Social Services Minister Lars
Engqvist.
	   Sweden currently has 30 facilities classified as private
hospitals, excluding long-term facilities. Most of them are small,
with fewer than 20 beds.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firebombs exploded Thursday at the private
office of Greece's justice minister, causing damage and slightly
injuring a security guard, police said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on
Evangelos Yannopoulos' downtown Athens office, which was empty at
the time.
	   But it was similar to more than 200 other blasts this year,
including one earlier this month at a government labor office. Most
have been claimed by obscure leftist groups and have targeted cars,
government offices, policemen and foreign businesses.
	   At least two propane gas containers were used in the attack,
police said.
	   It occurred while thousands of students took part in a march
through central Athens to protest proposed education reforms.
	   ``Such acts won't frighten anybody and Greeks are disgusted by
them,'' Yannopoulos stated after visiting his office.

Singapore drops all restrictions on former political prisoner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore on Thursday dropped all restrictions
on the movements of a former political prisoner, who had been
detained without trial for 23 years, the government said.
	   Chia Thye Poh, 57, was a member of Parliament from the now
defunct Barisan Sosialis Party and a university lecturer when he
was arrested in October 1966.
	   Until 1989, he was imprisoned under the Internal Security Act,
which allows for indefinite detention without charge or trial for
those the government suspects of being subversive.
	   Chia, listed by Amnesty International as one of the longest held
political prisoners in the world, has denied the government's
accusation that he was a communist.
	   In 1989, he was released from prison and confined to a fortress
on the tourist island of Sentosa, a mile (1.6 kilometers) off
Singapore. In 1992, he was allowed to visit and work in Singapore
for eight hours a day, and later he was allowed to reside on
Singapore's main island.
	   The easing of restrictions allowed Chia to travel to Germany
last year on a one-year Hamburg Foundation Fellowship. Still, he
was prohibited from making public statements without the Singapore
government's permission.
	   ``The Internal Security Department has reported that Chia's
conduct suggests he is unlikely to engage in activities prejudicial
to Singapore's security,'' the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a
statement.
	   It added: ``Should Chia in future re-involve himself in such
activities, he well be dealt firmly under the law.''
	   Singapore has been criticized abroad for its hard line against
political dissent, and for stifling opposition with libel suits.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   AMRITSAR, India (AP) _ An express train slammed in to another
passenger train that had derailed minutes earlier Thursday in
northwestern India, killing at least 86 people and injuring 250
others, police and railroad officials said. Seven cars of the
Amritsar-bound Frontier Mail from New Delhi jumped the tracks in
the wheat-growing district of Punjab state. Minutes later, the
Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express on a parallel track collided with
the derailed cars, said Amrit Lal, a police officer in Khanna. The
accident, the third worst in recent years, occurred 250 kilometers
(155 miles) northwest of New Delhi. The federal government ordered
a railroad safety official to conduct an inquiry into the accident.
The Punjab state police chief ruled out sabotage, the United News
of India news agency reported. Punjab was the center of a
decade-long secessionist movement that was crushed in 1984.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Proclaiming the start of a new partnership between
Tokyo and Beijing, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi apologized
Thursday for his country's wartime aggression and pledged to
support China's claims to Taiwan. But in sign that significant
differences remain, a joint statement originally to be released
after Obuchi's talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin was held
up, reportedly as the two sides wrangled over wording. Emerging
from almost two hours of talks with the Chinese president, Obuchi
said they had agreed to broad cooperation to promote regional
stability and ease Asia's year-old economic crisis. The joint
statement, which news reports said was intended to herald the
beginning of ``a friendly partnership to advance peace and
development,'' still had not appeared hours after the meeting
ended. (JAPAN-CHINA)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen, who seized power
in a coup d'etat last year, can now boast of being his country's
legal and legitimate leader with his appointment as prime minister
by a royal decree announced Thursday. The appointment by King
Norodom Sihanouk, dated Wednesday, came four months after Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party won a plurality in parliamentary
elections. Hun Sen had to let longtime rival Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, leader of the royalist FUNCINPEC party, become president
of the national assembly in order to win enough support to form a
new government. Hun Sen had ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in
last year's coup, killing a number of Ranariddh's top aides in the
process. (CAMBODIA-NEW GOVERNMENT)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for Malaysia's sacked
former deputy prime minister said Thursday they would ask a court
to free him on bail because he was not well. A bail application for
Anwar Ibrahim had been filed in court and would be heard Saturday,
his lawyer Attorney Sankaran Nair. ``Normally in cases like these,
medical conditions are always a basis to ask for bail,'' Nair told
reporters. The trial judge said Anwar's lawyers weren't able to
prove that he would not tamper with witnesses in the corruption
case if released on bail. Anwar suffers from a stomach disorder
that causes intense heartburn, family members have said. Although
he does not appear to be in physical pain during his court
appearances, his lawyers say his condition has worsened. Anwar was
arrested Sept. 20 under a special security law only hours after
organizing a mammoth rally in the capital. During that protest, he
called for sweeping government reforms and the resignation of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's former president was
convicted Thursday of 11 counts of sodomy and homosexual assault,
and prosecutors confirmed he had fled the country. Canaan Banana, a
Methodist minister, was requesting political asylum in neighboring
Botswana after leaving the country Nov. 17 ahead of the verdict,
said Chief Prosecutor Augustine Chikumira. He said the government
will seek Banana's extradition. The guilty verdict on all counts
came after a three-week trial in June. Banana faces an estimated
maximum sentence of 22 years in prison at sentencing Dec. 10.
Prosecutors alleged Banana used his authority as the nation's
titular president to force staff into homosexual acts. In his court
defense in June, Banana said the charges were an attempt to destroy
his character and political standing amid rumors he was planning a
political comeback. (ZIMBABWE-BANANA)

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International efforts at finding a
peace formula for Kosovo intensified Thursday despite Serbia's
defiant attempts to impose its own plan, which ethnic Albanians
have rejected.
	   European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch arrived in the province
for a day of meetings with ethnic Albanian negotiators and
representatives of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Wolfgang Petritsch, who is Austria's ambassador to Yugoslavia,
is expected to hook up with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill in Pristina
on Friday, continuing joint Western efforts to negotiate a deal for
Kosovo acceptable to all sides.
	   He was to talk with KLA representatives later Thursday and
possibly with Serb politicians on Friday.
	   After meeting Kosovo's Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, Petritsch
said that although a humanitarian catastrophe has been prevented,
the situation on the ground, due to the cold Kosovo winter, remains
``very critical.'' He said the European Union is seeking
``long-term arrangements to improve both humanitarian and economic
conditions.''
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes claimed hundreds of lives and forced some 300,000 people to
leave their homes.
	   ``I believe that, even if we reach a political accord, that
doesn't provide for jobs in Kosovo,'' said Petritsch before going
into the field to meet some of the tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who are still displaced.
	   Petritsch also handed Rugova a list of abducted Kosovo Serbs
provided by a Serbian opposition party from Belgrade. Rugova
promised to look into it.
	   ``We have to be concerned about every single person no matter
whether the person is of Albanian extraction, Serb or from any
other group here in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Petritsch's visit came after Serbia on Wednesday reiterated its
rejection of an American plan, and sought to push forward its own
peace proposal. Top Serbian negotiator also warned of a regional
war if Kosovo is granted more than self-rule.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant of the two
republics in Yugoslavia. Majority ethnic Albanians want
independence but Serbia rejects the idea.
	   There are fears that the province could explode in new fighting
if a solution is not found by spring.
	   The American plan would leave Kosovo loose ties with Serbia
while keeping it under jurisdiction of the Yugoslav federation.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians have praised the plan, but Serbian
officials said it is unacceptable. Serbia wants to keep Kosovo,
which it considers the cradle of its statehood, firmly under its
control.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.

Israeli opposition leader rejects call to join a unity government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's opposition leader on Thursday rejected
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported attempts to coax him
into joining a unity government, vowing he would never become part
of such a ``terrible'' administration.
	   Cabinet ministers in Netanyahu's Likud party are reaching out to
their Labor rivals in a scramble to save the premier's shaky
coalition, Israeli media reported.
	   The six-party alliance has been on the verge of collapse since
Israel handed over another chunk of West Bank land to the
Palestinians last week.
	   Two members of the coalition voted against implementing the Wye
summit agreement, leaving Netanyahu with a questionable majority in
the 120-seat Knesset.
	   ``The Labor Party will not join a national unity government,''
party head Ehud Barak said on Israel Radio. ``We will not be a part
of this terrible government.''
	   If his right-wing ministers bolt, Netanyahu would be left
without a majority and thus vulnerable in no-confidence motions.
Netanyahu will face his next test next Tuesday when an early
elections bill is scheduled to come up and then again in December
when he presents the annual budget.
	   As part of the intensive effort to save his government,
Netanyahu struck a tentative deal Wednesday with moderate David
Levy, who had resigned earlier this year from his post as foreign
minister.
	   Levy, who controls three Knesset seats, is likely to return as
minister of infrastructure. His rejoining would give Netanyahu
control of 64 seats, enough to defeat an early elections bill
without the support of the extreme right-wing Moledet party.
	   Despite Barak's continued statements that he would not lead
Labor into a union with Likud, Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister
and head of the Labor party, said a merging of bi-partisan
political forces is the only way a final peace deal can be
clinched.
	   ``I don't think we can reach a final settlement with only one
party. In order to reach a final settlement, we need both parties,
and the two parties need to understand that,'' Peres said in an
interview with Israel Radio.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, one of a trio of ministers
pushing for a national unity government, said Netanyahu's desire to
bring Labor into the fold is genuine and that the prime minister
would appeal to Labor directly on his return from Europe next week,
the daily Yediot Ahronot said.
	   Both Sharon and Netanyahu canceled trips in order to deal with
the coalition crisis. Sharon had been set to go to Washington, and
Netanyahu backed-out of the Swiss portion of a three-country
European tour.

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ An express train slammed into another
passenger train that had vaulted off its tracks Thursday in
northwestern India, killing at least 97 people and injuring 250
others, police and railroad officials said.
	   In all, 16 cars were damaged in the accident, the worst in three
years in India. The accident occurred in darkness in the early
morning, Kumar told reporters at the accident site, 250 kilometers
(150 miles) northwest of New Delhi.
	   Three rear cars of the Amritsar-bound Frontier Mail from New
Delhi jumped the tracks between the towns of Khanna and Payal in
the wheat growing district of Punjab state. Barely a minute later,
the Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express coming from Jammu on a parallel
track collided with the derailed cars, said Ashok Kumar, a top
official of the government-owned railroad company.
	   The engine and four cars of the express train were crumpled like
balls of paper in the impact.
	   Rescue workers cut the cars with acetylene torches to extricate
97 bodies, said Punjab state police chief Pooran Chand Dogra. Among
the dead were 40 army soldiers going home to Calcutta.
	   Kumar said the links snapped in the Frontier Mail and some of
the rear cars detailed. A total of 1,700 passengers were aboard
both trains.
	   Dogra said more bodies were still lying in the cars. Authorities
have called for more gas cutters, cranes and other equipment.
	   The engine of the express train was buried under dirt. Two of
its mangled cars were perched on the wreckage of three Front Mail
coaches.
	   Workers took 250 people to local government and private
hospitals, where the condition of 36 people was serious, said S.K.
Mirza, an officer at the state police control room.
	   Residents of the wheat wholesale market town of Khanna organized
the first rescue effort, barely an hour after the accident.
	   Farmers shone headlights of cars or tractors on the wreckage.
Others offered tea, bread or blankets and sweaters since many
passengers were dressed in night clothes or had lost their
belongings, said Shiv Kumar, a businessman who joined the rescue
efforts.
	   Hours after the accident, many people were still trapped inside
the cars.
	   ``They are shrieking. Some are saying, 'Cut off my legs. Cut off
my hands. Just rescue me.' I saw one woman who is still trapped
inside. Her legs are dangling from the compartment, but they are
not able to rescue her because the compartment is at the bottom.''
	   Police rigged up loudspeakers to frequently announce that help
was on the way. Others were shouting words of encouragement to
those trapped insided.
	   Kumar said most of the dead appeared to be passengers in the
first four cars of the Sealdah Express.
	   Five hours after the accident, rescue workers gingerly lifted
two army soldiers to waiting ambulances after engineers using crow
bars or their bare hands slowly yanked apart the metal wreckage of
the Frontier Mail.
	   Rescuers, involving some 1,000 police and railroad workers,
first propped up the wobbly wreckage with wooden planks and steel
beams, then used six light cranes to slowly tear apart the upper
coach.
	   ``It was a major engineering problem,'' said V.K. Agnihotri, the
chief railroad engineer supervising the operation. ``We couldn't
use gas cutters because people were trapped in the coach below.
	   First information about the accident reached a railroad watchman
after a passenger ran a few kilometers (miles) on the tracks along
the fields to call for help.
	   Traffic along the northern routes in Punjab was suspended to
facilitate the rescue operations and the removal of wreckage.
	   The federal government ordered an inquiry by a railroad safety
official. Police chief Dogra and railroad official Kumar ruled out
sabotage. ``It was a purely mechanical problem,'' Kumar said.
Punjab was the seat of a decade-old secessionist movement that was
crushed in 1994.
	   Every year, some 300 accidents occur on India's railways, the
largest network under one management in the world. In January, 52
people were killed in a train collision on a foggy morning in the
northern city of Lucknow. Three years ago, two trains collided near
New Delhi, killing 358 people. Most of the past accidents have been
blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment.
	   More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India
every day on 67,000 kilometers (41,875 miles) of track stretching
from mountains to the coastal plains, through dense forests, arid
deserts and crowded cities.

IMF chief to visit Moscow for talks on resuming loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund will
visit Moscow next week for talks on the resumption of assistance to
Russia's ailing economy, news reports said Thursday.
	   An IMF delegation left Moscow earlier this week with no promise
that it would resume an existing loan, and the fund has remained
critical of the Russian government's plans to tackle the economic
crisis.
	   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a speech in
Madrid, Spain, on Wednesday that the IMF wouldn't abandon Russia.
But he said, ``Russia must first show it is willing to help
itself,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Camdessus is expected to arrive in Russia on Dec. 1, Russian
news agencies reported.
	   The IMF has insisted on seeing a sound economic program by the
Russian government, and signs that is has been implemented, before
releasing any more of the dlrs 22.6 billion aid package that has
been frozen since August.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse, following a default on loans and the devaluation of the
ruble in August. The government says more foreign aid is crucial
for getting the economy on track.
	   In the speech in Madrid, Camdessus said that Russia's most
urgent task is to increase tax collections, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The State Tax Service said Thursday it planned to collect 12
billion rubles (dlrs 687 million) in November _ less than in
October, but more than originally planned for November.
	   Appearing at a news conference, deputy tax chief Sergei Shulgin
did not say why the collections were likely to drop from the 14
billion rubles (dlrs 801 million) collected in October.
	   Total tax collections for the first nine months of the year were
134 billion rubles (dlrs 7.7 billion at the current rate), and
Shulgin said next year's revenues were expected to be slightly
above 200 billion rubles (dlrs 11 billion).

Czech Republic creates commission to return Jewish property
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The government has established a
commission to return Jewish property confiscated during World War
II, a Jewish community official said Thursday.
	   The commission, to include members of the government and the
Czech Federation of Jewish Communities, is to map out by March all
unrestituted property, Alena Rubesova said.
	   The state has already returned some 80 percent of confiscated
Jewish properties which it held.
	   The government plans to return to surviving Holocaust victims
all remaining property confiscated by the Nazis during World War
II. It will also create a fund for compensation where restitution
is impossible.
	   Besides the state-held properties, the Federation of Jewish
Communities demands return of property now owned by municipalities
and individuals. About half of the 202 properties are yet to be
returned.
	   Restitution was delayed by 40 years of communism, which ended
here in 1989, and subsequently by insufficient legislation.
	   Some 120,000 Jews lived on Czech territory before the Holocaust.
Now there are about 6,000.

Turkey's sports minister invites Italian counterpart to match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's sports minister has invited his
Italian counterpart to attend the Galatasaray-Juventus Champions
League match set for next week in Istanbul.
	   Sports Minister Yucel Seckiner sent a formal invitation to
Giovanna Melandri on Wednesday.
	   ``We invited the minister to see that there is no negative
atmosphere in Turkey,'' said Ahmet Gocen, a sports ministry
official.
	   UEFA postponed the match _ it was to have been played Wednesday
_ and set it for next Wednesday because of anti-Italian sentiment
in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Turkish and Galatasaray officials said the decision favored the
Italian team. Some claimed soccer's European governing body had
postponed the match to allow injured Juventus players time to get
back into shape.
	   The Turkish side has seven points in Group B, one behind
Norway's Rosenborg. Galatasaray has seven and Juventus four, but
they've each played one fewer game than the Norwegians.
	   Juventus has reached the European Champions Cup final three
straight times and won once.
	   Thousands of Turks have taken to the streets in the past week in
anti-Italian demonstrations since Ocalan's detention in Rome
earlier this month. Italy has since released the rebel leader and
is considering granting him political asylum.

Top hospital's woes underline Sweden's medical system problems

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The doctors at Stockholm's
world-respected Karolinska Hospital are struggling to fight off a
malady that may be getting the better of them _ severe
overcrowding.
	   Emergency-room patients are waiting up to 16 hours for
treatment, doctors are quitting in frustration and the hospital
that once basked in admiring media attention endures photographers
recording its troubles.
	   Karolinska, affiliated with the institute that awards the Nobel
Medicine Prize, long had been regarded as a model of the
sophisticated universal medical care provided by the Swedish
welfare state. It is now a model of the misfortunes plaguing the
system.
	   Forced in the 1990s to come to grips with the fact that the
welfare state was putting the country into deep debt, the
government _ under conservative and socialist prime ministers _
imposed budget cuts that pushed social services to their limits.
	   Sweden charges most patients only nominal fees for medical
treatment, with about 80 percent of the funding coming from public
coffers, and reining in the national budget imposed severe
hardships on hospitals.
	   In 1985, there were about 63,000 hospital beds throughout the
country of 8.8 million people, but the budget cuts have reduced the
number to about 38,000 now, according to the National Health and
Welfare Board, which monitors the health-care system but does not
run it.
	   In the early 1990s, Karolinska's emergency room already was
serving more than the 30,000 patients a year that it had been
designed for. But the cuts resulted in the closing of another
Stockholm hospital, and Karolinska ended up with many more
emergency patients.
	   The hospital's emergency room treats 65,000 people a year, ``an
unheard-of burden,'' said emergency room chief Stefan Engqvist.
``It is extremely stressful.''
	   Karolinska's unwelcome role as exemplar of the fraying medical
system was underlined Monday, when officials of the state Labor
Inspectorate toured the hospital and said they would demand
solutions from its directors.
	   ``The facilities aren't suitable. They don't suffice for today's
techniques and for how one should take care of people,'' inspector
Gunni Ekdahl said after the tour, which received intense attention
by local news media.
	   That coverage could be seen as embarrassing to a once-proud
facility, but Engqvist sounded almost relieved.
	   ``Maybe all this attention will help us,'' he said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``I can't influence the county
authorities'' responsible for hospitals.
	   If there are changes, they will come too late for doctor Jessica
Fryckstedt, who resigned from Karolinska in protest of the
conditions.
	   ``Sometimes when we go on night duty at 9:30 we have to take
over 10 patients who have been sitting since 2 because the doctors
had too much to do,'' she said in an interview with the newspaper
Dagens Nyheter. ``When it's at its worst we can't eat, drink or go
to the toilet.''
	   At another Stockholm hospital, Soedersjukhuset, it's the
overburdened maternity ward that is of particular concern:
according the newspaper Aftonbladet, the infant-mortality rate
there is 9 in 1,000; by comparison, the rate for all of the United
States is about 7.5 in 1,000.
	   ``I'm not surprised. We have problems,'' maternity ward chief
Peter Thoamssen was quoted as saying by the newspaper when
confronted with the figure. He described conditions on the ward as
extremely stressful.
	   ``Nobody paid attention. It was like a factory where you come in
on a moving belt,'' Agneta Johansson told the newspaper of giving
birth at Soedersjukhuset.
	   The troubles come as local authorities in Stockholm debate the
privatization of hospitals, seeing that as the best way to improve
services.
	   The hospital rated by many as Stockholm's best-run, Sankt
Goeran's, already is privately run _ although as an independent
subsidiary operation under the supervision of the county, rather
than as a profit-making company. Local authorities are considering
selling it and at least two medical-services companies have
expressed strong interest.
	   But privatization is resisted by many who have grown used to a
benign welfare state and who fear that privatization could mean
worsening services for those with lower incomes.
	   ``I hope that people will assess this very thoroughly, and never
go through with the sale,'' said Social Services Minister Lars
Engqvist.
	   Sweden currently has 30 facilities classified as private
hospitals, excluding long-term facilities. Most of them are small,
with fewer than 20 beds.

Witness: Police tampered with key documents at Anwar's behest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with testimony from witness &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's former No. 2 leader
forced police to produce even stronger retractions from two people
who had accused him of illegal sex, a former police official
testified in court Thursday.
	   The witness was the latest called in prosecution efforts to
prove that Anwar Ibrahim abused his power last year by forcing
police to arrest and obtain retractions from those who had written
to authorities accusing him of sodomy and adultery.
	   The original retraction letters were not strong enough to suit
Anwar, and the then deputy prime minister forced him to tamper with
them, said Amir Junus, a former deputy chief of police
intelligence.
	   Ummi Hafilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, had
accused Anwar of having sex with her brother's wife. Azizan Abu
Bakar, the politician's former chauffeur, claimed he was sodomized
by his boss.
	   ``Anwar ordered us to obtain confession letters from them that
... had to be more committed, convincing and firm in denying and
retracting all their allegations'' against him, Amir testified on
the trial's 14th day.
	   He said Anwar demanded that additional paragraphs be added so
the documents would unequivocally state that Anwar was innocent of
sexual misconduct.
	   Amir said he had not choice but to accede.
	   ``I modified the retraction letter according to the accused's
wishes,'' he told the court.
	   Anwar, 51, has repeatedly denied the 10 corruption and sex
charges against him, saying they were fabricated to eliminate his
political challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Earlier, a surprise twist delayed Anwar's trial when the chief
prosecutor was called away to testify in a related criminal case.
	   Abdul Gani Patail, who is leading the prosecution against Anwar,
had been subpoenaed to take the stand against Anwar's former tennis
partner, who faces the death penalty for alleged illegal possession
of live bullets.
	   But that trial was recessed, and Anwar's trial went ahead later
Thursday.
	   Last month, Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah said that once
Anwar's current trial ends, more sex-related charges would be
leveled against him based on new evidence against Anwar and his
former tennis partner, S. Nallakarruppan, commonly known as Nalla.
	   Nalla, a businessman, was indicted shortly before Anwar's
arrest.
	   Charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live
ammunition, Nalla faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted.
	   The bullets were said to have been found in Nalla's house during
a police investigation of allegations published in the book ``Fifty
Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while Anwar was finance and deputy prime minister.
	   Nalla and Anwar have vehemently denied the allegations, and
Anwar has accused authorities of conspiring to destroy his
political career.
	   One of Nalla's lawyers, Manjeet Singh Dhillon, said earlier this
week he planned to drop out of the case to take the stand as a
defense witness and reveal information relating to Anwar's case.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's biggest stock markets ended higher
Thursday, with Tokyo blue chips climbing on optimism that plans to
bring a Japanese opposition party into a governing coalition would
bring more economic stimulus measures. The benchmark 225-issue
Nikkei Stock Average gained 134.30 points, or 0.89 percent, closing
at 15,207.77. The Nikkei has rallied about 800 points this week,
closing above 15,000 points Tuesday for first time since Aug. 25.
The dollar bought 121.92 yen in late afternoon, up 1.08 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of 121.73
yen overnight. Investors have been encouraged by an alliance
between Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party and the minority
Liberal Party, which has called for suspending an unpopular sales
tax and trimming the government bureaucracy. In Hong Kong, the
blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 57.93 points, or 0.5 percent,
closing at 10,778.92. The Hang Seng has gained 8.4 percent over the
past two weeks. Volume was thin in many markets due to the U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A divided OPEC opened its year-end
ministerial meeting a day behind schedule Thursday, with some
delegates saying the organization would agree to extend production
cuts to the end of 1999. That is the bare minimum analysts say is
needed to prop up rock-bottom oil prices, but it doesn't promise a
boost for prices, flirting with 12-year lows. A 2.6 million
barrel-a-day cut that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries set in June to run for six months could be extended to
the end of 1999, an Iranian delegate said. OPEC president Obaid bin
Saif Al-Nasseri, who also is the United Arab Emirates' oil
minister, acknowledged in an opening speech to delegates that a
``strong bearish sentiment has set in'' on the world market. (OPEC)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
is coming to Washington this weekend for a meeting expected to
boost international aid to Palestinians beyond the dlrs 2.1 billion
delivered over the past five years. The Clinton administration
plans to increase U.S. pledges, which have totaled dlrs 500
million, and to seek more from about 40 countries to be represented
at a meeting Monday, including Israel and all Arab states except
Syria and Lebanon. Five years ago, dlrs 2.3 billion was pledged at
a similar conference to assist the Palestinians in the West Bank
and in Gaza. A total of dlrs 2.1 billion was disbursed. A State
Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined
to specify how much U.S. aid would be pledged at the conference,
but the official said an increase is planned, subject to
congressional approval. Arafat arrives Saturday to push for public
and private aid and to attend the donor meeting. (US-PALESTINIANS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., split apart nearly
90 years ago by trustbusters, are discussing a merger that would
create the world's premier energy business, the Financial Times
reported Thursday. Exxon's acquisition of Mobil, which would likely
be worth at least dlrs 49 billion and the largest industrial deal
in history, could be announced as soon as next week, the
London-based paper said, citing people close to both companies.
Exxon is the world's second-largest energy company after the Royal
Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. Mobil is the second-largest U.S. oil and
gas group after Exxon and the fourth-largest in the world. Neither
company would confirm whether talks are ongoing. The consolidation
of the energy giants would reunite two pieces of the Standard Oil
Trust empire pulled apart by the Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon, a
leading worldwide producer of petrochemicals, operates in more than
100 countries. Mobil has been divesting its non-core operations to
focus on oil and gas production, and owns or operates all or part
of 25 refineries globally. (US-MOBIL-EXXON)
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Panicked depositors pulled 40 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.2 billion) out of a troubled bank, but
calm was restored Thursday as branches reopened with plenty of cash
displayed on the counters. The run on Taichung Business Bank was
the worst in Taiwan's history, and some branches stayed open into
the early hours of Thursday, after depositors had lined up all day
Wednesday to get their money. The government sacked the bank's
chairman and other directors Wednesday over alleged improper loans,
and ordered a consortium to come up with emergency funds to pay off
depositors. It was reported that the ousted chairman, Tseng
Chen-jen, had gotten into financial troubles during a property
slump several years ago, but he bailed himself out by going to a
Las Vegas casino where he won U.S. dlrs 30 million. The report in
the United Daily News could not immediately be verified.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Saman Sorjaturong outpointed
fourth-ranking challenger Ladislao Vazquez of Mexico in a unanimous
decision Thursday to retain the World Boxing Council flyweight
crown.
	   Vazquez, 32, dropped Saman with a left hook in the fifth round,
which resulted in a mandatory eight count.
	   But then the Mexican suffered a cut above the left eye halfway
through the 12-round bout, slowing but not stopping him. In the
seventh round, a ringside doctor was called in to examine the cut
but the fight was allowed to continue.
	   Saman, 27, dominated the second half of the fight, delighting
the home crowd with straight rights and left hooks that troubled
the challenger but couldn't bring him down.
	   By the 10th round, Saman had a comfortable lead, and kept his
distance with stiff jabs while moving side to side.
	   It was Saman's 10th WBC title defense.
	   Judges from Australia and Switzerland scored the fight 115-113
in Saman's favor, while a Korean judge scored it 116-114 for Saman.
	   Both fighters weighed 107 pounds (48.5 kilograms).
	   The fight took place at one of the three sports complexes to be
used at the Dec. 6-20 Asian Games.

Romanian workers protest unpaid wages, poverty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of Romanian workers
protested falling living standards and unpaid wages in cities
around the country on Thursday.
	   Hundreds of health workers marched to the government
headquarters in Bucharest and government buildings in the cities of
Botosani, Buzau and Turnu Severin to demand higher salaries.
	   They also want the government to spend more money on the
country's ailing health system. Romania spends very little on
health and doctors and medical assistants' meager wages are
supplemented by bribes and gifts.
	   Chemical workers in Bucharest protested a decision by Finance
Minister Decebal Traian Remes not to pay traditional year-end
salary bonuses to state workers as part of reduced government
spending.
	   ``The government is not the owner of our factories so it cannot
tell our managers not to pay us bonuses,'' said the chemical
workers' union in a statement quoted by national radio.
	   In the Transylvanian town of Hateg, 275 kilometers (170 miles)
northwest of Bucharest, some 600 miners blocked a national highway
to protest wage arrears, radio reported.
	   Workers have taken to the streets in recent weeks over unpaid
salaries and proposed government reforms they fear will leave many
jobless.
	   The average national monthly salary is 1.2 million lei (dlrs
120) and unemployment is about 9.2 percent.

Libyan television shows alleged Gadhafi assassination attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan television has broadcast for the
first time footage of what it said was a 1996 assassination attempt
against Moammar Gadhafi organized by the British secret service.
	   The footage aired Wednesday showed a faint object flying through
the air as the Libyan leader mingled with a crowd. Gadhafi's
bodyguards quickly surrounded him and hustled him away.
	   The television named the assailant as Abdullah Radwan. The
report was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   The London-based Arab satellite television channel ANN broadcast
similar footage in September. One frame of that video, frozen and
examined closely, showed what appeared to be a painting of a
grenade imposed on the hand of the alleged assailant
	   Libyan television described the alleged assassination attempt as
``a plot set up by the British secret services.''
	   The British government has denied the claim.
	   Libyan television said the attack took place in Tobruk, in
eastern Libya. Earlier reports said it was staged in Fezzan, in the
south. There was no immediate explanation for the differences.

Pop star Gary Glitter ordered to stand trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YATE, England (AP) _ Pop star Gary Glitter on Thursday was
ordered to stand trial on a string of child sex and pornography
charges.
	   Glitter, 54, whose real name is Paul Gadd, has been charged with
making 50 indecent photographs of children and 50 alternative
counts of possessing indecent photographs of children.
	   He also faces four charges of indecent assault involving a young
girl, and four other charges alleging serious sexual offences
involving a girl.
	   The sex allegations date back as far as 1976.
	   Magistrate Tim Workman ordered Glitter to stand trial at Bristol
Crown Court, western England, where a preliminary hearing will be
held Jan. 18.
	   Glitter, who has sold 18 million records over his 25-year
career, is best known for the rousing song ``Rock 'n' Roll, Part
2,'' played at many sporting events with its characteristic
``Hey!''
	   He was arrested almost a year ago after the technicians
repairing his computer reported finding indecent images on it.

Italian foreign minister contends Ocalan does not meet conditions
</HEADLINE>
for asylum &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy cannot grant Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan political asylum because he is not a victim of persecution,
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini contended in an interview published
Thursday.
	   ``We are talking about terrorist acts committed voluntarily,''
Dini told the Corriere della Sera daily. ``We are not dealing with
a victim.''
	   Italy's Interior Ministry is examining Ocalan's asylum request,
with a decision expected in the coming months.
	   Both Turkey and Germany have issued arrest warrants for Ocalan
on charges of terrorism. But Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan
to Turkey -- where he is the No. 1 fugitive -- because Italian laws
forbids the extradition of suspects to countries where they face
the death penalty, as Ocalan does in Turkey.
	   Turkey is furious over the decision and its people have
protested burning Italian clothes and cars and launched boycotts
against Italian products.
	   Germany is worried about possible violence between its
approximately 2 million Turks and 400,000 Kurds and has said it
won't seek Ocalan's extradition.
	   ``By not asking for Ocalan's extradition, Germany risks damaging
the international fight against terrorism,'' Dini said. He
criticized Germany's decision to issue an arrest warrant and then
fail to ask for extradition as ``incoherent.''
	   Italy's rightist-led opposition has demanded Ocalan's immediate
expulsion.
	   ``That would be backing away from our responsibility in the
fight against terrorism,'' Dini said. Instead, Dini suggested
putting Ocalan on trial in an arbitrarily chosen country, which
could also be Italy.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 when he arrived at the Rome airport
aboard a flight from Moscow. A hardline Communist deputy revealed
Wednesday that he accompanied Ocalan on the flight.
	   The rebel leader is staying in a Rome villa under police
surveillance while he awaits a decision on his asylum request.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
waged a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.

Russia to keep supplying nuclear fuel to Armenia despite
</HEADLINE>
nonpayment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will continue supplying nuclear fuel to
Armenia, even though the Caucasus nation has not paid for previous
deliveries and is unlikely to do so soon, a news report said
Thursday.
	   Russia's Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov said the decision
to keep providing fuel for Armenia's nuclear power plant was
motivated by political reasons.
	   ``The agreement is being concluded because of a political
necessity,'' he told a news conference Wednesday, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency. ``We are strongly persuaded to supply fuel
and receive the payment later,''
	   He did not elaborate, but Moscow enjoys warm relations with the
former Soviet republic.
	   Adamov said he doubted Armenia would pay its nuclear bills on
time, but stressed that ``we will not leave the Armenian plant
without fuel.''
	   The Medzamor nuclear power plant produces 40 percent of the
Armenia's power, and officials have said it is vital for the
country's energy supplies.
	   Russia and Armenia are planning to conclude an agreement for
continued deliveries, Adamov said.
	   The Medzamor plant, located 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of the
capital Yerevan and 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the Turkish
border, has two VVER-440 reactors.

Slovenia names temporary defense minister amid political standoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Drnovsek's quote on Ribic; CLARIFIES she lacks
defense, not military experience &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Premier Janez Drnovsek named a
temporary defense minister Thursday, more than a month after
corruption allegations toppled the former minister in this
NATO-hopeful nation.
	   Drnovsek said Science Minister Lojze Marincek will take the
defense portfolio until politicians name a permanent successor.
	   The former minister, Alojz Krapez, was forced to resign Oct. 20
after opposition leaders revealed he accepted an apartment reserved
for uniformed soldiers.
	   Political parties within the government have been arguing since
over who will replace him.
	   Slovenia, which joined NATO's Partnership for Peace Program
after seceding from Yugoslavia in 1991, hopes to be named a
candidate for NATO enlargement at the organization's summit in
Washington next year.
	   Earlier this week, the Slovene People's Party, the second
largest force in Cabinet, suggested as defense minister Marija
Ribic, who works in the ministry's finance department.
	   But Drnovsek is expected to reject Ribic due to her lack of
experience in the specific defense issues.
	   In an interview with the Slovene daily Dnevnik, which will be
published Saturday, Drnovsek expressed appreciation for Ribic's
``qualities, her knowledge of finance affairs and her expertise''
presented during the recent talks on the 1999 budget.
	   ``But I am not sure that would be enough for her to head this
specific department,'' he said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ This weekend's registration of
millions
	   of voters for South Africa's second all-race elections will be
bumpy but ``good enough,'' election officials predicted Thursday.
	   The blunt assessment by the Independent Electoral Commission
came as troubles were already surfacing in preparations for the
registration of the country's 25 million potential voters _ the
first time voter lists have been established in South Africa's
history.
	   Some civil servants who are supposed to register voters for the
1999 elections have not appeared for training. Leaflets telling of
the registration dates and procedures haven't been distributed to
all households as planned. And some voter registration equipment
has disappeared, said chief electoral officer Mandla Mchunu.
	   Mchunu called for patience, saying election officials were
feeling their way.
	   ``It's a maiden voyage for them,'' he told a news conference.
``They've got to learn to deal with problems.''
	   In a statement, the IEC said, ``We believe that the registration
process will not be perfect, but it will be good enough.''
	   The National Party, which ruled during apartheid, threw a
potential monkey wrench into the works when it announced Thursday
it will go to court to make it easier for mostly white South
Africans to register. The governing African National Congress
blasted the plan.
	   The government and the IEC have decreed that South Africans can
only use the latest generation of identity cards, which have a
computer bar code, to register and vote.
	   Most blacks rushed to convert their restrictive apartheid-era
documents with the fall of white minority rule, so a greater
proportion of blacks have new cards than whites, the National
Party's main support base.
	   The party wants apartheid-era IDs also to be valid to register
and will seek a hearing on the matter in Cape Town High Court,
party leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk told reporters in the
southwestern city.
	   The ANC accused the National Party of being ``entangled in its
apartheid past.''
	   ``We have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of South
Africans will not allow Mickey Mouse parties to undermine, or even
attempt to derail, the democratic process,'' the ANC said in a
statement.

statement.

Body of Marcos-era general brought back to Manila

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The body of one of the most powerful
generals under the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos was brought back
to Manila Thursday on its way to burial with military honors,
despite protests from human rights groups.
	   Relatives and friends, led by Marcos' widow, Imelda, sobbed as
the casket containing the body of Gen. Fabian Ver was lowered from
a Lufthansa plane and brought to a nearby air force lounge.
	   The body was to be displayed at the lounge overnight and then
flown to Ver's hometown of Sarrat in northern Ilocos Norte province
for burial Sunday.
	   Ver died last Saturday of lung malfunction at a hospital in
Bangkok.
	   He had been linked to widespread human rights violations and to
the 1983 assassination of anti-Marcos opposition leader Benigno
Aquino Jr.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who was among the thousands
imprisoned by Marcos during his 20-year rule, said Ver would be
accorded military honors as a former soldier.
	   ``We are not in any way acquitting him,'' said Mercado. ``We are
just burying him.''
	   Mercado said the burial salute would include three volleys of
gunfire and the playing of drums.
	   Under Marcos, Ver headed the presidential security force before
being appointed as the president's chief of staff.
	   He fled with the Marcos family to Hawaii after the strongman was
ousted in the military-backed ``people power'' revolt in February
1986. After four months, he left Hawaii and hid for eight years in
several countries including Germany, Austria and Singapore before
proceeding to Thailand, where he stayed for the last four years.
	   Former Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos had banned the
return of Ver and his three sons on grounds they posed a security
threat.
	   President Joseph Estrada, however, had lifted the ban on Ver on
condition that he face the charges against him.
	   Ver left behind his wife Aida, three sons and two daughters. He
also has two daughters from his common-law wife Edna Camcam, who
was present at his death bed.
	   Ver underwent lung surgery last year and a gall bladder
operation early this year, which may have led to a deterioration of
his health.
	   One of the last images of Ver seen by Filipinos was at the
height of the 1986 revolt when he was urging Marcos during a live
television broadcast to give the order to bomb mutinous troops
holed up in two suburban camps surrounded by hundreds of thousands
of civilian supporters.
	   Ver, a childhood friend of Marcos, rose from the rank of private
to four-star general in his four decades in the military.
	   He was accused of involvement in the assassination of Aquino,
Mrs. Aquino's husband, at Manila's airport but was acquitted while
Marcos was still in power.
	   After Mrs. Aquino took office, the Supreme Court ordered a new
trial in which 16 soldiers were convicted of killing her husband.
Ver, who was accused as an accomplice, was not tried in absentia
and the case against him was shelved.
	   The trial failed to determine who ordered the killing.

Israeli troops, Palestinians clash in three West Bank locations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with clash in third location over Israeli building of
road, report Hamas planned series of bombings over prisoner issue. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers shot rubber-coated
bullets into a crowd of about 100 Palestinians who threw stones at
their outpost during a demonstration today to demand freedom for
Palestinian prisoners.
	   One Palestinian was wounded in the leg, and another was struck
in the arm. Both were taken away in private cars to a hospital.
	   About 500 people marched through Jenin to an office where
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police coordinate security. The
protesters walked behind a white banner showing prisoners' hands
chained and bleeding. ``No peace without release of all
prisoners,'' it said.
	   More than 2,500 Palestinians are in Israeli jails, and the issue
is sensitive among Palestinians, many of whom spent time in jail or
had relatives jailed during the three-decade occupation by Israel.
	   Also today, Jewish settlers in the divided West Bank town of
Hebron blocked Palestinian school children heading out for a field
trip, touching off scuffles, witnesses said.
	   The confrontation began when 6- to 14-year-olds from Kurtouba
Preparatory School gathered to board a bus to Jerusalem.
Palestinian witnesses said about 20 settlers from nearby Beit
Haddasah enclave began pushing the girls back into the school.
	   Ofir Sivan, spokesman for Israeli police in the West Bank
district, said the scuffle broke out after 40 students led by their
principal, Firial Abu Hekal, refused orders to end a protest.
	   Five girls were carried away in Palestinian ambulances after
fainting, and the hospital later reported 12 were seen by doctors
but none suffered lasting injury.
	   Israeli police said they detained four Palestinians, including
the school principal and a student, for questioning.
	   In the Burkin village near Qalqiliya, about 2,000 Palestinians
and about 15 Israeli peace activists protested the building of a
road linking an Israeli settlement with an industrial estate.
	   The demonstrators blocked the road and stopped the bulldozers
briefly. The Palestinian protesters threw stones, and Israeli
troops responded by firing in the air and lobbing tear gas to
disperse the crowd. During the clash in Jenin, an Israeli soldier
could be seen on a tower inside the compound, alternately ducking
and shooting.
	   Palestinian police looked on from their post inside the joint
compound but did not get involved in the confrontation. After
warnings from Israeli officers, Palestinian security police arrived
a half-hour after the violence began to persuade protesters to pull
back.
	   The Jenin demonstration was organized by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's political faction, Fatah.
	   In recent weeks, there have been a series of Palestinian
protests lobbying for the release of security prisoners held by
Israel.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January. Palestinians complained that
most of the 250 prisoners freed in the first phase were common
criminals, not political activists.
	   ``Free the fighters, not the criminals,'' the protesters
shouted.
	   Awad Kenami said his son Ahmed, 37, a founder of the Black
Panther faction that fought Israeli occupation, was jailed two
months after the Oslo peace agreement was signed in September 1993.
	   ``My son was a soldier in a war led by Yasser Arafat; now Yasser
Arafat is a leader of peace, and so my son and his comrades must be
freed as soldiers for peace,'' Kenami said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not
release prisoners with ``blood on their hands'' or members of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, which has rejected the peace process.
	   The daily Haaretz newspaper said that a slain Hamas leader, Adel
Awadallah, had planned to set off a series of five car bombs in
major Israeli cities before he was killed by the army last Sept.
10.
	   The newspaper said that according to information found in his
hideout, and which had been held up by military censorship,
Awadallah planned to set off a car bomb and then demand Israel free
all Palestinian prisoners. Hamas also planned to attack senior
political figures, the report said.

Two Ukrainian officers and student poisoned to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A drinking bout in the western region of
Lviv ended with the deaths of two army officers and a college
student, apparently from tainted alcohol, a newspaper said
Thursday.
	   The two officers were missing from their communications unit
this week, and soldiers were sent to one of their apartments in the
village of Starychi near the Polish border, the newspaper Fakty
said.
	   The soldiers discovered the dead bodies of Capt. Eduard
Gudovsky, 30, Lt. Maxym Bozhenko, 24, and 18-year-old student
Kostiantyn Belykh, Fakty said.
	   The three were still seated around a table with a bottle of
vodka on it, the report said. Investigators believe the men were
poisoned by the drink, Fakty added.
	   President Leonid Kuchma said last month that a quarter of all
alcoholic drinks sold in Ukraine are either smuggled or illegally
produced, and many are tainted.

Israeli opposition leader rejects call to join a unity government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's opposition leader on Thursday rejected
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported attempts to coax him
into joining a unity government, vowing he would never become part
of such a ``terrible'' administration.
	   Cabinet ministers in Netanyahu's Likud party are reaching out to
their Labor rivals in a scramble to save the premier's shaky
coalition, Israeli media reported. The six-party alliance has been
on the verge of collapse since Israel handed another chunk of West
Bank land last week to the Palestinians.
	   Two members of the coalition voted against implementing the Wye
summit agreement, leaving Netanyahu with a questionable majority in
the 120-seat Knesset.
	   ``The Labor Party will not join a national unity government,''
party head Ehud Barak said on Israel Radio. ``We will not be a part
of this terrible government.''
	   If his right-wing ministers bolt, Netanyahu would be left
without a majority in parliament and thus vulnerable in
no-confidence motions. Netanyahu will face tests on Tuesday when an
early elections bill is scheduled to come up and again in December
when he presents the annual budget.
	   In an intensive effort to save his government, Netanyahu struck
a tentative deal Wednesday with moderate David Levy, who had
resigned this year from his post as foreign minister.
	   Levy, who controls three Knesset seats, is likely to return as
minister of infrastructure. His rejoining would give Netanyahu
control of 64 seats, enough to defeat an early elections bill
without the support of the extreme right-wing Moledet party.
	   Despite Barak's continued statements that he would not lead
Labor into a union with Likud, Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister
and head of the Labor party, said a merging of bipartisan political
forces is the only way a final peace deal can be clinched.
	   ``I don't think we can reach a final settlement with only one
party. In order to reach a final settlement, we need both parties,
and the two parties need to understand that,'' Peres said in an
interview with Israel Radio.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, one of a trio of ministers
pushing for a national unity government, said Netanyahu's desire to
bring Labor into the fold is genuine and that the prime minister
would appeal to Labor directly on his return from Europe next week,
the daily Yediot Ahronot said.
	   Both Sharon and Netanyahu canceled trips in order to deal with
the coalition crisis. Sharon had been set to go to Washington, and
Netanyahu backed-out of the Swiss portion of a three-country
European tour.

Aoki, Marsh share lead in Japan Senior Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SADOHARA, Japan (AP) _ Defending champion Isao Aoki and
Australian Graham Marsh shot 7-under-par 65s Thursday and shared a
three-stroke lead in the first round of the 50 million yen (dlrs
417,000) Japan PGA Senior Open.
	   Aoki, seeking his second senior title this season, scored an
eagle and five birdies on the 6,754-yard (6,146-meter), par-72 Ube
Country Club course.
	   The 56-year-old Aoki, winner of the BellSouth Senior Classic in
June in Nashville, Tennessee, is in contention for his 74th career
victory.
	   Marsh, seeking his first senior title and 26th overall in Japan,
sank seven birdies, including three straight from the 10th hole, in
another bogey-free round.
	   Fumio Tanaka turned in a 68, followed by Taiwan's Hsieh Min-nan,
who carded a 69 and was alone in fourth.
	   Seiichi Kanai, winner of the Japan PGA Senior Championship last
month, shot a 71 for a share of fifth with seven others.

Russia asks U.S. to restore guards at ambassador's residence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has asked the United States to reinstate
guards at the residence of Russia's ambassador in Washington,
saying the decision to remove them threatened security, an official
said Thursday.
	   The U.S. government removed a police post from the Russian
ambassador's residence on Nov. 16, Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said. He mentioned no reason for the
decision.
	   The same day the guards were removed, the embassy asked the U.S.
State Department to reinstate the post, saying it was ``needed both
to maintain an adequate level of security and prevent the possible
undesirable penetration of the residence by strangers,'' Rakhmanin
said.
	   ``We count on the American side to regard our demarche with due
attention,'' Rakhmanin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.

	   --
	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ About 100 doctors at southern
Africa's biggest hospital protested Thursday against criminal
attacks on staff at the hospital.
	   About 100 placard-bearing doctors and other medical staff
gathered outside Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital to hand a
memorandum demanding action to a representative of provincial
Safety and Security Minister Paul Mashatile and other officials.
	   Ten doctors have been held up in the hospital in the past two
months, hundreds of staff members' cars have been stolen from the
parking lot and their goods snatched from their hands in hospital
corridoors, Dr. Beverley Traub said.
	   The doctors called on hospital security personnel, police and
government and the Soweto community to ensure their safety at the
hospital.
	   Some of the placards read: ``Dead doctors don't save lives,''
and ``Stop biting the hand that heals you.''

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Representatives of Pfizer Inc.
joined Ivorian
	   medical experts in launching the anti-impotency drug Viagra in
the Ivory Coast, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Viagra's merits and side effects and potential risks were
discussed in an
	   animated question and answer session with journalists and
members of the public on Wednesday, French-language daily Le Jour
reported.
	   After all the publicity over the drug's benefits, Pfizer's
regional head Vincent Noel underlined the drug's potential dangers
if not used under a doctor's supervision.
	   ``Self-medication is strictly forbidden,'' he was quoted as
saying in Le Jour.
	   In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration on
Tuesday added more explicit warnings to Viagra's label. Of
particular concern is the use of
	   Viagra by men with pre-existing medical conditions that may
increase the risk of heart attacks or strokes.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Hoping to help Africans lead their
continent from poverty and strife to development and stability, a
Kenyan peacemaker on Thursday launched the African Renaissance
Institute.
	   Washington Okumu, a Harvard-educated political activist who
mediated differences that blocked South Africa's first democratic
elections in 1994, said the institute based in Gaborone, Botswana,
would issue its first paper next month.
	   ``The ARI is designed to serve as a vehicle for Africa's
thinkers, researchers and development workers ... who are motivated
by the quest for Africa's survival, recovery and sustainable
development,'' said Okumu.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The European Commission said Thursday it
has pledged dlrs 10 million in aid to prevent a food shortage in
southern Somalia.
	   Lutz Saizmann, EC chief in Kenya, said the World Food Program
will distribute food purchased by the EC, including 9,130 tons of
cereals, 1,000 tons beans and 559 tons of vegetable oil.
	   Food supplies have been dwindling in southern Somalia due to
fighting and the effects of El Nino floods last year.
	   The report said the latest harvest yielded less than half the
expected output, the worst in a series of poor harvests.
	   Somalia has had no central government since late dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 by a coalition of rebels who
later turned against each other, splitting the country into
fiefdoms protected by clan militias.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ended a rancorous year-end meeting
Thursday without even a minimum agreement to extend oil production
cuts, saying it would review the situation again in March.
	   OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman said the organization will
take whatever measures are necessary at that time to try to boost
oil prices, but there will be no policy changes in the meantime.
	   The reason for the failure to take action wasn't immediately
announced, but the official meeting already had been pushed back
from Wednesday because of the internal split.
	   Analysts had said that extending production cuts to the end of
1999 was the bare minimum action needed to prop up rock-bottom oil
prices, flirting with 12-year lows.
	   Some delegates had voiced hope a 2.6 million barrel-a-day cut
that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries set in
June to run for six months could be extended to the end of 1999.
	   OPEC did decide to realign its annual meeting schedule, and will
meet from now on in March and September rather than June and
November, its secretary-general said afterward.
	   Cartel president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, who also is the
United Arab Emirates' oil minister, acknowledged in an opening
speech to delegates that a ``strong bearish sentiment has set in''
on the world market.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng birdied the last
three holes Thursday for a 7-under-par 64 and took a two-stroke
first-round lead in the U.S. dlrs 300,000 Perrier Hong Kong Open
Golf Championship.
	   American John Daly, the 1991 PGA Championship winner, Hong
Kong's Brad Schadewitz and Taiwan's Wang Ter-chang, the 1992
Philippines Open winner, were tied for second at 66.
	   The 36-year-old Hsieh, who won the Hong Kong title in 1988, shot
seven birdies in all on the 6,727-yard, par-71 Composite Course of
the Hong Kong Golf Club.
	   ``I am quite familiar with the course, having played here many
times,'' he said.
	   Daly, playing in Hong Kong for the first time, eagled the 12th
hole in his 5-under round.
	   ``Everything is going right for me,'' said Daly, winner of the
1995 British Open.
	   ``It was one of those days when you know that everything is
going to fall in place,'' he added.
	   In fifth place was Ecuadorian Rafel Ponce, who had a 67.
	   Defending champion Frank Nobilo of New Zealand shot a one-under
70 and was tied for 26th with 15 other players.

Court turns down Allied POWs compensation suit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from British prime minister's office &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Thursday rejected a demand for
compensation by a group of Allied soldiers and civilians held
prisoner by Japanese troops during World War II.
	   The lawsuit was filed in January 1995 by seven plaintiffs on
behalf of 20,000 members of veteran and civilian ex-prisoner
organizations from Britain, the United States, Australia and New
Zealand.
	   The decision was the first handed down in Japan in a legal suit
brought by former World War II POWs from Allied countries. The
plaintiffs said they would appeal.
	   The seven were outraged. One, Arthur Titherington of Britain,
said he left the court in anger and spit at two entrances of the
nearby Japanese Parliament.
	   ``That's how I feel about them,'' he said of Japanese leaders.
``I worked like a slave. ... I want compensation.''
	   The plaintiffs demanded dlrs 22,000 each for what they claimed
were violations of their rights under international treaties and
conventions on the treatment of war prisoners. The total claim was
for dlrs 440 million.
	   The court ruled that the issue was resolved in 1951 with the
signing of the San Francisco peace treaty.
	   Presiding Judge Shigeki Inoue said in his verdict that because
of the 1951 treaty, individuals or groups could not seek
compensation from the government. He said compensation issues must
be dealt with on the government-to-government level.
	   Japan forced POWs to work in shipyards, mines and jungles in
violation of international law. They were also beaten and some were
executed. The POWs' death rate at the Japanese camps was 27
percent, compared to a 4 percent rate at Allied camps.
	   A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Martin Day, said the ruling _ and
the court's refusal to consider testimony of the suffering his
clients endured _ were an insult to the former prisoners.
	   ``We have received a judgment that has been a kick in the
teeth,'' Day told reporters. ``I think the Japanese court today
should be ashamed of itself.''
	   Day said the plaintiffs were willing to take the case to the
Japanese Supreme Court. Gilbert Hair, representing the American
former prisoners, said his group was also considering suing for
compensation for slave labor under an international labor treaty
signed by the Japanese in the 1930s.
	   Hair said the plaintiffs could also try to sue their own
governments for compensation, arguing that those governments did
not do enough to further the former prisoners' cause, but he said
he would rather be compensated by the Japanese.
	   In London, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said, ``We understand the disappointment of those who brought the
case. We never forget their suffering and sacrifice.
	   ``But we can't comment on a judicial decision,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The government's
position remains as it has been throughout that the issue of
compensation was settled under the Treaty of 1951.''

Saudi Arabia deepens old dispute with Thais, pulls out of games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with live broadcast won't be affected, 12th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from
the Asian Games left organizers scrambling Thursday to change
schedules and Thai diplomats mulling a decade of relations strained
by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats.
	   Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the
Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign
Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its
105-strong team. The games open Dec. 6.
	   ``We're not sure if this is related to the Saudi jewel
scandal,'' Bhichai told Thai radio. ``But regardless, we should not
mix sports with politics.''
	   In a letter to the Thai prime minister's office, reported
Thursday by Bangkok newspapers, Saudi sports authorities cited the
looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan and national centenary
celebrations as reasons for suddenly pulling out.
	   But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason was the
continued strain in relations since a Thai janitor stole precious
jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and fled home.
	   Thai police recovered the jewels and returned them, but many
were fakes _ leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers
and members of Thailand's power elite kept the loot. The real
jewels have never been recovered.
	   Tensions were aggravated in 1990 and 1991, when three Saudi
diplomats were murdered in Bangkok. In retaliation, the Saudis
barred new Thai guest workers and refused to renew the visas of the
thousands already in the desert kingdom. The killings remain
unsolved.
	   Saudi Arabia has said relations would be normalized only when
the two cases were solved.
	   Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said it would be
understandable if Saudi Arabia pulls out because of Ramadan
fasting.
	   ``If there is any other reason behind this, such as the jewelry
case and the murders, we will regret it very much because sports
should be separated from politics,'' Kobsak said.
	   Organizers noted that 10 other Muslim nations are sending teams.
Suggestions were made that in the future, the Olympic Council of
Asia should consider punishing last-minute withdrawals.
	   Organizers need to hold new draws for both handball and
basketball because of the pullout, but said the live television
coverage schedule will not be affected.
	   The withdrawal is expected to cost 30 million baht (dlrs
830,000) to cover the committee's expenses for organizing programs,
accommodation and television schedules.
	   They said they would consult with the council, which oversees
the organization of the games, about the impact of the Saudi
withdrawal.
	   Officials, meanwhile, expressed shock over a brawl that erupted
Tuesday during a friendly soccer match between Thailand and Qatar.
	   The scoreless match was suspended without further play after
players from both sides kicked, punched and body-slammed each other
for about 10 minutes. Several suffered light injuries.
	   ``As a host, surely the melee will have an impact on the image
and reputation of Thailand,'' said Santiparb Tejavanija, chairman
of the administrative committee. ``Nobody wanted that incident to
happen.''
	   Officials said that forgiveness was a better option than
punishment and that both sides would be admonished not to let a
repeat brawl occur.

for her family since her husband was killed in the terrorist
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya on Aug. 7.
	   ``Well-wishers and friends have been helping us, but as time
goes on, they are giving less and less,'' Mutinda said.
	   The Red Cross, in a first distribution, gave food Thursday to
100 families who lost a breadwinner in the blast, which killed 213
people, including a dozen Americans. Another 11 people were killed
in a nearly simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania.
	   U.S. authorities believe Osama bin Laden, Saudi exile and
militant Muslim, masterminded the bombings. Three alleged
co-conspirators are already jailed in New York.
	   All families who lost a relative in the bombing, regardless of
their economic status, will receive food from the Red Cross for the
next eight months.
	   ``Most of these families are desperate,'' said Marion Weigel of
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies.
	   Each family received 40 kilograms (90 pounds) of rice, 4
kilograms (10 pounds) of beans, and 2 kilograms (5 pounds) of
cooking oil. The next parcels will be provided in two weeks, Weigel
said.
	   Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow said in the aftermath of the
bombing, needs have only intensified.
	   Among families that lost breadwinners, some are now homeless, he
said. Many of the more than 5,400 people wounded in the blast still
need surgery, which they cannot afford. Some need training to
adjust to being sightless or maimed.
	   ``We are not going to fix their problems today or next week or
next month,'' Sparrow said. ``We will need ongoing vigilance and
commitment.''
	   The Kenya Red Cross, supported by the federation, already is
helping people who need surgery and care that is beyond their
means, providing training to people with disabilities, and ensuring
orphans have money to continue their educations.
	   The Red Cross aims to help 1,000 people in the next year.
	   Kenya Red Cross official Wambui Kairo said initially friends and
relatives generously supported bombing victims, but more than three
months later they are attending to their own needs, many of which
are severe in Kenya's steadily worsening economy.
	   ``You can give for only so long if you have, and if you don't
have, you can't give,'' Kairo said.
	   Mutinda said she's right _ even the church where her husband was
an elder has begun to lose interest.
	   ``From next month, I don't know how I will pay the rent,'' the
housewife said.
	   Mutinda is unwilling to touch the 100,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs
1,670) in death benefits she has stashed in the bank, although she
is due to collect another 300,000 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 5,000).
	   ``It is a lot of money, but not if you don't know where your
next money is coming from,'' the widow said.

OPEC meeting ends in rancor; no agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quote in grafs 6-7; CLARIFIES in 5th graf
that June agreement runs for one year sted 6 months &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ended a rancorous year-end meeting
Thursday without even a minimum agreement to extend oil production
cuts, saying it would review the situation again in March.
	   OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman said the organization will
take whatever measures are necessary at that time to try to boost
oil prices, but there will be no policy changes in the meantime.
	   The reason for the failure to take action wasn't immediately
announced, but the official meeting already had been pushed back
from Wednesday because of the internal split.
	   Analysts had said that extending production cuts to the end of
1999 was the bare minimum action needed to prop up rock-bottom oil
prices, flirting with 12-year lows.
	   Some delegates had voiced hope a 2.6 million barrel-a-day cut
that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries set in
June to run for one year could be extended six months to the end of
1999.
	   ``We have already got an agreement, you know,'' Lukman said.
``In March we will decide what to do.''
	   ``There's no question of the need to reduce'' output, he said.
But when pressed on the issue, he said output levels were a
question of opinion, and refused to elaborate.
	   OPEC did decide to realign its annual meeting schedule, and will
meet from now on in March and September rather than June and
November, its secretary-general said afterward.
	   Cartel president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, who also is the
United Arab Emirates' oil minister, acknowledged in an opening
speech to delegates that a ``strong bearish sentiment has set in''
on the world market.

ING net profit rises, but banking results dented by global
</HEADLINE>
financial crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch banking and insurance
combine ING Group NV said Thursday its nine-month net profit rose
42 percent, but its banking results were slashed by global
financial woes.
	   Net profit for the nine months ending Sept. 30 came to 4.86
billion guilders (dlrs 2.56 billion), up from 3.43 billion guilders
(dlrs 1.8 billion) in the same period a year ago.
	   But non-recurring items contributed 1.34 billion guilders (dlrs
705 million) to ING's total profit increase. Excluding these items,
net profit rose only by 2.9 percent to 3.53 billion guilders (dlrs
1.85 billion).
	   The company reiterated its full-year expectation, saying that
1998 earnings per share will be 15 percent higher from last year's
figure.
	   Pretax profit from its banking operations dropped 9.6 percent to
2.10 billion guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion), from 2.32 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.22 billion). ING said if non-recurring sales
results were excluded, profit would have decreased by 35 percent.
	   The sharp drop was caused entirely by losses in the third
quarter due to the worldwide financial crisis, said the company in
a statement.
	   ING's insurance arm fared better. Pretax profit rose 70.3
percent to 4.24 billion guilders (dlrs 2.23 billion), up from 2.49
billion guilders (dlrs 1.31 billion).
	   But excluding non-recurring items, such as one-off sales
profits, the operational result rose by 31.8 percent.

Neighbors provide first comfort after train wreck
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With India-Train Accident &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ ``Cut off my legs! Cut off my hands! Just
save me.''
	   The pathetic shriek came from a passenger _ one of many _
trapped in the wreckage hours after an express train collided
Thursday with the toppled cars of another train that had derailed
moments before in rural northwest India.
	   Daylight was still hours away when neighbors arrived at the
crash site, where at least 86 people were killed and 250 wounded
among the 1,700 passengers on the two trains.
	   The townspeople of Khanna, a wheat marketing town five
kilometers (three miles) away, were among the first to reach the
site of the crash.
	   ``My neighbors and I rushed there immediately,'' said Shiv
Kumar, who sells bathroom fittings. ``I took three flasks of tea
and 50 loaves of bread.''
	   ``Our first priority was to rescue people. And they needed
comfort.'' Many residents took off their sweaters or shawls and
offered them to passengers, many of whom were dressed in night
clothes or had lost their belongings.
	   ``I saw one woman still trapped inside. Her legs are dangling
from the compartment, but they are not able to rescue her because
the compartment is at the bottom,'' Kumar told The Associated Press
by telephone.
	   Kumar joined hundreds of others in pulling out people from the
coaches. Volunteers took them to hospitals in cars, motorscooters
and tractors, or tried to help them find their families.
	   ``I found one boy crying in the Frontier Mail. His father,
mother and sister were in another compartment, in the front. He was
at the back and escaped unhurt.''
	   Kumar drove the 13-year-old Sunil Gupta to three hospitals in
nearby towns. ``We couldn't find his relatives. I brought him back
to the government hospital in Khanna. Maybe they will show up.''

Officials seek strategy to cut rising youth drug abuse
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Youth drug abuse continues to rise in
Southeast Asia despite legal crackdowns, threatening the ``fabric
of society,'' officials at a regional anti-drug conference said
Thursday.
	   They urged a cooperative global effort that would incorporate
young people's views and encourage alternative healthy activities.
	   ``Undoubtedly, drug abuse is extremely dangerous to the survival
of a nation, and it may even endanger mankind in general,'' said a
paper presented by Bersama, an Indonesian umbrella group of
anti-drug organizations.
	   ``Drug trafficking has such a huge criminal network that they
have the ability to impose their will on society. Drug abuse is not
merely a single problem; it is always associated with other aspects
of life, such as health, security and socio-economy.''
	   Maria-Pia de Palo, program officer for the U.N. Drug Control
Program's Regional Center for East Asia and the Pacific, said the
biggest rise has been in synthetic drugs, including
amphetamine-type stimulants like Ecstasy.
	   ``There are also disturbing indications that young people are
increasingly being exposed to a popular youth culture and mass
media messages that are more tolerant toward the use of certain
illicit drugs,'' she said.
	   De Palo said youths must be involved in seeking solutions.
	   ``Young people are usually considered a target population and
sometimes even a problem instead of a resource in the prevention of
drug abuse,'' she said. ``It is fundamental that their voices be
heard in the attempt to raise awareness among their peers, policy
makers and the public at large.''
	   In recent years, Vietnam, Indonesia and other countries have
stiffened their penalties for drug abuse and trafficking. In
Vietnam, 34 people were sentenced to death for drug trafficking in
the first eight months of the year.
	   ``The government of Vietnam is deeply concerned that drug abuse
continues to be more and more serious, particularly among young
people, which endangers ... the fabric of society and erodes
cultural values and the family,'' Le Minh Huong of the Ministry of
Public Security said in an opening speech.
	   Despite such efforts, drug addiction continues to rise,
particularly among the young.
	   ``National efforts are important but not enough,'' said a paper
by the Secretariat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
``There should also be concerted efforts at the regional and
international levels with a global approach and participation of
all sectors in the societies.''
	   Not every country has seen increases.
	   Singapore said its number of drug-abuse arrests has declined
since peaking in 1994 and that youths comprise only 6.8 percent of
all drug abusers.
	   It credited a number of initiatives, including a high-profile
campaign introduced in 1995 that is launched each year with a
variety of concerts featuring popular local and international stars
espousing anti-drug messages.
	   ``The annual campaign aims to raise the awareness of the general
public toward the detrimental social and economic effects of drug
abuse, and to introduce alternative healthy lifestyles to our
youths,'' a paper from the island nation said.

	   CAMP DOHA, Kuwait (AP) _ The 300 turkeys and the pecan and
pumpkin pies were flown in from home, but for many of the 2,500
U.S. soldiers in the Kuwaiti desert, the most import part of the
Thanksgiving meal - family - was missing.
	   ``It really doesn't seem like Thanksgiving because you are away
from the people you love,'' said Sgt. Robert Moore, 34, of
Valdosta, Georgia.
	   U.S. troops are celebrating Thanksgiving Thursday with elaborate
meals in the mess hall of this camp 12 kilometers (8 miles) north
of Kuwait City.
	   Several hundred of the soldiers are based in the camp to
maintain the armor and artillery that the United States keeps there
to be used in the event of an Iraqi attack. The rest are in Kuwait
to take part in routine war games.
	   ``It's depressing,'' Pfc. Mick Rasband, of Pleasant Grove, Utah,
said as he stood in line to fill his tray.
	   Rasband said the food was appreciated after months of exercises
in the barren desert.
	   But, he added, ``it's different when you're not home.''
	   The meal featured alcohol-free eggnog, but there was no beer or
wine. Alcohol is banned in this traditional Muslim country.
	   Maj. Anita McCarthy-McGee, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was
looking on the bright side of her sixth holiday far from home and
her six-year-old son.
	   ``I think of it as six turkeys I didn't have to cook,'' she
joked.

Taiwan blames bungling for failure to allow Horta entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's Foreign Ministry on Thursday
blamed ``administrative negligence'' for an incident in which Nobel
Peace Prize winner Josi Ramos-Horta was left stranded at the
airport for hours after being refused entry.
	   Opposition supporters alleged the incident Wednesday night was
politically motivated.
	   Ramos-Horta is an advocate of independence for
Indonesian-controlled East Timor, and newspapers reported Taiwan
had formerly barred him to avoid antagonizing Indonesia.
	   But Ramos-Horta's previous persona non grata status had been
ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in August, leaving no reason
why he should have been refused entry by airport immigration when
he came to town Wednesday night, ministry spokesman Roy Wu told a
news conference.
	   ``This incident accentuated the problem with administrative
relations, it needs to be improved. ... It's a fact,'' Wu told a
news conference.
	   Ramos-Horta had a rough time Wednesday night. Immigration
officials would not let him in, then he tried to catch a flight out
but missed the plane. Eventually, the Foreign Ministry intervened
and let Ramos-Horta enter Taiwan. He went only as far as the
airport hotel.
	   Conflicting reports indicate Ramos-Horta was stuck at the
airport for between four and seven hours. Ramos-Horta was carrying
a Portuguese passport, which should have permitted him visa-free
entry to Taiwan for up to 14 days, newspapers said.
	   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party alleged Ramos-Horta
had been refused entry because he planned to speak on behalf of
Chen Shui-bian's campaign to be re-elected as mayor of Taipei. Chen
is Taiwan's most prominent DPP politician.
	   ``This sort of incident shows that Taiwan is just not qualified
to be called a democratic nation,'' DPP Secretary-General Chiu
Yi-jen told a news conference.
	   Ramos-Horta sought to play down the incident before leaving town
Thursday.
	   ``I don't want to make a big problem out of it. I have been to
many countries. The only countries that don't allow me in would be
countries like Iraq, Iran,'' he told reporters before catching an
afternoon flight to attend a conference in Australia.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian
claims to East Timor.

Number of registered HIV cases in Russia reaches 10,283
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 3,250 new cases of HIV have been
registered in Russia this year, and 90 percent of those who
contracted the virus were intravenous drug users, the health
minister said Thursday.
	   The new cases bring the total number of people with HIV in
Russia to 10,283, including 418 children, Health Minister Vladimir
Starodubov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   More than 220 Russians have died of AIDS since the disease was
first detected here in 1987, including 77 children, Starodubov
said.
	   Russian officials warn that the actual number of HIV cases may
be up to 10 times higher, as Russia still lacks comprehensive
diagnostic and treatment programs.
	   While this year's figure appear to mark a decrease in new HIV
cases from 1997, when 4,300 new cases were registered, Starodubov
warned that the virus may spread faster in the next few years if
living standards continue to decline, bringing a rise in drug use
and prostitution.
	   Officials say more than 90 percent of people testing positive
for HIV are intravenous drug users who have caught the virus
through infected syringes.

Horses of Iran's equestrian team withdrawn from competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Horses belonging to Iran's equestrian
team will not be allowed to compete in next month's Asian Games
because they failed to meet the requirements of the games'
veterinary commission, the Thai organizers announced Thursday.
	   The three horses originally came from Iran, but arrived in
Thailand after a training period in the United States.
	   They did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing
that they are disease-free, said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of
the Veterinary Commission for the games.
	   This is the first Asian Games in which competitors have been
allowed to bring their own horses from abroad.
	   According to regulations, all participating horses had to be
screened for a number of diseases before arriving in Thailand.
	   Siraya said she felt sorry for the Iranian team because the
problem resulted from ignorance of the rules. Iran is the only
country that did not pass the requirements.
	   ``They are the most beautiful horses of all,'' she said. ``I am
so sorry for the team but cannot allow them to compete because it
is against the rules and it might affect other horses' good
health.''
	   There is only one Thai horse available on standby for the
Iranians, as Thailand was not prepared for such a problem, Siraya
said.
	   ``If the Iranian team can borrow a couple of more horses from
other participating countries, they still can compete,'' she said.
	   There are 106 horses and 12 countries participating in the
equestrian events.
	   Most of the horses actually come from Europe and the United
States. Thailand has provided a climate-controlled stable and field
cleared of contaminants to help the horses become acclimatized to
the tropical heat before the competition begins Dec. 8.
	   Many of the horses are suffering stress from the journey here,
but those from Asian countries are adjusting faster than those from
cold countries, Siraya said.

OPEC meeting ends in rancor; no agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quote in grafs 6-7; CLARIFIES in 5th graf
that June agreement runs for one year sted 6 months. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC ended a rancorous year-end meeting
Thursday without even a minimum agreement to extend oil production
cuts, saying it would review the situation again in March.
	   OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman said the organization will
take whatever measures are necessary at that time to try to boost
oil prices, but there will be no policy changes in the meantime.
	   The reason for the failure to take action wasn't immediately
announced, but the official meeting already had been pushed back
from Wednesday because of the internal split.
	   Analysts had said that extending production cuts to the end of
1999 was the bare minimum action needed to prop up rock-bottom oil
prices, flirting with 12-year lows.
	   Some delegates had voiced hope a 2.6 million barrel-a-day cut
that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries set in
June to run for one year could be extended six months to the end of
1999.
	   ``We have already got an agreement, you know,'' Lukman said.
``In March we will decide what to do.''
	   ``There's no question of the need to reduce'' output, he said.
But when pressed on the issue, he said output levels were a
question of opinion, and refused to elaborate.
	   OPEC did decide to realign its annual meeting schedule, and will
meet from now on in March and September rather than June and
November, its secretary-general said afterward.
	   Cartel president Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, who also is the
United Arab Emirates' oil minister, acknowledged in an opening
speech to delegates that a ``strong bearish sentiment has set in''
on the world market.

Lawmakers seeks formal complaint over abuse toward news crew in
</HEADLINE>
Chile &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Labor Party lawmaker has urged Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook to lodge a formal complaint about an attack on a British
Broadcasting Corp. news crew reporting on Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
legal saga in the Chilean capital of Santiago.
	   BBC correspondent Ben Brown, his producer and his cameraman were
dragged into a building and kicked and punched by up to 100 people
Wednesday, shortly after Britain's highest court ruled that
Pinochet had no immunity from arrest on Spanish charges of murder,
torture and genocide.
	   Brown said the assailants were supporters of Pinochet, Chile's
former dictator. He said he and the two members of his crew were
bruised and badly shaken, but not seriously injured.
	   Lawmaker Ben Bradshaw, a former BBC reporter, wrote to Cook
asking him to file a formal complaint with the Chilean ambassador
to Britain.
	   At no stage did authorities intervene to help the three men,
Bradshaw said Thursday.
	   ``This is quite unacceptable in a country that calls itself a
democracy,'' he said. ``I imagine there is plenty of evidence on
film so that the perpetrators of this violence can be brought to
justice.''
	   The Foreign Office said it would have no immediate comment on
Bradshaw's request.

Hong Kong Telecom agrees to new pay plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After months of wrangling with management, Hong
Kong Telecom staff agreed Thursday to a pay plan linked to work
performance, the company said.
	   Last week, the company _ one of Hong Kong's largest private
employers, with a staff of 13,800 _ proposed a profit-related bonus
scheme to workers earning more than 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 1,282) a month.
	   Under that plan, the workers would lose out if the company's
operating profits rose by less than 3 percent. Hundreds of Hong
Kong Telecom staff staged a sit-in outside company headquarters in
protest.
	   Hong Kong Telecom managers defused the situation by offering a
new plan under which workers stand to get a smaller bonus _
one-quarter of a month's salary _ if profits rise by less than 3
percent.
	   Many companies in Hong Kong give year-end bonuses equivalent to
about one month's salary.
	   The dispute began in September when Hong Kong Telecom first
proposed pay cuts of 10 percent. Hong Kong Telecom later came up
with its initial bonus plan, which workers called a pay cut in
disguise.

Burundi's president to seek lifting of sanctions at Paris summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ President Pierre Buyoya said he will
urge other African leaders to help him persuade neighboring
countries to lift economic sanctions against Burundi.
	   ``The support of many heads of state is already there,'' Buyoya
said Wednesday before departing for a two-day summit of African
leaders that opened Thursday in Paris.
	   But Burundi's neighbors have repeatedly refused to lift the
sanctions they imposed against the retired army major less than a
week after he overthrew a weak coalition government on July 25,
1996.
	   The seven countries want to force Buyoya to restore democratic
institutions, which he has partially done, and to share power with
the Hutu majority.
	   Hutu rebels are fighting to topple Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi
minority, which accounts for 14 percent of Burundi's population of
6 million. Hutus account for 85 percent.
	   More than 200,000 people have been killed since 1993 when
violence erupted in the East African nation after Tutsi
paratroopers killed the country's first democratically elected
president, a Hutu.

Britain's last manned lighthouse is automated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BROADSTAIRS, England (AP) _ The last manned lighthouse in
Britain was switched to computer controls Thursday, completing a
15-year effort to make lighthouse keepers obsolete.
	   ``Change is one of those things that you think is marvelous for
other people but is never quite as pleasant for yourself or for
other people you are responsible for,'' Prince Philip told the six
men who had tended the North Foreland lighthouse on the English
Channel coast in Kent.
	   The tower was built in 1691, and there has been a lighthouse on
the site since 1499.
	   Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is master of the
Trinity House Lighthouse Service, which has spent 15 years and
nearly 3 million pounds (dlrs 5 million) automating the nation's 72
towers.
	   Dermot Cronin, a lighthouse keeper for 33 years and the senior
keeper at North Foreland, said it was a sad day.
	   ``It is not just the end of a job -- it's the end of a way of
life. I always wanted to be a lighthouse keeper, ever since the age
of 16. I like the freedom,'' said Cronin.
	   His job required him to be at the lighthouse continuously for a
month at a time. He spent alternate months at home in Dublin,
Ireland, with his family.
	   Keepers worked in groups of three for 12-hour shifts.
	   ``People think you have got to be a bit of a loner to be a
keeper, but in reality you have got to get on with people as you
are stuck with them for long periods of time,'' Cronin said. ``You
have to have a hobby because there is a lot of waiting around.''

	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Celebrity judges on Thursday
finished interviewing 86 contestants for Miss World, just hours
before one was to be crowned.
	   As the first step in the Thursday evening finals, which will be
televised live in 130 countries, each judge had 2 1/2 minutes with
each candidate.
	   ``Outer beauty can fade, but inner beauty will last for life,''
said New Zealand All Black rugby star Jonah Lomu, a Miss World
judge.
	   Photographer Terry O'Neill said he was looking for ``bearing,
beauty and nature.''
	   Among the other judges are Formula 1 racing driver Jacques
Villeneuve; outgoing Miss World, India's Diana Hayden; model
Christelle de St. Augustin; and Venezuela's 1981 Miss World Pilin
Leon.
	   Thursday's event was to be co-presented by the MTV hostess Eden
and Ronan Keating, lead singer for the Irish pop group Boyzone,
which will play its new single. Former Hot Chocolate singer Errol
Brown was open the show with his hit ``You Sexy Thing.''
	   Controversy came to the contest this year with Croatia's entry,
Lejla Sehovic, a business administration student stripped of her
title by her country's Miss World franchise holder because she is a
Muslim. Muslims are a minority among Croatia's 4.7 million people.
	   Judges voted a second time and awarded the crown to a Roman
Catholic, Ivana Petkovic. But protests were so great, the crown was
returned to Sehovic, with the proviso that Petkovic would represent
Croatia next year.
	   India's Annie Thomas, 23, said she sees herself as ``defending
champion,'' taking advice from her compatriot, the current Miss
World.
	   South Africa's Kerishnie Naicker, 25, is one of the oldest
candidates. A qualified pharmacist, she is now hosting two
television shows, one on culture and races in her country, and the
other promoting South Africa's food, wine and tourist attractions.
She wants to be her country's health minister.
	   The Seychelles government is hosting the show for the second
year in a row in the hopes of promoting the country as a tourist
destination.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firebombs exploded Thursday at the private
office of Greece's justice minister, causing damage and slightly
injuring a security guard, police said.
	   A previously unknown group, calling itself Student Rebels,
claimed responsibility for the attack in a call to an Athens
newspaper. It claimed the justice minister, Evangelos Yannopoulos,
was unfair to students.
	   The explosion occurred while nearly 10,000 people joined a
student-led march through central Athens to protest proposed
education reforms, including replacing a single university entry
exam with a series of tests.
	   Marchers used gasoline-filled bottles to set fire to at least
five cars, including one belonging to the Egyptian Embassy, police
said. Students also clashed with police outside parliament.
	   The attack on Yannopoulos' downtown Athens office was similar to
more than 200 other arson strikes this year, including one earlier
this month at a government labor office. Most have been claimed by
small leftist groups.
	   ``Such acts won't frighten anybody and Greeks are disgusted by
them,'' Yannopoulos stated after visiting his office.

300 Asian workers flee Bahrain fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A pre-dawn fire swept through a
three-story apartment building in northeast Bahrain, forcing some
300 Asian workers to flee, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   There were no injuries as a result of the Wednesday fire in
Muharraq, northeast of the capital, Manama, the English-language
Gulf Daily News reported.
	   Police were investigating the cause of the fire, the paper said.
	   Shiite Muslim activists campaigning for political and social
reforms have been blamed for numerous arson attacks in the country.
	   More than 40 people have been killed since the campaign began in
1994. Many of the victims have been Asian workers. Activists have
accused the Asians of taking away jobs from local workers and of
being police informers.
	   At least 300 Asians, including Indian and Bangladeshi laborers,
resided in the three-story building that was the site of
Wednesday's fire.
	   Shiites form a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens,
but the Gulf state is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, which belongs
to the mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

<TEXT>
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli soldiers shot rubber-coated
bullets into a crowd of about 100 Palestinians who threw stones at
their outpost during a demonstration Thursday to demand freedom for
Palestinian prisoners.
	   One Palestinian was wounded in the leg, and another was struck
in the arm. Both were taken away in private cars to a hospital.
	   About 500 people marched through Jenin to an office where
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police coordinate security. The
protesters walked behind a white banner showing prisoners' hands
chained and bleeding. ``No peace without release of all
prisoners,'' it said.
	   More than 2,500 Palestinians are in Israeli jails, and the issue
is sensitive among Palestinians, many of whom spent time in jail or
had relatives jailed during the three-decade occupation by Israel.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January. Palestinians complained that
most of the 250 prisoners freed in the first phase were common
criminals, not political activists.
	   ``Free the fighters, not the criminals,'' the protesters
shouted.
	   Awad Kenami said his son Ahmed, 37, a founder of the Black
Panther faction that fought Israeli occupation, was jailed two
months after the Oslo peace agreement was signed in September 1993.
	   ``My son was a soldier in a war led by Yasser Arafat; now Yasser
Arafat is a leader of peace, and so my son and his comrades must be
freed as soldiers for peace,'' Kenami said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not
release prisoners with ``blood on their hands'' or members of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, which has rejected the peace process.
	   Meanwhile, the daily Haaretz newspaper said that a slain Hamas
leader, Adel Awadallah, had planned to set off a series of five car
bombs in major Israeli cities before he was killed by the army in a
hail of bullets in September.
	   The newspaper said that according to information found in his
hideout, Awadallah planned to set off a car bomb and then demand
Israel free all Palestinian prisoners. Hamas also planned to attack
senior political figures, the report said.
	   Also Thursday, Jewish settlers in the divided West Bank town of
Hebron blocked Palestinian school children heading out for a field
trip, touching off scuffles, witnesses said.
	   The confrontation began when 6- to 14-year-olds from Kurtouba
Preparatory School gathered to board a bus to Jerusalem.
Palestinian witnesses said about 20 settlers from nearby Beit
Haddasah enclave began pushing the girls back into the school.
	   Ofir Sivan, spokesman for Israeli police in the West Bank
district, said the scuffle broke out after 40 students led by their
principal, Firial Abu Hekal, refused orders to end a protest.
	   Five girls were carried away in Palestinian ambulances after

but none suffered lasting injury.
	   In the Burkin village near Qalqiliya, about 2,000 Palestinians
and about 15 Israeli peace activists protested the building of a
road linking an Israeli settlement with an industrial estate.
	   The demonstrators blocked the road and stopped the bulldozers
briefly. The Palestinian protesters threw stones, and Israeli
troops responded by firing in the air and lobbing tear gas to
disperse the crowd.

Khatami condemns attack on American tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's president condemned Thursday an
Islamic militant attack on a bus of American tourists, saying it
was a national disgrace.
	   ``The ugly, perverse and possibly conspiratorial treatment of
foreign tourists, and those who are officially visiting Iran with
valid visas, was an affront to the honor of the Iranian people,''
Tehran radio quoted Mohammad Khatami as saying in a speech to
Intelligence Ministry officials.
	   Radicals chanting ``Death to America'' and wielding iron bars
and throwing stones smashed the windows of a bus carrying 13
foreigners, mostly Americans, in Tehran on Saturday.
	   Hardline newspapers had accused the tourists of being spies.
	   On Monday, U.S. officials in Washington denied that any of the
Americans were government officials or had links to the CIA. The
group left the country early Sunday.
	   The president said the assault was ``an insult to the government
and an intolerable act,'' the radio reported.
	   Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh had earlier condemned
the attack as ``unacceptable,'' saying that anybody who entered
Iran legally was entitled to protection.
	   The Fedayeen Islam, a radical Muslim group that was dormant for
many years, has claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   ``This was an operation against U.S. spies and a warning to the
officials who invited them,'' the group said in a statement Monday.
The warning appeared to refer to Khatami's call for cultural
exchanges between the United States and Iran.
	   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran after
Islamic militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly
after the 1979 revolution.

Japan-China summit hits glitch over joint statement

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi apologized
Thursday for his country's wartime aggression against China, but
the remorse expressed to visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin
basically repeated what his predecessors had said.
	   Obuchi also offered new loans of 390 billion yen (dlrs 3.2
billion) for 28 environmental, farming and other development
projects in China for 1999-2000.
	   Obuchi told Jiang that Japan was in economic difficulty, but the
loan was extended as a special symbol for the first visit to Japan
by a Chinese head of state since the end of World War II.
	   Despite repeated references to a new partnership, the two sides
were still working out the wording of the apology in a declaration,
more than five hours after Obuchi delivered his oral version.
Japan's Foreign Ministry said the wrangling was over technical
interpretation, rather than content.
	   In a meeting with Obuchi, Jiang made clear that Japan's need to
face up to history was crucial in Japan-China relations, calling it
an emotional issue for the Chinese people, Japanese Foreign
Ministry officials told reporters after the summit.
	   Obuchi responded by again offering the apology issued by then
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in 1995 that referred to ``Japan's
deep remorse and heartfelt apology'' for its actions before and
during World War II, said Japanese government spokesman Sadaaki
Numata.
	   Although officials from both sides signed agreements on
environmental cooperation and student exchanges, the declaration on
the apology was not being signed.
	   ``Certain things are best conveyed orally,'' Numata said, adding
that both leaders were satisfied with the declaration.
	   Foreign Ministry officials quoted Jiang as saying that one way
to look at history was that enough had been said.
	   ``I don't agree with this view. The more we discuss this issue,
the future will open up for us,'' Jiang was quoted as saying.
	   But he was also quoted as saying that he welcomed Japan's
continued commitment to reject the militarism of the past and that
the Japanese people were also victims of their nation's past
militarism.
	   Jiang's visit had been heralded as an effort to put to rest the
bitter memories of the war and decades of Cold War division that
still weigh on relations between Asia's two most powerful
countries.
	   Japanese officials played down differences between the apology
issued to China and the apology, which was signed, to South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung during his visit to Tokyo last month.
	   To Kim, Japan gave its fullest apology yet for its 1910-45
colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula.
	   Numata said the messages were ``similar'' and that Japan had
already issued similar signed apologies to China in 1972, when two
nations normalized relations, and again in 1995.
	   Numata acknowledged that Jiang said he found it puzzling that
sometimes remarks that contradicted the official government apology
surfaced now and then.
	   Some conservative Japanese politicians have outraged China
repeatedly by making remarks that deny wartime atrocities by
Japan's army.
	   Japan remains worried that too many expressions of remorse could
trigger renewed demands for compensation by victims of atrocities.
	   In Thursday's talks, Jiang said Taiwan was another key issue.
Obuchi reassured him that Japan was behind Beijing's ``one China''
policy, which holds that Taiwan is a renegade province that is part
of China.
	   Obuchi also made clear that Japan does not support an
independent Taiwan. He told Jiang that Japan's security treaty with
the United States is purely ``defensive,'' and does not refer to
any specific nation, Numata said.
	   Economic ties were mentioned in Thursday's talks but took a
definite back seat to the issues of history and Taiwan. China is
Japan's second-largest trading partner, and Japan is China's
largest, with annual trade volume of more than dlrs 60 billion.
	   Jiang, who arrived Wednesday, plans to meet with business
leaders, civic groups and students at a major university before
leaving Tokyo Saturday for visits to two northern Japanese cities,
Sendai and Sapporo.

	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Former skiing star Alberto Tomba and his
father were indicted Thursday on charges of tax fraud, and the
court set a trial date in March 2000.
	   Tomba's mother was cleared.
	   None of the defendants was present in the Bologna courthouse.
	   The three-time Olympic champion, who announced his retirement
from the slopes last month, is accused of failing to pay taxes on

Tomba is his son's business manager.
	   Tax fraud is punishable in Italy by up to five years in prison
and fines.

Parliament speaker: Yeltsin's government `squishy as cabbage'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from Yeltsin's former bodyguard in new
four final grafs. &QL;

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of the parliament's upper house on
Thursday called for stronger parliamentary powers, citing the
growing feebleness of President Boris Yeltsin's government.
	   ``The government is as squishy as cabbage in the fall,'' Yegor
Stroyev, the speaker of the Federation Council said in an interview
published in the daily Komomolskaya Pravda.
	   Stroyev is normally a reliable ally of Yeltsin. But Stroyev
joined a growing number of presidential supporters who have
distanced themselves from Yeltsin in recent days. Stroyev, a
moderate, said that a weakened president was not able to use the
extensive powers granted him under the Russian constitution.
	   ``There is a flow of accusations against the president for
having sweeping powers unrivaled by any other president, but these
powers end at the Kremlin walls,'' Stroyev said.
	   Yeltsin remained hospitalized Thursday, undergoing treatment for
pneumonia, the latest in a series of illnesses that have turned him
into a part-time president and fueled concern about his ability to
serve out the remainder of a term that runs until mid-2000.
	   The Kremlin released no new details Thursday on the president's
condition.
	   Meanwhile, Valentin Pokrovsky, a doctor and the president of the
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, who has examined Yeltsin in
the past, said Thursday that the president seems ``rather tired and
not quite healthy.''
	   He added, though that he didn't have any information about
Yeltsin's latest illness. Yeltsin's ability or inability to govern
must be certified by doctors, and ``since the issue isn't raised,
it means the doctors don't think it necessary,'' Pokrovsky said at
a news conference.
	   The Communist-led opposition in parliament's lower house has
pushed for a bill that would require a medical checkup for the
president, with the results made public. So far, the move has
failed.
	   Stroyev didn't touch upon Yeltsin's health in his interview, but
spoke for a check on presidential powers and a corresponding
increase of the parliament's authority.
	   ``No reasonable man doubts that the constitution needs
revision,'' Stroyev said. ``The parliament's functions have been
unreasonably reduced.''
	   In another blow to Yeltsin, his former chief bodyguard Alexander
Korzhakov on Thursday reiterated allegations that the president and
his family are manipulated by controversial business mogul Boris
Berezovsky.
	   Korzhakov called a news conference to claim that Berezovsky was
blackmailing the president's family, threatening to release
compromising materials.
	   Berezovsky, who has gained a reputation as a suspected gray
eminence of Russian politics, serves as the executive secretary of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of ex-Soviet
republics.
	   Berezovsky dismissed Korzhakov's allegations Thursday, the
Interfax news agency said.

Three people dead in the latest wave of immigrants trying to enter
</HEADLINE>
Italy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police patrolling the coast of Sicily on Thursday
found the bodies of two alleged smugglers and a fatally wounded
would-be immigrant who had apparently tried to cross the
Mediterranean on boats during the night.
	   Some 300 would-be immigrants were also blocked by authorities in
the region of Puglia, at the heel of the boot-shaped Italian
peninsula.
	   An unidentified North African man was hurt while trying to climb
up the rocky shore of Pantelleria, a tiny island off the coast of
Sicily. He died while being taken to the hospital.
	   The man was believed to be part of a group of about 20 Tunisians
and Moroccans who reached the island, which is only 70 kilometers
(45 miles) west of Tunisia, on dinghies.
	   The group has been detained while police search for other
immigrants.
	   In Sicily, two men where found dead after their ship sunk in
rough waters off the coast of Syracuse, in the southeastern part of
the island.
	   Authorities believe the two, whose nationalities were not
immediately known, smuggled in a group of Kurds earlier this week.
	   Thousands of would-be immigrants fleeing persecution or war at
home have reached Italy's shores in recent years, most paying
smugglers huge fees for the trip. The arrivals include Kurds,
Moroccans, Tunisians, Afghans and Kosovo refugees.

Palestinian doctor given human rights award
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1600 GMT Friday, Nov. 27. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Psychiatrist Eyad Sarraj, who has been jailed for
speaking out against Palestinian authorities, has won the Martin
Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, it was announced Friday.
	   ``He is active in the field of rehabilitation of torture
survivors and prevention of torture,'' said Adama Dieng, president
of the Martin Ennals Foundation.
	   ``His involvement in human rights issues has exposed him on
several occasions to threatening situations and resulted in his own
imprisonment and torture. His open criticism of the Palestinian
National Authority has placed him in great danger.''
	   Sarraj is the founder and director of the Gaza Community Mental
Health Program. He has been imprisoned three times by the
Palestinian authorities.
	   ``Dr. El Sarraj has developed an independent mental health
service which provides urgently needed support for the large number
of people affected by the upheaval of the Intifada and the
organized violence perpetrated under Israeli occupation,'' Dieng
added.
	   The Martin Ennals award was created in 1993 to commemorate the
life-long human rights campaigner who created several human rights
organizations including International Alert and who helped build up
Amnesty International.
	   The first award was given to Chinese dissident Harry Wu in 1994
for his work against forced labor in China.

Italy, Cuba join Yugoslavia and Brazil in semifinals

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Defending champion Italy trounced the Netherlands
15-2, 15-7, 15-1 Thursday and advanced to the semifinals of the
Men's World Volleyball Championships, along with Cuba.
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Italy, seeking to become the first
men's team ever to win three consecutive world titles, plays
undefeated Brazil. Cuba meets Yugoslavia, which reached the
semifinals by upsetting Italy on Wednesday.
	   On Thursday, the Italians needed only 47 minutes to beat the
Netherlands, the 1996 Olympic champion and a silver medalist in the
previous championships in 1994.
	   ``Games like the one we played today are extremely important for
Italy. We knew our opponents' problems, but we were never
condescending,'' said Italian head coach Paulo de Freitas.
	   In another Group H game, Russia beat Yugoslavia 3-15, 15-13,
15-5, 15-11.
	   That left Yugoslavia, Italy and Russia all with 6-1 records in
the second round, but Yugoslavia placed first in the group, Italy
second and Russia third on a sets won-lost ratio. The Netherlands
finished at 4-3.
	   Also in Group H, the United States beat China 15-11, 15-8, 15-4,
and Ukraine beat Greece 15-3, 12-15, 15-3, 15-2.
	   ``I am happy because we didn't let China play the way they
played yesterday against Ukraine. My team is growing and the
players trust each other more and more,'' said American head coach
Doug Beal.
	   The United States and Ukraine both finished 2-5, and Greece and
China 1-6.
	   In Group G, Cuba beat Argentina 15-12, 15-4, 15-12 and won the
fourth semifinal place with a 6-1 record.
	   Brazil, already assured of a place in semifinals, beat Spain
15-4, 13-15, 15-5, 15-9 and was the only undefeated team in
second-round play.
	   Bulgaria beat winless Japan 10-15, 17-15, 15-12, 13-15, 15-10,
and South Korea beat Canada 7-15, 15-9, 15-11, 15-5.
	   Spain and Bulgaria both finished at 4-3, Canada at 3-4 and
Argentina and South Korea at 2-5.
	   The men's championships started Nov. 13 with 24 teams, and 16
teams advanced to the second round, which ended Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies were 157 for
four at tea Thursday on the first day of the first test against
South Africa.
	   The game at Wanderers Stadium marked the first time the two
teams have met in a test in South Africa, and the first time they
are playing each other in a full series.
	   After rebuilding the West Indies innings, Carl Hooper became
Allan Donald's first victim when he flashed at one outside the off
stump and edged a high catch to Darryl Cullinan's left at first
slip. Hooper had scored 44.
	   He and Shivnarine Chanderpaul launched their rescue act after
Shaun Pollock had ripped through the top order, taking three vital
wickets (Clayton Lambert for eight, Philo Wallace for 16 and Brian
Lara for 11). Their partnership for the fourth wicket earned 91
runs in 137 minutes.
	   Chanderpaul went on to record the first half-century of the
series, batting with great patience and application against a tight
line and length from the whole South African attack except Donald.
It was a characteristic innings by the left-hander, bringing him
his 15th test 50, and another in a long line of his innings which
have rescued the West Indies from a tight spot.

Report: Pinochet wept when he got the bad news
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Augusto Pinochet broke down and cried upon
learning he faces the threat of extradition to Spain and trial on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism, Spanish newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Half an hour before a five-judge panel of Britain's House of
Lords announced Wednesday that Pinochet has no immunity from
prosecution, a government interpreter went to the London hospital
where the former Chilean dictator is staying under police guard and
broke the news to him.
	   The interpreter read the ruling to Pinochet in Spanish, and
repeated it once at Pinochet's request. Then Pinochet, who turned
83 on Wednesday, held his head in his hands and wept, El Pais
reported from London, quoting sources close to the Pinochet affair.
	   Another paper, El Mundo, also reported that Pinochet sobbed when
he got the news.
	   Earlier in the day Pinochet supporters tried to make his
birthday as festive as possible at the Grovelands Priory hospital,
delivering a cake they'd kept fresh in a large portable
refrigerator.
	   Pinochet was arrested on a Spanish warrant in London on Oct. 16
as he recovered from minor back surgery.
	   In Madrid, the judge who issued that warrant and has requested
his extradition reacted to the Lords' ruling with the silence that
has become his trademark.
	   Baltasar Garzon, dubbed Super Judge for taking on a string of
high profile cases in Spain, made no public statement on the
ruling. Even in the privacy of his office he did not so much as
express satisfaction because he feared this would show bias, El
Pais said, quoting sources close to Garzon.
	   Garzon wants Pinochet to stand trial in Spain over the deaths or
disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his regime.
	   Spanish newspaper editorials welcomed the British Lords' ruling
as a precedent-setting one that should send shivers down the spine
of retired despots around the world.
	   ``As of yesterday, dictators who have lost power will no longer
enjoy freedom of movement outside their country. They will have to
stay home, or risk being arrested,'' El Pais said.
	   The center-right daily El Mundo added: ``The foundations of what
can and should be justice without borders are being laid.''

Taiwan blames bungling for failure to allow Horta entry

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's Foreign Ministry on Thursday
blamed ``administrative negligence'' for an incident in which Nobel
Peace Prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta was left stranded at the
airport for hours after being refused entry.
	   Opposition supporters alleged the incident Wednesday night was
politically motivated.
	   Ramos-Horta is an advocate of independence for
Indonesian-controlled East Timor, and newspapers reported Taiwan
had formerly barred him to avoid antagonizing Indonesia.
	   But Ramos-Horta's previous persona non grata status had been
ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in August, leaving no reason
why he should have been refused entry by airport immigration when
he came to town Wednesday night, ministry spokesman Roy Wu told a
news conference.
	   ``This incident accentuated the problem with administrative
relations, it needs to be improved. ... It's a fact,'' Wu told a
news conference.
	   Ramos-Horta had a rough time Wednesday night. Immigration
officials would not let him in, then he tried to catch a flight out
but missed the plane. Eventually, the Foreign Ministry intervened
and let Ramos-Horta enter Taiwan. He went only as far as the
airport hotel.
	   Conflicting reports indicate Ramos-Horta was stuck at the
airport for between four and seven hours. Ramos-Horta was carrying
a Portuguese passport, which should have permitted him visa-free
entry to Taiwan for up to 14 days, newspapers said.
	   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party alleged Ramos-Horta
had been refused entry because he planned to speak on behalf of
Chen Shui-bian's campaign to be re-elected as mayor of Taipei. Chen
is Taiwan's most prominent DPP politician.
	   ``This sort of incident shows that Taiwan is just not qualified
to be called a democratic nation,'' DPP Secretary-General Chiu
Yi-jen told a news conference.
	   Ramos-Horta sought to play down the incident before leaving town
Thursday.
	   ``I don't want to make a big problem out of it. I have been to
many countries. The only countries that don't allow me in would be
countries like Iraq, Iran,'' he told reporters before catching an
afternoon flight to attend a conference in Australia.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian
claims to East Timor.

Three people dead in the latest wave of immigrants trying to enter

Italy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police patrolling the coast of Sicily on Thursday
found the bodies of two alleged smugglers and a fatally wounded
would-be immigrant who had apparently tried to cross the
Mediterranean on boats during the night.
	   Some 300 would-be immigrants were also blocked by authorities in
the region of Puglia, at the heel of the boot-shaped Italian
peninsula.
	   An unidentified North African man was hurt while trying to climb
up the rocky shore of Pantelleria, a tiny island off the coast of
Sicily. He died while being taken to the hospital.
	   The man was believed to be part of a group of about 20 Tunisians
and Moroccans who reached the island, which is only 70 kilometers
(45 miles) west of Tunisia, on dinghies.
	   The group has been detained while police search for other
immigrants.
	   In Sicily, two men where found dead after their ship sunk in
rough waters off the coast of Syracuse, in the southeastern part of
the island.
	   Authorities believe the two, whose nationalities were not
immediately known, smuggled in a group of Kurds earlier this week.
	   Thousands of would-be immigrants fleeing persecution or war at
home have reached Italy's shores in recent years, most paying
smugglers huge fees for the trip. The arrivals include Kurds,
Moroccans, Tunisians, Afghans and Kosovo refugees.

`Millennium bug' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Most major companies in the
Philippines have fixed their computer systems to protect them from
the potentially disastrous effects of the ``millennium bug'' in the
year 2000, a business group said Thursday.
	   Initial results of a two-month survey of about 100 leading
corporations in the Philippines showed that most have fixed their
computer systems, said Guillermo Luz of the Makati Business Club.
	   ``Many people have prepared well in advance,'' Luz said. ``Many
are aware that many problems can happen.''
	   The bug could cause computers that are set to read only the last
two digits of a year to malfunction when the calendar changes to
2000. Those that aren't fixed may not be able to sort dates,
calculate transactions or perform other operations.
	   Luz said the group is organizing seminars to teach companies how
to cope with the bug's potential effects. The club's members are
the country's largest corporations, headquartered mainly in the
financial district of Makati in metropolitan Manila.
	   Philippine officials said they also have started fixing
government computer systems but that limited funds have only
allowed them to cover computers used by the power and utility
industries, telecommunications and transportation, health care and
insurance.
	   Other computers will be fixed as soon as funds, possibly donated
by private companies, become available, officials said.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada has ordered officials to
undertake a comprehensive audit of computer systems in all
government offices to determine whether they are susceptible to the
bug.

Keidanren: No new Japanese investments likely in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The head of Japan's most
influential business lobby said Thursday that new Japanese
investment in Malaysia was unlikely because not enough products
could be sold in the country.
	   ``I don't think, with the market contracting, we can hope for
new investments,'' said Takashi Imai, chairman of the Japan
Federation of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren.
	   A curb on yen coming in could further hurt Malaysia, which is
grappling with its first recession in a decade and desperately
needs foreign investment to boost its manufacturing sector.
	   Japan is the third biggest investor in Malaysia after the United
States and Singapore.
	   Imai, who also serves as chairman of top-ranked steelmaker
Nippon Steel Corp., said that any new money coming in would only be
meant for existing joint ventures between Malaysian and Japanese
companies that are struggling to cope with the fall in demand.
	   A delegation of visiting Japanese businessmen met with Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad earlier Thursday.
	   Mahathir urged Japan to expedite loans to Malaysia, the
businessmen said. The loans include a dlrs 1.5 billion package for
eight projects and a dlrs 500 million package for trade financing.
	   According to Keidanren's vice chairman, Mahathir said the
government may consider reviewing the recently imposed fixed
exchange rate for the ringgit only if Asian currencies fluctuate
widely against the dollar.
	   ``He has in mind a (minimum) 20 percent shift, either up or
down, as a criteria for considering change in the exchange rate,''
Naohiko Kumagai told reporters.
	   In early September, Malaysia imposed selective capital controls.
Those curbs prohibited offshore trading of ringgit, effectively
pegging the Malaysian currency at 3.80 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The policy was crafted to allow Malaysia's economic planners to
pump more liquidity into the recession-hit economy without
undermining the stability of the currency.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Slovenia's visiting Prime Minister Janez
Drnovsek called for increasing trade with Ukraine during talks
Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Valery Pustovoitenko.
	   Pustovoitenko also said increasing trade was a priority in
Ukraine's relations with Slovenia. Trade turnover between the two
nations was dlrs 73.4 in 1997, of which Ukrainian exports accounted
for only dlrs 6.7 million.
	   Pustovoitenko said economic ties were expected to profit from
accords on investment protection and avoidance of dual taxation
that are to be signed during Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's
upcoming visit to Slovenia.
	   Drnovsek, in turn, praised Ukraine as a ``very important
economic and political partner'' and said he brought along a
delegation of businessmen to study investment opportunities, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Slovenian premier also promised to simplify visa procedures
for Ukrainian visitors once his country opens an embassy in Kiev,
the Ukrainian capital, in the near future. About 30,000 Ukrainians
visited Slovenia in 1997.
	   The sides also discussed plans for setting up an international
consortium to build a European transport corridor from Italy's port
of Trieste to Slovenia, Hungary and Ukraine.
	   Drnovsek also was due to meet with Kuchma and parliament speaker
Oleksandr Tkachenko before completing his one-day visit.

Latvian government wins approval

not vote, sted abstained. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) - Legislators on Thursday voted in a new
minority government that will be headed by Vilis Kristopans of the
centrist Latvia's Way, and include another centrist party and a
rightwing group.
	   The vote by the Saeima parliament ended nearly two months of
negotiations. President Guntis Ulmanis had strongly pushed for
forming a majority government, but an agreement could not be
reached.
	   The new government leaves out the People's Party, which got the
largest number of seats in Oct. 3 national elections. Party leader
Andris Skele is strongly disliked by many other politicians and no
way could be found to include the party in the government.
	   The three-party government, consisting of Latvia's Way, the New
Party and the rightwing fatherland and Freedom, holds just 46 of
the 100 seats in the Saeima.
	   The government drew support from the leftwing Social Democrats
in Thursday's vote, even though that party will have no ministerial
posts. Fatherland and Freedom had rigidly refused to consider
having the Soial Democrats in government.
	   Kristopans will take over as prime minister from Guntars Krasts
of Fatherland and Freedom.
	   The only votes against the government came from the People's
Party, while the far-left National Harmony Party's 16 legislators
did not vote at all.
	   Since it regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991,
Latvia has been plagued by weak, unstable governments. It has had
more than half a dozen multi-party coalitions, none of which have
lasted more than two years.
	   The new government appeared likely to fit that pattern.
	   Ulmanis said on Thursday that he was disappointed a
majority-coalition government could not be formed and urged the new
government to continue trying to woo another party into the
coalition.
	   Kristopans, speaking to the Saeima before the vote, said keeping
Latvia's free-markets reforms on course would be a top priority for
his government.
	   He said his government would also continue to push hard for NATO
and European Union membership. Improving relations with Russia
would also be a high priority, he said.
	   Valdis Birkavs of Latvia's Way, the well-respected foreign
minister, will stay on in the post in the new government.

Hospital closed by war reopens under new municipal administration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Two years after war shut it down,
Mogadishu's second largest hospital reopened Thursday, under the
new municipal administration set up in the capital in an agreement
between former rival faction leaders.
	   Mogadishu administration officials inaugurated the renewed
hospital in a festive ceremony that included a musical police band,
poem recitations and other artist performances.
	   The fully renovated hospital, which was the capital's most
luxurious before the eruption of civil war in 1991, has been
rebuilt and equipped fully, with two operating theatres, generators
and water wells to supply constant electricity and water.
	   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the renovations
were financed by Somali businessmen at a cost of dlrs 100,000.
	   The municipal administration was set up in mid-October after
north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed reached agreement
with his main rival in the south of the formerly divided city,
Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
	   Speaking at the ceremony Thursday, Ali Mahdi thanked the Somali
businessmen who financed the project and said he believed it would
encourage more Somalis to participate in the noble task of
rebuilding the ravaged capital.
	   Somalia has had no central government since rival factions
conspired in 1991 to oust President Mohamed Siad Barre and then
turned on each other, carving up the country into a series of
militia-controlled fiefdoms.
	   Col. Abdi Qeybdid, commander of Mogadishu's newly-established
police force, said during the ceremony that police training would
conclude this month and his men will soon start operating to bring
security and stability back to the war-torn capital.
	   Hospital Director Sheikdon Salad Elmi said 50 percent of
hospital operations will be only for Mogadishu's police force, and
the other 50 percent will be for civilian use.
	   He said the hospital has 10 full-time doctors and 50 nurses.
	   In recent years, there have been only two hospitals servicing
Mogadishu's 1.5 million residents.

U.S. rapper Coolio on trial for theft, assault in Germany

 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Greeted by 200 applauding fans, U.S.
rapper Coolio denied charges of theft and assault in court Thursday
one year after his arrest for allegedly punching a saleswoman
during a European tour.
	   Police officials say the Grammy-award winning artist and six
members of his group left a boutique in a Stuttgart suburb last
Nov. 20 without paying for clothing worth 1,500 marks (dlrs 940).
	   The rapper is accused of hitting the saleswoman in the stomach
when she confronted the group.
	   Coolio, 35, denied punching the woman and said the incident was
a misunderstanding. He says he signed autographs in the boutique,
and that in exchange a clothing company had promised him and his
group free outfits.
	   ``It was understood that the clothes were in exchange for the
autographs,'' Collio said, represented by his German lawyer Georg
Prasser. Coolio told the court he offered to pay for the clothes
but that the saleswoman would accept cash but not his credit card.
	   Police arrested Coolio in Frankfurt, 90 miles to the north. The
group was released after posting 250,000 marks (dlrs 167,000) bail
and was allowed to finish its tour.
	   Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., won a Grammy for
best rap solo in 1996 for ``Gangsta's Paradise,'' which was
featured in the film ``Dangerous Minds.''
	   He faces four years in prison if convicted. The trial is to
resume next week, and prosecutors say they expect a verdict in
mid-December.
	   In September, Coolio was arrested in Los Angeles for carrying a
concealed weapon and possession of marijuana after police pulled
him over for driving on the wrong side of a street.

Britain's Blair breaks 76-year taboo with speech to Irish
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ In the first speech ever by a British
prime minister to an Irish parliament, Tony Blair predicted
Thursday that Northern Ireland's troubled peace accord would
ultimately work because of a wider cooperative spirit uniting
Britain and Ireland.
	   ``Like it or not we, the British and the Irish, are irredeemably
linked,'' Blair said, winning standing ovations that symbolized the
best relations between the two once-bitterly divided countries
since the Irish Republic won bloody independence from Britain in
1922.
	   Blair walked into the packed chamber side by side with his
increasingly close friend, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. The
two men together negotiated around the clock in Belfast to help
broker April's accord among eight Northern Ireland parties.
	   Blair thanked Ahern and his government for ``living up to your
side of the bargain'' by dropping the Irish Republic's territorial
claim to Northern Ireland, long a sore point for the north's
British Protestant majority.
	   ``It is time now for all the parties to live up to all their
commitments,'' he said in reference to Protestant politicians'
refusal to form a coalition government that includes the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party, and the Irish Republican Army's own refusal to
start disarming, both goals contained in the accord.
	   ``I am not asking anyone to surrender. I am asking everyone to
declare the victory of peace,'' Blair said.
	   Watching from the public gallery was Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams, who later delivered his own largely critical assessment of
the peace process in a speech to Dublin business people.
	   Adams lauded Blair as ``the British prime minister who can
change Anglo-Irish relations utterly.'' But he accused Protestant
politician David Trimble, the would-be leader of Northern Ireland's
unformed government, of scheming ``to undermine the substance of
the agreement from within.''
	   Blair emphasized the growing political, cultural and business
links binding together a Britain ``emerging from its post-empire
malaise'' and ``a modern, open'' Ireland. He noted that several
million of Britain's 55 million residents were Irish, while
hundreds of thousands of Britons vacationed in Ireland annually.
	   ``We've both grown up now,'' Blair said. ``A new generation is
in power in each country. And we now have a real opportunity to put
our relations on a completely new footing, not least through
working together in Europe.''
	   He emphasized: ``The old ways are changing between London and
Dublin. And this can spur the change and healing in Northern
Ireland too.''

OPEC meeting ends in rancor; no agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quote, analysis in grafs 9-11. UPDATES oil
price in London graf 12; Edits throughout, trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC closed a rancorous year-end meeting
Thursday without even a minimum agreement to extend oil production
cuts, saying it would review the situation again in March.
	   OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman said the organization will
take whatever measures are necessary to try and boost oil prices
then, but there will be no policy changes in the meantime.
	   Analysts had said that extending production cuts to the end of
1999 was the bare minimum action needed to prop up rock-bottom oil
prices, hovering near 12-year lows.
	   Some delegates had hoped that a 12-month, 2.6 million
barrel-a-day cut set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries June could be extended six months to the end of 1999.
	   ``We have already got an agreement, you know,'' Lukman said.
``In March we will decide what to do.''
	   ``There's no question of the need to reduce'' output, he said.
	   OPEC did decide to realign its annual schedule, meeting in March
and September rather than June and November _ a move which could
ease up on inaction.
	   ``If it's a weak winter they have the opportunity in March to do
something. That's the positive side. On the negative side _ for the
market is that _ they expected cuts to be extended and they haven't
got that,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at London's Center
for Global Energy Studies.
	   He predicted prices would dip, but not plummet, as expectations
of the meeting had been low.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January was
trading in London Thursday afternoon at dlrs 10.94, up slightly
from Wednesday's record contract low of dlrs 10.88.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its decision
last winter to boost production, which coincided with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi was elected the cartel's new
president, replacing the United Arab Emirates' Obaid bin Saif
Al-Nasseri.
	   In his opening speech, Al-Nasseri acknowledged that a ``strong
bearish sentiment has set in'' on the world market.
	   Oil-producing nations, he said, ``are deeply concerned about the
serious problems facing the world's oil industry at the present
time, with weak international prices and an underlying feeling of
insecurity about future prospects'' in the near term.
	   Ministers had pushed back the start of the meeting, originally
scheduled to begin Wednesday, because of deep differences over
issues of extending production cuts and disagreements on production
levels.
	   Iran said it was criticized for its output level, an allegation
it argued was unfair because it isn't overproducing.
	   A senior Iranian delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told the Associated Press that Iran had been asked to cut too much.
When OPEC was determining Iran's production capacity, he said, it
did not take into account two new refineries that came on line in
February.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the
group's biggest producer.
	   Some members complained that Saudi Arabia had seized market
share after Iraq's departure from the oil market in 1990, and now
won't let go. The kingdom is pushing for better compliance with
June's cuts, saying there is no point to further cuts until full
compliance is achieved.
	   Iraq has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990
invasion of fellow OPEC member, Kuwait, but is now allowed to sell
limited amounts of oil under U.N. supervision to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods.
	   Indonesian Oil Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said Indonesia was
conducting a legal review of its domestic oil industry after the
fall of long-time ruler Suharto.
	   ``We want to have a competitive sector, oil and gas, that is
effective and transparent, in terms of an open market downstream
and an effective market upstream,'' Mangkusubroto told the AP.
	   Venezuela threw a late wrench in the works when Oil Minister
Erwin Arrieta told ministers that with a new government taking over
in February it could not commit to an extension of the existing
production cuts.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
had called for new output reductions, a stance supported by Algeria
and Libya.

Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Former President Canaan Banana was convicted
of 11 counts of sodomy and homosexual assault Thursday, and
prosecutors confirmed he has fled the country.
	   Banana, 62, a Methodist minister, illegally went to neighboring
Botswana ahead of the verdict, said Chief Prosecutor Augustine
Chikumira. He said the government will seek Banana's extradition.
	   Judge Godfrey Chidyausiku issued an arrest warrant for Banana
and ordered his bail revoked.
	   Banana had been free on bail of 20,000 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs
600), and had surrendered his passport and the deed to his mansion
in the exclusive Mount Pleasant suburb of the capital Harare.
	   The guilty verdict on all counts came after a three-week trial
that took place in June. Each of the 11 charges carries a usual
penalty of two years imprisonment, for a possible maximum of 22
years in prison at sentencing scheduled Dec. 10.
	   Banana's case has deeply embarrassed President Robert Mugabe,
who insists homosexuality is foreign to African culture and was
brought to the continent from the West. He has launched an
outspoken campaign against homosexuality, describing same-sex
partners as ``lower than pigs and dogs.''
	   The stance against homosexuality in southern Africa is not
unusual. Government officials of nearby Namibia and Zambia have
made similar anti-gay statements. South Africa has bucked the trend
and recently decriminalized gay sex.
	   In Botswana, the Foreign Ministry confirmed Banana was in the
country but officials had received no request for asylum.
	   The state-controlled Herald newspaper of Harare reported
Thursday Banana may have taken refuge with the Anglican church in
Botswana.
	   Botswana's deputy police commissioner, Edwin Batshu, said
authorities would begin extradition proceedings once Banana was
found. The politician could face illegal entry charges in Botswana
for entering the country without a passport.
	   ``He must have used an uncontrolled entry point,'' he was quoted
as saying by South African Press Association.
	   While a political activist in the colonial era of Rhodesia, as
Zimbabwe was known before independence, Banana fled on foot into
Botswana in 1972 to avoid arrest by the white-led Rhodesia
government. In exile, he became chaplain at the American University
in Washington, D.C.
	   The offenses attributed to Banana mostly involved bodyguards, a
cook and a gardener on his presidential staff. They allegedly
occurred when he was president after independence in 1980 until
1987.
	   Prosecutors alleged Banana used his authority as the nation's
titular president to force the individuals into homosexual acts.
	   Banana was brought to trial after a police inspector who had
worked as his bodyguard shot dead a colleague who had taunted him
as ``Banana's wife.''
	   Jefta Dube, serving a 10-year prison term for that murder, said
he was forced into a three-year sexual relationship with Banana
between 1984 and 1986.
	   The ceremonial presidency was abolished and Mugabe assumed the
mantle of executive president in 1987.

Court turns down Allied POWs compensation suit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS British embassy instructed to continue aid to plaintiffs,
last graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Thursday rejected a demand for
compensation by a group of Allied soldiers and civilians held
prisoner by Japanese troops during World War II.
	   The lawsuit was filed in January 1995 by seven plaintiffs on
behalf of 20,000 members of veteran and civilian ex-prisoner
organizations from Britain, the United States, Australia and New
Zealand.
	   The decision was the first handed down in Japan in a legal suit
brought by former World War II POWs from Allied countries. The
plaintiffs said they would appeal.
	   The seven were outraged. One, Arthur Titherington of Britain,
said he left the court in anger and spit at two entrances of the
nearby Japanese Parliament.
	   ``That's how I feel about them,'' he said of Japanese leaders.
``I worked like a slave. ... I want compensation.''
	   The plaintiffs demanded dlrs 22,000 each for what they claimed
were violations of their rights under international treaties and
conventions on the treatment of war prisoners. The total claim was
for dlrs 440 million.
	   The court ruled that the issue was resolved in 1951 with the
signing of the San Francisco peace treaty.
	   Presiding Judge Shigeki Inoue said in his verdict that because
of the 1951 treaty, individuals or groups could not seek
compensation from the government. He said compensation issues must
be dealt with on the government-to-government level.
	   Japan forced POWs to work in shipyards, mines and jungles in
violation of international law. They were also beaten and some were
executed. The POWs' death rate at the Japanese camps was 27
percent, compared to a 4 percent rate at Allied camps.
	   A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Martin Day, said the ruling _ and
the court's refusal to consider testimony of the suffering his
clients endured _ were an insult to the former prisoners.
	   ``We have received a judgment that has been a kick in the
teeth,'' Day told reporters. ``I think the Japanese court today
should be ashamed of itself.''
	   Day said the plaintiffs were willing to take the case to the
Japanese Supreme Court. Gilbert Hair, representing the American
former prisoners, said his group was also considering suing for
compensation for slave labor under an international labor treaty
signed by the Japanese in the 1930s.
	   Hair said the plaintiffs could also try to sue their own
governments for compensation, arguing that those governments did
not do enough to further the former prisoners' cause, but he said
he would rather be compensated by the Japanese.
	   In London, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said, ``We understand the disappointment of those who brought the
case. We never forget their suffering and sacrifice.
	   ``But we can't comment on a judicial decision,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The government's
position remains as it has been throughout that the issue of
compensation was settled under the Treaty of 1951.''
	   Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett also cited the 1951
treaty, but said he has instructed the British Embassy in Tokyo
``to continue to give all necessary assistance to Arthur
Titherington and his colleagues'' as they appeal the decision.

Netanyahu: Israel will review tactics in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Thursday that he will order a review of his country's tactics in
Lebanon, where two Israeli soldiers died in a bomb attack a day
earlier.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack, about three kms (1.8 miles) west of
the Lebanon-Israel border.
	   Hezbollah seeks to evict some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the
2,500 allied militiamen from the occupied zone that Israel carved
out in 1985.
	   Following a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
Netanyahu told reporters that Israeli forces would withdraw from
Lebanon only when there were new arrangements to protect residents
of northern Israel and Israel's allies in Lebanon.
	   ``As soon as we have addressed these twin needs, we will
withdraw from Lebanon,'' he said.
	   ``When I return to Israel I will initiate a process which will
take several weeks for a reassessment, not of these goals _ which
remain fixed _ but I will seek a reassessment of our current
methods and tactics in Lebanon,''
	   he added.

OPEC meeting ends in rancor; no agreement

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC closed a rancorous year-end meeting
Thursday without even a minimum agreement to extend oil production
cuts, saying it would review the situation again in March.
	   OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman said the organization will
take whatever measures are necessary to try and boost oil prices
then, but there will be no policy changes in the meantime.
	   Analysts had said that extending production cuts to the end of
1999 was the bare minimum action needed to prop up rock-bottom oil
prices, hovering near 12-year lows.
	   Some delegates had hoped that a 12-month, 2.6 million
barrel-a-day cut set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries June could be extended six months to the end of 1999.
	   ``We have already got an agreement, you know,'' Lukman said.
``In March we will decide what to do.''
	   ``There's no question of the need to reduce'' output, he said.
	   OPEC did decide to realign its annual schedule, meeting in March
and September rather than June and November _ a move which could
ease up on inaction.
	   ``If it's a weak winter they have the opportunity in March to do
something. That's the positive side. On the negative side _ for the
market is that _ they expected cuts to be extended and they haven't
got that,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at London's Center
for Global Energy Studies.
	   He predicted prices would dip, but not plummet, as expectations
of the meeting had been low.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January was
trading in London Thursday afternoon at dlrs 10.94, up slightly
from Wednesday's record contract low of dlrs 10.88.
	   OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly in half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its decision
last winter to boost production, which coincided with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demand.
	   Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi was elected the cartel's new
president, replacing the United Arab Emirates' Obaid bin Saif
Al-Nasseri.
	   In his opening speech, Al-Nasseri acknowledged that a ``strong
bearish sentiment has set in'' on the world market.
	   Oil-producing nations, he said, ``are deeply concerned about the
serious problems facing the world's oil industry at the present
time, with weak international prices and an underlying feeling of
insecurity about future prospects'' in the near term.
	   Ministers had pushed back the start of the meeting, originally
scheduled to begin Wednesday, because of deep differences over
issues of extending production cuts and disagreements on production
levels.
	   Iran said it was criticized for its output level, an allegation
it argued was unfair because it isn't overproducing.
	   A senior Iranian delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press that Iran had been asked to cut too much.
When OPEC was determining Iran's production capacity, he said, it
did not take into account two new refineries that came on line in

	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the

	   Iraq has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990

limited amounts of oil under U.N. supervision to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods.

South African lawyer says foreign values don't protect abused
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for a wild-animal exporter
contended Thursday that foreign values regarding humane treatment
of animals don't apply in South Africa.
	   The statement was part of final arguments before Judge Herman
Glas in a two-month custody battle over 30 baby elephants whose
fate has drawn international attention.
	   The lawyer for National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, which is demanding custody of the animals to protect them
from alleged mistreatment, countered that South Africa was no
longer isolated, as it was during apartheid, and must respond to
international values.
	   ``When we deal with the reopening of South Africa to the world
since (the end of apartheid), we must take into account the mores
of other societies,'' said Jaap Roestorf.
	   According to court testimony and videotape, the elephants have
suffered psychological and physical damage while being trained by
Indonesian handlers who have hobbled their legs, poked their skin
into open sores and subjected them to water deprivation and water
torture.
	   The 3- to 6-year old elephants were captured from their families
in neighboring Botswana in August.
	   But Nic van der Walt, representing the exporter, African Game
Services, argued that such treatment was valid under South African
Law which allows castration and branding of farm animals.
	   ``It's not the aim to raise the animals to the level of human
rights,'' van der Walt told the judge.
	   During the court case, elephant experts from Kenya, England and
the United States testified that the Indonesian-style training
could turn the elephants into man-killers.
	   The NSPCA lawyer asked the judge to consider in his decision _
expected on Wednesday _ the outcry both in South Africa and abroad,
where some animal rights groups have threatened a tourism boycott.
	   Last month the NSPCA filed cruelty charges against the owner of
African Game Services, Riccardo Ghiazza. Earlier this week it filed
similar charges against an elephant trainer.
	   The cruelty cases are being prosecuted separately as criminal
matters.
	   Ghiazza's training method has won guarded approval from the
South African government and some conservation groups that have
helped set up a special advisory board to monitor the training.
	   But Roestorf argued that the committee was hastily assembled in
an attempt at damage control.
	   Ghiazza planned to export the elephants to zoos in Basel,
Switzerland; to German zoos in Erfurt and Dresden; and to a safari
park in China.

Baggio, Inter back on track; Rome derby must-win for Lazio
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Roberto Baggio got Internazionale of Milan back on
track in the Champions League. Now, it's time for the club to get
going in Serie A.
	   As Italy's league hits the one-third mark, Inter (4-3-3) is
languishing in a tie for sixth place, 7 points in the standings
behind leader Fiorentina heading into Sunday's action.
	   The defense has been a shambles and the attack inconsistent, due
largely to knee injuries to Baggio and two-time FIFA Player of the
Year Ronaldo.
	   It could all change now.
	   If that star striker pairing can share the field, it can lift
Inter. It took just 25 minutes of the two together after Baggio
came off the bench Wednesday for the club to bury defending
Champions Cup titlist Real Madrid 3-1 as Baggio fired in two late
goals.
	   The win gives Inter the inside track for a quarterfinal berth
and saves embattled coach Luigi Simoni's job.
	   ``Games like that are vital, they are fundamental for a team,''
Baggio said. ``They give you a special kind of confidence that
unite a team. Yes, it could also be the game that changes an entire
season.''
	   The long battle back up the Serie A standings starts against
visiting Salernitana, which has won three of four but still sits
17th in the 18-team league.
	   Baggio and Ronaldo should start side-by-side for only the second
time all season. There should be plenty of space for creative runs
in the weak Salernitana defense, which will be without suspended
sweeper Salvatore Fresi, who Inter traded away earlier two months
ago.
	   After Fiorentina (at Bari Sunday) with 21 points, there's a trio
of clubs tied for second with 18: AS Roma, AC Milan and Juventus of
Turin. AC Parma is another two points back.
	   While Milan squares off with Parma and Juventus travels to
streaking Bologna, Roma looks to end a four-game derby losing skid
when it plays cross-city rival Lazio of Rome at night.
	   The other games in Sunday's 11th round are Empoli vs. Vicenza,
Perugia vs. Piacenza, Udinese vs. Cagliari, and Vicenza vs.
Sampdoria of Genoa.
	   A full house of 80,000 is expected at Rome's Olympic Stadium for
a game that Roma (5-3-2) really wants to win and ninth-place Lazio
(3-4-3) really needs to.
	   While Roma has already beaten powers Fiorentina and Juventus
this season, staking its claim as a title contender, Lazio has lost
three of its last four games and risks falling out of touch with
the leaders.
	   Lazio's biggest problem has been injuries. Forward Christian
Vieri, Italy's top scorer at the World Cup, has missed all but the
first two games and said this week he thinks he'll return in
January. Croat striker Alen Boksic, sidelined since the spring, is
expected to head to the United States next week to have his right
knee examined.
	   Defender Alessandro Nesta has yet to play since hurting his knee
at the World Cup, while Spanish midfielder Ivan De la Pena,
defender Paolo Negro and others have also missed significant chunks
of time.

Iraq's oldest refinery deteriorates without spare parts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAG1 101-102
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Plumes of smoke and steam covered the aging
and rusty maze of pipes and metal towers of Iraq's Doura refinery
as engineers worked to meet government orders of 100,000 barrels
per day of gasoline and other products.
	   ``We are fighting against tremendous odds. We do everything we
can but still we cannot meet the target sometimes,'' engineer Basel
Mohammed Niyaz told reporters Thursday during a government tour to
show the impact of U.N. sanctions on Iraq's oldest refinery.
	   Under agreements with the United Nations, Iraq on Wednesday
received the first spare parts for its oil industry since the 1991
Gulf war. But the workers complained all these were for production
and not for refineries.
	   ``We have used all the spares in our stores and cannibalized
units which were beyond repair. Things will be tough without new
equipment,'' said Ali Jameel Ahmed, a director at the Doura
refinery.
	   Niyaz gave a long list of spare parts needed to keep the
refinery running _ pumps, compressors, chemicals, pipes, joints,
steel plates ``and in fact all kinds of machines.''
	   Quality of the refinery's output is deteriorating, Niyaz said,
adding that the high octane gas the refinery churns out ``is in no
way comparable to that produced in other countries.''
	   Niyaz said the unit producing 5,000 barrels of jet fuel was out
of order. ``Other sections may stop if we do not get the needed
spare parts in the coming few months,'' he said.
	   Ihsan Hadi, head of quality and control unit, said his employees
relied on their intuition in measuring temperatures, quality and
capacity.
	   ``We lack gloves, proper overalls and masks,'' he said.
	   The refinery, in the eastern outskirts of Baghdad, was bombed
during the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war but damage, according to Niyaz,
was repairable.
	   Doura suffered extensive damage, Niyaz said, during the 1991
Gulf War over Kuwait. Production came to a standstill, Niyaz added,
and the refinery's hi-tech control units were leveled.
	   Heaps of scrap metal dotted open spaces in the 5,000 square
meter (yard) refinery. Workers in shabby clothes and torn shoes
were still rebuilding two storage tanks destroyed in the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   Ahmad said the Doura facility was now facing another problem
from the crude it receives from Kirkuk in northern Iraq, which is
of lower quality than the oil that Doura was built to handle in the
1950s.
	   Doura is one of three refineries in Iraq. One in the country's
north and one in the south each have a capacity of 200,000 barrels
of refined products a day.
	   The average monthly salary for Doura's 1,800 workers is 25,000
dinars, about dlrs 15.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Investment in Jordan is expected to have
increased by 32 percent by the end of the year, more than three
times the growth in investment in 1997, a government official said
Thursday.
	   Muntaser Oklah, the head of the Investment Promotion
Corporation, said that investment had grown by 459 million
Jordanian dinars (dlrs 646 million) in the first 10 months of 1998
and was expected to reach 500 million dinars (dlrs 704 million) by
the end of December.
	   He put the dramatic rise down to last year's amendment to the
Investment Promotion Law, which enabled foreign investors to own
100 percent of a Jordanian company.
	   In 1997, investment increased by nine percent.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 1,810.3 points at the end of the trading week, down 2.3
percent from the previous week, a weekly report said Thursday.
	   The report of the National Investments Co. said the market had
initially reacted positively to a government decision to allow
investment companies to lend money to stock exchange investors.
	   But the market fell after newspaper reports on Wednesday said
that the governor of Central Bank, Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah,
had resigned in protest against the measure.
	   By Thursday the governor had neither denied nor confirmed the
reports.
	   Sheik Salem is reported to hold the opinion that the market is
not short of liquidity, as many economists claim, and that the
measure would eventually backfire.
	   Further measures were needed to revive the market, such as
privatization and incentives for foreign investment, the National
Investments Co. said in its report.
	   Some 163.66 million shares traded hands this week, 129.54
percent higher than the previous one, the report said. The value of
these shares also jumped by 141.84 percent, reaching 30.6 million
dinars (dlrs 101.32 million).
	   Of the 69 companies traded, 13 closed higher, and 45 closed
lower, and 11 were unchanged. The rest of the 77 listed companies
were not traded.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover increased on the
Amman stock exchange this week, a market report said Thursday.
	   Brokers attributed the rise to new entrants to the market and
progress in the implementation of the latest Israeli-Palestinian
agreement.
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
nudged up by 2.15 percent to 162.89 points.
	   Shares of industrial firms rose by 5.81 percent, commercial
banks by 1.15 percent, services sector by 1.13 percent and the
insurance sector by 0.67 percent.
	   Turnover increased by 88.1 percent to 6.64 million dinars (dlrs
9.3 million), the report said.
	   It said stocks of 94 firms were traded.

Schroeder pledges to put shoulder to the wheel of EU budget reform
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BRU105-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
pledged Thursday to conclude an overhaul of the European Union's
budget when his country holds the EU presidency in the first half
of next year. He again demanded cuts in Germany's EU membership
fee.
	   On a visit to EU headquarters, Schroeder said reform was
imperative if the EU is to fulfil plans to bring in up to 12 new
members but stressed it was to early to set a date for their entry.
	   ``I don't think we can say with any degree of precision when
this process (of enlargement) can be completed,'' Schroeder said
after talks with European Commission President Jacques Santer.
	   The EU has begun formal membership talks with Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus, whose
applications to join are the most advanced. Even they are unlikely
to get in before the middle of next decade.
	   The current 15 EU governments must first implement financial and
institutional reforms.
	   Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden want to see their
payments to EU coffers lowered. Germany estimates its net payment
totals 22 billion marks (some dlrs 10 billion) a year and wants
that cut by one-third.
	   ``We want a fair distribution of the burden,'' Schroeder told a
press conference.
	   Schroeder promised to complete dead-in-the-water talks to craft
a new EU budget within three months of Germany taking over the
six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1.
	   He said financial reform must occur through redirecting
spending, not by raising the maximum limit on national
contributions of 1.27 percent of a member's gross national product.
	   Proposals by the European Commission for deep cuts in farm
subsidies and retargeting funds for poor regions have divided the
EU governments.
	   Those reforms are part of a wider EU overhaul. Changes in
decision-making are to prevent an EU of two dozen members from
choking on bureaucracy. Controversial proposals call for more
majority voting.
	   Schroeder said Germany will not tackle institutional reforms,
leaving that for Finland which holds the EU presidency in the
second half of 1999.
	   Financial reform centers on proposals to cut farm subsidies by
up to 30 percent. So-called ``structural funds'' _ worth 30.5
billion ECUs (dlrs 33 billion) this year in aid to the EU's poorer
regions _ would not increase dramatically but be redirected toward
new members from Eastern Europe.
	   These funds are a lifeline for poor regions, especially in
Spain, Portugal and Greece who oppose cuts in their share.

Report: Ukrainian police officer kills alleged attacker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Authorities in Ukraine's port of Sevastopol
are investigating an alleged attack on the city's police chief in
which the officer shot one man to death and wounded another, a news
report said Thursday.
	   The incident occurred Wednesday on the outskirts of Sevastopol
when Lt. Gen. Vyvat Biloborodov, the head of Sevastopol's Interior
Ministry branch, fell into an argument with two young men, the
independent UNIAN news agency said.
	   It said the officer, who suspected the two of stealing audio
equipment, later fired from his pistol, killing one of the men and
seriously wounding the other.
	   The local Interior Ministry's press service declined to provide
further details on the case, UNIAN noted. It said authorities have
launched a criminal investigation focusing on an alleged attack on
the general.

FIFA boss receives top SAfrican honor

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Thursday lobbied the head of world soccer on behalf of South
Africa's bid to win the 2006 World Cup.
	   Hours later, FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter -- a longtime
supporter of an African World Cup -- gave one of his strongest
endorsements yet for the continent.
	   ``I am fighting for the World Cup of 2006 top come to Africa,''
Blatter told reporters. FIFA ``has the responsibility of giving
(it) to an African country,'' he said.
	   Blatter came to South Africa to receive the country's highest
award to a foreigner, the Order of Good Hope, on a visit originally
scheduled six weeks ago but delayed because Mandela was ill.
	   During the ceremony at Mandela's residence here, the South
African president extolled his nation's cause.
	   ``I told him, `I will support the best African bid' -- and he
understood what I meant,'' Blatter said. Morocco, Egypt and Nigeria
are also considering proposals, but South Africa is considered the
favorite on the continent.
	   Other frontrunners are Germany and France, and a bid may come
from Brazil. Countries must declare their intention to bid at the
end of this year. July 31 is the deadline for the presentation of
bid documents, and the FIFA board will make its decision in March
2000.
	   Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African
Football, said at the same news conference that he would ensure the
African countries unite behind a single candidate.
	   Blatter said an African bid must live up to FIFA's standards.
They include proper stadium security and comfort; solid training
facilities and team accommodations; a good transportation and
hospital system; and strong support by the government and
population.

Somalian hospital closed by war reopens under new municipal
</HEADLINE>
administration &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Two years after war shut it down,
Mogadishu's second largest hospital reopened Thursday, under the
new municipal administration set up in the capital in an agreement
between former rival faction leaders.
	   Mogadishu administration officials inaugurated the renewed
hospital in a festive ceremony that included a musical police band,
poem recitations and other artist performances.
	   The fully renovated hospital, which was the capital's most
luxurious before the eruption of civil war in 1991, has been
rebuilt and equipped fully, with two operating theatres, generators
and water wells to supply constant electricity and water.
	   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the renovations
were financed by Somali businessmen at a cost of dlrs 100,000.
	   The municipal administration was set up in mid-October after
north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed reached agreement
with his main rival in the south of the formerly divided city,
Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
	   Speaking at the ceremony Thursday, Ali Mahdi thanked the Somali
businessmen who financed the project and said he believed it would
encourage more Somalis to participate in the noble task of
rebuilding the ravaged capital.
	   Somalia has had no central government since rival factions
conspired in 1991 to oust President Mohamed Siad Barre and then
turned on each other, carving up the country into a series of
militia-controlled fiefdoms.
	   Col. Abdi Qeybdid, commander of Mogadishu's newly established
police force, said that police training would conclude this month
and his men will soon start operating to bring security and
stability back to the wartorn capital.
	   Hospital Director Sheikdon Salad Elmi said 50 percent of
hospital operations will be only for Mogadishu's police force, and
the other 50 percent will be for civilian use.
	   He said the hospital has 10 full-time doctors and 50 nurses.
	   In recent years, there have been only two hospitals servicing
Mogadishu's 1.5 million residents.

Parliament chamber approves coal mining restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's lower parliament chamber on
Thursday approved a restructuring plan for the country's ailing
coal mining industry that calls for reducing production and cutting
jobs.
	   The Sejm voted 218-67 with 102 abstentions for the measure. Most
of the support came from the rightist Solidarity-led governing
alliance, with much of the leftist opposition abstaining.
	   It now needs approval from the upper chamber of parliament and
then the signature of President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leftist.
	   Restructuring bloated, loss-making industries such as mining,
steel and transportation is part of Poland's strategy to reform its
economy after decades of communist rule and prepare for membership
in the European Union in the next five years.
	   The coal mining restructuring calls for reducing production from
137 million tons last year to 110 million tons in 2002. Wage
increases would be limited and the number of jobs would be cut by
more than 40 percent _ from 245,000 now to 138,000 in three years.
	   Only 30,000 of the more than 105,000 miners losing their jobs
would be laid off, with the rest retiring, said Czeslaw Sobierajski
of the ruling Solidarity bloc. Retrenched miners would have a
choice of retraining, severance packages or paid leave, he said.
	   The plan also calls for restructuring debts incurred by mines by
writing them off, converting debt into shares or arranging
installment plans for repayment.
	   Half of the 15 billion zloty (dlrs 4.36 billion) total cost of
the coal mining restructuring would be canceled debts.
	   Jan Kisielinski of the leftist opposition said the government
failed to consider workers in mining-related companies who will
lose their jobs because of the reform. He estimated the number
could exceed 400,000.
	   Coal mining, once the country's leading hard-currency earner
during communist times, is still heavily subsidized under Poland's
market reforms that began in 1990.
	   The government hopes coal mining will turn a profit of 410
million zloty (dlrs 117 million) in 2001, according to the state
mining agency.

Wenger needs quick solutions to Arsenal problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ What's gone wrong at Arsenal?
	   Ousted from the Champions Cup on Wednesday after losing 1-0 at
home to French club Lens, the Gunners haven't scored for four games
and, with players injured and suspended, fans are wondering why
manager Arsene Wenger hasn't acted to strengthen the squad.
	   They're also asking why he sold Ian Wright.
	   Last season Wenger led Arsenal to a league and FA Cup double and
his team is in third place in the Premier League this time with
every chance of making up Aston Villa's four-point lead.
	   But recent results have shown that the Gunners don't have enough
good players in reserve to make up for the losses of stars such as
Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, who have all
missed recent games through injury and suspension.
	   And now the team will have to do without injured captain and
center back Tony Adams for three games. The man around whom the
Gunners defense is built is suffering a recurrence of back problems
that have dogged him in recent seasons and Wenger has sent him away
for two to three weeks rest.
	   On Sunday, a patched-up Arsenal team faces in-form Middlesbrough
at Highbury and another loss, or a goal-less performance, will add
to the pressure building up on Wenger.
	   His sale of Wright to West Ham during the summer seemed like a
logical move as the player was age 34 and Wenger had Bergkamp,
Nicolas Anelka and Christophe Wreh to choose from. But Wright has
regained his place on the England team since his move across London
to West Ham for whom he has scored six Premier League goals while
the Arsenal strikers have dried up.
	   Middlesborough, which places sixth and is two points behind
Arsenal, has the option of recalling Paul Gascoigne after
suspension but may keep an unchanged team after last weekend's 2-0
victory over Coventry. Bryan Robson's team is unbeaten in six
league games and has the hottest scorer, Colombian Hamilton Ricard
who has netted 12 league and cup goals.
	   Despite last week's 4-2 loss at home to Liverpool, leader Villa
should be confident of a victory at second from last Nottingham
Forest on Saturday.
	   John Gregory's team still has a three-point lead over second
place Manchester United which has an extra day to recover from its
thrilling 3-3 tie with Barcelona in the Champions League on
Wednesday. United's game with fifth place Leeds at Old Trafford was
put back from Saturday to Sunday.
	   Chelsea's impressive climb on the back of an unbeaten league run
of 11 games should continue with a home win over Sheffield
Wednesday at Stamford Bridge. Gianluca Vialli's team, which is
fourth and level on points with Arsenal, has also avoided defeat in
seven League Cup and Cup Winners Cup games so that streak has
extended to 18 going into Saturday's match.
	   West Ham climbed to sixth after last week's 2-0 win at Derby and
faces another in-form team, Tottenham, at Upton Park.
	   Under George Graham, Spurs have moved up steadily to 10th in the
20-club standings as well as posting a League Cup victory at
Liverpool.
	   Newcastle likely will give a debut to 7 million pound (dlrs 11.5
million) signing Duncan Ferguson against Wimbledon although the
lanky Scottish forward won't be able to link up with Alan Shearer
yet because the England striker is recovering from an ankle injury.
	   After sliding down to last place and firing Roy Hodgson as
manager, Blackburn now has a tough trip to Liverpool on Sunday.
	   Gerard Houllier's Liverpool team followed up last weekend's
brilliant victory at Villa by being outplayed 3-1 in the UEFA Cup
by Spanish club Celta Viga on Tuesday and Houliier doesn't know
which Liverpool will perform against Rovers at Anfield.
	   Southampton hopes to celebrate finally climbing away from last
place by beating erratic Derby at home while Saturday's other games
are Charlton vs. Everton and Coventry vs. Leicester.
	   Division One leader Sunderland goes to fourth place Sheffield
United while Watford, which has climbed to second under former
England manager Graham Taylor, visits Terry Venables' Crystal
Palace.
	   Highlight of the Scottish action is the League Cup final between
Rangers and St. Johnstone at Celtic Park on Sunday. When they met
in the league two weeks ago, Rangers won 7-0.

Ex-Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko plans to form political party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
said Thursday he was setting up his own political party that would
take part in the parliamentary elections next fall.
	   Kiriyenko left open the question of forging a possible union
with other liberal parties and movements, according to the Interfax
news agency. He gave no details about his platform or the name of
the party.
	   Some liberal leaders see the 36-year-old Kiriyenko as a strong
potential leader of a new, broad reformist movement.
	   Galvanized by the recent killing of Galina Starovoitova, a
prominent liberal lawmaker, Russia's scattered pro-reform parties
have renewed talks about a possible alliance, but no concrete steps
have followed.
	   Kiriyenko led the Cabinet for four months before President Boris
Yeltsin ousted him in the wake of Aug. 17 decision to devalue the
ruble and default on government debts.

Former Nazi charged as accessory in deaths of 17,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ State prosecutors on Thursday charged
a 79-year-old former Nazi soldier as an accessory in the deaths of
17,000 people, mostly Jews, in November 1943 at the Majdanek
concentration camp.
	   The Ukrainian-born suspect, arrested at his home in Stuttgart in
March, is accused of participating in the systematic killings,
dubbed Operation Harvest Festival, while he was a Nazi officer and
Gestapo agent based in Lemberg, present-day Ukraine.
	   Prosecutors did not identify the man in a statement announcing
the charges. However, German security sources previously identified
the man as Alfons Goetzfried.
	   At the time of his arrest, prosecutors said the suspect had
admitted to having personally shot 500 adults and children. He is
accused of helping load weapons for the other killings, a
prosecutor's said.
	   Despite his alleged direct role in hundreds of deaths, he was
charged as an accessory because he did not have a command position,
the statement said.
	   Investigation against the suspect continues in the additional
deaths of some 45,000 people near Lemberg, Ukraine and near Lublin,
Poland.
	   The suspect volunteered for the German army in 1941 and first
worked as a horse caretaker. He later became a translator with the
Caucasian Company, then a member of the security police in Lemberg
in 1943.
	   He was imprisoned in a Siberian camp for 13 years after the war,
and lived in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan until 1991,
when he moved to Germany and became a citizen.
	   Prosecutors said at the time of his arrest that the suspect had
been tried previously for war crimes by British and Soviet
authorities during the 1950s and 1960s.
	   No date has been set for a trial.

Hospital closed by war reopens under new municipal administration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Two years after war shut it down,
Mogadishu's second largest hospital reopened Thursday, under the
new municipal administration set up in the capital in an agreement
between former rival faction leaders.
	   Mogadishu administration officials inaugurated the renewed
hospital in a festive ceremony that included a musical police band,
poem recitations and other artist performances.
	   The fully renovated hospital, which was the capital's most
luxurious before the eruption of civil war in 1991, has been
rebuilt and equipped fully, with two operating theatres, generators
and water wells to supply constant electricity and water.
	   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the renovations
were financed by Somali businessmen at a cost of dlrs 100,000.
	   The municipal administration was set up in mid-October after
north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed reached agreement
with his main rival in the south of the formerly divided city,
Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
	   Speaking at the ceremony Thursday, Ali Mahdi thanked the Somali
businessmen who financed the project and said he believed it would
encourage more Somalis to participate in the noble task of
rebuilding the ravaged capital.
	   Somalia has had no central government since rival factions
conspired in 1991 to oust President Mohamed Siad Barre and then
turned on each other, carving up the country into a series of
militia-controlled fiefdoms.
	   Col. Abdi Qeybdid, commander of Mogadishu's newly-established
police force, said during the ceremony that police training would
conclude this month and his men will soon start operating to bring
security and stability back to the war-torn capital.
	   Hospital Director Sheikdon Salad Elmi said 50 percent of
hospital operations will be only for Mogadishu's police force, and
the other 50 percent will be for civilian use.
	   He said the hospital has 10 full-time doctors and 50 nurses.
	   In recent years, there have been only two hospitals servicing
Mogadishu's 1.5 million residents.

Ukraine's government revises inflation figure for 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government more than doubled its
projected inflation figure for 1999 to 20 percent, while parliament
demanded that the government increase revenues in next year's
budget, officials said Thursday.
	   The developments might complicate Ukraine's talks with the
International Monetary Fund, which is sending a mission to Kiev
next week to check the country's compliance with the terms of a
dlrs 2.2 billion loan approved in the fall.
	   The government's revision of the 1999 budget came after
President Leonid Kuchma criticized the budget draft on Wednesday,
saying it was based on figures worked out before the effects of
Russia's financial crisis hit Ukraine.
	   Kuchma said the inflation figure should be around 20 percent
annually _ instead of the projected 7.8 percent _ adding that the
Cabinet should either readjust or abandon trading controls that
limit broad fluctuations in the national hryvna currency.
	   In recent days, Kuchma has spoken in favor of a floating rate
for the hryvna, now trading at about 3.43 to the U.S. dollar, and
for printing more money, which is strongly opposed by the IMF.
	   The National Bank had only planned to print 900 million hryvna
(dlrs 262 million at the current rate) in 1999, basing the figure
on a 7.8 percent rate of inflation and a hryvna rate of about 4 to
the dollar.
	   But Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Thursday the
government is now projecting an inflation rate of ``no less'' than
20 percent in 1999, the Interfax and the UNIAN news agencies said.
Inflation has been nearly 13 percent so far this year.
	   The budget deficit figure was left unchanged at 0.6 percent of
Ukraine's gross domestic product, Pustovoitenko said.
	   The original 1999 budget draft, which Cabinet presented to
parliament on Nov. 17, projected that the economy will grow by 1
percent next year, the first growth since Ukraine won independence
with the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   It also provided for 23.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 6.74 billion at
the current rate) in budget revenues.
	   The draft is likely to face strong criticism in parliament,
dominated by centrist and leftist opposition members who favor more
state subsidies to ease Ukraine's social tensions. Parliament is
due to hold its first vote on the budget draft around Dec. 1.
	   On Thursday, parliament's influential budget committee demanded
that the planned budget revenues be raised by nearly 20 billion
hryvna (dlrs 5.84 billion) and the additional funds be used to pay
back wages and pensions, subsidize ailing regions and support
Ukraine's health and education systems.
	   Committee chief and centrist opposition leader Julia Tymoshenko
said the revenues could be increased by raising transit fees for
the transportation of oil and gas through Ukraine and the use of
its air space by foreign air companies, Interfax reported.

Pakistan has surplus power it can sell to India but not anytime
</HEADLINE>
soon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan has about 2,000 megawatts of
surplus power it could sell to India, but that won't happen anytime
soon, according to a government statement issued Thursday at the
end of two days of technical talks between the uneasy neighbors.
	   The statement said there was a considerable amount of work still
to be done, studies to be carried out and meetings to be held
before a power purchase agreement could be reached.
	   The next step will be to investigate an agreement-in-principle,
something that will be done at the next round of talks to be held
in New Delhi. There was no date set for the talks.
	   But selling power to India would be a difficult task, according
to the statement. It would require a large transmission network.
	   Initially Pakistan is offering to sell India up to 500 megawatts
of power. Construction of power lines on both sides of the border
would take about six months.
	   A power purchase agreement, if it were to be signed, would be a
major step forward in relations between Pakistan and India, often
hostile neighbors who have fought three wars in the past 51 years.
	   Both countries exploded underground nuclear devices in May and
declared themselves nuclear powers, generating fears of a nuclear
arms race on the volatile South Asian subcontinent.
	   A nervous international community has been pressing both
Pakistan and India to sit at the negotiation table and develop
agreements that would build confidence, expand trade and economic
ties and reduce tension.

Report: Singapore patriarch criticizes Gore for Malaysia speech
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew says
critical remarks by U.S. Vice President Al Gore during his recent
visit to Malaysia were unnecessary, Singapore TV reported Thursday.
	   In an interview with BBC Radio this week, Lee reportedly said
that commenting publicly on domestic affairs of a country is just
not the style in this part of the world.
	   Lee, who was prime minister for 31 years, still wields enormous
influence in Singapore. The city-state of 3.1 million people is an
important regional ally of the United States.
	   In Kuala Lumpur in mid-November for a Pacific Rim summit
meeting, Gore lauded the ``brave people of Malaysia'' who have
demanded democracy as part of a reform movement launched by Anwar
Ibrahim, the former deputy prime minister now on trial on
corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar has denied the
charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   The Malaysian government later called in the U.S. ambassador to
stress its position ``that Gore's speech was an incitement of
lawlessness and not simply a call of democracy as claimed.''
	   Lee reportedly objected to Gore's lack of diplomatic tact,
adding that the same point could have been made in a different
form.
	   Commenting on the future of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, a regional political and economic forum, Lee said it will
endure because it is held together by strong common interests.
	   ``We need peace, stability and cooperation among ourselves and
eventually (to) bring back foreign capital and investments, which
is the way to get back to rapid growth,'' Lee said.
	   ``We are all undergoing a very harsh period of stress so things
are said which are not wise,'' he added.
	   ``We are small countries, some nine, eventually 10 countries in
Southeast Asia, that have to deal with China, the U.S. and Japan,
and maybe in 20 years time, Russia,'' Lee said.
	   ``If we are going to have any weight at all to what we say to
them, and (keep) our bargaining position when negotiating, we have
to get together.''

Disappointment dampens Barcelona's 100th birthday party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ FC Barcelona's 100th birthday party
promises to be a subdued one.
	   Heading into a weekend of commemorative festivities, the Catalan
titans are licking their wounds after being knocked out of European
soccer in a nail-biting 3-3 Champions League tie at home to
Manchester United on Wednesday.
	   The frustrated home crowd nevertheless gave their squad a
standing ovation at the end of the match that showcased Barcelona's
potential for good attacking football, including a fabulous
overhead goal by Rivaldo.
	   ``It is really painful, but life goes on,'' Dutch coach Louis
Van Gaal said.
	   ``When we beat Atletico de Madrid, it will hurt less and we can
recover from this loss,'' he added in reference to his team's next
appointment in its 12th-round Spanish league game at home on
Saturday
	   Barcelona, currently third in the standings with 19 points, will
don vintage-style red and blue jerseys against sixth-placed
Atletico in the game that officially inaugurates the 100th
anniversary festivities.
	   But this time Barcelona will be without the services of Rivaldo,
however, because of too many yellow cards, further deepening the
woes of a team already affected by injuries to Jose Guardiola,
Winston Bogarde, Luis Enrique, Abelardo Fernandez and Miguel Angel
Nadal.
	   The other perennial powerhouse of Spanish football, Real Madrid,
currently in fourth place, has the weekend off as it travels to
Japan in preparation for the World Club Championship against the
Brazilian team Vasco da Gama on Dec. 1 in Tokyo.
	   Real Madrid is smarting too, having lost its Champions League
game Wednesday to Inter Milan by a score of 3-1, although it is
still alive in the tournament.
	   The Spanish league game that Real Madrid was supposed to play
this weekend against Salamanca has been postponed until Jan. 6.
	   But the best game of the weekend is shaping up to be
second-place Celta de Vigo at home against No. 5 Valencia on
Sunday.
	   This year's surprise revelation Celta is on a roll in both
league and European play, its latest victory coming Tuesday with a
3-1 win against English giant Liverpool in a UEFA Cup match.
	   But against Valencia, Celta will be playing without star forward
Michel Salgado, who is ineligible because of a red card in last
weekend's Spanish league game against Alaves. Also, Russian
midfielder Alexander Mostovoi is doubtful because of injury.
	   Nevertheless, Valencia's respectable fifth place is tempered by
a doubtful away record of just one win this season.
	   First-place Real Mallorca, led by Argentine coach Hector Cuper,
travels to the Basque country to take on struggling Athletic de
Bilbao, which is in 15th place and flirting with demotion.
	   In other games on Sunday, lower-half Betis faces struggling
Tenerife, whose coach Juanma Lillo is facing calls to resign.
	   Extremadura, with just two goals scored all season, takes on
mid-table Espanyol, Valladolid hosts Deportivo La Coruna, Villareal
takes on Alaves, Zaragoza faces Oviedo and Racing plays Real
Sociedad.

European stock exchange leaders plan for new united market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With Europe's single currency about to debut,
leaders of nine European stock exchanges this week hope to forge
plans for a united market that one day could rival Wall Street.
	   The group is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding at a
meeting in Paris on Friday on how to construct a pan-European stock
exchange.
	   Most European exchanges reacted skeptically _ and some nervously
_ to the announcement this summer of an Anglo-German market by the
London and Frankfurt exchanges.
	   Since then, Paris and smaller European exchanges have realized
they will be left out if London and Frankfurt won't let them in on
their plans. The new European currency, the euro, which begins Jan.
1, 1999, has also been a major impetus toward the creation of a
pan-European market.
	   ``There is now an unstoppable movement toward a single European
exchange,'' said Dr. Patrick Dixon, a London-based international
analyst who studies trends in financial technology. ``We can argue
about the date but not the process.
	   It remains unclear, however, whether Frankfurt and London will
agree to modify their alliance plans to include other participants
on equal terms and just how big the new exchange would be.
	   In addition to Paris, London and Frankfurt, the heads of
exchanges from Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Madrid, Stockholm and
Zurich will participate.
	   Two days before Friday's Paris meeting, the Amsterdam, Brussels
and Luxembourg stock exchanges said they had formed a pact allowing
members access to each other's markets starting Jan. 4.
	   However, Raymond Salet, spokesman for the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange, said the Dutch are going to Friday's meeting about a
large European market with fairly low expectations.
	   ``We still have to solve many technicalities,'' said Salet.
``We're talking about different exchange systems, different laws
and tax regulations. It's not that easy to establish a European
exchange.''
	   Still, a single European market would have a number of
attractive features, including reduction of trading costs and
greater chances for companies to raise capital.
	   Peter Marsh, head of European sales and trading at Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corp, said the proposed European stock exchange is
a good way to eliminate costly fragmentation.
	   ``I think it's quite exciting and a logical step forward,'' he
said, predicting a move toward a more sector-based approach in
equity trading in Europe, away from a country-based approach.
	   For smaller exchanges, the prospect of a unified market means
companies would have greater chances to raise capital.
	   In Spain all of the country's exchanges, including Madrid but
especially the regional markets Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia have
expressed interest in joining the nine-country alliance.
	   ``Spain already has the advantage of working from different
cities in the same market,'' said a spokesman for Bilbao's stock
exchange. ``It's important that when you talk of Spain, you're not
just referring to Madrid.''
	   Leo Hug, spokesman for the Zurich stock exchange, said although
technically such a market is a way off, bringing into line
different rules of operation and bank holidays could save a lot of
money.
	   ``At the end of the day, why not?'' said Hug.

Murder or suicide? The mysterious death of a computer hacker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BER104, of Nov. 6 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ He was a gifted computer whiz _ one of the best,
one who'd made the jump from illegal tinkering to the legitimate,
potentially lucrative business of making codes crack-proof from
hackers like himself.
	   At 26, Boris Floriciz seemed headed for a great future. He'd
just finished his computer science degree. International firms
sought him as a consultant. He was happy, say his friends, who
cannot believe he would take his own life.
	   Boris was found hanging from a tree in a Berlin park on Oct. 22,
his belt around his neck and his feet dragging the ground. Was it
suicide, as police suspect? Or homicide?
	   The mystery of his death has drawn attention even outside the
tight-knit world of hackers, largely because it touches the
techno-wizardry of beating encryption codes and offers a glimpse
into the murkier side of the trade. Spies and criminals need
talented hackers, too, as espionage and black market goods become
increasingly high tech.
	   Boris' friends wonder if he had become a threat to someone on
the wrong side of the business, leading to his death.
	   ``That was not a personal decision,'' Andy Mueller-Maguhn, a
friend and fellow member of the Chaos Computer Club said. ``For
sure not. That was murder.''
	   From childhood, Boris looked destined to be an engineer. He was
always taking things apart to see how they worked. ``Radios,
television, clocks, the lawn mower _ nothing was safe from him,''
his father told Stern magazine.
	   He dissembled a telephone booth to get at computer data inside.
He was the first hacker to crack the microchips on Deutsche Telekom
telephone cards, used at pay phones in Germany. His homemade card
reloaded as the credit ran out.
	   After getting caught in 1995 and sentenced to probation, Boris
``felt the need to draw the line,'' says Mueller-Maguhn.
	   He joined Chaos, a 10-year-old group of computer devotees, and
he went back to college, earning his diploma in September by
developing a scrambler to encode telephone calls on high-speed,
digital lines.
	   German media reports say Boris also was working on cracking
decoders for pay television _ a booming business spreading across
Europe. One of the key players is Robert Murdoch, whose digital
broadcasting research firm NDS Ltd. contacted Boris two years ago
about being a code-design consultant.
	   ``He was an exceptionally talented engineer, said Margot Field,
spokeswoman at the firm's London headquarters. NDS wanted to hire
him but couldn't move forward because Boris hadn't yet graduated or
completed his compulsory military service. The firm's last contact
with him was in June.
	   NDS apparently wasn't the only one interested in Boris.
	   His father says Boris talked several times about being
approached by characters he suspected worked for spy agencies,
believed to have mined the hacker world for talent in the past.
	   Just a few months ago, members of Chaos say, Germany's spy
agency tried to hire a hacker to get secrets out of Iran's military
computers. The contact vanished when the hacker got Chaos involved,
the club says.
	   Boris might also have attracted black marketeers of counterfeit
chips for telephone cards and mobile phones. Deutsche Telekom
estimates it loses millions of marks (dollars) each year from
counterfeit cards. And industry officials worry that TV decoder
chips offer gangsters even bigger profits on the black market.
	   Money wasn't a lure for Boris, his friends say. He preferred to
post his research on the Internet for all to see _ and use.
	   ``It was all the same to him if others raked in the bucks from
what he developed,'' one friend, Daniel, told Stern. ``The main
thing for him was that he had proven what he was great at.''
	   Mueller-Maguhn says Boris's open attitude about his work might
have threatened those who didn't want competitors horning in on
their business.
	   ``He had lots of jobs, but he didn't want to become a slave of
one company,'' he said. ``Maybe that was a problem.''
	   Boris left his mother's apartment on Oct. 17 about 2 p.m. She
didn't think he'd be gone long, because he didn't take his laptop.
	   He never came back. Calls to his mobile phone went unanswered.
	   A passer-by found his body five days later. His phone, keys, ID
card and money were with him, evidence police say points to
suicide. No sign of a struggle. Nothing stolen. No drugs.
	   Detectives are waiting for test results _ fingerprint fragments
or chemical traces _ before making a final determination.
	   The Chaos Computer Club is putting together its own report,
which it plans to release at its annual convention Dec. 27-29 in
Berlin. Already, the death notice on the club's Web site states
what Boris's friends believe happened:
	   ``The circumstances under which he disappeared and his
extraordinary capabilities lead us to the conclusion that he became
a homicide victim.''

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The presidents of Bulgaria and Georgia
discussed a Black Sea ferry link between their countries and
military and police cooperation during talks Thursday.
	   Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov arrived in Georgia on
Thursday on a two-day visit.
	   Stoyanov and Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze discussed
plans to open a ferry link between Georgian and Bulgarian Black Sea
ports early next year, as well as contacts between their military
and law-enforcement structures.
	   They were the first bilateral talks at the presidential level
since Georgia gained independence with the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Following the talks, Georgian and Bulgarian officials signed
agreements on avoiding double taxation and on joint action against
drug-trafficking and other crime.
	   On Friday, Stoyanov is expected to visit the Georgian ports of
Poti and Supsa that will handle oil coming from the rich Caspian
Sea fields in Azerbaijan through Georgia and further to Europe.

Sacked army chief says his replacement ``illegal''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Yugoslavia's former army chief,
fired by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, said Thursday the
move was ``illegal.''
	   Milosevic fired Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic on
Tuesday, replacing him with a neo-communist supporter, follwoing a
running dispute over the country's strategy and the crisis in
Kosovo.
	   Perisic said in a statement carried by the independent Beta news
agency that he was sacked ``without consultation, in an
inappropriate and illegal manner.''
	   He said Yugoslavia's ``current leadership is against those with
high integrity and who are thinking with their own heads.''
	   In the strongly worded statement, Perisic also said he was
rejecting the ``non-existent post'' of adviser to the Yugoslav
Prime Minister, which Milosevic offered to him after sacking.
	   ``I remain at the disposal of my army, country and the people,''
Perisic concluded.
	   Recently, Perisic indirectly denounced Milosevic's defiant and
isolationist policies toward the West and criticized his hard-line
stand on Kosovo _ the Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are
fighting for independence _ saying the conflict was partly the
result of ``certain politicians' wish to stay in power.''
	   Although he never commented specifically on political issues,
Perisic was believed to be intent on keeping the army as neutral as
possible in Kosovo.
	   Independent Belgrade media have reported that Perisic was an
opponent of the neo-Communist party run by Milosevic's wife,
Mirjana Markovic. His replacement, Gen. Lt. Dragoljub Ojdanic is
reportedly close to her party, whose officials have recently
infiltrated Yugoslavia's top security posts.
	   There have been growing rumors in Belgrade that Milosevic and
his wife feared a coup attempt by Perisic and Jovica Stanisic, the
secret police chief. Stanisic, the second most powerful man in
Yugoslavia, was dismissed earlier this month and also was replaced
by a neo-communist.
	   Officials in Montenegro, the independent-minded republic that
with Serbia forms Yugoslavia, said Perisic's sacking heralds a
possible violent crackdown against its pro-Western leadership.
	   Milosevic's spokesman Ivica Dacic, however, denied Thursday that
Perisic was sacked, saying he was only transferred to another duty
in ``a normal and legal procedure.''

Hong Kong's reserves record slight increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's foreign reserves edged up to U.S.
dlrs 88.7 billion in October, the territory's de facto central bank
announced Thursday.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in a statement that
foreign currency assets rose slightly from the U.S. dlrs 88.4
billion recorded a month earlier ``due to investment gains.''
	   Total foreign currency assets still remain the third largest in
the world after Japan's and China's, and represent ``over seven
times the currency in circulation,'' the statement added.
	   In October, the HKMA announced a U.S. dlrs 4.4 billion drop in
reserves due to the government's unprecedented intervention in
financial markets.
	   The government scooped up shares and futures contracts in
mid-August in an effort to drive up share prices to levels at which
speculators _ who bet the market would fall _ would be stuck with
huge losses.
	   The climax came Aug. 28, when turnover on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange hit a high of 79 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10.1
billion).
	   The government claimed victory and later introduced a series of
regulations to restrict speculative activity and stabilize the
markets.

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras made tennis history
Thursday when Marcelo Rios pulled out of the ATP Tour World
Championship, giving Sampras the No. 1 ranking for a record sixth
year in a row.
	   Rios pulled out with a back injury before his match against Greg
Rusedski.
	   Rusedski, himself an alternate, will play Albert Costa, the
second alternate.
	   Rios was the only man who could have threatened Sampras for the
No. 1 ranking. By pulling out of the season-ending championship,
Rios allowed Sampras to retain the top spot without having to
battle. Sampras entered the tournament with a 33-point lead over
Rios on the computer standings.

Celine Dion sues French tabloid for saying she couldn't conceive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France _ Canadian singer Celine Dion has sued a French
tabloid for violation of privacy in an article suggesting she was
unable to have a child.
	   Dion's lawyer Jacques Levy told a court in this southwestern
French city that Voici, a weekly tabloid specializing in the
private lives of stars, had committed a ''serious violation of his
client's privacy and undermined her husband's dignity.''
	   Levy asked the court to award Dion and her husband 100,000
francs each (dlrs 17,500) in damages.
	   Luc Rossollet, a lawyer for Voici, told the court that the
article published last July was based on a biography about Dion
published in the United States, which the singer never contested in
court.
	   He asked the court to throw out the charges arguing that Dion
was forgiving towards the media when it helped advance her career.
	   A ruling is set for Feb. 9.

AIDS deaths falling in Europe, study says

	   LONDON (AP) _ Death rates across Europe among people infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, have fallen to less than a
fifth of what they were in 1995, according to a new study.
	   In the largest study to date tracking AIDS deaths in Europe,
researchers say the death rate has dropped 84 percent over the last
two years, mostly due to the introduction of new drugs and
combinations of treatments.
	   The study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a
British medical journal, involved 4,270 HIV patients in 50 centers
across Western Europe and Israel.
	   It found that from March to September of 1995, one in four
patients died after a year's follow-up, compared with one in 25
patients followed for a year dying in the same period in 1998.
	   The decline began after September 1995, coinciding with the
introduction of a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors and
with the way in which drugs were combined.
	   ``It was quite clear that these treatments are decreasing death
rates, but we didn't know the extent of the impact,'' said Andrew
Phillips, one of the lead researchers of the study at London's
Royal Free Center for HIV Medicine. ``We couldn't really have
predicted the magnitude.''
	   Death rates are also decreasing in the United States and other
developed countries, where such treatments are more widely
available than in the developing nations, but the decline in death
rates in Europe is the steepest reported to date, the researchers
said.
	   About 33 million people around the world are infected with HIV _
two thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa and about 2 percent of
them in Western Europe.
	   Phillips said scientists do not know whether the death rate will
stay down, There is a danger that it may creep up again, after
patients have been taking the new drugs for a few years, unless new
treatments are developed.
	   The United Nations reported earlier this week that although
death rates have been falling in Europe, rates of new infections
has not changed in recent years.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ German car manufacturer BMW is to start
assembling its 318ti model at a new factory west of Cairo in
January, the company said Thursday.
	   The first deliveries of the car will take place in April, BMW
said in a statement. The car will cost between 158,000 and 165,000
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 46,000 and 48,500), depending on the number
of accessories.
	   The cars will be assembled at a factory in 6th of October City
on the outskirts of Cairo. The plant plans to produce about 2,000
cars a year.
	   BMW began assembling models of its 5-series in Egypt last year.
But these cars are built at a plant owned by the Japanese
manufacturer, Nissan, in 6th of October City. There are no plans to
shift the 5-series production to the new BMW factory.
	   Nearly forty per cent of the components of the 3-series model
will be Egyptian.

	   Sampras, who played Karol Kucera later Thursday, already has
clinched a berth in the semifinals of the elite tournament he has
won four times already.
	   In the first match Thursday, Tim Henman beat Alex Corretja 7-6
(7-4), 6-7), 4-7), 6-2 to become the second player to advance to
the semifinals.
	   Rusedski was invited to the tournament to replace Andre Agassi,
who dropped out late Wednesday, also because of a back injury.
	   The dlrs 3.5 million tournament brings together players with the
best results over the year. But with Patrick Rafter and Richard
Krajicek both pulling out before the event because of injuries and
Agassi and Rios also now withdrawing, four of the best players in
the world are missing.
	   Rios had to do better than Sampras in the tournament to have a
shot at dethroning the American.
	   But Sampras came into the event highly motivated and had scored
to quick and impressive victories in his opening matches.
	   ``It's certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,''
Sampras said after crushing Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday.
	   ``I'm also helping myself by winning. I can't really be too
concerned about what Marcelo is doing,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take care of things
myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully good
enough.''
	   Last year, Moya had upset Sampras in a group match, but Sampras
went on to capture the dlrs 3.5 million event for the fourth time.
	   ``Last year I must admit I felt a little flat. This year, with
the ranking up for grabs, I just made a concerted effort to come
here a little bit early and prepare as best as I can.
	   ``It's obviously a very big week for Marcelo and I. I just
wanted to give myself the best chance possible to play well here,''
Sampras said.
	   Sampras was not even aware that he had clinched a place in the
semis and had to be convinced by reporters and ATP officials that
he had made it.
	   The way he is playing, he should not have any worries anyway.
	   ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today and
yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,''
Sampras said. ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit
more than last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much
pressure on him as possible.''

Kurds found stranded on remote Greek island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 150 illegal Kurdish immigrants
were discovered Thursday stranded on a barren island after being
left by smugglers, police said.
	   The immigrants say they swam to the rocky island near Kasos, off
the eastern tip of Crete, after the smugglers' boat experienced
mechanical problems, authorities said.
	   It was not immediately clear where the Kurds were from. Most
Kurds trying to sneak into Greece are from northern Iraq, but those
left on the island carried pictures of the Kurdish rebel leader,
Abdullah Ocalan, who has led a 14-year fight for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
	   Turkey is demanding Italy extradite Ocalan, who is seeking
political asylum.

Saddam says he taught Arabs not to fear America
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's defiance of Washington brought most
Arab nations to its side and proved that the United States was not
the world's only superpower, President Saddam Hussein was quoted as
saying Thursday.
	   However, he said it did not matter if the ``feeble and weak''
Arab rulers did not support him during his standoff with the United
States over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We are not frustrated if we fail to persuade'' Arab rulers to
support Iraq in its fight against U.N. trade sanctions, state-run
newspapers quoted Saddam as saying.
	   Arab rulers were only thinking of staying in power, while he was
concerned with Iraq's future and that of the Arab nations, Saddam
said without mentioning any Arab ruler by name.
	   He was apparently referring to the governments of the Arab Gulf
states as well as Syria and Egypt which, during a conference in
Qatar earlier this month, held Iraq ``responsible for any
consequences'' for refusing to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The United States on Nov. 14 called off air strikes after the
Iraqi leader promised U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan he would
permit U.N. weapons inspectors to visit suspected weapons sites in
Iraq.
	   Lack of Arab support during the standoff apparently forced Iraq
to make a quicker retreat.
	   ``Those rulers are feeble and weak and no matter how many they
are, they do not belong to the people,'' Saddam was quoted as
saying Thursday.
	   Many Arabs and Muslims, Saddam said, believed ``America had the
power to give life and deny it.'' But Iraq's ``steadfastness'' made
them rely on God instead, he added.
	   He said he was certain he would emerge victorious in his
defiance of America.
	   ``Based on strong faith in God, the future is for Baghdad and
not its enemies,'' he said.

Azerbaijan rejects OSCE proposal on disputed enclave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ President Geidar Aliev on Thursday
rejected a proposal by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe for settling the conflict with Armenia over
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   The plan called for Nagorno-Karabakh _ an enclave inside
Azerbaijan but populated mostly by ethnic Armenians _ to be run
jointly by Azerbaijan and the government of the separatist enclave,
Aliev said.
	   OSCE chief Bronislaw Geremek has been meeting with officials in
Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan this week. He presented
the latest OSCE proposal to Aliev on Thursday.
	   But the Azerbaijani leader expressed ``regret'' that such a
proposal was even made.
	   ``Azerbaijan cannot agree to these proposals,'' Aliev said,
adding that the plan would amount to recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh's
independence.
	   Officials in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, meanwhile, welcomed
the proposal, and Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan praised
the OSCE efforts to settle the dispute.
	   Armenian-backed separatists in Nagorno-Karabakh drove
Azerbaijani government forces out of the enclave and seized a
significant portion of Azerbaijan proper during a war that started
in 1988.
	   A 1994 truce ended the war, which killed 15,000 people and
turned about 1 million people into refugees. But peace negotiations
between the two former Soviet republics have stalled. Numerous
mediation attempts also have failed.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Slovenia's visiting Prime Minister Janez
Drnovsek called for increasing trade with Ukraine during talks
Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Valery Pustovoitenko.
	   Pustovoitenko also said increasing trade was a priority in
Ukraine's relations with Slovenia. Trade turnover between the two
nations was dlrs 73.4 in 1997, of which Ukrainian exports accounted
for only dlrs 6.7 million.
	   Pustovoitenko said economic ties were expected to profit from
accords on investment protection and avoidance of dual taxation
that are to be signed during Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's
visit to Slovenia, planned for next year.
	   Drnovsek, in turn, praised Ukraine as a ``very important
economic and political partner'' and said he brought along a
delegation of businessmen to study investment opportunities, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Slovenian premier also promised to simplify visa procedures
for Ukrainian visitors once his country opens an embassy in Kiev,
the Ukrainian capital, in the near future. About 30,000 Ukrainians
visited Slovenia in 1997.
	   The sides also discussed plans for setting up an international
consortium to build a European transport corridor from Italy's port
of Trieste to Slovenia, Hungary and Ukraine.
	   Drnovsek also met with Kuchma before completing his one-day
visit.

International diplomatic efforts in Kosovo continue

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International efforts at finding a
peace formula for Kosovo intensified Thursday despite Serbia's
defiant attempts to impose its own plan, which ethnic Albanians
have rejected.
	   European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch arrived in the southern
Serbian province for a day of meetings with ethnic Albanian
negotiators and representatives of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Wolfgang Petritsch, who is Austria's ambassador to Yugoslavia,
is expected to hook up with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill in Pristina
on Friday, continuing joint Western efforts to negotiate a deal for
Kosovo acceptable to all sides.
	   He was to talk with KLA representatives later Thursday and
possibly with Serb politicians on Friday.
	   After meeting Kosovo's Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, Petritsch
said that although a humanitarian catastrophe has been prevented,
the situation on the ground, due to the cold Kosovo winter, remains
``very critical.'' He said the European Union is seeking
``long-term arrangements to improve both humanitarian and economic
conditions.''
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes claimed hundreds of lives and forced some 300,000 people to
leave their homes.
	   ``I believe that, even if we reach a political accord, that
doesn't provide for jobs in Kosovo,'' said Petritsch before going
into the field to meet some of the tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians who are still displaced.
	   Petritsch also handed Rugova a list of abducted Kosovo Serbs
provided by a Serbian opposition party from Belgrade. Rugova
promised to look into it.
	   ``We have to be concerned about every single person no matter
whether the person is of Albanian extraction, Serb or from any
other group here in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Petritsch's visit came a day after Serbia reiterated its
rejection of a U.S. plan, and pushed forward its own peace
proposal. Top Serbian negotiator also warned of a regional war if
Kosovo is granted more than self-rule.
	   Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want independence but Serbia,
the dominant of the two republics in Yugoslavia, rejects the idea.
	   There are fears that the province could explode in new fighting
if a solution is not found by spring.
	   The American plan would leave Kosovo loose ties with Serbia
while keeping it under jurisdiction of the Yugoslav federation,
made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians have praised the plan, but Serbian
officials said it is unacceptable. Serbia wants to keep Kosovo,
which it considers the cradle of its statehood, firmly under its
control.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.

AIDS deaths falling in Europe, study says

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Death rates across Europe among people infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, have fallen to less than a
fifth of what they were in 1995, according to a new study.
	   In the largest study to date tracking AIDS deaths in Europe,
researchers say the death rate has dropped 84 percent over the last
two years, mostly due to the introduction of new drugs and
combinations of treatments.
	   The study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a
British medical journal, involved 4,270 HIV patients in 50 centers
across Western Europe and Israel.
	   It found that from March to September of 1995, one in four
patients died after a year's follow-up, compared with one in 25
patients followed for a year dying in the same period in 1998.
	   The decline began after September 1995, coinciding with the
introduction of a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors and
with the way in which drugs were combined.
	   ``It was quite clear that these treatments are decreasing death
rates, but we didn't know the extent of the impact,'' said Andrew
Phillips, one of the lead researchers of the study at London's
Royal Free Center for HIV Medicine. ``We couldn't really have
predicted the magnitude.''
	   Death rates are also decreasing in the United States and other
developed countries, where such treatments are more widely
available than in the developing nations, but the decline in death
rates in Europe is the steepest reported to date, the researchers
said.
	   A study earlier this year found that deaths in the United States
decreased by 75 percent between early 1994 and mid-1997.
	   About 33 million people around the world are infected with HIV _
two thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa and about 2 percent of
them in Western Europe.
	   Phillips said scientists do not know whether the death rate will
stay down, There is a danger that it may creep up again, after
patients have been taking the new drugs for a few years, unless new
treatments are developed.
	   The United Nations reported earlier this week that although
death rates have been falling in Europe, rates of new infections
has not changed in recent years.

Italian foreign minister contends Ocalan does not meet conditions
</HEADLINE>
for asylum &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with opposition leader calling for
government to resign, comments from justice minister. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's foreign minister weighed in Thursday in a
heated debate over the fate of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, saying Italy should not grant Ocalan political asylum
because he is not a victim of persecution.
	   ``We are talking about terrorist acts committed voluntarily,''
Lamberto Dini was quoted as telling Corriere della Sera daily. ``We
are not dealing with a victim.''
	   Dini reiterated his position in an interview broadcast by RAI
state television.
	   Italy's Interior Ministry is examining Ocalan's asylum request,
a review that is expected to take months.
	   Both Turkey and Germany have issued arrest warrants for Ocalan
on charges of terrorism. Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan to
Turkey _ where he is the No. 1 fugitive _ because Italian law
forbids the extradition of suspects to countries where they face
the death penalty, as Ocalan does in Turkey.
	   Italy's refusal to turn over Ocalan for trial has enraged Turks,
who have responded with boycotts and bonfires of Italian goods.
	   Germany, fearful of violence between its 2 million Turks and
400,000 Kurds, says it doesn't plan to seek extradition.
	   Dini criticized Germany for issuing a warrant but then waiving
extradition, calling the decision ``incoherent.''
	   ``By not asking for Ocalan's extradition, Germany risks damaging
the international fight against terrorism,'' he said.
	   Italy's center-right opposition, led by former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi, has demanded Ocalan's immediate expulsion.
	   ``That would be backing away from our responsibility in the
fight against terrorism,'' Dini said.
	   Instead, Dini suggested putting Ocalan on trial in third-party
country, which could also be Italy.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 when he arrived at the Rome airport
aboard a flight from Moscow.
	   A hard-line Communist lawmaker revealed Wednesday that he
accompanied Ocalan on the flight, prompting Berlusconi to call for
the government's resignation. Although the lawmaker and his
Communist Refoundation party are not in the majority, Berlusconi
accused the government of arranging Ocalan's arrival.
	   Justice Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino said Berlusconi's
accusations were ``figments of his imagination.''
	   The Refoundation lawmaker said Wednesday that the government had
not been informed of his intent to travel to Moscow to meet Ocalan.
	   The rebel leader is staying in a Rome villa under police
surveillance while he awaits a decision on his asylum request.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
waged a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.

Tens of thousands turn out for funeral of Iranian dissident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A funeral procession for a murdered
dissident and his wife turned into a rally Thursday, with tens of
thousands of mourners pledging to continue his struggle for
freedom.
	   Many in the crowd carried large photos of Dariush Foruhar and
his wife, Parvaneh, who were stabbed to death in their Tehran home.
Their bodies were discovered Sunday, but there were conflicting
reports about whether they were killed then or the day before.
	   In a strong speech to Intelligence Ministry officials Thursday,
President Mohammad Khatami said Foruhar's killers must be brought
to justice.
	   ``The murder of the late Mr. Foruhar is condemned. The
government, and especially the intelligence network, have a very
important duty to confront it,'' Khatami said in comments reported
by the state-run radio.
	   ``If we don't deal with the crime seriously, and not identify
the culprits, the episode will not only constitute a disrespect for
our (Islamic) system, it will become the beginning of more problems
to come,'' Khatami said.
	   Khatami, a moderate cleric elected last year, has promised to
grant more political freedoms.
	   But he faces strong opposition from hard-line opponents who are
backed by street vigilantes who have often taken the law into their
hands. Over the past year, the vigilantes have attacked dissidents,
liberal newspapers and even a reformist Cabinet minister. They have
also broken up pro-democracy rallies.
	   The Iran News daily quoted Thursday a police official as saying
that several people had been arrested in connection with murders of
Foruhar and his wife. It gave no other details.
	   Tens of thousands of supporters turned out for Foruhar's funeral
at the Fakhr Mosque in downtown Tehran, not far from where the
couple had lived.
	   Streets around the neighborhood were closed to traffic by
police, who formed human chains to try to control the crowds.
	   That led to small scuffles as the mourners pushed past the
policemen and made their way from the mosque to the old Parliament.
The building is a symbol of a nationalist movement that Foruhar
helped found in the 1950s.
	   ``You will live forever, Foruhar,'' the mourners chanted. ``Your
struggle continues with us.''
	   After a mass prayer held in the streets, thousands of mourners
crammed into buses for the 30-minute ride to the Behesht-e-Zahra
cemetery south of Tehran for the burial.

Latvian government wins approval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Lawmakers approved a new government Thursday
in Latvia that excludes the party that received the largest number
of seats in last month's elections.
	   The new minority government that will be headed by Vilis
Kristopans of the centrist Latvia's Way and include another
centrist party and a right-wing group.
	   The vote by the Saeima parliament ended nearly two months of
negotiations. President Guntis Ulmanis had strongly pushed for
forming a majority government, but an agreement could not be
reached.
	   The new government leaves out the People's Party, which got the
largest number of seats in Oct. 3 national elections. Party leader
Andris Skele is strongly disliked by many other politicians and no
way could be found to include the party in the government.
	   The three-party government, consisting of Latvia's Way, the New
Party and the rightwing Fatherland and Freedom, holds just 46 of
the 100 seats in the Saeima.
	   Kristopans will take over as prime minister from Guntars Krasts
of Fatherland and Freedom.
	   The only votes against the government came from the People's
Party, while the far-left National Harmony Party's 16 legislators
did not vote at all.
	   Since it regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991,
Latvia has been plagued by weak, unstable governments. It has had
more than half a dozen multiparty coalitions, none of which have
lasted more than two years.
	   Kristopans, speaking to the Saeima before the vote, said keeping
Latvia's free-markets reforms on course would be a top priority for
his government.
	   He said his government would also continue to push hard for NATO
and European Union membership. Improving relations with Russia
would also be a high priority, he said.

Iranian president condemns attack on U.S. tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's president on Thursday condemned an
attack by an Islamic militant group on a bus of U.S. tourists,
saying that it was a national disgrace.
	   Radicals chanting ``Death to America,'' wielding iron bars and
throwing stones smashed the windows of a bus carrying 13
foreigners, mostly Americans, in Tehran on Saturday.
	   Hard-line newspapers had accused the tourists of being spies.
	   But Tehran radio quoted the President Mohammad Khatami as
saying, ``The ugly, perverse and possibly conspiratorial treatment
of foreign tourists, and those who are officially visiting Iran
with valid visas, was an affront to the honor of the Iranian
people.''
	   On Monday, U.S. officials in Washington said that none of the
Americans was a government officials or had links to the CIA. The
group left the country early Sunday.
	   The president said the incident was ``an insult to the
government and an intolerable act,'' the radio reported.
	   The Fedayeen Islam, a radical Muslim group that has been dormant
for many years, claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Iran after
Islamic militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran shortly
after the 1979 revolution.

Greece: Italy should grant Ocalan political asylum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Italy should grant political asylum to
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan and not yield to economic
``blackmail'' by his foes in Turkey, Premier Costas Simitis said
Thursday.
	   But he added that Greece did not support the rebel group's use
of violence or back efforts to create an independent Kurdish state
out of parts of southeastern Turkey.
	   ``Greece is in favor of granting political asylum to Ocalan,''
Simitis told a news conference.
	   Simitis said the Kurdish problem ``must be solved peacefully
through political dialogue and not violence.''
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in 14 years of fighting
between Turkish forces and the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
	   Ocalan was arrested in Rome on Nov. 12 and later asked for
political asylum in Italy. Turkey, which considers Ocalan a
terrorist, is seeking his extradition.
	   It was Simitis' first reference to the Kurds since Ocalan's
arrest. Greece has been wary of being drawn into dispute between
Italy and Turkey, which has many regional disputes with Greece.
	   Turkey has become furious with Italy's decision not to extradite
Ocalan. Turks have launched private boycotts against one of their
country's largest trading partners, although the government says
there are no official sanctions on Italian goods.
	   ``Our European colleagues should appraise these reactions. This
violent reaction, this exaggeration, this blackmail to force a
retreat. These tactics should not be accepted by Europe,'' Simitis
said.
	   Simitis denied Turkish allegations that Greece supported PKK
rebels or allowed them to organize actions against Turkey.
	   ``It is against the law for anyone here to do this. This applies
to Kurds, Chechens or any one else,'' Simitis said. Chechnya
regards itself as independent after a 1994-96 war with Russia, but
Moscow does not acknowledge its statehood.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Thursday lobbied the head of world soccer on behalf of South
Africa's bid to become the venue for the 2006 World Cup.
	   Hours later, FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter -- a longtime
supporter of an African World Cup -- gave one of his strongest
endorsements yet for the continent.
	   ``I am fighting for the World Cup of 2006 to come to Africa,''
Blatter told reporters. FIFA ``has the responsibility of giving
(it) to an African country,'' he said.
	   Blatter came to South Africa to receive the country's highest
award to a foreigner, the Order of Good Hope, on a visit originally
scheduled six weeks ago but delayed because Mandela was ill.
	   During the ceremony at Mandela's residence here, the South
African president extolled his nation's cause.
	   ``I told him, `I will support the best African bid' -- and he
understood what I meant,'' Blatter said. Morocco, Egypt and Nigeria
are also considering proposals, but South Africa is considered the
favorite on the continent.
	   Other front-runners are Germany and England, and a bid may come
from Brazil. Countries must declare their intention to bid at the
end of this year. July 31 is the deadline for the presentation of
bid documents, and the FIFA board will make its decision in March
2000.
	   Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African
Football, said at the same news conference that he would ensure the
African countries unite behind a single candidate.
	   Blatter said an African bid must live up to FIFA's standards.
They include proper stadium security and comfort; solid training
facilities and team accommodations; a good transportation and
hospital system; and strong support by the government and
population.

Sampras makes tennis history when Rios pulls out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rios quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras made tennis history
Thursday when Marcelo Rios pulled out of the ATP Tour World
Championship, giving Sampras the No. 1 ranking for a record sixth
year in a row.
	   Rios pulled out with a back injury before his match against Greg
Rusedski.
	   ``I waited until the last minute,'' Rios said. ``I went to bed
last night thinking I would play.''
	   ``But when I tried to practice this morning, it was really sore.
It made no sense to go out on the court and play two games,'' Rios
said. ``I am disappointed but that's the way it goes.''
	   ``It's really, really sore, it's so sore that I can't go on
court. Pulling out of a tournaments is always bad and you don't
feel good,'' Rios said.
	   Rios was the only man who could have threatened Sampras for the
No. 1 ranking. By pulling out of the season-ending championship,
Rios allowed Sampras to retain the top spot without having to
battle for it. Sampras entered the tournament with a 33-point lead
over Rios in the computer standings.
	   Sampras shared the record of five straight year-ending No. 1
rankings with fellow American Jimmy Connors, who did it between
1974 and 1978.
	   The new record is unlikely to be ever broken, Sampras said
earlier this week.
	   Sampras, who played Karol Kucera later Thursday, already has
clinched a berth in the semifinals of the elite tournament he has
won four times already.
	   In the first match Thursday, Tim Henman beat Alex Corretja 7-6
(7-4), 6-7), 4-7), 6-2 to become the second player to advance to
the semifinals.
	   Rusedski was invited to the tournament to replace Andre Agassi,
who dropped out late Wednesday, also because of a back injury.
Rusedski played Albert Costa, the second alternate, in a later
match Thursday.
	   The dlrs 3.5 million tournament brings together players with the
best results over the year. But with Patrick Rafter and Richard
Krajicek both pulling out before the event because of injuries and
Agassi and Rios also now withdrawing, four of the best players in
the world are missing.
	   Rios had to do better than Sampras in the tournament to have a
shot at dethroning the American.
	   But Sampras came into the event highly motivated and had scored
to quick and impressive victories in his opening matches.
	   ``It's certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,''
Sampras said after crushing Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday.
	   ``I'm also helping myself by winning. I can't really be too
concerned about what Marcelo is doing,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take care of things
myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully good
enough.''
	   Last year, Moya had upset Sampras in a group match, but Sampras
went on to capture the dlrs 3.5 million event for the fourth time.
	   ``Last year I must admit I felt a little flat. This year, with
the ranking up for grabs, I just made a concerted effort to come
here a little bit early and prepare as best as I can.
	   ``It's obviously a very big week for Marcelo and I. I just
wanted to give myself the best chance possible to play well here,''
Sampras said.
	   Sampras was not even aware that he had clinched a place in the
semis and had to be convinced by reporters and ATP officials that
he had made it.
	   The way he is playing, he should not have any worries anyway.
	   ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today and
yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,''
Sampras said. ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit
more than last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much
pressure on him as possible.''

Bosnia Serbs find bodies of 10 war victims hidden in cemetery

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb forensic team
exhumed Thursday bodies of 10 civilians killed during the Bosnian
war and dumped in a shallow pit in a Sarajevo cemetery.
	   Another 150 to 200 bodies are likely buried in other unmarked
holes among the several thousand headstones of the 50-year-old
cemetery, said the Bosnian Serb Commission for Missing Persons.
	   Meanwhile, the Muslim Commission for Missing Persons said it
exhumed bodies of 18 Muslim war victims near Nevesinje, some 70
kilometers (44 miles) south of Sarajevo Thursday.
	   The Bosnian Serb commission said the search for the bodies of
Bosnian Serb civilians killed by Muslim forces will continue at
least 10 more days in the graveyard bordering a Sarajevo
residential district. Commission Chairman Jovo Rosic said local
gravediggers reported burying the bodies during the war.
	   Rosic said all bodies will be removed for autopsy and
identification. It will be up to their families to decide where to
rebury them.
	   Muslim-Croat police escorted the Bosnian Serb forensic team and
the operation was monitored by NATO-led peacekeepers and
international forensic and human rights officers.
	   Foreign officials Thursday praised cooperation between the
Croats, Muslims and Bosnian Serbs in their search missing war
victims.
	   ``This exhumation marks the end of a year that has seen
extraordinary cooperation between the three commissions for missing
persons in Bosnia,'' said Alexandra Stiglmayer, a spokeswoman for
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp.
	   All tolled, the commissions investigated more than 250 sites
across the country this year, finding some 1,700 bodies. More than
20,000 people are officially still missing.
	   Exhumations take place in the spring and summer months, as
freezing temperatures and snowcover in the winter prevent forensics
experts from carrying out their work.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin insisted that Japan's
reluctance to face up to its wartime past was a critical problem in
relations. But all he got from Tokyo Thursday was basically the
same apology offered three years ago.
	   In their talks, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi referred to a 1995
statement by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, expressing
``Japan's deep remorse and heartfelt apology,'' said Japanese
government spokesman Sadaaki Numata.
	   When it came to putting something in writing, officials of the
two sides wrangled for several hours after that over the wording.
Meanwhile, Obuchi and Jiang were dining at a state banquet at the
Imperial Palace, where Emperor Akihito expressed hopes for
``long-lasting relations of friendship.''
	   Although exchanges between the two Asian neighbors date back
2,000 years, many Chinese harbor a bitter resentment over the
atrocities committed by Japanese troops before and during World War
II, including massacres of civilians and experimentation on
prisoners of war.
	   Comments by Japanese conservative politicians over the years
that deny or belittle the atrocities have outraged Beijing.
	   In Jiang's visit _ the first by a Chinese head of state to Japan
since the end of World War II _ the Chinese had hoped for a more
clearly worded apology from Japan. In Beijing Thursday, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang indicated that China
wanted an explicit repudiation of such ``erroneous words and
practices.''
	   A declaration on partnership issued late Thursday appeared to be
a compromise. Japan expressed ``deep remorse'' and also used the
word ``aggression.'' Although the 1995 apology also referred to
``aggression,'' it was the first time Tokyo had used that word in
writing, Japanese ministry officials said.
	   Whether or not Japan would admit that the war was aggression has
been a sore point in the long-running dispute over the apology.
Japanese conservatives have said the war was against Western
colonialism.
	   The declaration referred to Japanese apologies offered in 1972
and 1995 and acknowledged ``responsibility in causing great
misfortune and damage to the people of China through its aggression
against China.''
	   The leaders, however, decided not to sign Thursday's
declaration. ``Certain things are best conveyed orally,'' Numata
said.
	   Chinese officials have said they wanted Japan to give Jiang the
same treatment accorded South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who
received from Obuchi in writing _ and signed _ Tokyo's fullest
apology yet for its 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean
Peninsula.
	   Numata played down the differences in the two apologies. The
messages were ``similar,'' and China and Japan agreed to work
together to expand economic and other ties to work toward a ``new
partnership'' for the 21st Century, he said.
	   Recently, Japan and South Korea have been working together more
on regional security, especially because the two nations share
fears about North Korea.
	   Communist China, with its military might and friendly relations
with North Korea, continues to be perceived as a more likely threat
to Japan than democratic, capitalist South Korea.
	   Japanese ministry officials quoted Jiang as telling Obuchi that
one way to look at history was that enough had been said.
	   ``I don't agree with this view. The more we discuss this issue,
the future will open up for us,'' Jiang was quoted as saying.
	   Taiwan was another key issue in the summit. Obuchi reassured
Jiang that Japan was behind Beijing's ``one China'' policy, which
holds that Taiwan is a renegade province that is part of China.
	   Obuchi also made clear that Japan does not support an
independent Taiwan. He told Jiang that Japan's security treaty with
the United States is purely ``defensive,'' and does not refer to
any specific nation, Numata said.
	   Obuchi also offered China new loans of 390 billion yen (dlrs 3.2
billion) for 28 environmental, farming and other development
projects for 1999-2000. Obuchi told Jiang that Japan was in
economic difficulty, but the loan was extended especially in
respect to his visit.
	   Jiang, who arrived Wednesday, will meet with business leaders,
civic groups and students at a major university before leaving
Tokyo Saturday for visits to two northern Japanese cities, Sendai
and Sapporo.

EU investigating Boeing, Airbus prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators are
investigating prices charged by airplane manufacturers Boeing Co.
and Airbus Industrie, an EU official said Thursday.
	   The official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
European Commission had sent the companies questions about price
rises to find out if there is any cartel activity.
	   He told reporters the EU executive body's inquiries were not a
full cartel probe and were not coordinated with U.S. regulators.
	   The European consortium Airbus and Boeing of the United States
share the world's market in large commercial jets.
	   Boeing announced rises in the base price of most of its
commercial jets by 5 percent in July, the first increase in 23
years.

Homeboy Price joint fifth on first day of Zimbabwe Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Four birdies in the last seven holes
Thursday propelled Zimbabwean Nick Price toward the top of a leader
board dominated by South Africans on the first day of the Zimbabwe
Open golf championship.
	   Seventh in world golf rankings, Price found himself one over par
after 10 holes but he fought back to return a three under par 69
with birdies at the 12th, 13th, 15th and a tap-in at the last. This
put him in joint fifth place.
	   Price said his weaker performance in the early going was partly
due to jet lag.
	   ``For me it was a dawn patrol today. My driving was indifferent
and I paid the price a couple of times,'' price said. ``But then I
got my tee shots organized, my putting improved and overall I was
well pleased with the day.''
	   Price is defending his home country's open title and going for a
third championship victory before his home town fans and on the
Royal Harare course he redesigned two years ago.
	   He is three shots behind Tjart van der Walt, who was second to
him last year. Van der Walt, of South Africa, is on six under par
66, a shot ahead of compatriot Ryan Dreyer and a further shot clear
of two other South Africans, Alan McLean and Andre van Staden.
	   Price shares fifth place with South African Warren Abery.
	   Zimbabwean Mark McNulty had an indifferent day, finishing on two
over par 74 but Tony Johnstone, also of Zimbabwe, was handily
placed on level par 72.

Iraqi president says he taught Arabs not to fear America

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's defiance of Washington brought most
Arab nations to its side and proved that the United States was not
the world's only superpower, President Saddam Hussein was quoted as
saying Thursday.
	   However, he said it did not matter if the ``feeble and weak''
Arab rulers did not support him during his standoff with the United
States over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We are not frustrated if we fail to persuade'' Arab rulers to
support Iraq in its fight against U.N. trade sanctions, state-run
newspapers quoted Saddam as saying.
	   Arab rulers were only thinking of staying in power, while he was
concerned with Iraq's future and that of the Arab nations, Saddam
said without mentioning any Arab ruler by name.
	   He was apparently referring to the governments of the Arab Gulf
states as well as Syria and Egypt which, during a conference in
Qatar earlier this month, held Iraq ``responsible for any
consequences'' for refusing to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The United States on Nov. 14 called off air strikes after the
Iraqi leader promised U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan he would
permit U.N. weapons inspectors to visit suspected weapons sites in
Iraq.
	   Lack of Arab support during the standoff apparently forced Iraq
to make a quicker retreat.
	   ``Those rulers are feeble and weak and no matter how many they
are, they do not belong to the people,'' Saddam was quoted as
saying Thursday.
	   Many Arabs and Muslims, Saddam said, believed ``America had the
power to give life and deny it.'' But Iraq's ``steadfastness'' made
them rely on God instead, he added.
	   He said he was certain he would emerge victorious in his
defiance of America.
	   ``Based on strong faith in God, the future is for Baghdad and
not its enemies,'' he said.

Mallorca withdraws appeal over Stankovic ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Spanish club Real Mallorca on Thursday withdrew
its appeal against a four-match suspension imposed by UEFA on its
winger Iovan Stankovic.
	   ``There was a problem with interpretation when it was explained
to us why he was being suspended,'' said Mallorca club director
Ramon Servalls. ``Now it has been cleared up so we don't have any
protest.''
	   Stankovic was suspended for violent conduct during his team's
Cup Winners Cup second-round match against Genk of Belgium earlier
this month.
	   In the day's earlier case, Mallorca came out the winner when
UEFA's appeal body upheld its rejection of a protest by Genk about
the advertising boards in the Spanish club's Luis Sitjar stadium.
Genk claimed the boards were not at regulation distance from the
playing area.
	   ``It was up to the referee to decide if the match should be
played,'' said Peter Limacher, UEFA's section manager for
disciplinary matters.
	   UEFA had to decide whether referee Remi Harrel of France had
abused his powers of discretion. ``The board of appeal felt he did
not,'' Limacher said.
	   UEFA regulations stipulate that advertising panels be placed 4
meters (13.1 feet) from the edge of the playing area.
	   Mallorca's boards were only about a half meter (1 1/2 feet) from
the touchline, Limacher said.
	   ``They acknowledged the pitch was irregular but the degree of
irregularity was an important factor,'' Limacher said. ``In this
case it was considered to be a minor irregularity.''
	   UEFA also noted Genk, which knew the problem long before the
start of the match, lodged its protest just 20 minutes before
kickoff.
	   The protest ``complied with the regulations,'' said Limacher.
``But they should have protested earlier or informed the Spanish
club in time for it to make necessary changes.''
	   Mallorca was fined 5,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 3,600) and its
stadium will undergo a full inspection by UEFA within the next two
weeks.
	   UEFA will then decide if changes are required, Limacher said.
``The club is about to construct a new stadium where the conditions
will be much better.''
	   After Mallorca knocked out Scottish club Hearts in the first
round, UEFA rejected an appeal from Hearts over the size of the
goalposts at the Spanish club's stadium.

Poland takes step toward extraditing communist-era prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Military prosecutors said Thursday they
have asked for an arrest warrant for communist-era prosecutor
Helena Wolinska, a step toward seeking her extradition from
England.
	   Historians say Wolinska, 79, is responsible for the 1952 arrest
and subsequent execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, a World War II
resistance hero, on allegedly fabricated evidence.
	   She failed to appear in Poland on Oct. 15 to testify at the
investigation of Fieldorf's death.
	   Col. Tadeusz Krysicki, head of the Warsaw Military Prosecutor's
Office, said it was seeking a temporary arrest warrant for
Wolinska, which he called a requirement for any further steps
toward her extradition.
	   Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground
Home Army that fought the Nazis during World War II. After the war,
he refused to collaborate with the secret service of the new
communist regime.
	   He was charged by Wolinska in 1952 with killing Soviet soldiers
and leftist resisters during the war, and was hanged in 1953.
Historians say Wolinska fabricated the charges.
	   If formally charged and convicted of denying Fieldorf his
freedom, Wolinska could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.
	   Wolinska lives in Oxford and is a British citizen. According to
Polish media reports, Britain could refuse to extradite her even
though it has an extradition treaty with Poland.
	   Maria Gorowska, the judge who presided over Fieldorf's trial,
died of cancer in January without testifying in the investigation.
	   Also Thursday, a state commission investigating Nazi and
communist crimes in Poland said it found evidence of 2,450 death
sentences carried out by the communists from 1944-56.
	   Witold Kulesza, head of the Commission for Investigating Crimes
on the Polish Nation, said some of the sentences were for stealing
food from state-owned farms or selling hard currency, which was
illegal then.
	   Kulesza said the committee will seek homicide charges against
any prosecutors and judges involved in the verdicts who are still
living.

Turkey's Islamic party avoids confrontation over leading next
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic party
said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead
Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the
military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
	   Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-old
government Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal,
setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secular
parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
	   ``The no-confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave political
chaos,'' Yilmaz declared.
	   By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go
to the Islamic Virtue Party since it is has the most seats in
Parliament. Few believe the all-powerful, staunchly secular
military would agree to that.
	   Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its
constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.
	   Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai
Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with
picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in
Parliament.
	   ``We have told the president that we will not be insistent. It's
fine if we're in the new government. It's fine if we're not,''
Kutan said.
	   Kutan said the next administration should be a caretaker
government with the support of all parties, which would lead the
country until the next national elections.
	   Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-led
government out of office last year, after it came to power in a
coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.
	   Mrs. Ciller, head of the center-right True Path Party and a key
contender for power, was meeting with Demirel later Thursday.
	   Newspapers reported that Mrs. Ciller was already in contact with
Virtue in pursuit of a possible alliance. The party denied the
reports.
	   No party has a majority in parliament. Analysts consider Mrs.
Ciller's True Path capable of fitting into any pro-secular
coalition in the political system, deeply divided by political
rivalry.
	   Turkish politics have been torn in the 1990s between the choice
of an Islamic-led government or fragile, pro-secular coalitions.
	   Even if the secular establishment succeeds in pushing aside
Virtue, it would be difficult to put together a government without
Mrs. Ciller's backing.
	   Mrs. Ciller, who commands 99 deputies in the 550-seat
parliament, declared that she would act in a ``constructive
manner'' either by being part of a coalition government or by
extending outside support to a minority government.
	   One scenario suggests she may join forces with Yilmaz, long her
rival.
	   Demirel said it would take four or five days before he completes
consultations with party leaders and designates a premier. Yilmaz,
meanwhile, serves as caretaker premier.
	   Elections are scheduled for April 18. Yilmaz has urged they be
held earlier.
	   Parliament opened an investigation Thursday into the allegations
that toppled Yilmaz _ that he had ties to Turkey's mafia and rigged
the sale of a state bank.

Mallorca withdraws appeal over Stankovic ban

Croatia police call for investigation into senior bank manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Police requested an investigation into
alleged corruption and mismanagement of one of Croatia's top
private bankers Thursday, said a police spokesman.
	   Marko Marcinko, chief manager of the bankrupt Glumina Banka,
will be investigated for ``abuse of position and powers,'' said
Josip Begovic, a Zagreb police spokesman.
	   Police have conducted a preliminary investigation but, under
Croatian law, must request the district attorney launch a full
investigation before he can be charged and stand trial. If
convicted, Marcinko could face a fine or three years in jail.
	   Glumina Banka, one of Croatia's largest private banks, recently
declared bankruptcy after Marcinko failed to find foreign investors
or attract state funds to save the bank.
	   Experts blamed the bankruptcy on the bank's high-risk
investments, plus low-interest loans and high interest savings
accounts for politicians and other influential people.
	   Earlier this year, authorities froze Glumina Banka's accounts,
enraging thousands of clients. The state said it will use reserves
to guarantee savings only up to 100,000 kuna (dlrs 16,600).
	   Last May, the government was forced to save Croatia's fifth
largest bank, Dubrovacka Banka, after a nationwide corruption
scandal allegedly involving senior state officials.
	   Authorities charged a senior bank official and an alleged
accomplice with fraud and embezzlement. They are to be tried in
early December.
	   Currently, 60 banks and 33 savings institutions operate in
Croatia, a surplus for this nation of 4.8 million.

Battle over taxes in Mexico's budget threatens presidency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo's 1999 budget
proposal sounds like an invitation to political suicide.
	   It raises gasoline prices by 15 percent. It introduces a
15-percent tax on phone services and lets states add 2 percent on
top of an existing 15-percent federal sales tax. And it includes a
dlrs 55 billion bank bailout most Mexicans see as benefiting
wealthy bankers.
	   ``Mexicans are being made to pay for what others have
pocketed,'' said congressman Luis Patino of the opposition Labor
Party.
	   Some lawmakers are parodying Zedillo's 1994 campaign slogan,
``well-being for families,'' calling his proposal ``ill-being for
families.''
	   Analysts say the slogan could become Zedillo's version of ``Read
my Lips'' _ a promise of no new taxes that former U.S. President
George Bush's made then violated. They say it could help Mexico's
governing party lose its 69-year grip on power in the 2000
presidential elections.
	   ``It could lead to a political crisis of grave consequences,''
said Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst with the elite Colegio de
Mexico thinktank.
	   Mexico's Congress has until Dec. 15 to approve or reject
Zedillo's budget proposal. It also could pass a modified version,
which the president would not have the authority to veto.
	   Zedillo says the new taxes are needed to help pay for the bank
bailout, and because of the worldwide drop in oil prices, which is
costing Mexico _ an oil exporter _ billions of dollars in lost
revenues.
	   It's the first time in recent Mexican history that a president's
budget proposal faces widespread criticism from business leaders,
the Roman Catholic church, economists and lawmakers _ even those
from his own Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   Business groups that have long acted as government allies have
dropped their support. The Entrepreneurial Coordinating Council and
the Mexican Employers' Confederation called the proposed budget an
affront.
	   And dissent also is growing even within the ruling party, known
as the PRI.
	   Mexican labor unions, long controlled by the PRI, are calling
for a 22-percent raise in the minimum wage, currently about dlrs 3
a day. The government has offered only 13 percent.
	   ``The 13 percent increase has already been eaten away by the 15
percent gasoline hike and other increases. Even 22 percent would
not be enough to restore purchasing power,'' said PRI congressman
Efren Enriques.
	   In its current issue, the weekly Milenio magazine interviewed 50
clergymen from throughout the country, all of whom harshly
criticized the government's economic policy.
	   ``It seems the authorities are suffering from blindness,'' said
Roman Catholic Archbishop Bartolome Carrasco. ``It is evident they
do not see or feel the people's suffering, and they don't want
to.''
	   Mexico's two main rebel groups are hoping that the discontent
will translate into more support for them. Subcomandante Marcos,
leader of the Zapatista rebels in southern Chiapas state, denounced
Zedillo's budget on Sunday.
	   The Popular Revolutionary Army issued a statement Wednesday
night saying the government ``is killing people with bullets of
hunger and misery,'' and called on those upset with the economy to
join its ranks.
	   Zedillo also faces a potential minefield in the bank bailout he
proposed in March, and part of which he included in his budget
proposal. He wants the government to absorb most of the dlrs 55
billion that the banks lost in bad loans in the 1995 economic
crisis.
	   Opposition leaders say the bailout fund absorbed bad loans from
wealthy businessmen, some of which have said they made
multimillion-dollar contributions to the ruling party's campaign
that brought Zedillo to power.
	   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, chairman of the Democratic
Revolution Party, challenged Zedillo last week to deny that he
received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Carlos
Cabal Peniche, a fugitive banker recently arrested in Australia.
	   A Zedillo spokeswoman said the president has not denied the
alleged contributions, which are being investigated by the Federal
Electoral Institute, Mexico's top election authority.
	   ``The issue of Zedillo's campaign spending looms on the
horizon,'' analyst Aguayo said. ``An investigation could lead to a
political scandal linking political corruption with the economic
crisis.''

Czech Republic creates commission to return Jewish property
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech government has
established a commission to return Jewish property confiscated
during World War II, a Jewish community official said Thursday.
	   The commission, to include members of the government and the
Czech Federation of Jewish Communities, is to map out by March all
property that has not been restituted, Alena Rubesova said.
	   The state has already returned some 80 percent of confiscated
Jewish properties which it held.
	   The government plans to return to surviving Holocaust victims
all remaining property confiscated by the Nazis during World War
II. It will also create a fund for compensation where restitution
is impossible.
	   Besides the state-held properties, the Federation of Jewish
Communities demands return of property now owned by municipalities
and individuals. About half of the 202 properties are yet to be
returned.
	   Restitution was delayed by 40 years of communism, which ended
here in 1989, and subsequently by insufficient legislation.
	   Some 120,000 Jews lived on Czech territory before the Holocaust.
Now there are about 6,000.

Jordanian women demonstrate against domestic violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ More than 250 women, including the king's
sister, marched through Amman on Thursday in a quiet demonstration
against domestic violence.
	   The rally came two days after a father was arrested for the
murder of his 17-year-old daughter, who had eloped with a
boyfriend, and three days after an international conference in
Amman called for judges to impose heavier sentences on those who
commit ``crimes of honor,'' where men kill their female relatives
for having pre-marital sex.
	   Princess Basma took part in the march, which began at the
offices of the Jordanian General Union for Women in Jabal Amman
district and ended at a hotel 2 kilometers (1.3 miles) away.
	   King Hussein has spoken out against wife battering and ``honor
crimes''.
	   ``We reject all kinds of (domestic) violence, because it is
practiced against a creature who represents half of the world, and
gave birth to the other half,'' the women's union secretary
general, Nejoud Fawzi, said in a speech outside the hotel at the
end of the march.
	   Referring to victims of domestic violence, Fawzi said a woman
was ``forced to marry the man chosen by her family, she is raped,
killed and tortured.''
	   About 25 women are killed each year in the name of honor in
Jordan, making it the most common type of murder of women in the
kingdom. But the courts impose jail sentences ranging from three
months to two years for such crimes because of the heavy premium
traditional Arab societies place on family honor.
	   Delegates from 10 Middle Eastern states recommended Monday that
their governments modernize their laws to ensure that those who
commit violence against women receive tough penalties.

Canada campaigns to stop execution of Canadian in Texas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Using high-level diplomacy and high-emotion
lobbying, Canadians are campaigning to save the life of a man who
on Dec. 10 is scheduled to become the first Canadian executed in
the United States since 1952
	   The case of Joseph Faulder, a former mechanic convicted in the
stabbing and beating death of a 75-year-old Texas woman, has
captured the attention of international human rights groups, the
U.N. human rights commission and the Canadian government.
	   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy plans to press Canada's campaign
for clemency when he meets U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Washington on Monday.
	   Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976, and regularly seeks
clemency for Canadians sentenced to death abroad. The Faulder case
has generated especially intense feelings because many Canadians
are critical of the high number of executions in the United States,
particularly in Texas.
	   Faulder has never claimed he is innocent in the 1975 death of
Inez Phillips, the matriarch of an oil family who was fatally
stabbed and bludgeoned during a botched robbery at her home in
Gladewater, Texas.
	   But those seeking clemency for Faulder have raised several
issues which they say should persuade Texas Gov. George W. Bush to
commute the execution.
	   For the Canadian government, which filed a brief Wednesday with
the U.S. Supreme Court, the key argument is that Texas authorities
violated an international treaty affording all foreign suspects the
right to contact their own governments for legal help. Faulder
wasn't given the chance to speak with Canadian consular officials
until 1991.
	   Texas authorities said they had no idea Faulder was Canadian at
the time of his arrest because he was using a Texas driver's
license.
	   Other critics of Faulder's sentence note that he was convicted
as a result of a private prosecution, funded by Mrs. Phillips' son.
	   Faulder, 61, grew up in Jasper, Alberta, but left his wife and
children during the winter of 1974-75 and headed to the United
States.
	   He and a girlfriend robbed Mrs. Phillips' home on the mistaken
belief that there was a large sum of money in her safe.
	   He signed a confession after his arrest, and was convicted of
murder in 1977. That conviction was overturned in 1979 because
Faulder had no lawyers present for the confession, resulting in a
second trial involving the private prosecutors.
	   Faulder, who is sentenced to die by lethal injection at the
state prison in Huntsville, granted an interview this month to the
Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
	   ``I don't say that I shouldn't be here,'' Faulder said. ``I say
that death row should not exist. Period.''
	   He thanked the Canadians campaigning on his behalf, and added,
``I just want to let people know I am not a monster.''
	   Axworthy raised Faulder's case Wednesday with Mary Robinson, the
U.N. high commissioner for human rights, during her visit to
Canada.
	   ``I'm very concerned about the circumstances of the Canadian and
the fact that he did not have access to consular advice at an
earlier stage,'' Robinson said.
	   A delegation of Canadians opposed to capital punishment is
leaving for Texas on Dec. 5 to ask Bush to commute Faulder's death
sentence. The delegation will include Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter,
the former boxer who spent 19 years in a New Jersey prison for a
murder he didn't commit.
	   Not all Canadians support the clemency campaign. Alberta's
conservative premier, Ralph Klein, said of the Faulder case,
``Texas has its laws and when you commit the crime you know what
the punishment is going to be.''

African heads of state focus on security at summit

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Security on the strife-ridden African continent was
the focus of a summit drawing 49 African nations, including 34
heads of state, to Paris Thursday, a meeting sure to underscore
France's bid to expand its sphere of influence.
	   The 20th French-African summit, which ends Saturday, could
possibly take steps toward addressing the knotty issues at the crux
of conflicts via meetings on the sidelines.
	   The main actors in the Congo conflict are attending the summit,
including Congolese President Laurent-Desire Kabila and the
presidents of Uganda and Rwanda, Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur
Bizimungu, respectively. Both countries support rebels waging an
insurgency in the Congo. The Rwandan leader said Wednesday he is
prepared to meet with Kabila in Paris.
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled for separate
talks with President Jacques Chirac on Saturday.
	   The guest list suggests a bid by France to break out of its
traditional sphere of influence, and expand beyond its former
colonies to other parts of Africa.
	   Among those making first appearances at the summit, which starts
real business Friday, are Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan. Annan and Organization of African
Unity chairman Blaise Campaore of Burkina Faso are to address the
summit.
	   Among absentees are Sudan and Libya, uninvited because their
countries are under U.N. sanctions, Algeria, which traditionally
refuses to attend, and Gabon.
	   French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said this week
that France seeks a ``pragmatic reflection'' on the security issue,
including conflict prevention and peacekeeping.
	   A quarter of sub-Saharan Africa is currently implicated in
crises.
	   ``There will be no development without security,'' French
Cooperation Minister Charles Josselin said in an interview
published Thursday in the daily Le Figaro.
	   Paris feels ``concerned with elaborating a new architecture of
security'' for Africa, Colonna told reporters this week.
	   Chirac said last year that France would no longer serve as
Africa' s gendarme. Paris favors regional security organizations
and an African peacekeeping force.
	   Since last year, France has moved to redefine its relationship
with Africa after a century as benevolent patriarch across a large
swath of the continent. Former colonies gained prestige and
financial benefits for remaining within Paris' sphere of influence.
	   But in 1997 France announced a five-year plan to cut its forces
in Africa from 8,000 to 5,000 and close one of six military bases.
	   The French push for an increasingly multilateral approach to
Africa came as the United States' began asserting its influence
there.
	   French aid to Africa - at some dlrs 1.25 billion - still
surpasses American aid, about dlrs 700 million.
	   But it is a development in another city, London, that has added
a layer of mystery to the Paris proceedings. The House of Lords'
decision Wednesday not to grant immunity to former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet had led to questioning about some of the leaders
gathered here, particularly Kabila.
	   The Paris-based International Federation of the League of Human
Rights and the French League for the Defense of Human Rights on
Tuesday both filed court complaints against Kabila for ``massive
violation of human rights.''
	   Colonna refused to specify to questioning reporters whether
Kabila, as a guest head of state, would be sheltered from French
justice.

 &UR; American soldiers celebrate Thanksgiving with mixed emotions
 &UR; By NERMINA DURMIC-KAHROVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Nearly 7,000 American
soldiers spent Thanksgiving Day writing letters, sending e-mail to
their loved ones and enjoying turkey and apple pie 7,000 miles away
from home.
	   Many of the troops, who are stationed in Bosnia as part of a
NATO-led international peacekeeping force, had mixed feelings about
spending the holiday so far from home.
	   ``The soldiers are sad to be away of their families, but they
are here on a noble mission and they are very proud to be part of
that,'' said Maj. Gen. Kevin Byrnes, Cmdr. Multinational Division
North.
	   Although they were far from home, the decorated dining
facilities tried to create the feel of Thanksgiving back in the
United States. Troops heaping their plates could feast on a
traditional turkey dinner and count their blessings.
	   ``I miss my parents, but I have a lot of things to be thankful
for,'' said Capt. Dia Logan, 30, of Boise, Idaho. ``And I feel as
additional benefit to be in Bosnia on a peacekeeping mission.''
	   Marking the holiday, American Forces Network-Europe (AFN) radio
station based in Frankfurt, Germany traveled to Eagle Base to open
AFN-Bosnia. The station, to be based in Taszar, Hungary and share
the airwaves with its partner AFN-Hungary, will broadcast to more
than 10,000 U.S. troops deployed in Hungary and Bosnia, as well as
Macedonia and Croatia.
	   ``We're American radio for the American peacekeepers, spreading
the word and music to those who keep the peace,'' said Bill
Johnson-Miles, AFN-Bosnia station manager.
	   American singers and bands _ Lari White and ``Galaxy'' _
traveled to a few U.S. military bases in Bosnia, trying to bring
the sounds of home.
	   ``Everyone like different things for Thanksgiving. For me,
without egg eggnog it is not Thanksgiving Day, ``said Lt. Colonel
Stephen Kerrick,49, of Lansing, Kansas.
	   Along with the traditional feast of grilled turkey, glazed baked
ham, candied sweet potatoes and apple pie, there was eggnog too _
but without alcohol.

Parliament speaker: Russian government `squishy as cabbage'

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Calling Boris Yeltsin's government ``squishy as
cabbage,'' the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament
abandoned his support for the president Thursday and called for a
transfer of some powers to parliament.
	   The statement was remarkable coming from Yegor Stroyev _ a
moderate who until now had firmly refused to take sides against
Yeltsin _ and another sign that the ailing president is losing even
his most loyal supporters.
	   ``The government is as squishy as cabbage in the fall,''
Stroyev, the speaker of the Federation Council, said in an
interview published in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.
	   He joined a growing number of former presidential supporters who
have distanced themselves from Yeltsin in recent days, while the
president remains hospitalized with pneumonia.
	   Stroyev said that a weakened president was unable to use the
extensive powers granted him under the Russian constitution.
	   ``There is a flow of accusations against the president for
having sweeping powers unrivaled by any other president, but these
powers end at the Kremlin walls,'' Stroyev said.
	   The Kremlin released no new details Thursday on the president's
condition.
	   Still, a series of illnesses has turned Yeltsin into a part-time
president and fueled strong doubts about his ability to serve out
the remainder of a term that runs until mid-2000.
	   Valentin Pokrovsky, a doctor and the president of the Russian
Academy of Medical Sciences, who has examined Yeltsin in the past,
said Thursday that the president seems ``rather tired and not quite
healthy.''
	   The Communist-led opposition in parliament's lower house has
pushed for a bill that would require a medical checkup for the
president, with the results made public. So far, the move has
failed.
	   While parliament's lower house has long been
opposition-dominated, Stroyev's upper house, made up of regional
governors, has been generally pro-Yeltsin _ until recently.
	   Stroyev didn't touch upon Yeltsin's health in his interview, but
spoke for a check on presidential powers and a corresponding
increase of parliamentary authority.
	   ``No reasonable man doubts that the constitution needs
revision,'' Stroyev said. ``The parliament's functions have been
unreasonably reduced.''
	   In another blow to Yeltsin, his former chief bodyguard Alexander
Korzhakov on Thursday reiterated allegations that the president and
his family are manipulated by controversial business mogul Boris
Berezovsky.
	   Korzhakov called a news conference to claim that Berezovsky was
blackmailing the president's family, threatening to release
compromising materials. He did not elaborate.
	   Berezovsky, who has gained a reputation as an influential
background player in Russian politics, serves as the executive
secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of
ex-Soviet republics.
	   Many in Russia believe that Berezovsky is a strong influence on
Yeltsin _ as Korzhakov had been before he was dismissed in a
Kremlin power struggle in 1996.
	   Berezovsky dismissed Korzhakov's allegations Thursday, and the
Kremlin refused to comment, the Interfax news agency said.

No. 1 again, Sampras makes tennis history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more background, EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras made tennis history
Thursday, holding the No. 1 ranking for a record sixth consecutive
year.
	   He assured himself the top ranking for 1998 when Marcelo Rios
pulled out of the ATP Tour World Championship because of a back
injury. Rios withdrew before his match against Greg Rusedski.
	   Sampras had been tied with Jimmy Connors, each finishing No. 1
for five straight years.
	   The new record is unlikely to be ever broken, Sampras said
earlier this week.
	   Rios, ranked No. 2, was the only man who could have threatened
Sampras for the top ranking. Sampras entered the tournament with a
33-point lead over the Chilean in the computer standings.
	   ``I waited until the last minute,'' Rios said. ``I went to bed
last night thinking I would play.''
	   ``But when I tried to practice this morning, it was really sore.
It made no sense to go out on the court and play two games,'' Rios
said. ``I am disappointed but that's the way it goes.''
	   ``It's really, really sore, it's so sore that I can't go on
court. Pulling out of a tournaments is always bad and you don't
feel good,'' Rios said.
	   Sampras, who played Karol Kucera later Thursday, already has
clinched a berth in the semifinals of the season-ending tournament
he has won four times.
	   In the first match Thursday, Tim Henman beat Alex Corretja 7-6
(7-4), 6-7, (4-7), 6-2 to become the second player to advance to
the semifinals.
	   Corretja dropped to 1-1 but remains alive under the round-robin
format. Henman is 2-0.
	   Rusedski, an alternate, played Albert Costa, the second
alternate. Rusedski replaced Andre Agassi, who dropped out late
Wednesday, also because of a back injury.
	   The elite dlrs 3.5 million tournament brings together players
with the best results over the year. But with Patrick Rafter and
Richard Krajicek both pulling out before the event because of
injuries and Agassi and Rios withdrawing, four of the best players
are missing.
	   Rios had to do better than Sampras in the tournament to have a
shot at dethroning him. But Sampras scored quick and impressive
victories in his opening matches.
	   Rios had already dented his hopes of overtaking Sampras by
losing his first match, to Henman.
	   ``It's certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,''
Sampras said after beating Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday.
	   ``I'm also helping myself by winning. I can't really be too
concerned about what Marcelo is doing,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take care of things
myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully good
enough.''
	   Sampras was not even aware that he had clinched a place in the
semis.
	   ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today and
yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,''
Sampras said.
	   ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit more than
last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much pressure on
him as possible.''
	   Sampras now has one more record to go for. With 11 Grand Slam
titles, he is one behind Roy Emerson.
	   By his standards, Sampras has had a relatively modest year,
winning four tournaments. That included his fifth Wimbledon, but no
other Grand Slams.
	   Sampras leads all active players with 56 career titles. Connors'
record of 109 looks safe for a long time to come.

Cyprus president arrives for crucial missile talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece will hold talks with the Cypriot
president on the fate of a controversial missile deployment that
threatens to bring conflict to the divided island.
	   Premier Costas Simitis said Thursday he will discuss the S-300
missile stalemate with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides during
his current visit to Greece.
	   Purchased earlier this year, the missiles have been gathering
dust in a Russian warehouse at a cost of dlrs one million a month
until Cyprus decides what to do with them. They have twice
postponed their deployment.
	   Greece is said to favor a proposal to install the missiles on
the Greek island of Crete, but Clerides fears such a decision could
lead to his political demise. Simitis would not directly deny that
the missiles could wind up on Crete.
	   ``The S-300 are not an end in themselves. We will discuss and
decide which course helps solve the problem,'' he said.
	   Last week, Turkey's second highest-ranking general warned Greece
that war would break out if Greek Cypriots set up the Russian-made
missiles.
	   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish forces invaded the
northern third of the island to protect the Turkish minority
following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece in
1974.
	   Turkey maintains about 30,000 troops in a northern break-away
state, which is only recognized by Ankara. Greece has a defense
pact with Greek Cypriots.
	   ``Greece's government agrees with Cyprus that it needs an
effective defense. To do this they need some means. But they are
not an end in themselves,'' Simitis explained during a news
conference.
	   Simitis, Clerides and their ministers of defense and foreign
affairs will meet here Friday to discuss whether Cyprus will go
ahead with the deployment of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles.
	   Although NATO allies, Greece and Turkey have nearly fought twice
in the past 11 years over territorial disputes.

Israeli troops, Palestinians clash in three West Bank locations

<TEXT>
	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ For the first time since the signing of
the latest Mideast peace accord, violent confrontations erupted
between Israelis and Palestinians Thursday in three areas of the
West Bank.
	   On the outskirts of the city of Jenin, Israeli troops fired
rubber-coated bullets into a crowd of about 100 Palestinian
protesters who threw stones and marched towards the soldier
compound. An Israeli soldier could be seen on a tower inside the
army's compound alternately ducking and shooting.
	   Two Palestinians suffered mild injuries and were treated at
hospital.
	   Palestinians had been demonstrating for the release of relatives
jailed by Israel. Organized by Yasser Arafat's Fatah party,
protesters walked behind a white banner showing prisoners' hands
chained and bleeding. ``No peace without release of all
prisoners,'' it said.
	   More than 2,500 Palestinians are in Israeli jails, and the issue
is sensitive among Palestinians, many of whom spent time in jail or
had relatives jailed during the three-decade occupation by Israel.
	   Israel set free 250 prisoners last week and will release another
500 in two more stages as part of the peace accord signed last
month in Washington. But prisoners who murdered or conspired to
murder will not be among those included in the release, despite
requests from Palestinians.
	   In the tensely divided city of Hebron, scuffles broke-out after
Jewish settlers tried to prevent Palestinian school children on
their way to a field trip from walking by the settler compound.
	   Palestinian witnesses said adults from the settler community
pushed and shoved the girls, ages 6-14, back into the nearby school
yard.
	   Five girls were carried away in Palestinian ambulances after
fainting and the hospital later reported 12 were seen by doctors
but none suffered lasting injury.
	   Israeli police however said the 40 children, led by their
principal, Firial Abu Hekal, were holding an illegal protest in
front of the settler homes. Palestinians are frequently harassed by
Jewish settlers when walking near their homes. The principal and
three others from the girls school were detained and questioned by
police.
	   In the Burkin village near Qalqiliya, about 2,000 Palestinians
and 15 Israeli peace activists protested Israeli construction of a
bypass road on confiscated Arab.
	   The demonstrators blocked the road and stopped the bulldozers
briefly. The Palestinians threw stones, and Israeli troops guarding
the site responded by firing in the air and lobbing tear gas to
disperse the crowd.
	   Palestinian police, stationed in all three West Bank areas, did
nothing to keep their citizens at bay. In Burkin, Palestinian
police watched from their post but did not get involved in the
confrontation. After warnings from Israeli officers, Palestinian
security police arrived a half-hour after the violence began to
persuade protesters to pull back.

EU investigating Boeing, Airbus prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Airbus reaction, background

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators are
investigating prices charged by airplane manufacturers Boeing Co.
and Airbus Industrie, an EU official said Thursday.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
European Commission had sent the companies questions about price
rises to find out if there is any cartel activity.
	   He told reporters the EU executive body's inquiries were not a
full cartel probe and were not coordinated with U.S. regulators.
	   Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht denied any involvement by the
European aerospace consortium in price-fixing. ``It's absolute
nonsense to talk of collusion in this industry,'' she said.
	   France-based Airbus and Boeing of the United States share the
world's market in large commercial jets.
	   Boeing announced rises in list prices on most of its aircraft by
5 percent in July, the first increase in 23 years. Airbus raised
its prices by 3 percent.
	   Both companies recently said they want to focus on increasing
profits rather than market shares after competition between them
drove down prices.
	   The EU move follows media reports that the US Federal Trade
Commission was investigating the companies' prices.
	   Kracht acknowledged that the industry is concentrated, but
insisted competition is fierce.
	   Boeing, which absorbed its U.S. competitor McDonnell Douglas
last year, traditionally has won 60 percent or more of the world's
airliner orders each year. Although Airbus reached parity this year
with orders, Boeing has 70 percent of the commercial jet deliveries
this year and would have 67 percent in 1999 if the forecasts hold.
	   The EU Commission imposed tough conditions on Boeing's takeover
of McDonnell Douglas to ensure the U.S. company did not gain a
dominant position in world markets.
	   The Airbus consortium comprises Aerospatiale SA of France,
Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas SA, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG
of Germany and British Aerospace.

Mitch reconstruction costs estimated at dlrs 4 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Officials from five Central
American countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch estimate it will
cost them dlrs 4 billion to rebuild.
	   ``This amount will be proposed to the international financial
community that is willing to help in the area's reconstruction,''
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein said Wednesday night
after an eight-hour meeting of ministers from the five nations.
	   The presidents of the Central American nations will travel to
Washington on Dec. 9-11 to meet with representatives of the
Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank.
	   Officials say more than 10,000 people were killed in Honduras,
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica. About 19,000 are
still missing and almost 3 million were left homeless from last
month's storm.

Nepal, Bhutan to resume talks on repatriation of refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal and Bhutan will resume talks in
January to resolve the issue of repatriation of nearly 100,000
Bhutanese refugees living in camps in this Himalayan state for the
past eight years, a Nepalese minister said Thursday.
	   Nepalese Interior Minister Govind Raj Joshi, who returned home
Thursday after talks with the Bhutanese officials in Thimpu, said
both sides have shown a strong commitment to settle the refugee
problem.
	   ``There have been some hurdles in negotiations. But this visit
has ended all that,'' Joshi told reporters in Katmandu, the
Nepalese capital.
	   Relations between the two Himalayan kingdoms have been strained
since Nepalese-speaking Bhutanese started fleeing to Nepal in early
1980s after Bhutan tightened its citizenship regulations.
	   The refugees, living in eight camps in eastern Nepal under the
care of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, say they
have the right to return to Bhutan.
	   Though many refugees possess land ownership certificates or
other evidence of citizenship, Bhutan says not all qualify as
legitimate citizens.
	   The last ministerial meeting between the two countries was held
in the Nepalese capital in April 1996.

Italian foreign minister contends Ocalan does not meet conditions
</HEADLINE>
for asylum &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy cannot grant Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan political asylum because he is not a victim of persecution,
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini contended in an interview published
Thursday.
	   ``We are talking about terrorist acts committed voluntarily,''
Dini told the Corriere della Sera daily. ``We are not dealing with
a victim.''
	   Italy's Interior Ministry is examining Ocalan's asylum request,
with a decision expected in the coming months.
	   Both Turkey and Germany have issued arrest warrants for Ocalan
on charges of terrorism. But Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan
to Turkey -- where he is the No. 1 fugitive -- because Italian laws
forbids the extradition of suspects to countries where they face
the death penalty, as Ocalan does in Turkey.
	   Turkey is furious over the decision and its people have
protested burning Italian clothes and cars and launched boycotts
against Italian products.
	   Germany is worried about possible violence between its
approximately 2 million Turks and 400,000 Kurds and has said it
won't seek Ocalan's extradition.
	   ``By not asking for Ocalan's extradition, Germany risks damaging
the international fight against terrorism,'' Dini said. He
criticized Germany's decision to issue an arrest warrant and then
fail to ask for extradition as ``incoherent.''
	   Italy's rightist-led opposition has demanded Ocalan's immediate
expulsion.
	   ``That would be backing away from our responsibility in the
fight against terrorism,'' Dini said. Instead, Dini suggested
putting Ocalan on trial in an arbitrarily chosen country, which
could also be Italy.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 when he arrived at the Rome airport
aboard a flight from Moscow. A hardline Communist deputy revealed
Wednesday that he accompanied Ocalan on the flight.
	   The rebel leader is staying in a Rome villa under police
surveillance while he awaits a decision on his asylum request.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
waged a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.

OPEC meeting ends in rancor; no agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES London oil price; ADDS analyst comment oil industry
heading for privatization; RESTORES second half of Lukman quote,
Iranian delegate quote; RECASTS &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC closed a rancorous year-end meeting
Thursday without even a minimum agreement to extend oil production
cuts, saying it would review the situation again in March.
	   OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman said the organization will
take whatever measures are necessary to try and boost oil prices
then, but there will be no policy changes in the meantime.
	   ``We have already got an agreement, you know,'' Lukman said.
``In March we will decide what to do.''
	   The move was a surprise, with analysts predicting beforehand
OPEC would extend cuts to the end of 1999, as a bare minimum to
shore up rock-bottom oil prices, hovering near 12-year lows.
	   In a sign of the pressure OPEC countries are under as average
OPEC oil prices fall from last year's dlrs 18 to under dlrs 11, the
meeting was characterized by sharp disagreements.
	   ``I cannot recall in recent years the body language (of
ministers) being so negative. It was really negative and it's not
good for the markets,'' said Mehdi Varzi, head of research at
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
	   Varzi predicted low oil prices will trigger privatization in
OPEC's quota-oriented, state-controlled oil industries, with
governments keen to shed costly state subsidies as prices slump.
	   ``I believe we are on the verge of a new era of the oil
industry, something which happens every 20-30 years,'' Varzi said.
	   Some delegates had hoped that a 12-month, 2.6 million
barrel-a-day cut set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries June could be extended six months to the end of 1999.
	   OPEC did decide to realign its annual schedule, meeting in March
and September rather than June and November _ a move which could
ease up on inaction.
	   ``If it's a weak winter they have the opportunity in March to do
something. That's the positive side. On the negative side _ for the
market is that _ they expected cuts to be extended and they haven't
got that,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at London's Center
for Global Energy Studies.
	   Drollas predicted prices would dip or stay flat, as expectations
of the meeting had been low.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January was
trading in London late Thursday afternoon at dlrs 10.97, up
slightly from Wednesday's record contract low of dlrs 10.88.
	   OPEC's problem: a hike in production last winter coincided with
Asia's economic crisis. Daily growth demand dropped from about 2
million to 640,000 barrels a day. An oil glut resulted, pushing
down prices.
	   In his opening speech, outgoing OPEC president Obaid bin Saif
Al-Nasseri acknowledged that a ``strong bearish sentiment has set
in'' on the world market.
	   OPEC Thursday elected Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi as the
cartel's new president, replacing Al-Nasseri.
	   Ministers had pushed back the start of the meeting, originally
scheduled to begin Wednesday, because of deep differences over
issues of extending cuts and disagreements on production levels.
	   Iran said criticism over its output level was unfair.
	   ``Others are blaming Iran,'' a senior Iranian delegate told The
Associated Press, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   When OPEC was determining Iran's production capacity, he said,
it did not take into account two new refineries that came on line
in February.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the
group's biggest producer.
	   Some members complained that Saudi Arabia had seized market
share after Iraq's departure from the oil market in 1990, and now
won't let go. The kingdom is pushing for better compliance with
June's cuts, saying there is no point to further cuts until full
compliance is achieved.
	   Iraq has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990
invasion of fellow OPEC member, Kuwait, but is now allowed to sell
limited amounts of oil under U.N. supervision to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods.
	   Venezuela threw a late wrench in the works when Oil Minister
Erwin Arrieta told ministers that with a new government taking over
in February it could not commit to an extension of the existing
production cuts.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
had called for new output reductions, a stance supported by Algeria
and Libya.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

New malfunctions reported at Ukraine's Zaporizhia nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Output was reduced at a reactor at Europe's
largest nuclear plant following an unexpected pump shutdown,
officials said Thursday, the latest of several problems at
Ukraine's Zaporizhia plant.
	   No radiation leaks were reported.
	   The government company Energoatom, which runs Ukraine's nuclear
power plants, said the turbine pump at the plant's reactor No. 5
suffered a vault failure Wednesday and was shut down ``due to
uncoordinated actions of personnel.''
	   Energoatom did not say what the actions were. The automatic
safety system reduced the reactor's output to 49 percent of
capacity after the pump shutdown and brought it back to 80 percent
by Wednesday night, it said.
	   Zaporizhia operates six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors,
about 630 kilometers (390 miles) south of the capital, Kiev.
	   Last week, a minor hydrogen explosion occurred at an idle
reactor at the plant. And output at yet another reactor, No. 6, was
briefly reduced because the chemical composition of its cooling
water deteriorated.
	   And earlier this month, the No. 5 reactor was stopped and
restarted in an unscheduled systems check, even though government
officials have warned against the practice.
	   The report of the latest malfunction coincided with a newspaper
report Thursday that said plant workers at Zaporizhia last week
switched off safety systems and operated the reactors manually. The
move was unconnected to the other problems at the plant.
	   The decision was made after the electricity frequency on the
countrywide power grid fell below a critical level, which prompts
nuclear plant safety systems to automatically reduce reactor
output, the daily Dyen said.
	   The workers feared that reducing output would put the reactors
at risk, so they switched off the safety systems.
	   Dyen said many experts consider similar actions to be the cause
of the 1986 explosion at Ukraine's Chernobyl plant, the world's
worst nuclear accident.
	   Oleksandr Hudyma, the head of parliament's nuclear safety
commission, told Dyen that financial problems in Ukraine's energy
sector have led to numerous drops in grid frequency and dangerous
situations at nuclear power plants.
	   Energoatom confirmed that safety systems reacting to frequency
changes were switched off for two days at Zaporizhia. The Nuclear
Regulation Administration told the newspaper it has issued an order
forbidding the practice.
	   Ukraine, however, heavily relies on its five nuclear power
plants, which account for over 40 percent of the country's
electricity. Energy officials have warned that a single reactor
shutdown might disrupt the entire energy system, already overloaded
because of an unusually cold weather.

Ukraine's government revises inflation figure for 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Pustovoitenko quote in 7th graf to `no more' sted `no
less.' &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government more than doubled its
projected inflation figure for 1999 to 20 percent, while parliament
demanded that the government increase revenues in next year's
budget, officials said Thursday.
	   The developments might complicate Ukraine's talks with the
International Monetary Fund, which is sending a mission to Kiev
next week to check the country's compliance with the terms of a
dlrs 2.2 billion loan approved in the fall.
	   The government's revision of the 1999 budget came after
President Leonid Kuchma criticized the budget draft on Wednesday,
saying it was based on figures worked out before the effects of
Russia's financial crisis hit Ukraine.
	   Kuchma said the inflation figure should be around 20 percent
annually _ instead of the projected 7.8 percent _ adding that the
Cabinet should either readjust or abandon trading controls that
limit broad fluctuations in the national hryvna currency.
	   In recent days, Kuchma has spoken in favor of a floating rate
for the hryvna, now trading at about 3.43 to the U.S. dollar, and
for printing more money, which is strongly opposed by the IMF.
	   The National Bank had only planned to print 900 million hryvna
(dlrs 262 million at the current rate) in 1999, basing the figure
on a 7.8 percent rate of inflation and a hryvna rate of about 4 to
the dollar.
	   But Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said Thursday the
government is now projecting an inflation rate of ``no more'' than
20 percent in 1999, the Interfax and the UNIAN news agencies said.
Inflation has been nearly 13 percent so far this year.
	   The budget deficit figure was left unchanged at 0.6 percent of
Ukraine's gross domestic product, Pustovoitenko said.
	   The original 1999 budget draft, which Cabinet presented to
parliament on Nov. 17, projected that the economy will grow by 1
percent next year, the first growth since Ukraine won independence
with the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   It also provided for 23.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 6.74 billion at
the current rate) in budget revenues.
	   The draft is likely to face strong criticism in parliament,
dominated by centrist and leftist opposition members who favor more
state subsidies to ease Ukraine's social tensions. Parliament is
due to hold its first vote on the budget draft around Dec. 1.
	   On Thursday, parliament's influential budget committee demanded
that the planned budget revenues be raised by nearly 20 billion
hryvna (dlrs 5.84 billion) and the additional funds be used to pay
back wages and pensions, subsidize ailing regions and support
Ukraine's health and education systems.
	   Committee chief and centrist opposition leader Julia Tymoshenko
said the revenues could be increased by raising transit fees for
the transportation of oil and gas through Ukraine and the use of
its air space by foreign air companies, Interfax reported.

	   LONDON (AP) _ If ballroom dancing makes it the Olympics, have a
team of paramedics standing by. There may be casualties.
	   Donna Shingler found herself rushed to hospital with concussion
and with a dislocated jawbone after colliding with an opponent at
the British national pro dance sport championships.
	   She and husband Alan collided with another couple during a
high-speed spin and she received a blow on the head.
	   ``She told me after the fox-trot that she did not feel very
well,'' Alan Shingler was quoted as saying on the sports pages of
The Times.
	   ``She survived the tango but went down at the end of the
quickstep.''
	   Shingler was given oxygen by first aid staff at Blackpool's
Winter Gardens where the event was taking place before she was
taken to hospital.
	   ``I drove her home the next day and she was sick three times in
the car,'' her husband said. ``We went to an osteopath who said her
jawbone was out of line and put it back for her.''
	   He explained that the incident was especially tough on the
couple as they were hoping to make an impact in pro dancing having
placed second in the world amateur championship in Japan last
month.
	   ``It was definitely rough out there,'' he said. ``There were 14
of us out there on the floor but it felt more like 40.
	   ``It is destined to get worse. All anyone speaks about now is
energy, energy and more energy. Dancers are trying to go faster and
faster,'' Alan Shingler said.
	   ``I'm just afraid that we are in danger of sacrificing beauty
for speed.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS _ Two people were killed and another critically injured
Thursday afternoon in a barroom shooting east of the capital,
police said.
	   A man opened fire just after 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) at a bar in
Lilas, a working class suburb east of Paris, police said.
Investigators do not yet know the motive for the shooting, but said
they believe it could have been a settling of scores.
	   Further details were not immediately available.
	   Emergency workers tried to resuscitate two people hit in the
shootout, but were unable to save them. A third person remains in
critical condition, according to emergency workers.
	   Two customers who witnessed the shooting were being treated for
shock, police said.

nations was dlrs 73.4 in 1997, of which Ukrainian exports accounted
for only dlrs 6.7 million.
	   Pustovoitenko said economic ties were expected to profit from
accords on investment protection and avoidance of dual taxation
that are to be signed during Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's
visit to Slovenia, planned for next year.
	   Drnovsek, in turn, praised Ukraine as a ``very important
economic and political partner'' and said he brought along a
delegation of businessmen to study investment opportunities, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Slovenian premier also promised to simplify visa procedures
for Ukrainian visitors once his country opens an embassy in Kiev,
the Ukrainian capital, in the near future. About 30,000 Ukrainians
visited Slovenia in 1997.
	   The sides also discussed plans for setting up an international
consortium to build a European transport corridor from Italy's port
of Trieste to Slovenia, Hungary and Ukraine.
	   Before completing his one-day visit, Drnovsek also met with
Kuchma, who voiced concern about the expansion of European Union
and its effects on Ukraine. Ukraine is worried about the possible
tightening of visa rules for its citizens and aspires to become an
associated EU member.
	   ``The EU expansion worries Ukraine no less than NATO
expansion,'' Kuchma said.

OPEC meeting ends in rancor; no agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES London oil price; ADDS analyst comment oil industry
heading for privatization; RESTORES second half of Lukman quote,
Iranian delegate quote; RECASTS with more details. &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC closed a rancorous year-end meeting
Thursday without even a minimum agreement to extend oil production
cuts, saying it would review the situation again in March.
	   OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman said the organization will
take whatever measures are necessary to try and boost oil prices
then, but there will be no policy changes in the meantime.
	   ``We have already got an agreement, you know,'' Lukman said.
``In March we will decide what to do.''
	   The move was a surprise, with analysts predicting beforehand
OPEC would extend cuts to the end of 1999, as a bare minimum to
shore up rock-bottom oil prices, hovering near 12-year lows.
	   In a sign of the pressure OPEC countries are under as average
OPEC oil prices fall from last year's dlrs 18 to under dlrs 11, the
meeting was characterized by sharp disagreements.
	   ``I cannot recall in recent years the body language (of
ministers) being so negative. It was really negative and it's not
good for the markets,'' said Mehdi Varzi, head of research at
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
	   Varzi predicted low oil prices will trigger privatization in
OPEC's quota-oriented, state-controlled oil industries, with
governments keen to shed costly state subsidies as prices slump.
	   ``I believe we are on the verge of a new era of the oil
industry, something which happens every 20-30 years,'' Varzi said.
	   Some delegates had hoped that a 12-month, 2.6 million
barrel-a-day cut set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries June could be extended six months to the end of 1999.
	   OPEC did decide to realign its annual schedule, meeting in March
and September rather than June and November _ a move which could
ease up on inaction.
	   ``If it's a weak winter they have the opportunity in March to do
something. That's the positive side. On the negative side _ for the
market is that _ they expected cuts to be extended and they haven't
got that,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at London's Center
for Global Energy Studies.
	   Drollas predicted prices would dip or stay flat, as expectations
of the meeting had been low.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January was
trading in London late Thursday afternoon at dlrs 10.97, up
slightly from Wednesday's record contract low of dlrs 10.88.
	   OPEC's problem: a hike in production last winter coincided with
Asia's economic crisis. Daily growth demand dropped from about 2
million to 640,000 barrels a day. An oil glut resulted, pushing
down prices.
	   In his opening speech, outgoing OPEC president Obaid bin Saif
Al-Nasseri acknowledged that a ``strong bearish sentiment has set
in'' on the world market.
	   OPEC Thursday elected Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi as the
cartel's new president, replacing Al-Nasseri.
	   Ministers had pushed back the start of the meeting, originally
scheduled to begin Wednesday, because of deep differences over
issues of extending cuts and disagreements on production levels.
	   Iran said criticism over its output level was unfair.
	   ``Others are blaming Iran,'' a senior Iranian delegate told The
Associated Press, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   When OPEC was determining Iran's production capacity, he said,
it did not take into account two new refineries that came on line
in February.
	   Iran says it deserves a review of its base production level and
that any further cuts should be made mostly by Saudi Arabia, the
group's biggest producer.
	   Some members complained that Saudi Arabia had seized market
share after Iraq's departure from the oil market in 1990, and now
won't let go. The kingdom is pushing for better compliance with
June's cuts, saying there is no point to further cuts until full
compliance is achieved.
	   Iraq has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990
invasion of fellow OPEC member, Kuwait, but is now allowed to sell
limited amounts of oil under U.N. supervision to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods.
	   Venezuela threw a late wrench in the works when Oil Minister
Erwin Arrieta told ministers that with a new government taking over
in February it could not commit to an extension of the existing
production cuts.
	   Kuwait, which says its 1998 oil revenue will sink by 45 percent,
had called for new output reductions, a stance supported by Algeria
and Libya.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

Russian Communist chief says conditions in homeland catastrophic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov,
on the second day of a four day visit to Germany, told reporters in
Bonn Thursday that economic and social conditions in his homeland
are ``catastrophic.''
	   Russia finds itself currently ``on a small ledge between chaos
and criminality,'' Zyuganov told reporters in Bonn.
	   He blamed Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who he said was
``unable to govern'' and former Prime Minster Viktor Chernomyrdin
for Russia's problems. He said they had created the conditions
allowing the people to be ``robbed,'' leaving only a few to attain
prosperity.
	   At the moment there are 20 million people jobless in Russia, 15
to 20 million without enough food, and nearly half the population
of some 148 million live in poverty, Zyuganov said.
	   At the same time Zyuganov described the policies of Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov as ``sensible,'' but said that
liberals in Yeltzin's circle were repeatedly hindering his work.
	   Russia can only be a success if it manages to combine stability
and economic growth and fights crime, Zyuganov said.
	   Zyuganov, who among others has met with Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine, Christian Democratic Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble and
business leaders, said that Germany remains very important to his
country.
	   Now that Germany has says it can no longer help financially,
Zyuganov said he hoped the government would encourage private
businesses to invest in Russia.
	   Zyuganov also said he could not understand why the trustworthy
government of Primakov could not obtain money from the West, while
Yeltsin, Chernoyrdin and their teams had ``boozed up the billions
of marks (dollars),'' previously received from Germany.
	   Russia's economy, which had begun to grow last year for the
first time since the Soviet collapse, succumbed this year to the
global economic crisis that started in Asia. It crashed in August,
when the Russian government devalued the ruble and effectively
defaulted on its foreign loans.

No. 1 again, Sampras makes tennis history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rusedski winning &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras made tennis history
Thursday, holding the No. 1 ranking for a record sixth consecutive
year.
	   He assured himself the top ranking for 1998 when Marcelo Rios
pulled out of the ATP Tour World Championship because of a back
injury. Rios withdrew before his match against Greg Rusedski.
	   Sampras had been tied with Jimmy Connors, each finishing No. 1
for five straight years.
	   The new record is unlikely to be ever broken, Sampras said
earlier this week.
	   Rios, ranked No. 2, was the only man who could have threatened
Sampras for the top ranking. Sampras entered the tournament with a
33-point lead over the Chilean in the computer standings.
	   ``I waited until the last minute,'' Rios said. ``I went to bed
last night thinking I would play.''
	   ``But when I tried to practice this morning, it was really sore.
It made no sense to go out on the court and play two games,'' Rios
said. ``I am disappointed but that's the way it goes.''
	   ``It's really, really sore, it's so sore that I can't go on
court. Pulling out of a tournaments is always bad and you don't
feel good,'' Rios said.
	   Sampras, who played Karol Kucera later Thursday, already has
clinched a berth in the semifinals of the season-ending tournament
he has won four times.
	   In the first match Thursday, Tim Henman beat Alex Corretja 7-6
(7-4), 6-7, (4-7), 6-2 to become the second player to advance to
the semifinals.
	   Corretja dropped to 1-1 but remains alive under the round-robin
format. Henman is 2-0.
	   Henman paid tribute to Sampras. ``It's a phenomenal
achievement,'' he said.
	   ``It's tough for anyone else really to comprehend. I don't think
it's one that's going to be broken for a long, long time, if
ever,'' Henman said.
	   Rusedski, an alternate, played Albert Costa, the second
alternate who is ranked No. 14 in the world and won 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.
The second Briton in the field needed 10 set points to win the
first set, but breezed through the second.
	   Rusedski replaced Andre Agassi, who dropped out late Wednesday,
also because of a back injury.
	   The elite dlrs 3.5 million tournament brings together players
with the best results over the year. But with Patrick Rafter and
Richard Krajicek both pulling out before the event because of
injuries and Agassi and Rios withdrawing, four of the best players
are missing.
	   Rios had to do better than Sampras in the tournament to have a
shot at dethroning him. But Sampras scored quick and impressive
victories in his opening matches.
	   Rios had already dented his hopes of overtaking Sampras by
losing his first match, to Henman.
	   ``It's certainly a good feeling to be here over the weekend,''
Sampras said after beating Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday.
	   ``I'm also helping myself by winning. I can't really be too
concerned about what Marcelo is doing,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I have to concentrate on my matches. If I take care of things
myself and go out and win, then it should be hopefully good
enough.''
	   Sampras was not even aware that he had clinched a place in the
semis.
	   ``It's not easy to play well like I have been today and
yesterday. I was coming into today's match pretty confident,''
Sampras said.
	   ``I wanted to make sure I was coming in a little bit more than
last year, chipping and charging, trying to put as much pressure on
him as possible.''
	   Sampras now has one more major record to go for. With 11 Grand
Slam titles, he is one behind Roy Emerson.
	   By his standards, Sampras has had a relatively modest year,
winning four tournaments. That included his fifth Wimbledon, but no
other Grand Slams.
	   Sampras leads all active players with 56 career titles. Connors'
record of 109 looks safe for a long time to come.
	   But Sampras could pull into a tie with Ivan Lendl on the all
time-list by winning his fifth season finale. He's won the World
Championship in 1991, 1994 and the last two years.
	   When the year-end rankings are released Monday, Sampras will be
at No. 1 for the 248th week, the third longest total behind Lendl
(270) and Connors (268). Sampras could pass both of them next year.

Netanyahu: Israel will review tactics in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British funds for Palestinians; other quotes;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Thursday that he will order a review of his country's tactics in
Lebanon, where two Israeli soldiers died in a bomb attack a day
earlier.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for the attack, about three kms (1.8 miles) west of
the Lebanon-Israel border.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, seeks to evict some 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and the 2,500 allied militiamen from the occupied zone
that Israel carved out in 1985.
	   Following a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
Netanyahu told reporters that Israeli forces would withdraw from
Lebanon only when there were new arrangements to protect residents
of northern Israel and Israel's allies in Lebanon.
	   ``As soon as we have addressed these twin needs, we will
withdraw from Lebanon,'' he said.
	   ``When I return to Israel I will initiate a process which will
take several weeks for a reassessment, not of these goals _ which
remain fixed _ but I will seek a reassessment of our current
methods and tactics in Lebanon,'' he added.
	   At a news conference later, he declined to elaborate on tactics,
saying ``I think I ought to discuss that with the Cabinet first.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel was desperate to see a ``powerful,
sovereign government'' in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
	   ``But there has not been such a government for the last 20
years,'' he told reporters. ``They have forfeited control in the
south to terrorist groups.''
	   Netanyahu said that with goodwill and negotiation, Israel's
September peace accord with the Palestinians can be made to work,
despite ongoing disagreements over land and prisoner releases and
attacks by Islamic militants.
	   ``I intend to ... confound all the pessimists and all the
cynics,'' he said.
	   Cook announced that Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett will
attend a conference for donors to the Middle East on Monday in
Washington where Britain and the European Union will announce a
package of assistance worth 100 million pounds (dlrs 160 million)
for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   Peace will only take root if help is given to ``take forward the
economy of the Palestinian people,'' Cook said.
	   Later Thursday, Netanyahu addressed lawmakers at the House of
Commons and was to have dinner with Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Ex-Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko plans to form political party

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
said Thursday he was setting up his own political party that would
take part in the parliamentary elections next fall.
	   Kiriyenko said he wanted to make Russia's nascent democratic
institutions work for the people, and to end the ``total lack of
understanding between the government and the society.''
	   Many Russians want to work hard but are growing frustrated by
the government's failure to create normal conditions for productive
work, he said. And ordinary people still shrink from involvement in
politics.
	   ``We have democratic institutions, but we are not using them _
continuing to believe in a good czar,'' he said on the ``Hero of
the Day'' television program.
	   Kiriyenko was a political unknown when he was named as prime
minister this March. A former business executive with a reputation
as a technocrat, he was fired by President Boris Yeltsin after his
government's Aug. 17 decision to devalue the ruble and default on
its treasury debt.
	   Kiriyenko left open the question of forging a possible union
with other liberal parties and movements, saying only that ``in
general, all rational people should act together,'' according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Some liberal leaders see the 36-year-old Kiriyenko as a strong
potential leader of a new, broad reformist movement.
	   Galvanized by the recent killing of Galina Starovoitova, a
prominent liberal lawmaker, Russia's scattered pro-reform parties
have renewed talks about a possible alliance, but no concrete steps
have followed.
	   Kiriyenko refused to say what his party would be called.
	   ``I don't attach much importance to things like names. What's
the difference? There is work that needs to be done first,'' he
said.

Jordanian women demonstrate against domestic violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ More than 250 women, including the king's
sister, marched through Jordan's capital Thursday in a quiet
demonstration against domestic violence.
	   The rally in Amman came two days after a father was arrested in
the killing of his 17-year-old daughter, who had eloped with a
boyfriend.
	   The protest also followed an international conference this week
in Amman that urged judges to impose heavier sentences for ``crimes
of honor'' involving men who kill their female relatives for having
premarital sex.
	   Princess Basma took part in the march, which began at the
offices of the Jordanian General Union for Women in Jabal Amman
district and ended at a hotel more than one mile (two kilometers)
away.
	   About 25 Jordanian women are killed each year in the name of
honor, making it the most common type of murder of women in the
kingdom. But the courts impose jail sentences ranging from three
months to two years for such crimes because of the heavy premium
traditional Arab societies place on family honor.
	   Delegates from 10 Middle Eastern states recommended Monday that
their governments modernize their laws to ensure that those who
commit violence against women receive tough penalties.

Peres calls for unilateral troop withdrawal from Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ One day after two Israeli soldiers were killed
in southern Lebanon, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres joined the
ranks of other prominent Israelis Thursday in calling for a
unilateral troop withdrawal from Lebanon.
	   Peres said there was ``no alternative'' but to pull the Israeli
army out from the self-styled security zone it has patrolled within
southern Lebanon since 1985 to prevent cross-border guerrillas
raids on Israeli communities.
	   Peres' remarks follow mounting public pressure within Israel to
bring its soldiers home from what many perceive as a losing battle
against Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas who have been fighting
to oust Israeli forces and their Lebanese militia allies from the
zone.
	   Overnight Wednesday, two Israeli soldiers were killed when a
roadside bomb exploded, bringing the total number of soldiers
killed in combat there this year to 20. Ten days ago, three
soldiers were killed in a similar attack in the same area, about
three kilometers (1.8 miles) west of the Lebanese border with
Israel, and about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of Marjayoun,
the main town in the occupied zone. Hezbollah claimed
responsibility for both attacks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on a visit to London, told
reporters that he planned to convene a ministerial committee to
discuss how to improve the army's tactics in south Lebanon but he
did not offer unilateral withdrawal as an option.
	   ``As soon as we find a way to withdraw our forces without
abandoning the need and the ability to defend our northern villages
and towns, without abandoning our allies in the south of Lebanon
... as soon as we have addressed these two needs, we will withdraw
from Lebanon,'' he said.
	   Previous Israeli governments have tried unsuccessfully to reach
a peace treaty with Beirut and remove their troops from Lebanese
soil. Netanyahu has said he would accept something short of a
treaty as long as it would provide security arrangements along
their shared border once Israeli withdraws.
	   The dispute in Israel over unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon
cuts across party lines, with prominent members of Netanyahu's
Likud and the opposition Labor party on both sides of the debate.
	   The present Labor party leader Ehud Barak said Thursday it would
be ``irresponsible,'' of Israel to withdraw unilaterally. The
former military chief-of-staff said without a comprehensive
agreement including Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, there
would be no way of preventing direct fire by Hezbollah against the
Israeli civilian population.
	   But Peres argued that the threat of massive military retaliation
would work as a deterrent.

Tighter EU security cooperation concerns nonmember Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, current
chairman of the European Union, broached a touchy subject in Norway
on Thursday by warmly endorsing tighter security cooperation within
the European bloc.
	   Norway, a country of 4.4 million, is the only member of the NATO
military alliance that shares a land border with Russia. It is
completely dependent on NATO, especially the United States, for its
defense. Any move that might weaken the North Atlantic alliance
sends a chill through the small EU outsider.
	   During a visit to the Norwegian capital of Oslo, Klima said the
EU should become more of a world player, with joint military and
foreign policy - as well as economic - structures.
	   ``Think about a security structure where Europe could solve its
regional problems _ peace enforcement, peacekeeping _ in close
cooperation with our Atlantic partners,'' said Klima, appearing at
a brief news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne
Bondevik.
	   After Norwegian voters rejected EU membership in a 1994 national
referendum, and the bloc opened membership talks with former East
Bloc nations, Oslo feared that the small country could be left
forgotten on the northern fringe of Europe.
	   Bondevik said he told Klima that Norway would oppose any measure
that might weaken the NATO alliance between Europe and North
America.
	   `I underlined very strongly that we will work for and hope for a
development in Europe that results in there be no weakening of the
transatlantic connections. Norway is very dependent on them due to
our strategic location in the far north as a neighbor to Russia,''
Bondevik said.
	   He added that Klima has assured him that the intent was not to
weaken NATO.
	   Last month, Britain dropped years of opposition to building a
stronger EU security alliance when Prime Minister Tony Blair called
for better military coordination within Europe.
	   Austria, Norway and Poland make up the current leadership troika
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Bondevik said he and Klima also discussed problems that will face
the OSCE next year, when Norway takes over chairmanship from
Poland.

Kabila resists European pressure for talks with rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Congolese President Laurent Kabila held
on Thursday to his refusal to negotiate with rebels fighting his
government, insisting the insurgents and their foreign backers must
be defeated.
	   ``There is no rebellion. There are Ugandan and Rwandan troops
occupying the territory,'' Kabila told reporters.
	   He said Western powers have a ``warped'' view of the situation
in Congo.
	   ``Each gesture of ours to throw out the ennemy is seen as an
attempt at genocide. It is an unbearable injustice,'' he told a
crowd of suporters at the Congolese embassy.
	   He said he had tried to correct the western view during his
three-day visit to Belgium, during meetings with European Union and
Belgian officials. ``This mission was essential to tell the
truth,'' he said.
	   ``We cannot let (Rwandans) enslave us like they enslaved their
own Hutu majority,'' Kabila said, to much applause.
	   Speaking of his talks Thursday with Belgian King Albert II and
Foreign Minister Erik Derycke, he said he had asked Belgium not to
remain passive when faced with what he called the foreign invasion
of Congo.
	   In a statement, the Belgian foreign ministry called for a
``negotiated solution'' to the crisis in Congo.
	   It urged ``the parties in the conflict to pave the way for
negotiation, by calling a ceasefire and putting a stop to human
rights violations and incitement to ethnic hatred, both
unacceptable.''
	   The statement also urged Kabila to open talks with other
political parties in the country. Belgian and EU officials hoped to
bring Kabila closer to agreeing to negotiate with the rebels waging
a four-month insurgency.
	   But Kabila, who met with the EU's Commissioner for relations
with Africa, Joao de Deus Pinheiro Wednesday, denied there was a
rebellion in his country and blamed the violence on outside
interference.
	   The Congolese leader also emphatically denied reports of alleged
human rights violations by him and his government. ``These reports
have been made up by those who couldn't stand the (political)
change,'' he said Wednesday.
	   On Tuesday, Kabila said he will allow political parties again
starting in January and announced elections for April.
	   Human rights abuses under the late President Mobutu Sese Seko
led the EU to suspend all aid but emergency humanitarian supplies
in 1992, when the country was known as Zaire. Aid has not been
resumed.
	   Kabila has come under a barrage of criticism over his own human
rights record. Lawyers representing members of Congo's Tutsi
minority and an opposition political group have filed law suits
against Kabila in Belgian courts accusing him of inciting ethnic
hatred against Tutsis.
	   On Monday, Amnesty International released a report on Congo
highlighting atrocities by government and opposition forces.
	   It cited widespread human rights abuses by the rebels including
killings, torture and rape, but said Kabila's forces also massacred
civilians suspected of sympathizing with the opposition.
	   The visit was Kabila's first to Congo's former colonial ruler
since he toppled Mobutu to take power in 1997. The Congolese leader
was due to leave late Thursday for Paris to attend a summit of
francophone leaders.

IMF chief to visit Moscow for talks on resuming loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in two last grafs with Russia's payments on
restructured treasury bills. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund will
visit Moscow next week for talks on the resumption of aid to
Russia's ailing economy, news reports said Thursday.
	   An IMF delegation left Moscow earlier this week with no promise
that it would resume an existing loan, and the fund has remained
critical of the Russian government's plans to tackle the economic
crisis.
	   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a speech in
Madrid, Spain, on Wednesday that the IMF wouldn't abandon Russia.
But he said, ``Russia must first show it is willing to help
itself,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Camdessus is expected to arrive in Russia on Dec. 1, Russian
news agencies reported.
	   The IMF has insisted on seeing a sound economic program by the
Russian government, and signs that is has been implemented, before
releasing any more of the dlrs 22.6 billion aid package that has
been frozen since August.
	   Russia is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse, after succumbing to the global economic troubles that
started in Asia, which prompted Russia to default on loans and
devalue the ruble in August. The government says more foreign aid
is crucial for getting the economy on track.
	   In the speech in Madrid, Camdessus said that Russia's most
urgent task is to increase tax collections, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The State Tax Service said Thursday it planned to collect 12
billion rubles (dlrs 687 million) in November _ less than in
October, but more than originally planned for November.
	   Appearing at a news conference, deputy tax chief Sergei Shulgin
did not say why the collections were likely to drop from the 14
billion rubles (dlrs 801 million) collected in October.
	   Total tax collections for the first nine months of the year were
134 billion rubles (dlrs 7.7 billion at the current rate), and
Shulgin said next year's revenues were expected to be slightly
above 200 billion rubles (dlrs 11 billion).
	   Also Tuesday, the government announced that Russia's payments on
new treasury bills _ issued to replace those it defaulted on in
August _ will total between 8 billion and 9 billion rubles (dlrs
458 million to 515 million) this year, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The IMF has insisted that Russia reach an agreement on
compensating foreign holders of the bills.

EU investigating Boeing, Airbus prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Airbus reaction, background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators are
investigating prices charged by airplane manufacturers Boeing Co.
and Airbus Industrie, an EU official said Thursday.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
European Commission had sent the companies questions about price
rises to find out if there is any cartel activity.
	   He told reporters the EU executive body's inquiries were not a
full cartel probe and were not coordinated with U.S. regulators.
	   Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht denied any involvement by the
European aerospace consortium in price-fixing. ``It's absolute
nonsense to talk of collusion in this industry,'' she said.
	   France-based Airbus and Boeing of the United States share the
world's market in large commercial jets.
	   Boeing announced rises in list prices on most of its aircraft by
5 percent in July, the first increase in 23 years. Airbus raised
its prices by 3 percent.
	   Both companies recently said they want to focus on increasing
profits rather than market shares after competition between them
drove down prices.
	   The EU move follows media reports that the US Federal Trade
Commission was investigating the companies' prices.
	   Kracht acknowledged that the industry is concentrated, but
insisted competition is fierce.
	   Boeing, which absorbed its U.S. competitor McDonnell Douglas
last year, traditionally has won 60 percent or more of the world's
airliner orders each year. Although Airbus reached parity this year
with orders, Boeing has 70 percent of the commercial jet deliveries
this year and would have 67 percent in 1999 if the forecasts hold.
	   The EU Commission imposed tough conditions on Boeing's takeover
of McDonnell Douglas to ensure the U.S. company did not gain a
dominant position in world markets.
	   The Airbus consortium comprises Aerospatiale SA of France,
Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas SA, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG
of Germany and British Aerospace.

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ A gateman warned the nearest railroad
station that the Frontier Mail had derailed early Thursday and was
spread across the tracks of an oncoming express in northwestern
India. But it was too late _ the Sealdah Express had already passed
the station, and was speeding toward the passenger coaches
concealed by Thursday's predawn mist.
	   Less than a minute later, it plowed into the derailed train,
killing at least 108 people and injured 250 others, police and
railroad officials said.
	   The crash, 250 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of the capital
New Delhi, was the worst in India in the last three years, said
Ashok Kumar, spokesman for the government-owned company, Indian
Railways.
	   At least 108 people were killed in the collision of the trains,
between the towns of Khanna and Payal in Punjab state.
	   Rescue workers took 250 people to local government and private
hospitals, where the condition of 36 people was serious, said S.K.
Mirza, an officer at the state police control room.
	   ``I was awakened by a jolt as the train came to a screeching
halt,'' said Usha Rani, a survivor from the Frontier Mail who was
on her way to attend a wedding. ``Before I could realize what has
happened, the Sealdah Express came and collided with the derailed
coaches.''
	   Kumar said most of the dead appeared to be passengers in the
first four cars of the Sealdah Express.
	   The first four cars of the express train were crumpled like
balls of paper; the engine buried under dirt. Two of its mangled
cars were perched on the wreckage of three Frontier Mail coaches.
	   Rescuers were searching debris for another 35 missing passengers
who were presumed dead, police said. There were 1,700 passengers
aboard.
	   The Calcutta-bound Sealdah Express coming from the northern town
of Jammu collided with the derailed Frontier Mail, traveling from
New Delhi to Amritsar, said Ashok Kumar, a top official of the
government-owned railroad company.
	   The sound of crunching metal awoke villagers, and word quickly
spread to market town of Khanna.
	   Within 15 minutes, villagers arrived to help. Farmers turned
headlights of cars or tractors on the wreckage. Others offered tea,
bread or blankets and sweaters since many passengers were dressed
in night clothes or had lost their belongings, said Shiv Kumar, a
businessman who joined the rescue efforts.
	   Rescue workers cut the cars with acetylene torches to extricate
97 bodies, said Punjab state police chief Pooran Chand Dogra. Among
the dead were 40 army soldiers going home to Calcutta.
	   Dogra said more bodies were still lying in the cars. Authorities
have called for more gas cutters, cranes and other equipment.
	   Hours after the accident, many people were still trapped inside
the cars. ``They are shrieking. Some are saying, 'Cut off my legs.
Cut off my hands. Just rescue me.' I saw one woman who is still
trapped inside. Her legs are dangling from the compartment, but
they are not able to rescue her because the compartment is at the
bottom,'' Ashok Kumar said.
	   Ten hours after the accident, rescue workers gingerly lifted two
army soldiers to waiting ambulances after engineers using crow bars
or their bare hands slowly yanked apart the metal wreckage of the
Frontier Mail.
	   Rescuers, including 1,000 police and railroad workers, first
propped up the wobbly wreckage with wooden planks and steel beams,
then used six light cranes to slowly tear apart the upper coach.
	   ``It was a major engineering problem,'' said V.K. Agnihotri, the
chief railroad engineer supervising the operation. ``We couldn't
use gas cutters because people were trapped in the coach below.
	   The federal government ordered an inquiry, but both police and
railroad officials ruled out sabotage in Punjab state, where a
decade-old secessionist movement was crushed in 1994.
	   ``It was a purely mechanical problem,'' Kumar said.
	   Every year, there are about 300 accidents on India's railways,
the world's largest network under single management.
	   In January, 52 people were killed in a train collision on a
foggy morning in the northern city of Lucknow. Three years ago, two
trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people. Most of the
past accidents have been blamed on human error or outdated
signaling equipment.
	   More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India
daily on 67,000 kilometers (41,875 miles) of track stretching from
mountains to the coastal plains, through dense forests, arid
deserts and crowded cities.

Bosnia Serbs find bodies of 10 war victims hidden in cemetery

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A forensic team exhumed
Thursday bodies of 10 Bosnian Serb civilians killed during the 3
1/2-year civil war and dumped in a shallow pit in a Sarajevo
cemetery.
	   About 20,000 people remain unaccounted for since Bosnia's civil
war ended in 1995. Three separate commissions _ representing
Croats, Muslims and Serbs _ have so far recovered about 1,700
bodies.
	   The Bosnian Serb Commission for Missing Persons said Thursday it
would keep searching a graveyard near a Sarajevo residential
district for the bodies of civilians killed by Muslim forces.
Commission Chairman Jovo Rosic said local gravediggers reported
burying the bodies during the war.
	   Another 150 to 200 bodies are likely buried in other unmarked
holes among the several thousand headstones of the 50-year-old
cemetery, the team said.
	   Muslim-Croat police escorted the Bosnian Serb forensic team and
the operation was monitored by NATO-led peacekeepers and
international forensic and human rights officers.
	   Meanwhile, the Muslim Commission for Missing Persons said it
exhumed bodies of 18 Muslim war victims near Nevesinje, some 70
kilometers (45 miles) south of Sarajevo Thursday.
	   Foreign officials Thursday praised cooperation between the
Croats, Muslims and Bosnian Serbs in their search missing war
victims.
	   ``This exhumation marks the end of a year that has seen
extraordinary cooperation between the three commissions for missing
persons in Bosnia,'' said Alexandra Stiglmayer, a spokeswoman for
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp.
	   So far, the commissions investigated more than 250 sites across
the country this year, finding some 1,700 bodies.
	   Exhumations take place in the spring and summer months, as
freezing temperatures and snowcover in the winter prevent forensics
experts from carrying out their work.

Norway set to resume normal relations with Iran after Rushdie

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway is set to resume normal diplomatic
relations with Iran, more than three years after the small northern
country downgraded ties to protest a death order against British
writer Salman Rushdie, the foreign ministry announced Thursday.
	   Norway permanently withdrew its ambassador to Iran in July 1995,
and left diplomatic representation at a lower level. Iran called
home its ambassador to Norway the previous year to protest what it
called Oslo's hostile attitude.
	   Norway has repeatedly protested against an Iranian religious
edict, called a fatwa, ordering the death of Rushdie and anyone
connected with his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Iran's spiritual leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, issued the
edict in 1989 after he deemed Rushdie's book blasphemous against
Islam, which forced the writer to live in hiding.
	   Relations between the countries worsened when Rushdie's
Norwegian-language publisher, William Nygaard, was shot and
severely wounded in Oslo in 1993, with suspected Iranian
involvement.
	   A statement from the foreign ministry in Oslo said Norway was
ready to appoint a new ambassador to Tehran after Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi in September guaranteed that his government
would not support any steps to carry out the death order against
Rushdie.
	   The announcement came after a meeting between Norwegian and
Iranian foreign ministry officials in Oslo. The statement said Iran
was considering a similar upgrading of diplomatic relations with
Norway.
	   Norway has been a strong supporter of Rushdie, a regular visitor
to the Scandinavian nation.

Vajpayee calls allies to discuss possible defeat in state
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With exit polls predicting a humiliating
defeat for the Hindu nationalist party in provincial elections, the
main opposition Congress Party said Thursday it may try to form the
next government if Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 19-party
coalition collapsed.
	   The elections held Wednesday were the first political test since
Vajpayee's government took office eight months ago. Millions of
people voted in four states, New Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh
and Mizoram.
	   Counting of votes will begin Saturday and final results are
expected Sunday.
	   ``In the event of the collapse of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led
coalition ... the Congress Party may take the support of
like-minded secular forces in staking claim to form the next
government,'' Anil Shastri, the party spokesman, said in New Delhi.
	   Exit polls predicted that the BJP would lose its strongholds of
New Delhi and Rajasthan states to a resurgent Congress Party, led
by Sonia Gandhi. The Congress Party is expected to lose power in
Madhya Pradesh to the BJP and Mizoram state to regional parties.
	   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Vajpayee said he has called a
meeting of his political allies.
	   Asked if a defeat in the elections would prompt national midterm
elections, the prime minister said state results should not affect
his government _ but acknowledged calling the political summit.
	   ``The present political situation is pregnant with many
possibilities and the coordination committee of the Bharatiya
Janata Party and its allies will meet immediately after the results
of the assembly elections are announced,'' Vajpayee told reporters
in Lucknow, the capital of the northern Uttar Pradesh state.
	   His party dismissed the exit polls. ``Sometimes these have gone
completely wrong, sometimes they have proved correct,'' said
spokesman Venkaiah Naidu in New Delhi on Wednesday.
	   Violence marred voting in at least one state. Three people were
killed and 16 wounded in a gunfight between political rivals in a
rural area of Madhya Pradesh in central India, Press Trust of India
reported. Voting was peaceful in the other three states.
	   Nearly 58 percent of more than 80 million electorates voted in
four of India's 26 states where elections were held Wednesday. The
key issues during the election campaign turned out to be shortages
of onion, edible oil, electricity and water.
	   A massive shortage of onion and 700 percent rise in its price
since September because of heavy monsoon floods became a powerful
symbol of protest for opposition ranks.
	   The exit polls were conducted by the private Center for Media
Studies and the state television, Doordarshan.

 &UR; Worldwide doping agency moves toward liftoff in early '99
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Plans are proceeding for the
creation of an independent agency next year that will spearhead the
fight against doping around the world, the project's coordinator
said Thursday.
	   Dick Pound, a Canadian vice president of the International
Olympic Committee, said experts have reached a ``high degree of
consensus'' on the structure, mandate and financing of the agency.
	   Pound, who heads an IOC working group on the financial aspects
of the anti-doping fight, said the agency could be up and running
in early 1999 with initial funding of dlrs 25 million.
	   The IOC initiative, launched in the wake of the drug scandals
which rocked the Tour de France this summer, will be discussed
Friday at a meeting of Olympic leaders and international sports
federations.
	   The IOC hopes the drug agency will get the final go-ahead at the
world anti-doping summit in Lausanne on Feb. 2-4.
	   Pound said the agency would be an independent body run by
representatives of the IOC, international federations, national
Olympic committees and international governmental organizations.
The private sector, including sponsors and drug manufacturers,
would also be be part of the setup.
	   ``Everyone will have equal representation,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Montreal. ``There is independence, with
all the stake holders represented in the policy making.''
	   While financing of the project has been a concern, Pound said
his group is proposing an initial outlay of dlrs 25 million _ with
the money taken from Olympic television revenues.
	   ``If the conference in Feburary agrees, we could have it up and
running within a couple of months,'' Pound said.
	   Within six months to a year, the IOC would establish a long-term
budget and action plan, he said.
	   Among the agency's roles will be to oversee year-round
out-of-competition drug testing. Until now, the IOC has been
responsible only for drug testing during Olympic Games.
	   Pound said the agency will also help direct drug-testing
research and coordinate with sports federations so that the focus
of testing is on the highest-level athletes.
	   Sampling and analysis would be subjected to internationally
recognized standards.
	   ``We want to ensure to anyone, anytime, that the tests and
analysis are all on the same level,'' Pound said.
	   He said his group of experts concluded that the anti-doping
fight should not be dominated by scientific issues.
	   ``Having the biochemists seize control of the agenda has not
been successful,'' he said. ``What we want to do is go back to
square one: the philosophical issues.
	   ``While acknowledging that testing is necessary, it's ancillary
rather than primary. We need to fund research so we get reliable
tests for the high-tech drugs. We need to make out-of-competition
testing good enough so that athletes buy into it.''
	   Pound criticized the view of other IOC officials, including
medical commission chairman Prince Alexandre de Merode, that drug
sanctions should be amended to take into account the pressures for
shorter doping penalties from European courts.
	   ``If some Belgian labor court wants to say the right to work is
more important than cheating and reduces the sentence, it's up to
the Belgian labor court to explain its morality to the public,''
Pound said. ``It's not up to us to meet their lower expectations.''

NATO strengthens presence in southern Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO-led peacekeepers on
Thursday strengthened their presence and took control of roads in
southern Bosnia, where incidents against non-Croat returnees have
occurred, international officials said.
	   Since the beginning of the year, 70 explosions or other
incidents directed against non-Croat refugees trying to return to
the homes they fled during the 1992-95 Bosnian war have been
registered in the area around Mostar. No arrests have been made.
	   Richard Ellerkmann, head of the regional office of the top
international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, said the
beefed up peacekeeping force is aimed at preventing further
incidents, as well as halt smuggling of explosives and weapons.
	   ``They (troops) may stop the cars to search them'' to check
whether they are transporting illegal explosives, Ellerkmann said.
He said international police will ask local police for assistance
if necessary.
	   In a separate action Thursday, local officials arrested 10
people in Mostar, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Sarajevo, after
local police found hashish and heroin worth 400,000 German marks
(dlrs 235,000).
	   ``There is enough of the confiscated drug for 8,000 doses,''
said Sefkija Dziho, a regional police chief, adding that some
restaurants in region have become distributors.
	   Dziho said Thursday's was the biggest confiscation in region in
the past 50 years, but gave no further details, pending an
investigation.

Russian bank offers dlrs 100,000 for information on killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with wounded aide learning of Starovoitova's death in
last 2 grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLAIDMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A leading Russian bank has offered a dlrs 100,000
reward for information that could help solve the killing of a
prominent liberal lawmaker, the bank president said in an interview
published Thursday.
	   Galina Starovoitova, 52, was gunned down by unidentified
assailants on the stairs of her apartment building in St.
Petersburg last week, and was buried Tuesday in a ceremony attended
by thousands of mourners.
	   ``If this crime goes unpunished, it would deal an enormous blow
to peoples' attitude to the state,'' Mikhail Friedman, the head of
Alpha-Bank, said in an interview published in the business daily
Kommersant.
	   ``It would leave no hope that the government is capable of
caring for ordinary citizens, since it's unable to care for even
the leading members of the society.''
	   Friedman said his bank would pay dlrs 100,000 from its charity
fund to any person or group that provides information to help solve
the crime.
	   ``When we learned about this gruesome murder, we consulted our
partners and colleagues and decided that we must take part despite
the current difficult financial situation,'' Friedman said.
	   Starovoitova's slaying had all the trademarks of a contract
murder, which have become common in Russia and are rarely solved.
Still, her death has provoked outrage among many Russians.
	   Many of the killings are related to business disputes, but
Starovoitova had no known business interests. She was also perhaps
the most prominent female political figure in the country.
	   Police have not announced any major breakthroughs in the case.
However, the Russian media have speculated that the killing was
linked to Starovoitova's role in local elections in St. Petersburg
set for Dec. 6.
	   Several reports have claimed local mobsters might have been
tempted to kill Starovoitova because her liberal election bloc,
Northern Capital, is expected to make a strong showing.
Starovoitova was not on the ballot but was campaigning for her
allies, who have often spoken out against corruption.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said Thursday that
detectives had received some clues from Starovoitova's aide,
27-year-old Ruslan Linkov. He suffered serious head wounds but has
recovered enough to speak with police.
	   His testimony along with other witness accounts should allow
police to make sketches of the attackers, Stepashin said.
	   Linkov didn't learn of Starovoitova's death until Thursday, as
doctors had tried to spare him extra trauma. But he overheard it on
a news broadcast through an open door.
	   ``He is taking the death of Starovoitova very badly,'' Linkov's
mother was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Israeli troops, Palestinians clash in three West Bank locations

	   JENIN, West Bank (AP) _ For the first time since the signing of
the latest Mideast peace accord, violent confrontations erupted
Thursday between Israelis and Palestinians in three areas of the
West Bank.
	   On the outskirts of the city of Jenin, Israeli troops fired
rubber-coated bullets into a crowd of about 100 Palestinian
protesters who threw stones and marched towards the soldiers'
compound. An Israeli soldier could be seen on a tower inside the
army's compound alternately ducking and shooting.
	   Two Palestinians suffered mild injuries and were treated at
hospital.
	   Palestinians had been demonstrating for the release of relatives
jailed by Israel. Organized by Yasser Arafat's Fatah party,
protesters walked behind a white banner showing prisoners' hands
chained and bleeding. ``No peace without release of all
prisoners,'' it said.
	   More than 2,500 Palestinians are in Israeli jails, and the issue
is sensitive among Palestinians, many of whom spent time in jail or
had relatives jailed during the three-decade occupation by Israel.
	   Israel set free 250 prisoners last week and will release another
500 in two more stages as part of last month's peace accord. But
prisoners who murdered or conspired to murder will not be among
those included in the release, despite requests from Palestinians.
	   In the tensely divided city of Hebron, scuffles broke-out after
Jewish settlers tried to prevent Palestinian school children on
their way to a field trip from walking by the settler compound.
	   Palestinian witnesses said adults from the settler community
pushed and shoved the girls, ages 6-14, back into the nearby school
yard.
	   Five girls were carried away in Palestinian ambulances after
fainting and the hospital later reported 12 were seen by doctors
but none suffered lasting injury.
	   Israeli police however said the 40 children, led by their
principal, Firial Abu Hekal, were holding an illegal protest in
front of the settler homes. Palestinians are frequently harassed by
Jewish settlers when walking near their homes. The principal and
three others from the girls school were detained and questioned by
police.
	   In the Burkin village near Qalqiliya, about 2,000 Palestinians
and 15 Israeli peace activists protested Israeli construction of a
bypass road on confiscated Arab.
	   The demonstrators blocked the road and stopped the bulldozers
briefly. The Palestinians threw stones, and Israeli troops guarding
the site responded by firing in the air and lobbing tear gas to
disperse the crowd.
	   Palestinian police, stationed in all three West Bank areas, did
nothing to keep their citizens at bay. In Burkin, Palestinian
police watched from their post but did not get involved in the
confrontation. After warnings from Israeli officers, Palestinian
security police persuaded protesters to pull back.

Peres calls for unilateral troop withdrawal from Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres joined other
prominent Israelis Thursday in urging a unilateral troop withdrawal
from Lebanon, issuing their call the day after two Israeli soldiers
were killed in southern Lebanon.
	   Peres said there was ``no alternative'' but to pull the Israeli
army out from the self-styled security zone it has patrolled within
southern Lebanon since 1985 to prevent crossborder guerrillas raids
on Israeli communities.
	   Public pressure is mounting within Israel to bring soldiers home
from what many believe is a losing battle against Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas fighting to oust Israeli forces and their
Lebanese militia allies from the zone.
	   Overnight Wednesday, two Israeli soldiers were killed when a
roadside bomb exploded, bringing to 20 the number of soldiers
killed in combat there this year. Ten days ago, three soldiers were
killed in a similar attack about three kilometers (two miles) west
of the Lebanese border with Israel, and about 20 kilometers (12
miles) southwest of Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied zone.
Hezbollah claimed responsibility for both attacks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on a visit to London, told
reporters that he planned to convene a ministerial committee to
discuss how to improve the army's tactics in south Lebanon, but he
did not offer unilateral withdrawal as an option.
	   ``As soon as we find a way to withdraw our forces without
abandoning the need and the ability to defend our northern villages
and towns, without abandoning our allies in the south of Lebanon
... as soon as we have addressed these two needs, we will withdraw
from Lebanon,'' he said.
	   Previous Israeli governments have tried unsuccessfully to reach
a peace treaty with Beirut and remove their troops from Lebanese
soil. Netanyahu has said he would accept something short of a
treaty as long as it would provide security arrangements along
their shared border once Israeli withdraws.
	   The dispute in Israel over unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon
cuts across party lines, with prominent members of Netanyahu's
Likud and the opposition Labor party on both sides of the debate.
	   The present Labor party leader Ehud Barak said Thursday it would
be ``irresponsible,'' of Israel to withdraw unilaterally. The
former military chief-of-staff said without a comprehensive
agreement including Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, there
would be no way of preventing direct fire by Hezbollah against the
Israeli civilian population.
	   But Peres argued that the threat of massive military retaliation
would work as a deterrent.

Pinochet weeps as the threat of a trial looms larger than ever

Chile becoming a possibility, includes Chilean lobby of British
government to block extradition request &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet broke down upon learning he faces the threat of
extradition to Spain on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism,
Spanish newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Pinochet was read the news Wednesday in Spanish at the London
hospital where he is staying under police guard, minutes before
Britain's law lords upheld his detention and ruled he did not have
immunity.
	   The man allegedly responsible for killing and torturing
thousands when he ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990, and who was
also celebrating his 83rd birthday, put his head in his hands and
sobbed, leading daily El Pais reported.
	   Meanwhile, the threat of extradition to Spain has convinced
Pinochet's opponents at home that a trial could be possible in his
native Chile.
	   ``The trial of Pinochet in Chile is no longer a shot into the
air or a mad dream,'' Chilean lawyer Eduardo Contreras told
reporters in Madrid.
	   In January, Contreras helped file a suit in Chile against
Pinochet for mass murder, kidnapping and illegal burying of bodies.
Up to recently the case was assumed to be doomed.
	   ``With time the impact of the (British) lords' decision on
Chilean public opinion could lead the (Chilean) courts to strip
Pinochet of his immunity and allow him to be tried,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza is this
week to head a delegation to lobby Britain for the release of
Pinochet, who was arrested in London at the instigation of Spanish
Judge Baltasar Garzon on Oct. 16.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei complained that the affair
violates sovereignty, and endangers the country's fragile
transition to democracy which began when Pinochet stepped down in
1990.
	   News of the ruling was greeted with anger by Pinochet's
supporters in Chile who attacked journalists in Santiago, including
a television crew from the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   The Pinochet Foundation said it lamented the mistreatment of
journalists at its headquarters in Santiago.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw has asked for a week-long
extension to the original Dec. 2 deadline by which he is supposed
to decide whether or not to allow extradition proceedings to go
ahead.
	   Spanish jurists believe that if allowed to proceed a final
decision on extradition issue could take a year. In the meantime,
Garzon may travel to London to question the former dictator.
	   But for Contreras, even if Straw allows Pinochet home on
compassionate grounds he has been irreparably damaged.
	   ``He would go back as human trash, as a broken general, as a
general who cries,'' the lawyer said.
	   Chilean author Luis Sepulveda, who lives in northern Spain,
wrote an article for El Pais recounting how he greeted the ruling
with a toast to those who were not alive to hear the news.
	   He said he especially remembered late Chilean President Salvador
``Allende on this lucky day for justice and decency.''
	   Allende died in the 1973 coup led by Pinochet.
	   Pinochet is due to appear at London's Bow Street Magistrate's
Court on Wednesday, a formality required of anyone facing an
extradition order.

dispute &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway is set to resume normal diplomatic
relations with Iran, more than three years after the small northern
country downgraded ties to protest a death order against British
writer Salman Rushdie, the foreign ministry announced Thursday.
	   Norway permanently withdrew its ambassador to Iran in July 1995,
and left diplomatic representation at a lower level. Iran called
home its ambassador to Norway the previous year to protest what it
called Oslo's hostile attitude.
	   Norway has repeatedly protested against an Iranian religious
edict, called a fatwa, ordering the death of Rushdie and anyone
connected with his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   Iran's spiritual leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, issued the
edict in 1989 after he deemed Rushdie's book blasphemous against
Islam, which forced the writer to live in hiding.
	   Relations between the countries worsened when Rushdie's
Norwegian-language publisher, William Nygaard, was shot and
severely wounded in Oslo in 1993, with suspected Iranian
involvement.
	   A statement from the foreign ministry in Oslo said Norway was
ready to appoint a new ambassador to Tehran after Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi in September guaranteed that his government
would not support any steps to carry out the death order against
Rushdie.
	   The announcement came after a meeting between Norwegian and
Iranian foreign ministry officials in Oslo. The statement said Iran
was considering a similar upgrading of diplomatic relations with
Norway.
	   Norway has been a strong supporter of Rushdie, a regular visitor
to the Scandinavian nation.

Discord evident before key meeting of sports federations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with officials saying detailed proposals on sanctions
won't be discussed Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Sports federations agree on the
need to fight doping but can't seem to agree on how to do it.
	   The latest attempt to bring uniformity to the war against
performance-enhancing drugs comes Friday when 35 international
sports federations meet with International Olympic Committee
leaders in Lausanne.
	   The IOC wants the 28 Olympic summer sports and seven winter
sports to fall into line and endorse a single medical code
embracing common anti-doping rules, procedures and sanctions.
	   Olympic leaders are intent on getting agreement from the sports
federations on the key issues before the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping
summit in Lausanne.
	   But already there are signs of discord.
	   Top Olympic officials admit the medical code is not acceptable
to everyone and that it will be impossible to get every federation
to agree to the same sanctions. Some have criticized proposed new
drug penalties as flawed.
	   An IOC working group has drawn up a package of proposals that
divides doping offenses into different categories with different
sanctions _ including maximum punishments of life bans and dlrs 1
million fines.
	   The panel defines doping as one or both of the following:
	   _ ``use of an expedient substance or method potentially harmful
to health and capable of enhancing the athlete's performance''
	   _ ``the presence in the athlete's body of a substance or
evidence of a use of a method where such substance appears'' on the
IOC's list of banned substances.
	   The proposal divides doping offenses into ``regular'' and
``aggravated'' cases.
	   In so-called regular cases, the range of suspensions are from
one to six months for stimulants and from six months to two years
for more serious drugs.
	   For aggravated cases, the proposal calls for suspensions of two
years to eight years, and life bans for certain ``intentional
doping'' offenses.
	   Fines of up to dlrs 100,000 are proposed for minor drug
offenses, with dlrs 1 million penalties for serious infractions.
	   ``I'm afraid, unfortunately that the proposal is complicated,''
said Gunnar Werner, Swedish secretary of the international swimming
federation and a member of the IOC panel. ``For me as a lawyer, I
understand the discussion, but it won't be so easy to apply it for
those non-lawyers.'
	   The previous IOC guidelines recommended a maximum two-year
suspension for a first steroid offense. There was no provision for
fines.
	   IOC officials said Thursday that the working group's proposals
would not be put forward at Friday's meeting but would probably
come up at the IOC executive board meeting Dec. 11-14.
	   On Friday, the federations will be asked to endorse the
principles of key anti-doping issues, including a minimum doping
sanction for serious drugs.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Labor Party lawmaker has urged Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook to lodge a formal complaint about an attack on a British
Broadcasting Corp. news crew reporting on Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
legal saga in the Chilean capital of Santiago.
	   BBC correspondent Ben Brown, his producer and his cameraman were
dragged into the Pinochet Foundation building and kicked and
punched by up to 100 people Wednesday, shortly after Britain's
highest court ruled that Pinochet had no immunity from arrest on
Spanish charges of murder, torture and genocide.
	   Brown said the assailants were supporters of Pinochet, Chile's
former dictator. He said he and the two members of his crew were
bruised and badly shaken, but not seriously injured.
	   Lawmaker Ben Bradshaw, a former BBC reporter, wrote to Cook
asking him to file a formal complaint with the Chilean ambassador
to Britain.
	   At no stage did authorities intervene to help the three men,
Bradshaw said Thursday.
	   ``This is quite unacceptable in a country that calls itself a
democracy,'' he said. ``I imagine there is plenty of evidence on
film so that the perpetrators of this violence can be brought to
justice.''
	   The Foreign Office said it would have no immediate comment on
Bradshaw's request.
	   But The Pinochet Foundation said Thursday it ``laments'' the
mistreatment of some people, especially journalists and ``presents
it apologies'' to them.
	   The group said it has not been able to identify the assailants.

Cuba wins friends with offers of medical help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ With its support of revolutions a thing of the
past, Cuba now wants to be known as an exporter of doctors rather
than fighters.
	   When Hurricane Mitch ravaged Central America, Cuba quickly sent
medical teams, and followed that up with offers of more. About 200
Cuban doctors already are working in countries affected by the
storm.
	   Cuba's decades-old policy of aiding Third World countries has
long been overshadowed by its support for armed struggle.
	   But now President Fidel Castro is making a broad proposal:
offering to help improve the health care systems of Central America
with more than 2,000 doctors and 5,000 medical scholarships over 10
years.
	   The idea is to slash the area's high infant mortality rate,
saving tens of thousands of lives each year _ many more than the
10,000 officials say were lost in the hurricane.
	   ``There is a hurricane worse than Mitch that is causing terrible
human damage,'' Castro said in a weekend speech whose text was
published Wednesday by the Communist Party daily Granma.
	   ``What Cuba wants to show is that if a country of such limited
material and economic resources can do something ... the
industrialized world can do infinitely more,'' Castro said.
	   Indeed, other countries would have to help if Castro's plan is
to go forward. He estimated it would require roughly dlrs 200
million in goods and medicine _ money that Cuba itself could not
provide.
	   Castro suggested that European or Latin American nations might
be able to help. He also calculated that if the United States were
to dedicate to the plan one dollar out of each dlrs 1,250 it spends
on defense, ``they could save 50,000 lives.''
	   While outside support is uncertain at best, the proposal is an
example of a major thread in Cuban foreign policy: using the
surplus of doctors created by its socialist system to win friends
abroad.
	   Cuba has been sending doctors to underdeveloped nations and
educating foreign doctors since the early 1960s. It even sent
doctors to help Nicaragua and Peru, then hostile to Cuba, recover
from earthquakes.
	   But Cuba's military support of rebel movements in Latin America
and pro-Soviet governments in Africa alienated Cuba from many
countries.
	   With the close of the Cold War, the soldiers have come home,
Cuba has cut support to revolutionaries and stepped up doctor
diplomacy _ with positive effects on Cuba's image.
	   Castro noted that Cuba has had as many as 22,000 foreign college
students, medical and otherwise, on scholarships in the past.
	   ``That also helps explain the solidarity of the Third World with
Cuba,'' he said, adding: ``We did not do it for that. We did it
because of our ideals and our feelings of solidarity and of
internationalism.''
	   While many things in Cuba are in short supply, the country is
flush with doctors.
	   When the current class graduates in August, Castro said Cuba's
11 million people will be served by 66,000 doctors. That is roughly
one for every 170 people, one of the best ratios in the world.
	   The country already has 1,000 doctors working abroad, including
more than 400 in South Africa. Many work in remote areas where
health care has been hard to come by and other doctors are loathe
to work _ such as the Mosquitia Indian area on Honduras' Atlantic
coast.
	   Cuba also has room in its medical schools. Castro said the
country has space for 30,000 medical students but has only about
15,000 now studying, including students from abroad.

Israeli opposition leader rejects call to join a unity government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu comment grafs 6-7; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's opposition leader on Thursday rejected
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported attempts to coax him
into joining a unity government, vowing he would never become part
of such a ``terrible'' administration.
	   Cabinet ministers in Netanyahu's Likud party are reaching out to
their Labor rivals in a scramble to save the premier's shaky
coalition, Israeli media reported.
	   The six-party alliance has been on the verge of collapse since
Israel handed over another chunk of West Bank land to the
Palestinians last week, which coalition hard-liners oppose.
	   ``The Labor Party will not join a national unity government,''
pary leader Ehud Barak said on Israel Radio. ``We will not be a
part of this terrible government.''
	   Netanyahu did not seem troubled by the comments.
	   ``I have heard that Mr. Barak is opposed to the idea of unity.
I, for my part, intend to take steps to expand the basis of support
for the government's policies,'' he told reporters on a visit to
London.
	   If his right-wing ministers bolt, Netanyahu would be left
without a majority and thus vulnerable in no-confidence motions.
Netanyahu will face his next test Tuesday when an early elections
bill is scheduled to come up.
	   As part of the intensive effort to save his government,
Netanyahu struck a tentative deal Wednesday with moderate David
Levy, who had resigned earlier this year from his post as foreign
minister.
	   Levy's rejoining would give Netanyahu a four-seat majority,
enough to defeat an early elections bill without the support of the
extreme right-wing Moledet party.
	   Despite Barak's continued statements that he would not lead
Labor into a union with Likud, Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister
and head of the Labor party, said a merging of bi-partisan
political forces is the only way a final peace deal can be
clinched.
	   ``I don't think we can reach a final settlement with only one
party. In order to reach a final settlement, we need both parties,
and the two parties need to understand that,'' Peres said in an
interview with Israel Radio.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, one of a trio of ministers
pushing for a national unity government, said Netanyahu's desire to
bring Labor into the fold is genuine and that the prime minister
would appeal to Labor directly on his return from Europe next week,
the daily Yediot Ahronot said.
	   Both Sharon and Netanyahu canceled trips in order to deal with
the coalition crisis. Sharon had been set to go to Washington, and
Netanyahu backed-out of the Swiss portion of a three-country
European tour.

Researchers identify 142 million-year-old flowering plant fossil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release after 2100 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers believe they have discovered
fossil evidence of the world's oldest flower, at 142 million years:
a spindly twig with peapod-shaped fruit and a woody stem that looks
nothing like a rose, an apple blossom or a daisy.
	   The fossil is from an early evolutionary stage when plants were
just developing the flowering system that later evolved into fruit,
grain, brilliantly colored and fragrant flowers and food for many
animals, said David Dilcher, a University of Florida biology
professor.
	   ``It would have been a very different world if early flowering
plants like this one had not been successful,'' said Dilcher,
co-author of a study in Friday's edition of the journal Science.
``There would have been no apples, no Wheaties in the morning, no
corn on the cob, no potatoes, no rice or other grains.''
	   All of the common plant food sources came into existence after
plants evolved the ability to make flowers that attracted insects
and other pollinators and then grew into fruit.
	   The flowering plant fossil was found in a rock formation of
limestone and volcanic ash layers in China, near the town of
Beipiao, about 250 miles northeast of Beijing. The rock beds were
once on the bottom of a lake that periodically was showered with
volcanic ash, Dilcher said.
	   Plants and animals that sank to the lake bottom became covered
with sediment and turned into fossils. Villagers digging in the
fossil beds have unearthed dinosaurs, insects, birds and plants
from millions of years ago, but this is the first time a flowering
plant has been uncovered.
	   The discovery has been age-dated at 142 million years by Chinese
scientists, Dilcher said. The oldest previously known flowering
plant was about 130 million years old. Chinese researchers,
including the researcher who found the fossil, asked Dilcher to
analyze it.
	   The ancient plant lacks the petals and shape that most people
associate with flowers.
	   ``It doesn't have any beautiful or showy flowers, but it is a
flowering plant because it has fruit that enclose seeds,'' said
Dilcher.
	   Botanists hailed the discovery as an important advance in
understanding how plants evolved.
	   ``To the world of botany, it's a discovery of the same scale as
understanding the details of why the dinosaurs became extinct,''
said William L. Crepet, a Cornell University professor.
	   The plant specimen is about three inches (7.6 centimeters) long,
with two parts that appear to be joined branches. Along the
branches are what appear to be paired leaves. But Dilcher said the
whole thing, branches and leaves, is actually a flower. That is
because some of the leaves are closed, like peapods, and contain
seeds. The peapods are considered the fruit of the flower, he said.
	   Indeed, the plant ``may have been the first evolutionary
experiment in enclosing seeds and trying to attract pollinators,''
Dilcher said.
	   Plants first developed seeds some 350 million years ago.
Developing flowers and attracting insect pollinators was the next
great leap in plant evolution, and eventually in animal evolution,
he said.
	   Plants, in effect, evolved ways to enlist the cooperation of
animals to reproduce. They developed ways to attract pollinators,
such as bees. They developed ways to have seeds transported by
making fruit, such as apples, that were eaten by animals who then
dropped the seeds elsewhere.
	   ``Flowering plants were the first advertisers in the world,''
said Delcher. ``They managed to gain the cooperation of animals by
learning to say `Hey, I smell good. I've got a reward for you. Come
and visit me.'''
	   Plants reached the stage of having bright blossoms, sweet
fragrance and flowing nectar about 55 million years ago, some 90
million years after the Chinese flower fossil.
	   ``These changes all came in progressive steps,'' said Delcher.
``They helped flowering plants become the most successful of all of
the plants.''

French travelers brace for second national rail strike in a week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French travelers braced for the second national
rail strike in a week on Thursday as train workers were set to slow
service to a crawl starting in the evening hours.
	   The French national train company, the SNCF, said service across
the country would be seriously disrupted from 8 p.m. (1900 GMT)
Thursday until Saturday morning.
	   An average of one in three trains were expected to run Thursday
night and Friday, the SNCF said.
	   Only Eurostar trains to London, Thalys trains to Brussels and
the fast train to Switzerland were expected to run normally Friday.
	   Paris commuters faced a difficult Friday morning, with severe
disruptions seen for local train routes and some suburban lines.
	   Rail workers are protesting what they see as insufficient staff,
as well as concern over how the government will implement a plan to
cut the work week. Unions are set to meet Friday to decided whether
to continue the walkout beyond Saturday.
	   On Monday, French rail unions joined workers in Belgium, Greece,
Spain, Portugal and Luxembourg to protest EU plans to open
state-owned railways to private operators.
	   The EU said the proposed changes, which are not set to go into
effect immediately, would be limited to the freight sector.
	   French train workers are well known for walkouts and officials
have expressed nervousness over the past week that the situation
could worsen. In late 1995, train workers brought France to a near
standstill for more than three weeks over a government plan to
reduce benefits.
	   SNCF Chairman Louis Gallois has called for talks starting Dec.
14 to address rail workers' concerns.

	   Al-Gumhuriya, Cairo, Egypt, on the implementation of
Palestinian-Israeli agreement:
	   The implementation of the Wye agreement between the Palestinian
and Israeli sides has begun, and the Israeli forces withdrew or
have begun withdrawing from Palestinian territories.
	   A glimpse of hope has appeared in the sky of peace in the Middle
East, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu filled with
lots of dark clouds. These clouds have spread pessimism over the
region where people have dreamed for a long time of peace and the
restoration of land in return for peace.
	   Among the illusions and facts, new possibilities have came to
light such as the official opening of the Gaza International
Airport, and the takeoff of the plane of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat from the airport, which has been closed without
justification for two years.
	   The beginning of the implementation of the agreement is a good
step forward. It opens the way for the sun of peace and hope to
spread its light _ after being absent since Netanyahu came to power
in Israel.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on the U.N.-Iraq confrontation
over weapons inspections:
	   The real issue that divides the two parties is ... not Iraq's
possession or deployment of mass destruction weapons or the lack of
it. The fundamental bone of contention appears to touch on the
future of the Iraqi regime. ...
	   The U.S. and Britain must have realized by now that all efforts
to unseat the government in Baghdad have so far failed and could
only bring more hardships on innocent Iraqis and more resentment in
the Arab World.
	   The game over Iraq is a dangerous one that might fragment that
country and endanger the region's stability. It is time the two
Western powers thought of new methods to contain the Iraqi people
and driving the region to the brink every few months.
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit
to Japan:
	   We need to consider the historic relationship between the two
countries and with Taiwan. We should recognize the historic facts
of past events for what they are and apologize for what should be
apologized for.
	   While the problems the two countries now share are important in
themselves, it is even more important that the bilateral
relationship be expanded in the coming century. There is,
therefore, much to hope for in President Jiang's impending visit.
Japan, the economic power, and China, the political power, are
formidable presences in the international community. As such, they
have considerable responsibility for the peaceful development of
the region.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Australian, Sydney, Australia, on Indonesian riots:
	   The deaths on the streets of Jakarta are not sufficient evidence
of a nation of 200 million teetering on the verge of anarchy.
Nonetheless, they are proof, if any were needed, that no single
group has control of Indonesia _ not the government, the military,
nor opposition parties and their supporters. Whether the violence
is part of a political campaign or whether it represents anarchy
rooted in hunger, prejudice and fear is not clear. Most frightening
of all, however, is the possibility that political maneuvering and
mob rule are now feeding off each other. The possibility that the
elections originally promised for May could now be delayed by
proposed amendments to new electoral laws is disturbing and must be
averted.
	    &UR; ___
	   Basler Zeitung, Basel, Switzerland, on Kurdish rebel leader
Ocalan:
	   ```Italians be damned'' and ``Eternal hatred'' were among the
milder outbursts of anger in the streets of Turkey after the
release of Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan by the Italian
appeal court.
	   The Italian flag joined a blazing pyre of packing material for
Italian textiles and espresso machines. ...
	   More dangerous, however, were the reactions of Turkey's own
people to the Ocalan affair.
	   In Izmir at the weekend, Kurdish refugees had to be taken to
safety from their Turkish compatriots for safety. ...
	   The bus in which the respectable Kurdish women and children were
driven away was pelted with paving stones and shoes. ...
	   It is not the Turkish people which is so out of control that it
takes its revenge for Kurdish rebels' campaign of terror on
innocent people.
	   It is a small number of angry people, stirred up by openly
stated racism in the Turkish media. ...
	   Persistent government propaganda in the Kurdish conflict has
driven certain sections of Turkish society to abandon reason. The
mood has grown more angry, sober thoughts are being replaced by
violence.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Hindu, New Delhi, India, on APEC:
	   Nobody expected anything spectacular from the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's sixth summit in Kuala Lumpur...
	   The host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed, put up a
brave front, withstood both direct and subtle criticism of domestic
political issues and still managed to score a couple of debating
points.
	   While rejecting his calls for currency controls of market
regulation, the APEC leaders conceded his demand for a review of
the international credit rating agencies and also for examining the
capital flows, with the focus on hedge funds.
	   Not that anything substantial will come out of this study, but
Malaysia succeeded in drawing attention to the problems posed by
these factors outside the control of the affected economies.

	   Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Frankfurt, on Kurdish rebel
leader Ocalan:
	   It is understandable why Justice Minister Daeubler-Gmelin
doesn't wank PKK leader (Abdullah) Ocalan in Germany. On the one
hand, the political reasons: Among the 400,000 Kurds who live in
Germany are only a few thousand members of the terroristic
Kurdistan Workers Party that Ocalan heads. But there are also many
who see him as the embodiment of the fight for Kurdish rights.
Kurdish unrest is likely if he were jailed here. .... Domestic
security is one side of the coin. On the other is the arrest
warrant that German authorities filed against Ocalan years ago. ...
	   German authorities have displayed a politically motivated
reserve in the pursuit of the PKK in recent years. It was a
balancing act to keep terrorism away from German soil without
endangering Turkish-German relations. And it continues in the
Ocalan case, with one difference: Turkey, and also Italy, are sure
to read a German non-decision as a decision, namely that it is
better to give in to terroristic blackmail than to charge domestic
politics with anger.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Telegraph, London, on Greece and Prince Charles:
	   Pity the poor Prince of Wales, lectured interminably in Athens
by the Greek minister of culture, Evangelos Venizelos, on the
``restitution'' of the Elgin Marbles. The prince deserves credit
for preserving dignity and his temper. It is 34 years since he last
set foot in the Greek capital, and after yesterday's ambush it may
be even longer before he goes there again.
	   By insulting the heir to the British throne, the Greek
authorities have certainly not advanced their case. That case has
always rested on bad history and bogus sentiment. Even if the
marbles had been acquired illegally, which they were not; even if
the trustees of the British Museum were legally entitled to give
them away, which they are not; even if it were true that Greece
would have been a better custodian over the past two centuries,
which it is not _ none of this would prove the case for
restitution. To break up the great museums of Europe and America in
order to send their exhibits 'home' would serve no useful purpose.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Mirror, London, on voting rights of hereditary peers in the
House of Lords:
	   Monarchs have done away with lords before but never in such a
gentle way.
	   In gory days of yore, it was the morning walk to meet the
executioner's sharp blade.
	   Yesterday the queen sat in her finery in the House of Lords and
gently announced that those who inherited their titles were to lose
the right to make our laws.
	   They did not like that, naturally. Some of them voiced their
disapproval, showing that good manners do not always come with good
breeding.
	   But at last the end of the peers is in sight. It has been a long
time coming _ about 700 years _ but their abolition will be another
step on the path to modernizing Britain.
	   Does that matter? It certainly does. As long as part of our
parliament lives in the past, the country will struggle to get into
the future.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on Indonesia:
	   Stark anarchy might well stare Indonesia in the face unless
President B.J. Habibie's government grasps the nettle and takes
firm measures quickly to restore law and order.
	   This is the grim message of the latest round of violence and
vandalism, with Ambonese Christians as the target this time. At one
level, the threat is to the process of political democratization
and economic regeneration that was the purpose of the cataclysmic
events of May. But the bigger danger could be to the very survival
of a far-flung nation state of 16,000 islands and more than 400
ethnic groups.
	   It is an immense task to hold together such a huge and disparate
nation, to weld together its demographic and geographic fault
lines, and reinforce the sense of nationhood that enabled
Indonesians to throw off the colonial yoke. But the job should not
be beyond the competence of a government that responds positively
to the challenge of the reformasi movement.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Stampa, Turin, on Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan:
	   Italy shouldn't be expecting help from the German government in
the case of the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   An extradition request from Germany would at the same time
entail an appeal to all the European countries to consider the case
from a political point of view, along with the legal one.
	   This would certainly represent an important step forward in the
handling of the Kurdish problem, but it's something the German
government cannot afford.
	   Despite all the talks about a new European Left, (German
Chancellor Gerhard) Schroeder is too weak to risk his government on
such a delicate matter.
	   He can't afford to ask for Ocalan's extradition because a high
number of Turks and Kurds live on its territory, and because
charges against the Kurdish leader are extremely serious...
	   It's difficult to predict what happens next. In any case, the
Ocalan case has represented yet another failure in the European
integration, another missed chance for a politically united Europe,
a fairy tale we hear every day.
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Monde, Paris, on the assassination of Galina Starovoitova:
	   Her name was Galina Starovoitova; she was 52 years old; she was
one of the last _ and most brilliant _ democratic leaders of a
movement reduced to almost nothing next to Russia's Yeltsinists,
Communists and Ultra-Nationalists...
	   The climate surrounding the murder is important. Boris Yeltsin
is weak, hospitalized yet again Monday for one of his famous
``pneumonias,'' incapable of running a country in advanced
delinquency.
	   Since 1992, Starovoitova is the sixth deputy of the Duma to be
assassinated...Interpol estimates the number of murder contracts in
Russia at 600 a month.
	   Anti-Semitism in Russia is more and more virulent, propagated
notably by the principal force in the Duma, Gennady Zyuganov's
communists...
	   Galina Starovoitova was faithful to battles that became more and
more urgent as Russia prepared to enter a new, post-Yeltsin phase
of decomposition.

Kuchma refuses to sign law limiting his powers over budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma refused to sign a
law that would limit his powers to slash government spending, his
press service said Thursday.
	   The Verkhovna Rada, or parliament, voted earlier this month to
approve changes to the budgetary system law, annulling a provision
that allows the president to stop or limit state spending on
certain budget articles.
	   The lawmakers argued that the provision contradicted Ukraine's
constitution, which gives parliament the exclusive right to approve
the federal budget and grants no rights to the president to change
it.
	   The Rada is dominated by Kuchma's centrist and leftist foes who
generally favor more spending for social subsidies. They changed
the old law ahead of debates on Ukraine's 1999 budget, scheduled
for next month.
	   Kuchma asked the legislators to cancel the new version of the
law, saying it would deprive him of the chance to correct the
budget deficit in case revenues fail to reach the planned targets,
his press service reported.

U.S. carrier celebrates Thanksgiving, saving something for Saddam

	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ U.S. sailors and airmen
celebrated Thanksgiving in fine style here Thursday with a feast of
turkey, honey-baked ham and good old pumpkin pie.
	   ``This is the kind of stuff that my mom would be proud to eat,''
chief cook Kenneth Nall said as he put the finishing touches to the
meal.
	   For this aircraft carrier of some 5,000 men and women and nearly
72 warplanes, the day that commemorates the first good harvest of
the Pilgrims in America began with a religious service.
	   Then lines started to form outside the ship's mail office as
scores of crew waited to get their share of the 10,000 pounds
(4,500 kilograms) of letters and parcels that had arrived from all
over the United States.
	   Lt. Chris Sims of Kosciusko, Mississippi said he missed his wife
Carrie and 17-month-old son, Jonathan ``like crazy.'' He held out
their pictures which he took before the Enterprise sailed from
Norfolk, Virginia, three weeks ago.
	   Lt. Lori Dague, 26, of Houston, Texas, said she missed her
husband Chris and son Cameron.
	   ``I am so lonely today. It's my first Thanksgiving away from
them,'' said Dague, a communications security officer and one of
some 300 women among the crew.
	   But minds quickly had to turn to the practical aboard the U.S.
Navy's longest carrier which entered the Gulf, a war zone, on
Tuesday.
	   By late morning the first of the day's 90 training missions had
started. The flight deck was catapulting F-14 and F-18 fighter jets
into the clear sky. The planes roared from standstill to 180 miles
per hour (288 kilometers per hour) in three seconds.
	   For the pilots, Thursday's agenda featured dropping dummy bombs
and refueling in midair.
	   For other crew, the day's work was a matter of loading bombs,
servicing engines and readying planes for take-off.
	   ``It doesn't make a difference whether it is Thanksgiving or
Christmas when you are in a war zone,'' said Petty Officer Joe
Sprague of Hornell, New York.
	   ``We have saved some Thanksgiving goodies for Saddam,'' quipped
Sprague, referring to the Iraqi president, whose decision to block
U.N. arms inspectors prompted Washington to send the carrier to the
Gulf.
	   ``If (Saddam Hussein's) hungry for some, we'll be glad to
deliver right at his door step,'' Sprague said, pointing at rows of
1,000 pound (450 kilograms) bombs.
	   Meanwhile in the kitchen, Nall and 200 other cooks and
assistants were preparing the feast of 10,000 turkey rolls, 2,500
of whole turkeys, 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) of honey-baked ham,
500 pounds (225 kilograms) of mashed potatoes and several thousand
pounds (kilograms) of other goodies, including pumpkin pie.
	   ``It's definitely a big operation,'' said Nall of Foley,
Alabama.
	   In the Kuwaiti desert, some 2,500 U.S. soldiers celebrated
Thanksgiving Thursday with elaborate meals in the mess hall of the
Camp Doha, 12 kilometers (8 miles) north of Kuwait City.
	   Several hundred of the soldiers are based in the camp to
maintain the armor and artillery that the United States keeps there
to be used in the event of an Iraqi attack. The rest are in Kuwait
to take part in routine war games.
	   The Thanksgiving meal featured alcohol-free eggnog, but there
was no beer or wine. Alcohol is banned in Kuwait, a Muslim country.
	   Maj. Anita McCarthy-McGee, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was
looking on the bright side of her sixth holiday far from home and
her six-year-old son.
	   ``I think of it as six turkeys I didn't have to cook,'' she
joked.

Florida couple's travel timers pack London sale

	   LONDON (AP) - A New York couple lacking space in their Florida
retirement home for all their French carriage clocks saw 160 of
them sold on Thursday for 509,000 pounds (dlrs 845,600).
	   Dr. Eugene Antelis, of Delray Beach, Florida, and his wife Rose,
joined dealers and collectors crowding into Christie's salesroom in
South Kensington for what the auction house described as the most
important collection of such clocks ever offered at auction.
	   ``I am sad to see them go _ they are like children but we
haven't enough space and I need to pay for the house,'' said
Antelis, a former internist in Brooklyn, New York, who at different
times has had 650 of the clocks. He said he now has about 100 left.
	   Carriage clocks in metal-framed cases, often with glass sides
showing their mechanism, were invented in France in 1798 for
travelers and exported throughout the world.
	   Christie's South Kensington salesroom handles middle market
consignments for the less glamorous end of the firm's business, but
it had 10 telephone lines open for outside bids, an unusual event
there.
	   An unidentified private buyer paid the top price of 23,000
pounds (dlrs 38,000) for a gilt-brass clock, 8 1/2 inches (21 cms)
tall, made by Drocourt in the last years of the 19th century, with
porcelain panels on which were painted romantic scenes of rustic
maidens and their admirers.

NATO opens verification analysis mission

<TEXT>
	   KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Thursday that Serbs and ethnic Albanians are complying with
the cease-fire agreement in Kosovo and that two new NATO missions
here would make verifying that compliance and protecting its
monitors much easier.
	   Solana said the new Macedonian government had given the green
light for NATO to base its 1,800-man French-led ``extraction
force'' at the Macedonian military base in this town just south of
the Kosovo border.
	   The mission of that force will be to rescue any of the 2,000
unarmed civilian peace ``verifiers'' now being dispatched to
Kosovo. Personnel are just beginning to arrive for the Kosovo
Verification Mission, as it is called. Significant numbers are
expected to be operational by mid-January.
	   ``This extraction force is a mission of peace,'' Solana said,
adding that official approval is expected next week when the
government is installed, but that it had signaled its willingness
in talks Thursday. ``It is a force needed for humanitarian
reasons.''
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe, said
NATO would move within 48 hours of the activation order for the
force, adding that leaders were already here laying the groundwork.
	   Solana and Clark were in Macedonia to open the Kosovo
Verification Coordination Cell, which serves as liaison between
NATO's air surveillance flights over Kosovo and the ground
verification mission just getting started under the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Information from both air and land components about President
Slobodan Milosevic's compliance with the deal he struck with
American negotiator Richard Holbrooke Oct. 12 and both sides
compliance with the cease-fire will be collated into a single
report.
	   About 60 military personnel from the United States, Britain,
Canada, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy Norway and Germany
are already in place, working in the coordination cell, essentially
an operations room filled with computers and sophisticated
communications equipment.
	   Eventually they will number about 140.
	   ``It's here that it will all put together ... and transmitted up
the NATO command chain,'' said Commander Bertie Armstrong of
Britain, the center's operations officer.
	   Solana said the verification cell is ``further proof of NATO's
determination to establish long-term peace in Kosovo and in the
entire Balkan region.''
	   ``Peace and stability in Kosovo may still be a long way off, but
the spirit of cooperation here make me believe a lasting solution
can be found,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International efforts at finding a
peace formula for Kosovo intensified Thursday despite Serbia's
defiant attempts to impose its own plan, which ethnic Albanians
have rejected.
	   European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch arrived in the province
to meet with ethnic Albanian negotiators and representatives of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Petritsch, who is Austria's ambassador to Yugoslavia, also
visited a suspected mass grave site in central Kosovo, accompanied
by the leader of an EU team of forensic experts that intends to
examine six such sites around the province.
	   Helena Ranta, who heads the 20-member, all-Finnish group, said
Yugoslav authorities on Thursday granted permission for full
investigations of the six sites, in addition to any other reported
of mass grave sites. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   ``Free access to the sites is of the utmost importance,'' said
Ranta, adding that the six areas will be investigated ``as soon as
possible.''
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush an armed rebellion by separatist rebels. The
clashes left some 300,000 people homeless and claimed the lives of
hundreds of others.
	   Suspected mass grave sites were discovered in October, but
Yugoslav authorities have previously refused to allow international
human rights experts to examine them.
	   The forensic team will exhume human remains from the sites and
take them to the provincial capital Pristina for examination. If
the investigation reveals evidence of atrocities committed by
either side in the conflict, the results will be passed on to the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands,
Petritsch said.
	   On Friday, Petritsch is expected to hook up with U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill in Pristina, continuing joint Western efforts to
negotiate a deal for Kosovo acceptable to all sides.
	   After meeting Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
Thursday, Petritsch said the situation on the ground remains
``very, very critical,'' due to the cold Kosovo winter. He said the
EU is seeking ``long-term arrangements to improve both humanitarian
and economic conditions.''
	   ``I believe that, even if we reach a political accord, that
doesn't provide for jobs in Kosovo,'' said Petritsch.
	   Petritsch also handed Rugova a list of abducted Kosovo Serbs
provided by a Serbian opposition party from Belgrade. Rugova
promised to look into it.
	   Petritsch's visit came amid renewed arguments over an
American-proposed plan for the region, that the Serbs have refused
and countered with their own version, which the Albanians, in turn,
have refused.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant of the two
republics in Yugoslavia. Most of the province's ethnic Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of the population, want independence but
Serbia rejects the idea.
	   There are fears that the province could explode in new fighting
if a solution is not found by spring.
	   A shaky truce mediated by U.S. envoys last month is generally
holding, but sporadic violence continues.

AIDS deaths falling in Europe, study says

	   LONDON (AP) _ Death rates across Europe among people infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, have fallen to less than a
fifth of what they were in 1995, according to a new study.
	   In the largest study to date tracking AIDS deaths in Europe,
researchers say the death rate has dropped 84 percent over the last
three years, mostly due to the introduction of new drugs and
combinations of treatments.
	   The study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a
British medical journal, involved 4,270 HIV patients in 50 centers
across Western Europe and Israel.
	   It found that from March to September of 1995, one in four
patients died after a year's follow-up, compared with one in 25
patients followed for a year dying in the same period in 1998.
	   The decline began after September 1995, coinciding with the
introduction of a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors and
with the way in which drugs were combined.
	   ``It was quite clear that these treatments are decreasing death
rates, but we didn't know the extent of the impact,'' said Andrew
Phillips, one of the lead researchers of the study at London's
Royal Free Center for HIV Medicine. ``We couldn't really have
predicted the magnitude.''
	   Death rates are also decreasing in the United States and other
developed countries, where such treatments are more widely
available than in the developing nations, but the decline in death
rates in Europe is the steepest reported to date, the researchers
said.
	   A study earlier this year found that deaths in the United States
decreased by 75 percent between early 1994 and mid-1997.
	   About 33 million people around the world are infected with HIV _
two thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa and about 2 percent of
them in Western Europe.
	   Phillips said scientists do not know whether the death rate will
stay down, There is a danger that it may creep up again, after
patients have been taking the new drugs for a few years, unless new
treatments are developed.
	   The United Nations reported earlier this week that although
death rates have been falling in Europe, rates of new infections
has not changed in recent years.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's former dictator broke into tears
upon learning he faces the threat of extradition to Spain on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism, Spanish newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Gen. Augusto Pinochet was read the news Wednesday _ his 83rd
birthday _ at the London hospital where he is under police guard,
minutes before Britain's highest court upheld his detention and
ruled he did not have immunity from prosecution.
	   The man allegedly responsible for killing and torturing
thousands during his 13-year rule, put his head in his hands and
sobbed, leading daily El Pais reported.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw asked to extend by one week
the original Wednesday deadline to decide whether to allow
extradition proceedings to continue, his office announced Thursday.
	   Pinochet is due to appear Wednesday at a London court, required
of all facing extradition.
	   Spanish jurists believe that a final decision on extradition
could take a year. In the meantime, Judge Baltazar Garzon, who
instigated the case, may travel to London to question the former
dictator.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,000 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
dictatorship, which began in 1973 when he overthrew Salvadore
Allende, an elected Marxist. Allende died in the coup.
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza will head a
delegation this week to press Britain to release Pinochet, who was
arrested Oct. 16 in London.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei complained that the affair
violates Chile's sovereignty, and endangers the country's fragile
transition to democracy, which began when Pinochet stepped down in
1990.
	   News of the ruling was greeted with anger by Pinochet's
supporters in Chile who attacked journalists in Santiago, including
a television crew from the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   The Pinochet Foundation said it lamented the mistreatment of
journalists at its headquarters in Santiago.
	   But the threat of extradition to Spain has convinced Pinochet's
opponents at home that a trial could be possible _ even in his
native Chile.
	   ``The trial of Pinochet in Chile is no longer a shot into the
air or a mad dream,'' Chilean lawyer Eduardo Contreras told
reporters in Madrid.
	   In January, Contreras helped file a suit in Chile against
Pinochet for mass murder, kidnapping and illegal burying of bodies.
Until recently the case was thought doomed.
	   ``With time the impact of the (British) lords' decision on
Chilean public opinion could lead the (Chilean) courts to strip
Pinochet of his immunity and allow him to be tried,'' he said.
	   Contreras says that Pinochet has been irreparably damaged _ even
if Britain lets him return home.
	   ``He would go back as human trash, as a broken general, as a
general who cries,'' the lawyer said.

Ukrainian president attacks government for failing to support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government has been too slow in
solving the problems of private businesses, even though business
development is the country's key economic priority, President
Leonid Kuchma said Thursday.
	   Speaking at a Kiev city council meeting devoted to small and
medium businesses, Kuchma called on the government to turn its
attention to encouraging private enterprise in this former Soviet
republic.
	   ``The confrontation along the bureaucrat-businessman line is
continuing,'' Kuchma said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He assailed the government for failing to work out a program for
supporting private business, which it was supposed to put together
by August, and failing to come up with budgetary means required for
such support.
	   Kuchma also complained of pervasive corruption, saying officials
in many regions of Ukraine are giving preferential treatment to
some businesses that ``monopolize local markets'' at the expense of
others.
	   In some cities, municipal authorities are demanding bribes from
private businesses for their own communal needs, which often
squashes developing businesses, he said.
	   ``It is necessary, without any pity, to uproot abuses of power
by the executive branch, the lobbying of interests of certain
commercial structures,'' Kuchma said.
	   Kuchma said the number of small business grew by 41 percent in
Ukraine in 1997, but lamented the fact that only 20 percent of
these were engaged in production.
	   ``Production must become the main target in perfecting the
structure of business'' in Ukraine, Kuchma said, singling out such
spheres as food and construction materials production,
machine-building and wood processing.
	   At the same time, Kuchma called for putting an end to the
situation in which business is a ``feeding ground'' for criminals
who set up fake companies for money laundering. He said 2,000 such
companies were uncovered in Ukraine this year alone.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A funeral procession for a slain dissident
and his wife turned into a rally Thursday, with tens of thousands
of mourners pledging to continue his struggle for freedom.
	   Many in the crowd carried large photos of Dariush Foruhar and
his wife, Parvaneh, who were stabbed to death in their Tehran home.
Their bodies were discovered Sunday; police reportedly have taken
several suspects into custody.
	   In a speech to Intelligence Ministry officials Thursday,
President Mohammad Khatami said Foruhar's killers must be brought
to justice.
	   ``The murder of the late Mr. Foruhar is condemned. The
government, and especially the intelligence network, have a very
important duty to confront it,'' Khatami said in comments reported
by the state-run radio.
	   ``If we don't deal with the crime seriously, and not identify
the culprits, the episode will not only constitute a disrespect for
our (Islamic) system, it will become the beginning of more problems
to come,'' Khatami said.
	   Khatami, a moderate cleric elected last year, has promised more
political freedoms.
	   But he faces strong opposition from hard-line opponents who are
backed by street vigilantes who have often taken the law into their
hands.
	   Over the past year, the vigilantes have attacked dissidents,
liberal newspapers and even a reformist Cabinet minister. They have
also broken up pro-democracy rallies.
	   The Iran News daily on Thursday quoted a police official as
saying that several people had been arrested in connection with
murders of Foruhar and his wife. It gave no other details.
	   Tens of thousands of supporters turned out for Foruhar's funeral
at the Fakhr Mosque in downtown Tehran, not far from where the
couple had lived.
	   Streets around the neighborhood were closed to traffic by
police, who formed human chains to try to control the crowds.
	   That led to small scuffles as the mourners pushed past the
policemen and made their way from the mosque to the old Parliament.
The building is a symbol of a nationalist movement that Foruhar
helped found in the 1950s.
	   ``You will live forever, Foruhar,'' the mourners chanted. ``Your
struggle continues with us.''
	   After a mass prayer held in the streets, thousands of mourners
crammed into buses for the 30-minute ride to the Behesht-e-Zahra
cemetery south of Tehran for the burial.
	   Foruhar, 70, was the leader of the People's Party of Iran, a
small opposition group that is tolerated by the government.
	   He served as minister of labor and social affairs in the
provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy.
	   His wife was in her mid-50s.

Israeli opposition leader rejects call to join a unity government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu comment grafs 6-7; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's opposition leader on Thursday rejected
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported attempts to coax him
into joining a unity government, vowing he would never become part
of such a ``terrible'' administration.
	   Cabinet ministers in Netanyahu's Likud party are reaching out to
their Labor rivals in a scramble to save the premier's shaky
coalition, Israeli media reported.
	   The six-party alliance has been on the verge of collapse since
Israel handed over another chunk of West Bank land to the
Palestinians last week, which coalition hard-liners oppose.
	   ``The Labor Party will not join a national unity government,''
party leader Ehud Barak said on Israel Radio. ``We will not be a
part of this terrible government.''
	   Netanyahu did not seem troubled by the comments.
	   ``I have heard that Mr. Barak is opposed to the idea of unity.
I, for my part, intend to take steps to expand the basis of support
for the government's policies,'' he told reporters on a visit to
London.
	   If his right-wing ministers bolt, Netanyahu would be left
without a majority and thus vulnerable in no-confidence motions.
Netanyahu will face his next test Tuesday when an early elections
bill is scheduled to come up.
	   As part of the intensive effort to save his government,
Netanyahu struck a tentative deal Wednesday with moderate David
Levy, who had resigned earlier this year from his post as foreign
minister.
	   Levy's rejoining would give Netanyahu a four-seat majority,
enough to defeat an early elections bill without the support of the
extreme right-wing Moledet party.
	   Despite Barak's continued statements that he would not lead
Labor into a union with Likud, Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister
and head of the Labor party, said a merging of bipartisan political
forces is the only way a final peace deal can be clinched.
	   ``I don't think we can reach a final settlement with only one
party. In order to reach a final settlement, we need both parties,
and the two parties need to understand that,'' Peres said in an
interview with Israel Radio.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, one of a trio of ministers
pushing for a national unity government, said Netanyahu's desire to
bring Labor into the fold is genuine and that the prime minister
would appeal to Labor directly on his return from Europe next week,
the daily Yediot Ahronot said.
	   Both Sharon and Netanyahu canceled trips in order to deal with
the coalition crisis. Sharon had been set to go to Washington, and
Netanyahu backed-out of the Swiss portion of a three-country
European tour.

Cuba wins friends with offers of medical help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to CLARIFY exporting of doctors has long
history. Trims. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ With its support of revolutions a thing of the
past, Cuba now wants to be known as an exporter of doctors rather
than fighters.
	   When Hurricane Mitch ravaged Central America, Cuba quickly sent
medical teams, and followed that up with offers of more. About 200
Cuban doctors already are working in countries affected by the
storm.
	   Cuba's decades-old policy of sending doctors to Third World
countries was long overshadowed by its support for armed struggle,
which ended with the Cold War at the start of this decade.
	   Now President Fidel Castro is making a broad proposal: offering
to help improve the health care systems of Central America with
more than 2,000 doctors and 5,000 medical scholarships over 10
years.
	   The idea is to slash the area's high infant mortality rate,
saving tens of thousands of lives each year _ many more than the
10,000 officials say were lost in the hurricane.
	   ``There is a hurricane worse than Mitch that is causing terrible
human damage,'' Castro said in a weekend speech whose text was
published Wednesday by the Communist Party daily Granma.
	   ``What Cuba wants to show is that if a country of such limited
material and economic resources can do something ... the
industrialized world can do infinitely more,'' Castro said.
	   Indeed, other countries would have to help if Castro's plan is
to go forward. He estimated it would require roughly dlrs 200
million in goods and medicine _ money that Cuba itself could not
provide.
	   Castro suggested that European or Latin American nations might
be able to help. He also calculated that if the United States were
to dedicate to the plan one dollar out of each dlrs 1,250 it spends
on defense, ``they could save 50,000 lives.''
	   While outside support is uncertain at best, the proposal is an
example of a major thread in Cuban foreign policy: using the
surplus of doctors created by its socialist system to win friends
abroad.
	   Cuba has been sending doctors to underdeveloped nations and
educating foreign doctors since the early 1960s. It even sent
doctors to help Nicaragua and Peru, then hostile to Cuba, recover
from earthquakes.
	   But Cuba's military support of rebel movements in Latin America
and pro-Soviet governments in Africa alienated Cuba from many
countries.
	   With the close of the Cold War, the soldiers have come home,
Cuba has cut support to revolutionaries and stepped up doctor
diplomacy _ with positive effects on Cuba's image.
	   Castro noted that Cuba has had as many as 22,000 foreign college
students, medical and otherwise, on scholarships in the past.
	   ``That also helps explain the solidarity of the Third World with
Cuba,'' he said, adding: ``We did not do it for that. We did it
because of our ideals and our feelings of solidarity and of
internationalism.''
	   While many things in Cuba are in short supply, the country is
flush with doctors.
	   When the current class graduates in August, Castro said Cuba's
11 million people will be served by 66,000 doctors. That is roughly
one for every 170 people, one of the best ratios in the world.
	   The country already has 1,000 doctors working abroad, including
more than 400 in South Africa. Many work in remote areas where
health care has been hard to come by and other doctors are loathe
to work _ such as the Mosquitia Indian area on Honduras' Atlantic
coast.
	   Cuba also has room in its medical schools. Castro said the
country has space for 30,000 medical students but has only about
15,000 now studying, including students from abroad.

	   LONDON (AP) - A New York couple lacking space in their Florida
retirement home for all their French carriage clocks saw 160 of
them sold Thursday for 509,000 pounds (dlrs 845,600).
	   Dr. Eugene and Rose Antelis of Delray Beach, Florida, joined
dealers and collectors crowding into Christie's salesroom in South
Kensington for what the auction house described as the most
important collection of such clocks ever offered at auction.
	   ``I am sad to see them go. They are like children, but we
haven't enough space and I need to pay for the house,'' said
Antelis, a former internist in the New York City borough of
Brooklyn who at different times has had 650 of the clocks. He said
he now has about 100 left.

Iraqi president says he taught Arabs not to fear America
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's defiance of Washington brought most
Arab nations to its side and proved that the United States was not
the world's only superpower, President Saddam Hussein was quoted as
saying Thursday.
	   However, he said it did not matter if the ``feeble and weak''
Arab rulers did not support him during his standoff with the United
States over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We are not frustrated if we fail to persuade'' Arab rulers to
support Iraq in its fight against U.N. trade sanctions, state-run
newspapers quoted Saddam as saying.
	   Arab rulers were only thinking of staying in power, while he was
concerned with Iraq's future and that of the Arab nations, Saddam
said without mentioning any Arab ruler by name.
	   He was apparently referring to the governments of the Arab Gulf
states as well as Syria and Egypt which, during a conference in
Qatar earlier this month, held Iraq ``responsible for any
consequences'' for refusing to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The United States on Nov. 14 called off airstrikes after the
Iraqi leader promised he would permit U.N. weapons inspectors to
visit suspected weapons sites in Iraq.
	   Lack of Arab support during the standoff apparently forced Iraq
to make a quicker retreat.
	   ``Those rulers are feeble and weak and no matter how many they
are, they do not belong to the people,'' Saddam was quoted as
saying Thursday.
	   Many Arabs and Muslims, Saddam said, believed ``America had the
power to give life and deny it.'' But Iraq's ``steadfastness'' made
them rely on God instead, he added.
	   He said he was certain he would emerge victorious in his
defiance of America.
	   ``Based on strong faith in God, the future is for Baghdad and
not its enemies,'' he said.

Russian, Nigerian oil companies discuss alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's biggest oil and gas companies are in
talks with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. about a possible
alliance, officials said Thursday.
	   At a recent meeting in Moscow of representatives from Russian
oil giant Lukoil, gas monopoly Gazprom and NNPC, a strategic
alliance ``was one of the proposals,'' a Lukoil spokesman said on
condition of anonymity. He did not elaborate.
	   Gazprom officials were not available for comment.
	   The Interfax news agency reported that the Nigerian side, led by
former foreign minister Ike Navachukve, expressed interest in
buying stakes in Russian oil and gas companies.
	   The Lukoil spokesman declined to give any details of the talks,
but said they were held at the Nigerians' initiative.
	   Earlier this week, Lukoil and Gazprom signed an agreement on a
partnership that provides for joint projects and aims at reducing
costs.
	   The Interfax report also said Nigeria was planning investments
in Russia.
	   Nigerian presidential adviser on energy, Aret Adams, told Dow
Jones that he was unaware of any discussion between Nigerian and
Russian oil companies.
	   Asked if there were any proposal from NNPC to invest in Russian
projects Adams asked, ``Where would we get the money?''

Pinochet ruling: It's not just the tyrants who've got a problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ By stripping Chile's Gen. Augusto Pinochet of
immunity from arrest on charges of genocide and torture, Britain's
highest court did more than warn dictators everywhere.
	   It is not only the likes of Uganda's infamous Idi Amin or
Haiti's ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier who need worry, some international
lawyers argue.
	   South Africa's Nobel Peace Prize-winning former President F.W.
de Klerk could find himself in trouble over apartheid's torturers,
Britain's Margaret Thatcher over sinking an Argentine cruiser, or
even Bill Clinton, once out of office, over bombing a Sudan drug
factory.
	   ``The big problem with the Pinochet case is just how far does
this judgment go?'' Craig Barker, a lecturer in international law
at England's Reading University, said Thursday.
	   ``And different nations will interpret it differently,'' Barker
added. ``In the case of de Klerk, it would depend on what he was
accused of but, under this judgment, he could find himself in a
difficult position.''
	   In a landmark 3-2 ruling Wednesday, Britain's House of Lords
said Pinochet's alleged crimes were beyond the immunity that, up to
now, this country's domestic law had given to heads and former
heads of state for any acts committed as part of their official
functions.
	   During Pinochet's 1973-90 rule, 3,197 people were killed or
tortured at the hands of the security forces, a Chilean government
report says.
	   And that, the majority judges found, was no more part of
Pinochet's official duties than if he had murdered his gardener or
ordered torture at whim.
	   Human rights lawyers hailed the Lords' decision unreservedly.
	   ``In the past, diplomats were trusted with making arrangements
for torturers to leave the scenes of their crimes with amnesties in
their pockets and their Swiss bank accounts intact,'' international
law barrister Geoffrey Robertson said. ``This shows international
law is strong enough to act as a real threat.''
	   But the ruling opened up an intricate world where nothing, it
seems, is that straightforward.
	   Chaloka Beyani, a specialist on public international law at the
London School of Economics, said exiled dictators accused of mass
murder _ but with protective hosts _ still look pretty secure.
	   So, too, do exiles in Europe sought for crimes against humanity
by Rwanda or Ethiopia. European Union nations refuse to extradite
people to countries where they might be sentenced to death or where
the impartiality of the courts is suspect.
	   For example, Idi Amin, under whose 1971-79 rule in Uganda some
300,000 people were killed, lives in Saudi Arabia as a pampered
guest. Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner is secure in Brazil. And
Ethiopia's Mengistu Haile Mariam is protected in Zimbabwe.
	   But de Klerk, a regular visitor to Britain, would now be
vulnerable to an extradition warrant filed, say, by a neighboring
African country or human rights activists over apartheid, Beyani
said.
	   Similarly, an Argentine court might now rule that Lady
Thatcher's sinking of the Belgrano, in which some 700 sailors died
during the 1982 Falkland s Islands conflict, was a war crime.
	   Or Sudan might seek Clinton's extradition in future years from a
third country for the August bombing of the El-Shifa factory, which
Washington contended produced chemical weapons.
	   To Sudan, the bombing was a heinous offense, wiping out a
facility it said produced only medicines that accounted for half
the nation's supply.
	   Whatever the courts rule, governments can still block
extradition.
	   For the 83-year-old Pinochet _ still in a London hospital,
although lawyers say he has recovered from back surgery _ that
would be his one last chance of getting home anytime soon.
	   If British Home Secretary Jack Straw blocks the extradition
proceedings initiated by Spain when he rules next month, the former
dictator could leave on the medically equipped Chilean Air Force
jet that has been standing by since his Oct. 16 arrest.
	   Beyani noted that many of Pinochet's colleagues might learn from
his example.
	   ``I think many former heads of state will be avoiding the United
Kingdom like the plague,'' he said. ``It opens a Pandora's box,''
he said.

Russian bank offers dlrs 100,000 for information on killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with candidate in election detained on extortion
charges, Interior Minister comment, new grafs 11-13. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A leading Russian bank has offered a dlrs 100,000
reward for information that could help solve the killing of a
prominent liberal lawmaker, the bank president said in an interview
published Thursday.
	   Galina Starovoitova, 52, was gunned down by unidentified
assailants on the stairs of her apartment building in St.
Petersburg last week, and was buried Tuesday in a ceremony attended
by thousands of mourners.
	   ``If this crime goes unpunished, it would deal an enormous blow
to peoples' attitude to the state,'' Mikhail Friedman, the head of
Alpha-Bank, said in an interview published in the business daily
Kommersant.
	   ``It would leave no hope that the government is capable of
caring for ordinary citizens, since it's unable to care for even
the leading members of the society.''
	   Friedman said his bank would pay dlrs 100,000 from its charity
fund to any person or group that provides information to help solve
the crime.
	   ``When we learned about this gruesome murder, we consulted our
partners and colleagues and decided that we must take part despite
the current difficult financial situation,'' Friedman said.
	   Starovoitova's slaying had all the trademarks of a contract
murder, which have become common in Russia and are rarely solved.
Still, her death has provoked outrage among many Russians.
	   Many of the killings are related to business disputes, but
Starovoitova had no known business interests. She was also perhaps
the most prominent female political figure in the country.
	   Police have not announced any major breakthroughs in the case.
However, the Russian media have speculated that the killing was
linked to Starovoitova's role in local elections in St. Petersburg
set for Dec. 6.
	   Several reports have claimed local mobsters might have been
tempted to kill Starovoitova because her liberal election bloc,
Northern Capital, is expected to make a strong showing.
Starovoitova was not on the ballot but was campaigning for her
allies, who have often spoken out against corruption.
	   St. Petersburg is a particularly crime-ridden city, even by
Russian standards.
	   A candidate in the Dec. 6 elections, businessman Alexander
Moshkalov, was detained Wednesday on suspicion of extortion, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
	   The latest in a long list of politicians accused or convicted of
criminal involvement prompted Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin to
call Thursday for a law that would allow police to investigate
candidates for public office.
	   Stepashin also said detectives had received some clues from
Starovoitova's aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov. The aide suffered
serious head wounds but has recovered enough to speak with police.
	   His testimony along with other witness accounts should allow
police to make sketches of the attackers, Stepashin said.
	   Linkov didn't learn of Starovoitova's death until Thursday, as
doctors had tried to spare him extra trauma. But he overheard it on
a news broadcast through an open door.
	   ``He is taking the death of Starovoitova very badly,'' Linkov's
mother was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Iraqi dissidents dispute claim of attempt on Saddam's deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi opposition group disputed Thursday
government reports of an assassination attempt on the life of
Saddam Hussein's deputy.
	   Baghdad ``falsified'' the reports to ``increase repression'' on
Shiite Muslims in southern and central Iraq, said a statement by
the London-based Iraqi National Congress.
	   The statement was also read over the Iraqi Broadcasting
Corporation, a radio station that operates in northern Iraq and is
affiliated to INC, an umbrella of several Iraqi opposition groups.
	   State-run Baghdad television reported Monday that assailants
threw two grenades at Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy as he got out
of his car Sunday in the central Shiite holy city of Karbala to
attend a religious ceremony. He was unhurt.
	   ``The (Iraqi) regime falsified this attack in order to increase
repression of the Shiite people in central and southern Iraq,''
said the INC statement that was faxed to The Associated Press
office in Cairo.
	   Baghdad television said several bodyguards and bystanders were
wounded in the assassination attempt.
	   The INC statement said that on the day of the alleged attack,
Ibrahim _ who is Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary
Command Council and deputy commander of the Iraqi armed forces _
was leading troops from the elite Republican Guard, the Emergency
Units and Saddam's Fedayeen, as part of the ``national campaign to
capture (army) deserters.''
	   Saddam's Fedayeen is a paramilitary force of 40,000 run by
Saddam's eldest son, Odai. The Emergency Units is part of the Iraqi
army, specialized in combating riots, rebellions and other
disturbances.
	   Clashes broke out between Ibrahim's forces and the Shiites as
arrests were being made, and a number of soldiers were killed, said
the INC statement. ``But there was no attempt against Izzat Ibrahim
personally.''
	   It said the assassination attempt was falsified to justify the
``mass arrests of young people in the town'' and the ensued clashes
between Ibrahim's forces and the people of Karbala.
	   It said the campaign to capture army deserters was launched on
Nov. 7 in several Iraqi towns in the southern marshes where
thousands of deserters and Shiite rebels take refuge and carry out
hit-and-run attacks against government forces.

NATO opens verification analysis mission

	   KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Thursday that Serbs and ethnic Albanians are complying with
the cease-fire agreement in Kosovo and that two new NATO missions
here would make verifying that compliance and protecting its
monitors much easier.
	   Solana said the new Macedonian government had given the green
light for NATO to base its 1,800-man French-led ``extraction
force'' at the Macedonian military base in this town just south of
the Kosovo border.
	   The mission of that force will be to rescue any of the 2,000
unarmed civilian peace ``verifiers'' now being dispatched to
Kosovo. Personnel are just beginning to arrive for the Kosovo
Verification Mission, as it is called. Significant numbers are
expected to be operational by mid-January.
	   ``This extraction force is a mission of peace,'' Solana said,
adding that official approval is expected next week when the
government is installed, but that it had signaled its willingness
in talks Thursday. ``It is a force needed for humanitarian
reasons.''
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe, said
NATO would move within 48 hours of the activation order for the
force, adding that leaders were already here laying the groundwork.
	   Solana and Clark were in Macedonia to open the Kosovo
Verification Coordination Cell, which serves as liaison between
NATO's air surveillance flights over Kosovo and the ground
verification mission just getting started under the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Information about President Slobodan Milosevic's compliance with
the deal struck with U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke Oct. 12 and
both sides' compliance with the cease-fire will be collated into a
single report.
	   About 60 military personnel from the United States, Britain,
Canada, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway and Germany
are already in place, working in the coordination cell, essentially
an operations room filled with computers and sophisticated
communications equipment.
	   Eventually they will number about 140.
	   ``It's here that it will all put together ... and transmitted up
the NATO command chain,'' said Commander Bertie Armstrong of
Britain, the center's operations officer.
	   Solana said the verification cell is ``further proof of NATO's
determination to establish long-term peace in Kosovo and in the
entire Balkan region.''
	   ``Peace and stability in Kosovo may still be a long way off, but
the spirit of cooperation here make me believe a lasting solution
can be found,'' he said.

Asian, European markets advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stock markets in Asia and Europe advanced Thursday,
as Japanese investors awaited economic stimulus measures and the
European markets percolated with rumors of a big oil merger.
	   Tokyo's main index, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, gained
134.30 points, or 0.89 percent, closing at 15,207.77. The index
rebounded from a drop of 91.17 points Wednesday.
	   Share prices rose amid optimism that recent moves to stabilize
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government will prove beneficial to
the ailing Japanese economy.
	   Investors have been encouraged by an alliance between Obuchi's
ruling party and the minority Liberal Party, which has called for
suspending an unpopular sales tax and trimming the government
bureaucracy, traders said.
	   The main stock index has rallied about 800 points this week,
closing above 15,000 points Tuesday for first time since Aug. 25.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 57.93 points,
or 0.5 percent, to close at 10,778.92. The Hang Seng has gained 8.4
percent over the past two weeks. Thursday, financial giant HSBC
Holdings led the charge, rising 5 Hong Kong dollars to its highest
level in more than six months.
	   Most other Asian markets posted slim gains or losses, with the
exception of South Korea, where shares fell 3.8 percent. Analysts
said the losses were caused by massive selling by local
institutional investors to hedge against the futures market.
	   In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index
rose 72.6 points, or 1.26 percent, to close at 5,827.9 points.
	   Some traders attributed the gains to a Financial Times report
that said U.S. oil giants Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are in an
advanced stage of merger talks. Several European oil companies saw
their shares benefit from the prospect of continued industry
consolidation, led by the British-traded shares of Royal
Dutch-Shell Group of Cos., which rose 4 percent. British Petroleum,
which stunned the industry in August with its $49 billion
acquisition of Amoco Corp., also rose.
	   Most other European markets rose, too. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX
closed 2.3 percent higher, the Paris CAC-40 rose 1.7 percent and
the main indexes in Milan and Madrid both rose 2.6 percent.
	   Volume in most markets was light, as traders took cues from the
United States, where markets were closed for the Thanksgiving
holiday.

Colombian peace talks hit snag over soldiers' presence in
</HEADLINE>
demilitarized zone &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian rebels said Thursday that the
government has not honored its promise to remove all troops from an
extensive southern region as a condition for holding peace talks.
	   The impasse _ over the presence of about 120 soldiers on a base
in Caqueta state _ is the first major snag in peace talks still in
the planning stages between the government and the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's most powerful
guerrilla group.
	   Earlier this month, President Andres Pastrana withdrew some
2,000 troops and police from the 16,200 square-mile
(42,000-square-kilometer) area as a security guarantee for
guerrilla negotiators. He left the 120-member contingent at the
base in San Vicente del Caguan, however, insisting they were
necessary support staff for the government's negotiating team.
	   Ignoring weeks of rebel criticism, Pastrana has insisted the
soldiers _ most of them young cadets _ are unarmed and would remain
on the base.
	   In the statement to reporters on Thursday in the pullout zone,
FARC negotiator Fabian Ramirez said that if Pastrana did not change
his mind and remove the troops ``he will bear sole responsibility
for the freezing of the dialogues.''
	   Pastrana responded that he would not back down, and urged the
leftist rebels to press ahead with peace talks to end the country's
36-year civil war.
	   ``The government will manage its own headquarters,'' Pastrana
said.
	   Despite the controversy, presidential peace envoy Victor G.
Ricardo said his preparatory meeting in the southern jungle region
with the FARC's top commander, Manuel Marulanda, would go forward
as planned on Friday.
	   The two are to discuss the FARC's insistence that the government
exchange 452 jailed rebels for some 300 soldiers and police the
rebels have captured over the past year.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's former dictator broke into tears
upon learning he faces the threat of extradition to Spain on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism, Spanish newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Gen. Augusto Pinochet was read the news Wednesday _ his 83rd
birthday _ at the London hospital where he is under police guard,
minutes before Britain's highest court upheld his detention and
ruled he did not have immunity from prosecution.
	   The man allegedly responsible for killing and torturing
thousands during his 13-year rule, put his head in his hands and
sobbed, leading daily El Pais reported, citing unidentified sources
close to the case.
	   But Jose Luis Morales, an official at the Chilean Embassy in
London, was quoted by the Santiago afternoon daily La Hora as
flatly denying that Pinochet cried.
	   The paper cited Morales as saying by telephone that he was the
one who broke the news to Pinochet and that ``he reacted with
disappointment but with calm.''
	   El Pais said a British woman official had read out the ruling to
Pinochet. Two other Spanish papers also reported that Pinochet had
cried.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw asked to extend by one week
the original Wednesday deadline to decide whether to allow
extradition proceedings to continue, his office announced Thursday.
	   Pinochet is due to appear Wednesday at a London court, required
of all facing extradition.
	   Spanish jurists believe that a final decision on extradition
could take a year. In the meantime, Judge Baltasar Garzon, who
instigated the case, may travel to London to question the former
dictator.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,000 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
dictatorship, which began in 1973 when he overthrew Salvador
Allende, an elected Marxist. Allende died in the coup.
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza will head a
delegation this week to press Britain to release Pinochet, who was
arrested Oct. 16 in London.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei complained that the affair
violates Chile's sovereignty, and endangers the country's fragile
transition to democracy, which began when Pinochet stepped down in
1990.
	   News of the ruling was greeted with anger by Pinochet's
supporters in Chile who attacked journalists in Santiago, including
a television crew from the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   The Pinochet Foundation said it lamented the mistreatment of
journalists at its headquarters in Santiago.
	   But the threat of extradition to Spain has convinced Pinochet's
opponents at home that a trial could be possible _ even in his
native Chile.
	   ``The trial of Pinochet in Chile is no longer a shot into the
air or a mad dream,'' Chilean lawyer Eduardo Contreras told
reporters in Madrid.
	   In January, Contreras helped file a suit in Chile against
Pinochet for mass murder, kidnapping and illegal burying of bodies.
Until recently the case was thought doomed.
	   ``With time the impact of the (British) lords' decision on
Chilean public opinion could lead the (Chilean) courts to strip
Pinochet of his immunity and allow him to be tried,'' he said.
	   Contreras says that Pinochet has been irreparably damaged _ even
if Britain lets him return home.
	   ``He would go back as human trash, as a broken general, as a
general who cries,'' the lawyer said.

	   ``He is active in the field of rehabilitation of torture
survivors and prevention of torture,'' said Adama Dieng, president
of the Martin Ennals Foundation.
	   ``His involvement in human rights issues has exposed him on
several occasions to threatening situations and resulted in his own
imprisonment and torture. His open criticism of the Palestinian
National Authority has placed him in great danger.''
	   Sarraj is the founder and director of the Gaza Community Mental
Health Program. He has been imprisoned three times by the
Palestinian authorities.
	   ``Dr. El Sarraj has developed an independent mental health
service which provides urgently needed support for the large number
of people affected by the upheaval of the Intifada and the
organized violence perpetrated under Israeli occupation,'' Dieng
added.
	   The Martin Ennals award was created in 1993 to commemorate the
life-long human rights campaigner who created several human rights
organizations including International Alert and who helped build up
Amnesty International.
	   The first award was given to Chinese dissident Harry Wu in 1994
for his work against forced labor in China.

Turkey's Islamic party avoids confrontation over leading next

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic party
said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead
Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the
military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
	   Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-old
government Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal,
setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secular
parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
	   ``The no-confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave political
chaos,'' Yilmaz declared.
	   By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go
to the Islamic Virtue Party since it has the most seats in
Parliament. Few believe the all-powerful, staunchly secular
military would agree to that.
	   Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its
constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.
	   Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai
Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with
picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in
Parliament.
	   ``We have told the president that we will not be insistent. It's
fine if we're in the new government. It's fine if we're not,''
Kutan said.
	   Kutan said the next administration should be a caretaker
government with the support of all parties, which would lead the
country until the next national elections.
	   Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-led
government out of office last year, after it came to power in a
coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.
	   Mrs. Ciller, head of the center-right True Path Party and a key
contender for power, said after meeting with Demirel later Thursday
that she favored a strong, ``broad-based'' coalition capable of
tackling problems until the elections. She would not elaborate.
	   Newspapers reported that Mrs. Ciller was already in contact with
Virtue in pursuit of a possible alliance. The party denied the
reports.
	   No party has a majority in parliament. Analysts consider Mrs.
Ciller's True Path capable of fitting into any pro-secular
coalition in the political system, deeply divided by political
rivalry.
	   Turkish politics have been torn in the 1990s between the choice
of an Islamic-led government or fragile, pro-secular coalitions.
	   Even if the secular establishment succeeds in pushing aside
Virtue, it would be difficult to put together a government without
Mrs. Ciller's backing.
	   ``We are open to any kind of proposal. We will act
constructively,'' Mrs. Ciller, who commands 99 deputies in the
550-seat parliament, told reporters.
	   One scenario suggests she may join forces with Yilmaz, long her
rival.
	   Demirel said it would be four or five days before he completes
consultations with party leaders and designates a premier. Yilmaz,
meanwhile, serves as caretaker premier.
	   Elections are scheduled for April 18. Yilmaz has urged they be
held earlier.
	   Parliament opened investigations Thursday into the allegations
that toppled Yilmaz _ that he had ties to Turkey's mafia and rigged
the sale of a state bank - and one other into alleged irregularity
in the sale of cellular telephone licenses.

Pollock causes West Indies to flutter

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In typical fashion South
Africa worried away at the West Indian batting to have them at 249
for seven Thursday at the close of play of the first day of the
first test against South Africa.
	   The game at Wanderers Stadium marked the first time the two
teams have met in a test in South Africa. It is the first time they
are playing each other in a full series after South Africa lost in
Barbados in 1992 in its first test match on its return after
apartheid.
	   After a brilliant spell in the morning in which he took three
for 19 in eight overs, Shaun Pollock was unable to make any further
inroads. However, Allan Donald, who was dispatched for 50 runs off
his first eight overs by an aggressive top order, came back to take
two wickets; David Terbrugge took one on his debut and Jacques
kallis captured the only other wicket to fall.
	   West Indies captain Brian Lara pronounced himself happy with the
200 runs his team scored after the first three wickets fell so
cheaply.
	   ``I would have prepared a pitch with a truer bounce but losing
only one wicket between lunch and tea is a good achievement,'' he
said.
	   ``I expect the pitch to deteriorate some time during the third
day and I expect my spinners to do the job, especially Rawl
Lewis.''
	   He also had Carl Hooper and Shivnarine Chanderpaul to thank for
rebuilding the West Indies innings after Pollock's early spell.
Hooper scored 44 before he became Donald's first victim when he
flashed at one outside the off stump and edged a high catch to
Darryl Cullinan's left at first slip.
	   He and Chanderpaul launched their rescue act after Pollock had
ripped through the top order, taking three vital wickets (Clayton
Lambert for eight, Philo Wallace for 16 and Brian Lara for 11).
Their partnership for the fourth wicket earned 91 runs in 137
minutes.
	   Chanderpaul went on to record the first half-century of the
series, batting with great patience and application against a tight
line and length from the whole South African attack except Donald.
It was a characteristic innings by the left-hander, bringing him
his 15th test 50, and another in a long line of his innings which
have rescued the West Indies from a tight spot.

	   PARIS _ An armed man opened fire in a bar east of Paris Thursday
afternoon, killing two people and critically injuring another,
police said.
	   The gunman entered the ``Le Paris'' bar in Lilas, a working
class suburb east of Paris, just before 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) and shot
the bar's owner, the owner's wife and a waiter, police said.
	   The attacker fled the scene in a car.
	   The bar's owner, Gerard Pasquier, 51, and the waiter, Marc
Braun, 54, died of their injuries, despite efforts by emergency
workers to resuscitate them. Christine Pasquier, 53, was taken to
the hospital but her life was not in danger, emergency workers
said.
	   Investigators do not know the motive for the shooting, but said
they believe it could be a settling of scores.
	   Two customers who witnessed the shooting were being treated for
shock, police said.

Brazil probes alleged irregularities in Telebras sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The government has ordered an
investigation into alleged irregularities in the dlrs 19 billion
sale of federal telecommunications company Telebras.
	   The general accounting office announced Thursday it will look
into unusual financing practices in the July 29 auction for
Telebras, which was split into 12 companies.
	   Office director Carlos Atila said the National Development Bank,
which financed some of the bidders, reportedly set some unorthodox
conditions _ in one case, demanding that a consortium buy 25
percent of one of the spinoff companies.
	   The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported that the bank offered
dlrs 1.24 billion in financing and guarantees to Brazilian-led
groups, including dlrs 462 million in cash.
	   The inner workings of the privatization were revealed in
illegally taped phone conversations of the former communications
minister, Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros.
	   Although Mendonca apparently did nothing illegal, the seeming
manipulation of the bidders shocked Brazilians. This week, Mendonca
and four other top officials resigned.

Mice eat dlrs 6,000 in Russian woman's savings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It was awfully expensive mouse feed.
	   Mice in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg reportedly gnawed
through dlrs 6,000 in cash dollars that a woman had been saving in
a food jar _ a common alternative to Russia's risky banking system.
	   The woman told officials at a local bank that she had saved dlrs
30,000 in the glass jar, which she kept in her cellar in
Yekaterinburg, 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) east of Moscow, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
	   The mice apparently ate through the plastic lid on the jar,
which was among other jars that actually contained food.
	   She brought the remains of the chewed-up dlrs 6,000 into a
branch of the Uralvneshtorgbank to see if they were worth anything,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The bank often accepts mangled notes, but said this was its
first experience with mouse-eaten money. The report did not say
whether the bank could reimburse the woman for any of the damaged
bills.
	   Most Russians keep their savings in dollars because of the
instability of the ruble in recent years, and many people have long
been suspicious of depositing money in Russia's fledgling banks.
	   Their fears have only worsened since August, when Russia's
financial crisis crippled most banks, prompting them to freeze
accounts because they couldn't pay off depositors _ and depriving
millions of Russians of their savings.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Several fans among the thousands
waiting to buy tickets for a weekend soccer match that could decide
the season championship scuffled with one another and police
Thursday. Twelve people were injured and 11 arrested, authorities
said.
	   Many of the nearly 10,000 people who lined up outside the Boca
Juniors' stadium arrived Monday, hoping for a chance to watch their
team play Sunday against Independiente. A Boca tie or win would
give Diego Maradona's former club team its first Argentine
championship since 1992.
	   As time drew near for the 12,000 tickets priced at dlrs 10 to be
put on sale Thursday, fans began pushing and shoving among
themselves and later with police who tried to maintain order.
	   Annoyed with the more than 300 police officers surrounding the
stadium, fans began throwing bottles, rocks and sticks at the
officers, who were armed with batons.
	   Meanwhile, Gustavo Correa, the fan lucky enough to be at the
head of the line, held firmly onto his spot.
	   ``My dear Boca....the champion,'' he shouted after buying the
first ticket.
	   He will be among the more than 62,000 fans expected to fill
Boca's La Bombonera stadium Sunday.

Parlaiment approves new pensions system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The lower house of parliament on Thurday
approved a new pension system that makes retirement payments
dependent on duration of employment and amount of contributions
that will be split between state and private funds.
	   The 460-member Sejm voted 194-123 with no abstentions to approve
the plan, a vital element of Poland's reforms that do away with the
remains of the communist-era administrative and social welfare
structures. It is to take effect Jan. 1.
	   The bill still needs the approval of the upper house and of
President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
	   The new plan offers working Poles the possibility of larger
pensions than the current scheme, which provides meager payments
not directly related to workers' contributions.
	   It also will ease the burden on the strained national budget by
eliminating subsidies for social security payments.
	   Heavy subsidies to cover average payments of 720 zlotys (dlrs
205) a month - or 60 percent of the average wage - to 7.5 million
pensioners amounted to 3.8 billion zlotys (dlrs 1.08 billion) in
1996, the same as total spending on culture and higher education.
	   The plan guarantees state pensions for workers now over 50, but
gives workers between 30 and 50 the option of splitting their
pension plans between state and private funds. Workers under 30 can
chose between the state, private and mixed plans.
	   Social security contributions would remain at the current level
of 45 percent of the payroll, split equally between employer and
employee. The new plan also sets strict retirement limits _ 65
years for men and 60 years for women _ and curtails earlier
retirement.
	   Last month, the United States offered dlrs 4.6 million for the
Western-style pension reforms.
	   The money funneled through the U.S. Agency for International
Development by the year 2000 will be spent on an information
campaign, training and supervision of funds.

No. 1 again, Sampras makes tennis history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Sampras winning, recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras has his piece of tennis
history and a few other landmarks are within his grasp.
	   Considered by many to be perhaps the finest player in the
history of the game, Sampras is notching up the numbers to prove
it.
	   On Thursday, Sampras made sure of holding the No. 1 ranking for
a record sixth consecutive year, a mark he feels may never be
broken.
	   He had been tied with Jimmy Connors, each finishing No. 1 for
five straight years. Connors did it in 1974-1978.
	   Marcelo Rios made a perfect Thanksgiving for Sampras when he
pulled out of the ATP Tour World Championship because of a back
injury.
	   Rios, ranked No. 2, was the only man who could have threatened
Sampras for the top ranking. Sampras entered the season-ending
championship with a 33-point lead over the Chilean in the computer
standings.
	   If Sampras wins the tournament for the fifth time, he will pull
even with Ivan Lendl on the all-time list. Sampras won the elite
event in 1991, 1994 and the last two years.
	   Having won his first two round-robin matches, Sampras was
already assured of a place in the semifinals before he played Karol
Kucera Thursday.
	   A relaxed Sampras then demonstrated why he is No. 1, crushing
Kucera 6-2, 6-1 in 45 minutes. Kucera is No. 7 in the world and
beat Sampras once in their three previous matches this year.
	   ``It feels great,'' Sampras said. ``I put a lot of work into the
game. It's tough to stay on top so long.''
	   Sampras' declared career goal is to break Roy Emerson's record
of 12 Grand Slam titles. Sampras, 27, already has 11 and a few
years ahead of him on the tour.
	   He leads all active players with 56 career titles, but Connors'
record of 109 looks safe for a long time to come.
	   By his standards, Sampras has had a relatively modest year,
winning four tournaments. That included his fifth Wimbledon, but no
other Grand Slams.
	   When the year-end rankings are released Monday, Sampras will be
at No. 1 for the 248th week, the third longest total behind Lendl
(270) and Connors (268). Sampras could pass both of them next year.
	   In the first match Thursday, Tim Henman beat Alex Corretja 7-6
(7-4), 6-7, (4-7), 6-2 to become the second player to advance to
the semifinals.
	   Corretja dropped to 1-1 but remains alive under the round-robin
format. Henman is 2-0.
	   Henman paid tribute to Sampras. ``It's a phenomenal
achievement,'' he said.
	   ``It's tough for anyone else really to comprehend. I don't think
it's one that's going to be broken for a long, long time, if
ever,'' Henman said.
	   Rusedski, an alternate, played Albert Costa, the second
alternate who is ranked No. 14 in the world, and won 7-6 (7-5),
6-1. The second Briton in the field needed 10 set points to win the
first set, but breezed through the second.
	   Rusedski replaced Andre Agassi, who dropped out late Wednesday,
also because of a back injury.
	   The dlrs 3.5 million tournament brings together players with the
best results over the year. But with Patrick Rafter and Richard
Krajicek both pulling out before the event because of injuries and
Agassi and Rios withdrawing, four of the best players are missing.
	   Rios had to do better than Sampras in the tournament to have a
shot at dethroning him. But Sampras scored quick and impressive
victories in his opening matches.
	   Rios had already dented his hopes of overtaking Sampras by
losing his first match, to Henman.
	   ``When I tried to practice this morning, it was really sore. It
made no sense to go out on the court and play two games,'' Rios
said. ``I am disappointed but that's the way it goes.''
	   On Friday, Yevgeny Kafelnikov will battle Carlos Moya for a
place in the semifinals.
	   In other matches, Rusedski plays Henman and Costa meets
Corretja. Their outcome will determine the other two semifinalists.
With Henman already through, Corretja and Rusedski are still in the
running. Corretja will advance is Rusedski loses to Henman.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French rail service slowed to crawl Thursday night
as train workers began their second national strike in a week.
	   The French national train company, the SNCF, said service across
the country would be seriously disrupted at least until Saturday
morning.
	   About one in three trains were expected to run Thursday night
and Friday, the SNCF said. Only Eurostar trains to London, Thalys
trains to Brussels and the fast train to Switzerland were expected
to run normally Friday.

Pollock causes West Indies to flutter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: new throughout to UPDATE with play through close

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In typical fashion South
Africa worried away at the West Indian batting to have them at 249
for seven Thursday at the close of play of the first day of the
first test against South Africa.
	   The game at Wanderers Stadium marked the first time the two
teams have met in a test in South Africa. It is the first time they
are playing each other in a full series after South Africa lost in
Barbados in 1992 in its first test match on its return after
apartheid.
	   After a brilliant spell in the morning in which he took three
for 19 in eight overs, Shaun Pollock was unable to make any further
inroads. However, Allan Donald, who was dispatched for 50 runs off
his first eight overs by an aggressive top order, came back to take
two wickets; David Terbrugge took one on his debut and Jacques
kallis captured the only other wicket to fall.
	   West Indies captain Brian Lara pronounced himself happy with the
200 runs his team scored after the first three wickets fell so
cheaply.
	   ``I would have prepared a pitch with a truer bounce but losing
only one wicket between lunch and tea is a good achievement,'' he
said.
	   ``I expect the pitch to deteriorate some time during the third
day and I expect my spinners to do the job, especially Rawl
Lewis.''
	   He also had Carl Hooper and Shivnarine Chanderpaul to thank for
rebuilding the West Indies innings after Pollock's early spell.
Hooper scored 44 before he became Donald's first victim when he
flashed at one outside the off stump and edged a high catch to
Darryl Cullinan's left at first slip.
	   He and Chanderpaul launched their rescue act after Pollock had
ripped through the top order, taking three vital wickets (Clayton
Lambert for eight, Philo Wallace for 16 and Brian Lara for 11).
Their partnership for the fourth wicket earned 91 runs in 137
minutes.
	   Chanderpaul went on to record the first half-century of the
series, batting with great patience and application against a tight
line and length from the whole South African attack except Donald.
It was a characteristic innings by the left-hander, bringing him
his 15th test 50, and another in a long line of his innings which
have rescued the West Indies from a tight spot.

Turkey's sports minister invites Italian counterpart to match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Italian minister saying whole
government will have to decide whether to accept. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's sports minister has invited his
Italian counterpart to attend the Galatasaray-Juventus Champions
League match set for Wednesday in Istanbul _ a politically charged
offer at a time of tensions between the two nations.
	   Sports Minister Yucel Seckiner sent an invitation to Giovanna
Melandri on Wednesday.
	   ``We invited the minister to see that there is no negative
atmosphere in Turkey,'' said Ahmet Gocen, a sports ministry
official.
	   UEFA postponed the match _ it was to have been played Wednesday
_ and set it for next Wednesday because of anti-Italian sentiment
in Turkey over Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Turkish and Galatasaray officials said the decision favored the
Italian team. Some claimed soccer's European governing body had
postponed the match to allow injured Juventus players time to get
back into shape.
	   Melandri said Thursday she appreciated Turkey's invitation
personally. She didn't say whether she would accept, saying, ``that
should be a decision for the government as a whole to consider.''
	   The Turkish side has 7 points in Group B, one behind Norway's
Rosenborg. Galatasaray has seven and Juventus four, but they've
each played one fewer game than the Norwegians.
	   Juventus has reached the European Champions Cup final three
straight times and won once.
	   Thousands of Turks have taken to the streets in the past week in
anti-Italian demonstrations since Ocalan's detention in Rome
earlier this month. Italy has since released the rebel leader and
is considering granting him political asylum.

City center gets facelift for Christmas and millennium

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ The start of the Christmas season in
the town where Jesus was born marks a mad rush to complete a total
makeover of Manger Square in time for the holidays and for
millennium celebrations next year.
	   Manger Square, in front of the 4th century church built over the
traditional birthplace of Jesus, is one big construction site. Two
yellow tractors clear away rubble as workmen lay large, square
stone tiles that are to cover the football-field-sized square.
	   They're about one-quarter done. The rest of the square is dust,
dirt, open trenches and piles of gravel, sand and bags of cement.
	   City officials claim the dlrs 12 million project will be nearly
completed by Christmas Eve. Palestinian merchants, watching the
proceedings from their empty stores around the square, say that
would be a miracle.
	   Even according to the most optimistic schedule, the square will
not be ready for visitors in the middle of December, least of all
President Bill Clinton. City officials expect Clinton to stop by
and light the Christmas tree during a visit to the Palestinian
areas and Israel.
	   A chain-link fence stands between Angela Giacaman's large gift
shop and the ruins of Manger Square. The store is at the end of a
row of shops along one side of the square, near the church.
	   Before construction, three steps along the length of the row of
shops connected them with the square. Now there is a three-foot
dropoff. A rickety wooden plank crosses it at one end.
	   Work started in August. ``They destroyed our summer season, and
now they are destroying our winter season,'' said Giacaman, who has
run her souvenir store for 20 years.
	   Disgusted, she pointed to a few tourists raising a cloud of dust
on the other side of the square. ``They have to climb over rubble
to get to the church,'' she complained.
	   Bethlehem Mayor Hanna J. Nasser presides over the project from
his wood-panelled office on the second floor of city hall, facing
the Church of the Nativity at the other end of Manger Square. He
promises that the square will be ready for Christmas and reminds
the disgruntled merchants: ``You cannot construct things if you do
not destroy things,'' he said.
	   Nasser said this reconstruction project has been his dream for
25 years, but there was never enough money. Then along comes the
millennium, a one-time chance to remake Bethlehem for the
celebrations of the year 2000. Large donations came from Europe,
Japan and the United States.
	   ``This occasion is a very important and unique vehicle for us to
use for developing the city,'' Nasser observed with a sly smile.
	   Khader Ali, 50, sat dejectedly on a stool at the end of Milk
Grotto Street overlooking Manger Square. He owns a small
restaurant, appropriately named ``Ruins'' at the other end of the
street. The end next to the church, where Ali sat, was blocked off
by a large cement sewer pipe fixture at the edge of Manger Square.
	   Ali didn't bother opening his restaurant. It stands forlornly
shuttered amid a row of shops in the shadow of a huge, square
church bell tower. Shrugging a shoulder toward the rubble, he
complained, ``Because of this, they destroyed the business,
especially for me inside.''
	   Ali admitted that in the long run, he will benefit from this.
``When it is finished,'' he said. ``It will be 100 times better
than before.''
	   City engineer Judeh Morkos underlines that. Standing on a City
Hall balcony surveying the work in progress, he pointed out the
renovation project includes reworking Bethlehem's ancient and
crumbling infrastructure _ water, sewage, electricity and phones,
to benefit the city's 24,000 residents.
	   A sign on one corner of the church states the projected
completion date is Jan. 3, 10 days after Christmas. Morkos said he
is pressing the contractor to finish by Dec. 23.
	   Standing in shirtsleeves under a bright sun, Morkos admitted the
weather has been in his favor. The rainy season is a month late.
	   ``Maybe this is a gift from God to us,'' said Morkos.

Spanish court rejects prison release for ex-minister in `dirty war'
</HEADLINE>
case &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Constitutional Court has rejected a
bid by a former cabinet minister and another ex-official to be
released from prison while they appeal their convictions in a
`dirty war' against Basque separatists, news reports said Thursday.
	   The court ruled that former Socialist government minister Jose
Barrionuevo, his former top aide, Rafael Vera, and four others
convicted in the case should remain in jail while the appeals are
heard.
	   Another four who were convicted _ former low-ranking police
officials _ will be allowed to leave jail, the private Europa Press
news agency and other media reported.
	   Barrionuevo, Interior Minister under former Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez between 1982-86, and 11 others were convicted in
July of organizing the 1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who
was mistaken for a hitman of the armed Basque separatist group ETA
and held for 10 days.
	   The abduction was the first act attributed to the self-styled
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next four years in a campaign designed to crush
ETA. Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
	   The case against Barrionuevo came after two police officers also
convicted in the case alleged that the GAL was run by Gonzalez's
government.
	   Gonzalez, who has always denied his government had anything to
do with the dirty war, is acting as a lawyer in Barrionuevo's
appeal.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain. It is
currently abiding by an unconditional ceasefire begun Sept. 18.
	   Barrionuevo, 56, and ex-secretary of state for security Vera,
53, began serving 10-year sentences on Sept. 10.
	   Last month the Supreme Court also rejected the two men's
petition to be released while their appeals are studied.

Mandela repeats insistence on two thirds majority for African
</HEADLINE>
National Congress &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Sounding on a theme for next
year's elections, President Nelson Mandela on Thursday insisted the
ruling African National Congress needs a two-thirds majority to
accomplish its goals.
	   Speaking at an annual gathering of foreign journalists, Mandela
complained that traditional white ``Mickey Mouse'' parties are
blocking the government's efforts at social transformation.
	   With sharp rhetoric, the usually reconciliatory Mandela also
lashed out at whites for dragging their feet and defending the
privileges they had during apartheid that ended with 1994's first
democratic ballot.
	   ``We are crawling out of the traditions and institutions of
apartheid (and) some opposition parties are opposing every effort
to deliver services'' to previously disadvantaged nonwhites,
Mandela said.
	   A two-thirds majority for the ANC would enable it to change the
country's new constitution.
	   It was not clear which programs have been blocked, since the ANC
has used its 60 percent vote in Parliament to push through all of
its major legislation in the past four years.
	   The opposition parties do not have enough votes to block the ANC
initiatives.
	   ``We need two thirds majority to make sure we're not interfered
with by Mickey Mouse parties,'' Mandela said.
	   Mandela is retiring next year. His likely successor is Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki.
	   The National Party which ruled during apartheid and the
Democratic Party are the leading opposition parties, and are
supported mostly by whites.
	   Mandela told the journalists he supported an initiative by the
Human Rights Commission to investigate racism in the South African
media.
	   ``We hope it will contribute to understanding the extent to
which racism plays a role in our every day lives,'' Mandela said.
	   The investigation was triggered by a cllfoblc ofsial

Turkey's Islamic party avoids confrontation over leading next

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with deputy premier suggesting Yilmaz-Ciller
coalition, picks up graf 11 pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic party
said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead
Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the
military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
	   Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-old
government Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal,
setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secular
parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
	   ``The no-confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave political
chaos,'' Yilmaz declared.
	   By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go
to the Islamic Virtue Party since it has the most seats in
Parliament. Few believe the all-powerful, staunchly secular
military would agree to that.
	   Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its
constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.
	   Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai
Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with
picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in
Parliament.
	   ``We have told the president that we will not be insistent. It's
fine if we're in the new government. It's fine if we're not,''
Kutan said.
	   Kutan said the next administration should be a caretaker
government with the support of all parties, which would lead the
country until the next national elections.
	   Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-led
government out of office last year, after it came to power in a
coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.
	   Mrs. Ciller, head of the center-right True Path Party and a key
contender for power, said after meeting with Demirel later Thursday
that she favored a strong, ``broad-based'' coalition capable of
tackling problems until the elections. She would not elaborate.
	   Bulent Ecevit, the deputy premier in the outgoing government and
leader of a center-left party, declared himself in favor of a
coalition between Yilmaz and Mrs Ciller. He also indicated that he
was willing to take part in that alliance.
	   Some reports have suggested a scenario in which Ecevit would
head a three-party alliance with Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller as the most
likely option.

Miss Israel wins Miss World Contest

<TEXT>
	   MAHE, Seychelles (AP) _ Miss Israel, a 19-year-old model called
Linor Abargil, won the new look 1998 Miss World Contest on
Thursday, held for the second year running on this tiny Indian
Ocean archipelago.
	   Abargil, who said she wants to work in the media, won the top
prize of dlrs 100,000, beating the runner-up, Miss France, a
23-year old language student called Veronique Caloc, who has
ambitions to become an interpreter and professional model.
	   Miss Malaysia, Pick Lim Lina Teoh, a 22-year-old actress and
model with plans to be a film director, was the second runner-up.
	   After 48 years, the beauty contest created by former British
serviceman Eric Morley to liven up drab, postwar England, underwent
a face-lift for this year's contest.
	   A British production company did away with the high heels and
swimsuit parade before the judges. Instead, the girls paraded in
four different sets of clothes, from casual look to smart party
dresses, and instead of talking about themselves, talked about
their friends.
	   And the company made sure that the contestants were
environmentally friendly, planting trees and taking part in a
ceremonial return of hawksbill turtle shells to the sea, the theme
of this year's contest.
	   The audience, seated in a lagoon beach, watched prerecorded film
of the girls, divided into groups of 11, swim, play volleyball, or
practice aerobics.
	   The initial 86 entrants were whittled down to 10 girls from
Israel, Peru, Chile, France, Brazil, the United States, Jamaica,
South African, Malaysia and the Czech republic.
	   The judges, who included singer Mica Paris, photographer Terry
O'Neill and Diana Hadden, last year's Miss World, said they looked
for qualities in the girls ranging from baring to inner beauty.
	   In recent years, the contest has been criticized by some for
demeaning women. Two years ago, Indian groups demonstrated against
the pageant in Bangalore, forcing Morley and his wife, Julia, to
move the swimsuit competition to Seychelles.
	   A holding company formed by the government of Seychelles, a
92-island archipelago, staged the event in hopes of bolstering its
image as a haven for snorkelers and eco-tourists.
	   The archipelago is home to the world's largest population of
giant hawksbill turtles. After the turtles were hunted to near
extinction for their shells, commercial exploitation was banned.
	   The Irish pop group Boyzone headlined Thursday's awards show,
and lead singer Ronan Keating hosted along with MTV hostess Eden.

Russians lead opening events in Cup of Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ After winning in the United States,
Canada, Germany and France, Russian figure skaters led all four
events in Moscow on Thursday, the first day of the Cup of Russia.
	   The Cup is the fifth event in the International Skating Union's
Grand Prix, which features Olympic-eligible skaters and is being
held in Moscow for the first time.
	   In Skate America and Skate Canada, the Russians had four
victories in eight events. They doubled that in Gelsenkirchen,
Germany, and added two more at the Lalique trophy competition in
France.
	   Back on their home turf, the Russians again are favorites.
	   In the first day of competition, Russians captured all three top
positions in the women's short program.
	   Irina Slutskaya, 19, the 1995 world junior champion and second
to Michelle Kwan in the 1998 World Championship, committed the same
mistake as at Skate Canada, when she two-footed a jump landing. In
Moscow on Thursday she came in second to Yelena Sokolova.
	   Sokolova, 18, finished second at Skate America and is one of a
half-dozen Russian skaters who could fight for spots for the
Russian team.
	   Julia Soldatova was in third.
	   Russian World ice dance champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov are leading in the ice dances after the compulsory
dance, the Ravensburg Waltz. They made their season debut two weeks
ago to win the Nations Cup in Gelsenkirchen.
	   Russians captured the men's event Thursday as well, with Alexei
Urmanov of Russia, the 1994 Olympic champion, leading in the short
program with the highest marks of the day. Yevgeny Plushenko was
second and Alexander Abt third. Abt had a more difficult routine
than Urmanov but missed a triple axel-triple loop slightly.
	   In the pairs short program, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia were first, followed by Dorota Zagorska and
Mariuzh Sludek of Poland.
	   Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman of the United States held third.
	   Original dance with the free program will be held on Friday.
	   Winners receive dlrs 30,000. Skaters can accumulate points from
two of the meets to qualify for the series final in St. Petersburg,
Russia, in March. The next event is NHK Trophy in Sapporo, Japan,
in December.

No. 1 again, Sampras makes tennis history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras quotes, celebrations, edits &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras has a piece of tennis
history, one more milestone to strengthen the case that he just
might be the game's finest player ever.
	   On Thursday, he became the first player to hold the No. 1
ranking for a record sixth consecutive year, a mark he feels may
never be broken.
	   ``It feels great,'' Sampras said. ``I put a lot of work into the
game. It's tough to stay on top so long. It's very satisfying, it
was well worth the sacrifice.''
	   Sampras had been tied with Jimmy Connors, who was No. 1 for five
straight years from 1974 to 1978.
	   Marcelo Rios made a perfect Thanksgiving for Sampras when he
pulled out of the ATP Tour World Championship because of a back
injury.
	   Sampras was having pasta in his hotel when he heard the news.
	   ``It's an ultimate achievement, it will probably never be
broken,'' he said. ``I'm trying to stay humble through all this,
but the record speaks for itself. It's a little overwhelming.''
	   Rios, ranked No. 2, was the only man who could have threatened
Sampras for the top ranking. Sampras entered the season-ending
championship with a 33-point lead over the Chilean in the computer
standings.
	   If Sampras wins the tournament for the fifth time, he will pull
even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the elite
event in 1991, 1994 and the last two years.
	   Having won his first two round-robin matches, Sampras was
already assured a semifinal berth before he played Karol Kucera on
Thursday.
	   A relaxed Sampras then demonstrated why he is No. 1, crushing
Kucera 6-2, 6-1 in 45 minutes. Kucera is No. 7 and beat Sampras
once in their three previous matches this year.
	   Sampras received a figure-six cake with a tennis ball inside the
circle from ATP Tour chief Mark Miles and promoter Ian Tiriac.
There was champagne for everybody, a lot of it poured over Sampras'
head and he in turn showering the impeccably dressed Miles and
Tiriac.
	   ``I'll try to stay on top for as lons as possible,'' Sampras
said.
	   Sampras' declared goal is to break Roy Emerson's record of 12
Grand Slam titles. Sampras already has 11 and at 27 years old has a
few years ahead of him on the tour.
	   He leads all active players with 56 career titles, but Connors'
record of 109 looks safe for a long time.
	   By his standards, Sampras has had a relatively modest year,
winning four tournaments. That included his fifth Wimbledon, but no
other Grand Slams.
	   When the year-end rankings are released Monday, Sampras will be
No. 1 for the 248th week, the third longest total behind Lendl
(270) and Connors (268). Sampras could pass both of them next year.
	   In the first match Thursday, Tim Henman beat Alex Corretja 7-6
(7-4), 6-7, (4-7), 6-2 to become the second player to advance to
the semifinals.
	   Corretja dropped to 1-1 but remains alive under the round-robin
format. Henman is 2-0.
	   Henman paid tribute to Sampras.
	   ``It's a phenomenal achievement,'' he said. ``It's tough for
anyone else really to comprehend. I don't think it's one that's
going to be broken for a long, long time, if ever.''
	   Greg Rusedski, an alternate, played Albert Costa, the second
alternate who is ranked No. 14 in the world, and won 7-6 (7-5),
6-1. The second Briton in the field needed 10 set points to win the
first set, but breezed through the second.
	   Rusedski replaced Andre Agassi, who dropped out late Wednesday,
also because of a back injury.
	   The dlrs 3.5 million tournament brings together players with the
best results over the year. But with Patrick Rafter and Richard
Krajicek both pulling out before the event because of injuries and
Agassi and Rios withdrawing, four of the best players are missing.
	   Rios had to do better than Sampras in the tournament to have a
shot at dethroning him. But Sampras scored quick and impressive
victories in his opening matches.
	   Rios had already dented his hopes of overtaking Sampras by
losing his first match, to Henman.
	   ``When I tried to practice this morning, it was really sore,''
Rios said. ``It made no sense to go out on the court and play two
games. I am disappointed but that's the way it goes.''
	   On Friday, Yevgeny Kafelnikov will play Carlos Moya for a place
in the semifinals.
	   Also, Rusedski faces Henman and Costa meets Corretja in matches
determining the other two semifinalists. With Henman already
through, Corretja and Rusedski are still in the running. Corretja
will advance if Rusedski loses to Henman.

Iraqi dissidents urge U.S. to stop backing Iraqi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A group of Iraqi dissidents urged the United
States Thursday to let the Iraqi people choose their own opposition
leader in their quest to topple Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraqi opposition groups said Wednesday that the United States
had nominated Adnan al-Pachachi, a former foreign minister, to
forge a united Iraqi opposition movement that would try to topple
Saddam.
	   The Clinton Administration has ``to let the Iraqi people
themselves choose their national opposition leader,'' said a group
of 85 London-based independent dissidents in a statement faxed to
The Associated Press office in Cairo.
	   The dissidents are mostly professionals and academics who are
not linked to any Iraqi opposition group.
	   They said the United States should help the Iraqi people in
their efforts to overthrow Saddam but to let the Iraqis choose the
way to go about it.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk proposed
al-Pachachi's name during his meeting with 16 Iraqi opposition
leaders in London on Tuesday, according to some of the participants

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A group of Iraqi dissidents urged the United
States Thursday to let the Iraqi people choose their own opposition
leader in their quest to topple Saddam Hussein.
	   Iraqi opposition groups said Wednesday that the United States
had nominated Adnan al-Pachachi, a former foreign minister, to
forge a united Iraqi opposition movement that would try to topple
Saddam.
	   The Clinton Administration has ``to let the Iraqi people
themselves choose their national opposition leader,'' said a group
of 85 London-based independent dissidents in a statement faxed to
The Associated Press office in Cairo.
	   The dissidents are mostly professionals and academics who are
not linked to any Iraqi opposition group.
	   They said the United States should help the Iraqi people in
their efforts to overthrow Saddam but to let the Iraqis choose the
way to go about it.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk proposed
al-Pachachi's name during his meeting with 16 Iraqi opposition
leaders in London on Tuesday, according to some of the participants
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   U.S. officials, also requesting anonymity, would not confirm the
report.
	   The U.S. Congress has allocated dlrs 97 million aid for Iraqi

	   MAHE, Seychelles (AP) _ Miss Israel, a 19-year-old model called
Linor Abargil, won the new look 1998 Miss World Contest on
Thursday, held for the second year running on this tiny Indian
Ocean archipelago.
	   Abargil, who said she wants to work in the media, won the top
prize of dlrs 100,000, beating the runner-up, Miss France, a
23-year old language student called Veronique Caloc, who has
ambitions to become an interpreter and professional model.
	   Miss Malaysia, Pick Lim Lina Teoh, a 22-year-old actress and
model with plans to be a film director, was the second runner-up.
	   After 48 years, the beauty contest created by former British
serviceman Eric Morley to liven up drab, postwar England, underwent
a face-lift for this year's contest.
	   A British production company did away with the high heels and
swimsuit parade before the judges. Instead, the girls paraded in
four different sets of clothes, from casual look to smart party
dresses, and instead of talking about themselves, talked about
their friends.
	   And the company made sure that the contestants were
environmentally friendly, planting trees and taking part in a
ceremonial return of hawksbill turtle shells to the sea, the theme
of this year's contest.
	   The audience, seated in a lagoon beach, watched prerecorded film
of the girls, divided into groups of 11, swim, play volleyball, or
practice aerobics.
	   The initial 86 entrants were whittled down to 10 girls from
Israel, Peru, Chile, France, Brazil, the United States, Jamaica,
South African, Malaysia and the Czech republic.
	   The judges, who included singer Mica Paris, photographer Terry
O'Neill and Diana Hadden, last year's Miss World, said they looked
for qualities in the girls ranging from baring to inner beauty.
	   In recent years, the contest has been criticized by some for
demeaning women. Two years ago, Indian groups demonstrated against
the pageant in Bangalore, forcing Morley and his wife, Julia, to
move the swimsuit competition to Seychelles.
	   A holding company formed by the government of Seychelles, a
92-island archipelago, staged the event in hopes of bolstering its
image as a haven for snorkelers and eco-tourists.
	   The archipelago is home to the world's largest population of
giant hawksbill turtles. After the turtles were hunted to near
extinction for their shells, commercial exploitation was banned.
	   The Irish pop group Boyzone headlined Thursday's awards show,
and lead singer Ronan Keating hosted along with MTV hostess Eden.

Researchers identify 142 million-year-old flowering plant fossil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS grafs 16, 18 to CORRECT spelling of Dilcher &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers believe they have discovered
fossil evidence of the world's oldest flower, at 142 million years:
a spindly twig with peapod-shaped fruit and a woody stem that looks
nothing like a rose, an apple blossom or a daisy.
	   The fossil is from an early evolutionary stage when plants were
just developing the flowering system that later evolved into fruit,
grain, brilliantly colored and fragrant flowers and food for many
animals, said David Dilcher, a University of Florida biology
professor.
	   ``It would have been a very different world if early flowering
plants like this one had not been successful,'' said Dilcher,
co-author of a study in Friday's edition of the journal Science.
``There would have been no apples, no Wheaties in the morning, no
corn on the cob, no potatoes, no rice or other grains.''
	   All of the common plant food sources came into existence after
plants evolved the ability to make flowers that attracted insects
and other pollinators and then grew into fruit.
	   The flowering plant fossil was found in a rock formation of
limestone and volcanic ash layers in China, near the town of
Beipiao, about 250 miles northeast of Beijing. The rock beds were
once on the bottom of a lake that periodically was showered with
volcanic ash, Dilcher said.
	   Plants and animals that sank to the lake bottom became covered
with sediment and turned into fossils. Villagers digging in the
fossil beds have unearthed dinosaurs, insects, birds and plants
from millions of years ago, but this is the first time a flowering
plant has been uncovered.
	   The discovery has been age-dated at 142 million years by Chinese
scientists, Dilcher said. The oldest previously known flowering
plant was about 130 million years old. Chinese researchers,
including the researcher who found the fossil, asked Dilcher to
analyze it.
	   The ancient plant lacks the petals and shape that most people
associate with flowers.
	   ``It doesn't have any beautiful or showy flowers, but it is a
flowering plant because it has fruit that enclose seeds,'' said
Dilcher.
	   Botanists hailed the discovery as an important advance in
understanding how plants evolved.
	   ``To the world of botany, it's a discovery of the same scale as
understanding the details of why the dinosaurs became extinct,''
said William L. Crepet, a Cornell University professor.
	   The plant specimen is about three inches (7.6 centimeters) long,
with two parts that appear to be joined branches. Along the
branches are what appear to be paired leaves. But Dilcher said the
whole thing, branches and leaves, is actually a flower. That is
because some of the leaves are closed, like peapods, and contain
seeds. The peapods are considered the fruit of the flower, he said.
	   Indeed, the plant ``may have been the first evolutionary
experiment in enclosing seeds and trying to attract pollinators,''
Dilcher said.
	   Plants first developed seeds some 350 million years ago.
Developing flowers and attracting insect pollinators was the next
great leap in plant evolution, and eventually in animal evolution,
he said.
	   Plants, in effect, evolved ways to enlist the cooperation of
animals to reproduce. They developed ways to attract pollinators,
such as bees. They developed ways to have seeds transported by
making fruit, such as apples, that were eaten by animals who then
dropped the seeds elsewhere.
	   ``Flowering plants were the first advertisers in the world,''
said Dilcher. ``They managed to gain the cooperation of animals by
learning to say `Hey, I smell good. I've got a reward for you. Come
and visit me.'''
	   Plants reached the stage of having bright blossoms, sweet
fragrance and flowing nectar about 55 million years ago, some 90
million years after the Chinese flower fossil.
	   ``These changes all came in progressive steps,'' said Dilcher.
``They helped flowering plants become the most successful of all of
the plants.''

Commission to examine restitution to Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An independent group of historians
investigating Austria's options for compensating victims of both
Nazi looting and unjust post-WWII restitution laws requested access
to all state and private archives at its first session Thursday.
	   The Austria Press Agency reported the six-member group, known as
the History Commission, held its first meeting in the capital to
begin hammering out a proposal of what it aims to accomplish in the
next three months.
	   The commission is the first of its kind in Austria and was set
up by the government this fall in the face of threatened lawsuits
by U.S. attorney Ed Fagan. Fagan represents the families of
victims, and the commission's overall purpose is to lay ground
rules for the compensation of survivors and victims' families whose
money, art and other valuables were looted by the Nazis as well as
the immediate postwar government.
	   One of the commission's first acts was to request that all
relevant archives be opened to them, APA reported.
	   The commission wants access to Austria's national archives, as
well as social security, state and municipal records. It also hopes
that all political parties and private companies will make relevant
documents available.
	   Creditanstalt, a leading Austrian bank, refused American and
British historians access to its files in September when they were
investigating Jewish gold looted by the Nazis.
	   Austria was annexed by the Nazis in March 1938, but for decades
after the war it cultivated an image of itself as the first victim
of Nazi aggression. Not until 1991 did an Austrian leader,
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, publicly acknowledged that ``not a
few'' Austrians participated in wartime atrocities.
	   Austria's first postwar government also effectively confiscated
hundreds of paintings from Jewish owners and their heirs, using a
1923 law preventing the export of artworks. The government allowed
some Jews to reclaim their artworks and take them out of the
country, but forced them to ``donate'' many others in exchange.
	   President of the commission is Clemens Jabloner, Director
General of the National Archives and another high-profile member is
Israeli historian Avraham Barkai.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International efforts at finding a
peace formula for Kosovo moved slowly forward Thursday, stymied by
Serbia's defiant attempts to impose its own plan.
	   A European Union envoy paid a surprise visit to a mass grave
site while on a mission to promote efforts to efforts for peace in
the troubled Serb province.
	   Envoy Wolfgang Petritsch met with ethnic Albanian negotiators
and representatives of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Petritsch also visited a suspected mass grave site in central
Kosovo, accompanied by the leader of a EU team of forensic experts
that intends to examine six such sites around the province.
	   Helena Ranta, who heads the 20-member, all-Finnish group, said
Yugoslav authorities granted permission Thursday for full
investigations of the six sites, in addition to any other reported
of mass grave sites. The report could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Suspected mass grave sites were discovered in October, but
Yugoslav authorities have previously refused to allow international
human rights experts to examine them.
	   Kosovo has been in turmoil since Serbs launched a crackdown last
February to crush a separatist rebellion. The clashes left some
300,000 people homeless and claimed the lives of hundreds of
others.
	   After meeting Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on
Thursday, Petritsch said the situation on the ground remains
``very, very critical,'' due to the cold Kosovo winter. He said the
EU is seeking ``long-term arrangements to improve both humanitarian
and economic conditions.''
	   Petritsch also handed Rugova a list of abducted Kosovo Serbs
provided by a Serbian opposition party from Belgrade. Rugova
promised to look into it.
	   Petritsch's visit came amid renewed arguments over an
American-proposed plan for the region, that the Serbs have refused
and countered with their own version. The Albanians, in turn, have
refused the Serb plan.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant of the two
republics in Yugoslavia. Most of the province's ethnic Albanians,
who make up 90 percent of the population, want independence but
Serbia rejects the idea.
	   Meanwhile, in neighboring Macedonia, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said Thursday that two new NATO missions would make
verifying that compliance and protecting its monitors much easier.
	   Solana said the new Macedonian government had given the green
light for NATO to base its 1,800-man French-led ``extraction
force'' at the Macedonian military base in Kumanovo, just south of
the Kosovo border.
	   The mission of that force will be to rescue any of the 2,000
unarmed civilian peace ``verifiers'' now being dispatched to
Kosovo.
	   Personnel are just beginning to arrive for the Kosovo
Verification Mission, as it is called. Significant numbers are
expected to be operational by mid-January.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission will review any
merger between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. to see if violates the
European Union's antitrust laws, a EU official said Thursday.
	   ``The companies haven't notified us yet, but it is clear that a
deal of this size would prompt an inquiry,'' said the official.
	   The Financial Times said Thursday the two companies were
contemplating a merger and that an announcement could come next
week. The companies have declined to comment.
	   The EU official, who asked not to be named, said any
investigation would focus on the different market segments each
company operates in separately.
	   ``We would look at each market separately,'' he said.
	   Under EU law, companies doing business in the EU must abide by
EU antitrust legislation. If the European Commission finds a merger
results in an an unfair advantage it may disallow the merger or
order changes in the venture.
	   An Exxon-Mobil merger would result in a company with a market
capitalization of dlrs 237 billion.
	   Exxon is the world's second-largest energy company after the
Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. Mobil is the second-largest U.S.
oil and gas group after Exxon and the fourth-largest in the world.

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swissair MD-11 en route to Zurich
returned to Singapore Thursday after a strong smell was detected in
the jetliner's cockpit, a spokeswoman for the airline said.
	   Flight SR189 landed safely, having turned back 41 minutes after
takeoff, Swissair spokeswoman Beatrice Tschanz said on Swiss
television.
	   Its passengers will travel to Zurich on another flight Friday,
she added.
	   An electrical problem was behind the incident but further
information was unavailable, Tschanz said.
	   The jet, which had undergone a check Nov. 12, is being examined
by Swissair technicians.
	   All 229 people on board were killed when a Swissair MD-11 bound
from New York to Geneva crashed off Nova Scotia Sept. 2.
	   Sixteen minutes before the crash, the pilots detected smoke in
the cockpit. The cause of the crash has yet to be determined.

cried, more background. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's former dictator broke into tears
upon learning he faces the threat of extradition to Spain on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism, Spanish newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Gen. Augusto Pinochet was read the news Wednesday _ his 83rd
birthday _ at the London hospital where he is under police guard,
minutes before Britain's highest court upheld his detention and
ruled he did not have immunity from prosecution.
	   The man allegedly responsible for killing and torturing
thousands during his 13-year rule, put his head in his hands and
sobbed, leading daily El Pais reported, citing unidentified sources
close to the case.
	   But Jose Luis Morales, an official at the Chilean Embassy in
London, was quoted by the Santiago afternoon daily La Hora as
denying that Pinochet cried.
	   Morales told the newspaper hat he broke the news to Pinochet and
that ``he reacted with disappointment but with calm.''
	   El Pais said a British woman official had read the ruling to
Pinochet. Two other Spanish papers also reported that Pinochet had
cried.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw asked to extend by one week
the original Wednesday deadline to decide whether to allow
extradition proceedings to continue, his office announced Thursday.
	   Pinochet is due to appear Wednesday at a London court, required
of all facing extradition.
	   Spanish jurists believe that a final decision on extradition
could take a year. In the meantime, Judge Baltasar Garzon, who
instigated the case, may travel to London to question the former
dictator.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,000 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
dictatorship, which began in 1973 when he overthrew Salvador
Allende, an elected Marxist. Allende died in the coup.
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza will head a
delegation this week to press Britain to release Pinochet, who was
arrested Oct. 16 in London.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei complained that the affair
violates Chile's sovereignty, and endangers the country's fragile
transition to democracy, which began when Pinochet stepped down in
1990.
	   News of the ruling was greeted with anger by Pinochet's
supporters in Chile who attacked journalists in Santiago. The
Pinochet Foundation said it lamented the mistreatment of
journalists at its headquarters in Santiago.
	   But the threat of extradition to Spain has convinced Pinochet's
opponents at home that a trial could be possible _ even in his
native Chile.
	   ``The trial of Pinochet in Chile is no longer a shot into the
air or a mad dream,'' Chilean lawyer Eduardo Contreras told
reporters in Madrid.
	   In January, Contreras helped file a suit in Chile against
Pinochet for mass murder, kidnapping and illegal burying of bodies.
Until recently the case was thought doomed.
	   ``With time the impact of the (British) lords' decision on
Chilean public opinion could lead the (Chilean) courts to strip
Pinochet of his immunity and allow him to be tried,'' he said.
	   Contreras says that Pinochet has been irreparably damaged _ even
if Britain lets him return home.
	   ``He would go back as human trash, as a broken general, as a
general who cries,'' the lawyer said.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission would review
any merger between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. to see if it
violates the European Union's antitrust laws, an EU official said
Thursday.
	   ``It is clear that a deal of this size would prompt an
inquiry,'' the official said, adding that the companies have not
contacted the EU.
	   The Financial Times reported Thursday that the two companies are
contemplating a merger and that an announcement could come next
week. The companies have declined to comment.
	   The EU official, who asked not to be named, said any
investigation would focus on the different market segments each
company operates in separately.
	   Under EU law, companies doing business in the EU must abide by
EU antitrust legislation. If the European Commission finds a merger
results in an unfair advantage it may disallow the merger or order
changes in the venture.
	   An Exxon-Mobil merger would result in a company with a market
capitalization of dlrs 237 billion.
	   Exxon is the world's second-largest energy company after the
Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. Mobil is the second-largest U.S.
oil and gas group after Exxon and the fourth-largest in the world.
	   A merger between Exxon and Mobil would likely surpass the merger
announced this summer between British Petroleum and Amoco Corp.,
the largest industrial deal in history.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ They were celebrating into the small hours of
Friday morning in the Israeli coastal resort of Netanya at the home
of the new Miss World, Linor Abargel.
	   A constant stream of friends called at the home of Linor's
parents Jackie and Aliza Abargel, to congratulate them.
	   The 18 year-old brown-eyed brunette high school graduate was
crowned Thursday night at the Miss World contest in the Seychelles
Islands.
	   Jackie Abargel, told Israel radio he was taken completely by
surprise when he heard the news and jumped up and down for joy.
	   ``I will welcome her with flowers and kisses,'' the excited
father said. ``She is a credit to her family, to Netanya and to
Israel.''
	   Jackie, manager of the local facilities of the Soldiers Welfare
Committee, was born 45 years ago in Morocco. Aliza, who is deputy
principal of a junior high school, is from a family of immigrants
from Libya. ``I guess it was the ethnic mixture that made Limor so
beautiful,'' Jackie said.
	   The new Miss World is about to begin 20 months of compulsory
military service.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Officials from five Central
American countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch estimate it will
cost them dlrs 4 billion to rebuild.
	   ``This amount will be proposed to the international financial
community that is willing to help in the area's reconstruction,''
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein said Wednesday night
after an eight-hour meeting of ministers from Honduras, Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica.
	   The presidents of the Central American nations will travel to
Washington on Dec. 9-11 to meet with representatives of the
Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank.
	   Meanwhile, Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American
Development Bank, announced Thursday a dlrs 48.6 million loan to
help Nicaragua modernize and maintain its hospitals.
	   ``We feel more obligated than ever to help,'' Iglesias told
reporters.
	   Officials say more than 10,000 people were killed in the five
countries. About 19,000 are still missing and almost 3 million were
left homeless from last month's storm.

Battle over taxes in Mexico's budget threatens presidency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to RAISE gas price increase to 31 percent
sted 15 percent. Minor editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A 31 percent increase in gasoline prices. A
15 percent tax on phone calls. An extra 2 percent on the sales tax.
And a dlrs 55 billion bank bailout that most Mexicans see as
benefiting wealthy bankers.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo's 1999 budget proposal sounds like an
invitation to political suicide. Some analysts say it could cost
his ruling party its 69-year-old grip on power in the 2000
elections.
	   ``It could lead to a political crisis of grave consequences,''
said Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst at the prestigious Colegio
de Mexico.
	   The spending plan is the first ever by a Mexican president to
have so many critics: business leaders, economists, the Roman
Catholic Church, even lawmakers from Zedillo's own Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
	   Mexico's Congress has until Dec. 15 to approve or reject the
plan. It also could pass a modified version, which the president
would not have the authority to veto.
	   Under Zedillo's spending plan, the price of regular unleaded
gasoline would rise from the equivalent of dlrs 1.39 a gallon
(about four liters) to dlrs 1.82 a gallon over a year, an increase
of 31 percent.
	   The budget also introduces a 15 percent tax on phone services
and lets states add 2 percent on top of an existing 15 percent
federal sales tax.
	   And it includes the dlrs 55 billion bank bailout, which most
Mexicans see as rewarding corrupt bankers and politicians.
	   ``Mexicans are being made to pay for what others have
pocketed,'' said congressman Luis Patino of the opposition Labor
Party.
	   Zedillo says the new taxes are needed to help pay for the bank
bailout and to make up for lost oil revenues. The worldwide drop in
oil prices has cost Mexico, an oil exporter, billions of dollars.
	   Few _ at least publicly _ agree. Several business groups have
dropped their support. Among them, the Entrepreneurial Coordinating
Council and the Mexican Employers' Confederation called the
proposed budget an affront.
	   Dissent also is growing within the ruling party, known as the
PRI.
	   Mexican labor unions, long controlled by the PRI, are demanding
a 22 percent raise in the minimum wage, currently about dlrs 3 a
day. The government has offered only 13 percent.
	   ``The 13 percent increase has already been eaten away by the 15
percent gasoline hike and other increases. Even 22 percent would
not be enough to restore purchasing power,'' one PRI congressman,
Efren Enriques, said.
	   In its current issue, the weekly Milenio magazine interviewed 50
clergymen from throughout the country, all of whom harshly
criticized the government's economic policy.
	   ``It seems the authorities are suffering from blindness. It is
evident they do not see or feel the people's suffering, and they
don't want to,'' Archbishop Bartolome Carrasco said.
	   Mexico's two main rebel groups are hoping that the discontent
will translate into more support for them. Subcomandante Marcos,
leader of the Zapatista rebels in southern Chiapas state, denounced
Zedillo's budget on Sunday.
	   In a statement late Wednesday, the Popular Revolutionary Army
accused the government of ``killing people with bullets of hunger
and misery'' and urged people to join the rebels' ranks.
	   Zedillo also faces a potential minefield in his proposal for the
government to absorb most of the dlrs 55 billion that banks lost in
bad loans in Mexico's 1995 economic crisis.
	   Opposition leaders say the bailout absorbs loans from wealthy
businessmen who have made multimillion-dollar contributions to the
PRI's 1994 election campaign.
	   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, chairman of the Democratic
Revolution Party, challenged Zedillo last week to deny that he
received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Carlos
Cabal Peniche, a fugitive banker recently arrested in Australia.
	   The allegations are being investigated by the Federal Electoral
Institute, Mexico's top election authority.
	   ``The issue of Zedillo's campaign spending looms on the
horizon,'' analyst Aguayo said. ``An investigation could lead to a
political scandal linking political corruption with the economic
crisis.''

Commission to examine restitution to Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An independent group of historians
investigating Austria's options for compensating victims of both
Nazi looting and unjust post-WWII restitution laws requested access
to all state and private archives at its first session Thursday.
	   The Austria Press Agency reported the six-member group, known as
the History Commission, held its first meeting in the capital to
begin hammering out a proposal of what it aims to accomplish in the
next three months.
	   The commission is the first of its kind in Austria and was set
up by the government this fall in the face of threatened lawsuits
by U.S. attorney Ed Fagan. Fagan represents the families of
victims, and the commission's overall purpose is to lay ground
rules for the compensation of survivors and victims' families whose
money, art and other valuables were looted by the Nazis as well as
the immediate postwar government.
	   One of the commission's first acts was to request that all
relevant archives be opened to them, APA reported.
	   The commission wants access to Austria's national archives, as
well as social security, state and municipal records. It also hopes
that all political parties and private companies will make relevant
documents available.
	   Creditanstalt, a leading Austrian bank, refused American and
British historians access to its files in September when they were
investigating Jewish gold looted by the Nazis.
	   Austria was annexed by the Nazis in March 1938, but for decades
after the war it cultivated an image of itself as the first victim
of Nazi aggression. Not until 1991 did an Austrian leader,
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, publicly acknowledged that ``not a
few'' Austrians participated in wartime atrocities.
	   Austria's first postwar government also effectively confiscated
hundreds of paintings from Jewish owners and their heirs, using a
1923 law preventing the export of artworks. The government allowed
some Jews to reclaim their artworks and take them out of the
country, but forced them to ``donate'' many others in exchange.
	   President of the commission is Clemens Jabloner, Director
General of the National Archives and another high-profile member is
Israeli historian Avraham Barkai.

Mandela repeats insistence on two thirds majority for African
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO CORRECT GARBLE &QL; 
National Congress &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Echoing a theme for next
year's elections, President Nelson Mandela on Thursday insisted the
ruling African National Congress needs a two-thirds majority to
accomplish its programs.
	   Mandela spoke at an annual gathering of foreign journalists and
chided traditional white ``Mickey Mouse'' parties for blocking the
government's efforts at social transformation.
	   With sharp rhetoric, the usually reconciliatory Mandela also
lashed out at whites for dragging their feet and defending the
privileges they had during apartheid that ended with 1994's first
democratic ballot.
	   ``We are crawling out of the traditions and institutions of
apartheid (and) some opposition parties are opposing every effort
to deliver services'' to previously disadvantaged nonwhites,
Mandela said.
	   A two-thirds majority for the ANC in next year's elections would
enable it to change the country's new constitution, Mandela and
other officials have said.
	   It was not clear which blocked programs Mandela was referring
to, since the ANC has used its 60 percent vote in Parliament to
push through its major legislation in the past four years.
	   The opposition parties do not have enough votes to block the ANC
initiatives.
	   ``We need two thirds majority to make sure we're not interfered
with by Mickey Mouse parties,'' Mandela said.
	   Mandela is retiring next year after his first term as president.
His likely successor is Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
	   The National Party that ruled during apartheid and the
Democratic Party are the most vocal opposition parties and have
mainly white supporters.
	   Mandela told the journalists he supported an initiative by the
Human Rights Commission to investigate racism in the South African
Media.
	   The probe was triggered by a call from two black professional
groups who objected to reporting on government corruption by the
weekly Mail and Guardian and another paper. The groups said the
articles were racist because black officials were investigated for
alleged corruption.
	   By coincidence, the Foreign Correspondent's Association awarded
two Mail and Guardian reporters _ Wally Mbhele and Mungo Soggatt _
for their investigative work.
	   Mandela presented the awards to the reporters.

scandal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories (AP) _ The head of the
government in Canada's vast and sparsely populated Northwest
Territories resigned Thursday after an inquiry determined he
violated conflict of interest guidelines seven times.
	   Don Morin, who had led the territorial government since 1995,
stepped down as premier at the request of his Cabinet colleagues.
	   Most of the seven violations cited by conflict of interest
commissioner Anne Crawford relate to property deals in which Morin
or his wife were involved.
	   ``The trust of the people had been betrayed to the point where
the seat should be declared vacant,'' Crawford wrote.
	   In all the deals, Crawford found Morin failed to excuse himself
from government discussions concerning property he owned or
business people he dealt with. He guided the government toward
decisions that benefited him, Crawford said.
	   Morin has began a court action to request a judicial review of
the report.
	   The territorial legislature does not have political parties.
Members govern by consensus, and choose the premier from among
themselves.

Iraqi dissidents dispute claim of attempt on Saddam's deputy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi opposition group on Thursday
disputed government reports of an attempt to assassinate Saddam
Hussein's deputy.
	   Baghdad ``falsified'' the reports to ``increase repression'' on
Shiite Muslims in southern and central Iraq, according to a
statement by the London-based Iraqi National Congress.
	   The statement was also read over the Iraqi Broadcasting Corp., a
radio station that operates in northern Iraq and is affiliated to
INC, an umbrella of several Iraqi opposition groups.
	   The Iraqi government had no immediate reaction.
	   State-run Baghdad television reported Monday that assailants
threw two grenades at Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy as he got out
of his car Sunday in the central Shiite holy city of Karbala to
attend a religious ceremony. He was not injured.
	   ``The (Iraqi) regime falsified this attack in order to increase
repression of the Shiite people in central and southern Iraq,''
said the INC statement that was faxed to The Associated Press
office in Cairo.
	   Baghdad television said several bodyguards and bystanders were
wounded in the assassination attempt.
	   The INC statement said that on the day of the alleged attack,
Ibrahim, who is also deputy commander of the Iraqi armed forces,
was leading troops from the elite Republican Guard, the Emergency
Units and Saddam's Fedayeen, as part of the ``national campaign to
capture (army) deserters.''
	   Saddam's Fedayeen is a paramilitary force of 40,000 run by
Saddam's eldest son, Odai. The Emergency Units is part of the Iraqi
army, specialized in combating riots, rebellions and other
disturbances.
	   Clashes broke out between Ibrahim's forces and the Shiites as
arrests were being made, and a number of soldiers were killed, said
the INC statement. ``But there was no attempt against Izzat Ibrahim
personally.''
	   It said the assassination attempt was falsified to justify the
``mass arrests of young people in the town'' and the ensued clashes
between Ibrahim's forces and the people of Karbala.
	   It said the campaign to capture army deserters was launched on
Nov. 7 in several Iraqi towns in the southern marshes where
thousands of deserters and Shiite rebels take refuge and carry out
hit-and-run attacks against government forces.

	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Miss Israel, an 18-year-old student
called Linor Abargil, won the 1998 Miss World contest on Thursday,
held for the second year running on this tiny Indian Ocean
archipelago.
	   Abargil, who said she wanted to work as a lawyer after finishing
her studies, won the top prize of dlrs 100,000, beating the
runner-up, Miss France, a 23-year old language student called
Veronique Caloc, who has ambitions to become an interpreter and
professional model.
	   Abargil smiled and waved at the cheering crowd after she was
announced Miss World by competition creator Eric Morley, and hugged
her fellow contestants.
	   ''I hope my dream will come true,'' Abergil, who has brown hair
and eyes and is 1.76 meters (5 feet 8 ins) tall, said before she
was crowned.
	   Miss Malaysia, Pick Lim Lina Teoh, a 22-year-old actress and
model with plans to be a film director, was the second runner-up.
	   The new Miss World is due to begin 20 months of compulsory
military service in April 1999, but her father, Jackie Abargil,
told The Associated Press that he hopes the army will postpone her
induction to enable her to fulfill the yearlong duties of Miss
World.
	   After 48 years, the beauty contest created by former British
serviceman Morley to liven up drab, postwar England, underwent a
face-lift for this year's contest, which was televised in 130
countries.
	   A British production company did away with the high heels and
swimsuit parade before the judges. Instead, the women paraded in
different sets of clothes, from a casual look to smart party
dresses, and instead of talking about themselves, talked about
friends and future careers.
	   And the company made sure that the contestants were
environmentally friendly, planting trees and taking part in a
ceremonial return of hawksbill turtle shells to the sea, the theme
of this year's contest.
	   The audience, seated in a lagoon beach, watched prerecorded film
of the contestants, divided into groups of 11, swim, play
volleyball, or practice aerobics.
	   The initial 86 entrants were whittled down to 10 women from
Israel, Peru, Chile, France, Brazil, the United States, Jamaica,
South African, Malaysia and the Czech republic.
	   Mystery still surrounds the whereabouts of Miss Honduras, who
may have been caught up in the turmoil of Hurricane Mitch.
	   The judges, who included singer Mica Paris, photographer Terry
O'Neill and Diana Hadden, last year's Miss World, said they looked
for qualities ranging from bearing to inner beauty.
	   ``Outer beauty can fade, but inner beauty will last for life,''
said New Zealand All Black rugby star Jonah Lomu, one of the
judges. Among the other judges were Formula 1 racing driver Jacques
Villeneuve; model Christelle de St. Augustin; and Venezuela's 1981
Miss World Pilin Leon. Each judge had 2 1/2 minutes with each
candidate.
	   The Irish pop group Boyzone headlined Thursday's awards show,
and lead singer Ronan Keating hosted along with MTV hostess Eden.
Former Hot Chocolate singer Errol Brown opened the show with his
hit ``You Sexy Thing.''
	   In recent years, the contest has been criticized by some for
demeaning women. Two years ago, Indian groups demonstrated against
the pageant in Bangalore, forcing Morley and his wife, Julia, to
move the swimsuit competition to Seychelles.
	   Controversy came to the contest this year with Croatia's entry,
Lejla Sehovic, a business administration student stripped of her
title by her country's Miss World franchise holder because she is a
Muslim. Muslims are a minority among Croatia's 4.7 million people.
	   Judges voted a second time and awarded the crown to a Roman
Catholic, Ivana Petkovic. But protests were so great, the crown was
returned to Sehovic, with the proviso that Petkovic would represent
Croatia next year.
	   A holding company formed by the government of Seychelles, a
92-island archipelago, staged the event in hopes of bolstering its
image as a haven for snorkelers and eco-tourists.

Presidential candidate refuses to quit race to avoid victory by
</HEADLINE>
former coup leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The presidential candidate of
Venezuela's social democratic party refused to quit the race
Thursday despite being warned by party leaders that his candidacy
could assure victory by a former coup leader now leading the polls.
	   Leaders of the center-left Democratic Action Party voted
overwhelmingly late Wednesday to urge their candidate, 77-year-old
Luis Alfaro, to get out of the race. His presence, they said, could
divide the votes against former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, the
front-runner in the Dec. 6 presidential vote.
	   ``I will stay in the fight until the end,'' Alfaro told
supporters in the eastern state of Anzoategui.
	   Chavez opponents have been meeting for more than a week to come
up with strategies to prevent his victory and persuade trailing
contenders to renounce their candidacies. But those efforts have
been largely unsuccessful because of divisions in the anti-Chavez
camp.
	   Chavez, 44, led an unsuccessful coup attempt against the
government in 1992. He leads his closest rival, former state
governor Henrique Salas Romer, by around 10 percentage points in
most opinion polls.
	   Alfaro has about seven percent support. Many strategists believe
his votes could go to Salas if he agreed to bow out.
	   Chavez's candidacy has polarized Venezuela between the poor who
have been galvanized by his anti-establishment, anti-corruption
platform and the rich who fear he will install a leftist
dictatorship.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A huge volcano near Mexico City continued to
spew steam and lava, sprinkling nearby towns with ash.
	   Thursday morning's plume was two miles (three kilometers) high,
according to the National Center for Disaster Prevention.
	   Morelos state's civil protection director, Anselmo Sotelo Parra,
told the government news agency Notimex that the ash did not
represent any danger to residents.
	   The 18,000-foot (5,490-meter) Popocatepetl Volcano, 50 miles (80
kilometers) southeast of Mexico City, has been belching ash and
steam all week. Officials have said the ash is blowing over
sparsely populated areas.
	   About 300,000 people live on the mountain's slope and another 15
million live within 50 miles of it. The volcano has been active
since 1994, regularly emitting gas and steam.
	   Meanwhile, authorities kept a close eye on the western Colima
Volcano, which has been oozing lava and expelling bursts of ash
into the air. The eruptions continued Thursday.
	   Civil defense authorities said the relatively minor activity
represented no danger for surrounding towns.
	    &UR; ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Authorities in the southern state of Chiapas
detained 143 illegal immigrants from Central America in the border
town of Tapachula on Thursday, the government news agency reported.
	   State police commander Guillermo Cruz Ramirez told Notimex that
the immigrants were detained at a train station. He did not say if
the Central Americans were refugees from Hurricane Mitch.
	   The illegal immigrants were turned over to immigration
authorities for deportation.
	    &UR; ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican federal police discovered 4.3 tons
(3.9 metric tons) of marijuana hidden in a cargo truck Thursday in
the northwestern state of Sinaloa.
	   During a routine inspection, agents found 2,300 packages of
marijuana hidden in more than 300 boxes marked with a detergent
brand logo, the federal attorney general's office said in a
statement.
	   The truck driver, Jose Neftali Hernandez Ruiz, and a passenger,
Luis Ricardo Hernandez Ruiz, were arrested.
	    &UR; ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ To ease Brazil's crowded prisons,
the government is allowing judges to sentence some nonviolent
criminals to community service or fines instead of jail time.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed a bill late Wednesday
allowing alternative sentences for criminals facing less than four
years in prison.
	   These include community service, payment to the victim and
signing over their assets, Justice Ministry spokesman Wailler Diniz
said. An estimated 20,000 people awaiting sentence in Brazil could
qualify.
	   The bill will affect criminals like tax evaders and purse
snatchers. Until now, alternative punishments have been available
only for people sentenced to a year or less in prison.
	   About 170,000 prisoners are crammed into Brazil's prisons, built
to hold less than half that number.
	   The overcrowding frequently sparks riots. Last year there were
195 riots in jails and lockups reported in Sao Paulo state alone.
	    &UR; ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Canadian kidnapper said she
wants to have children and go back to college after spending nine
years in a Brazilian prison, the O Folha De Sao Paulo newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Christine Lamont, 39, and partner David Spencer, 35, last Friday
left Brazil and were imprisoned in British Columbia after returning
home under a prison transfer agreement.
	   Both were convicted of the 1989 kidnapping of Brazilian
supermarket magnate Abilio Diniz. They can apply for parole Dec. 28
after serving a third of their sentence.
	   ``I want to rebuild my life with David and have children,''
Lamont told the newspaper.
	   The couple have become a cause celebre in Canada after claiming
they were routinely tortured in prison _ allegations that prison
authorities denied.
	   They were part of a gang who kidnapped Diniz to funnel a dlrs 30
million ransom to guerillas in El Salvador. He was released after
six days and no ransom was paid.

Maradona attacks journalists before departure to Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona kicked and punched
journalists who were trying to interview him at the airport
Thursday prior to his departure to Italy.
	   Maradona and his wife Claudia Villafane arrived at Ezeiza
airport outside the Argentine capital, and were immediately
surrounded by journalists and autograph seekers.
	   ``I'm not talking,'' Maradona harshly told reporters. When the
crowd pressed around him, the former football star lashed out with
punches and kicks, at least one of which caught a TV reporter.
	   Finally, the Maradonas boarded a KLM flight to Rome via
Amsterdam.
	   Maradona will demand financial compensation for an allegedly
erroneous drug test taken during his playing days in Italy, his
manager Guillermo Coppola said.
	   The former player also is scheduled to appear on a popular
television show.
	   Maradona was suspended from Italian first-division play for 15
months beginning April 1991 after the test revealed traces of
cocaine in his backup urine sample.

	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Miss Israel, an 18-year-old student
called Linor Abargil, won the 1998 Miss World contest on Thursday,
held for the second year running on this tiny Indian Ocean
archipelago.
	   Abargil, who said she wanted to work as a lawyer after finishing
her studies, won the top prize of dlrs 100,000, beating the
runner-up, Miss France, a 23-year old language student called
Veronique Caloc, who has ambitions to become an interpreter and
professional model.
	   Abargil smiled and waved at the cheering crowd after she was
announced Miss World by competition creator Eric Morley, and hugged
her fellow contestants.
	   ``I hope my dream will come true,'' Abargil, who has brown hair
and eyes and is 1.76 meters (5 feet 8 ins) tall, said before she
was crowned.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Canadian singer Celine Dion has sued a
French tabloid for violation of privacy in an article suggesting
she was unable to have a child.
	   Dion's lawyer Jacques Levy told a court in this southwestern
French city that Voici, a weekly tabloid, committed a ``serious
violation of his client's privacy and undermined her husband's
dignity.'' The suit was filed Wednesday.
	   Levy asked the court to award Dion and her husband about dlrs
17,500 each in damages.
	   Luc Rossollet, a lawyer for Voici, told the court that the
article published last July was based on a biography about Dion
published in the United States, which the singer never contested in
court.
	   He asked the court to throw out the charges arguing that Dion
was forgiving towards the media when it helped advance her career.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Greeted by 200 applauding fans, U.S.
rapper Coolio denied charges of theft and assault in court one year
after his arrest for allegedly punching a saleswoman during a
European tour.
	   Police officials say the Grammy-award winning artist and six
members of his group left a boutique in a Stuttgart suburb last
Nov. 20 without paying for clothing worth 1,500 marks (dlrs 940).
The rapper is accused of hitting the saleswoman in the stomach when
she confronted the group.
	   Coolio, 35, on Thursday denied punching the woman and said the
incident was a misunderstanding. Coolio says he signed autographs
in the boutique, and that in exchange a clothing company had
promised him and his group free outfits.
	   ``It was understood that the clothes were in exchange for the
autographs,'' Coolio said, represented by his German lawyer Georg
Prasser.
	   Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., won a Grammy for
best rap solo in 1996 for ``Gangsta's Paradise,'' which was
featured in the film ``Dangerous Minds.''
	   He faces four years in prison if convicted. The trial is to
resume next week, and prosecutors say they expect a verdict in
mid-December
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Hundreds of Norwegians shed their usual
placidity and rushed a new Ikea furniture store that was offering
dlrs 135 gift certificates to the first 100 customers.
	   Dozens of people had camped out overnight at the store and
hundreds more showed up Thursday morning for the special offer.
	   Just after Oslo Mayor Per Ditlev-Simonsen and entertainer
Synnoeve Svaboe completed the opening ceremony, the crowd stormed
in, chanting ``100 more gift certificates,'' breaking merchandise
and causing some minor injuries.
	   ``It seemed a little dramatic,'' Svaboe was quoted as saying by
the Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Alberto Tomba and his father were indicted
Thursday on charges of tax fraud and were scheduled for trial in
March 2000.
	   The three-time Olympic ski champion, who retired last month, is
accused of failing to pay taxes on dlrs 14 million in income from
1990-96.
	   Tax fraud is punishable in Italy by up to five years in prison
and fines.
	   Franco Tomba, the skier's father, is his son's business manager.
Alberto Tomba's mother was cleared.
	   None of the defendants was in the Bologna courthouse.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona kicked and punched
journalists who were trying to interview him at the airport
Thursday prior to his departure to Italy.
	   Maradona and his wife Claudia Villafane arrived at Ezeiza
airport outside the Argentine capital, and were immediately
surrounded by journalists and autograph seekers.
	   ``I'm not talking,'' Maradona harshly told reporters. When the
crowd pressed around him, the former football star lashed out with
punches and kicks, at least one of which caught a TV reporter.
	   Finally, the Maradonas boarded a KLM flight to Rome via
Amsterdam.
	   Maradona will demand financial compensation for an allegedly
erroneous drug test taken during his playing days in Italy, his
manager Guillermo Coppola said.
	   The former player also is scheduled to appear on a popular
television show.
	   Maradona was suspended from Italian first-division play for 15
months beginning April 1991 after the test revealed traces of
cocaine in his backup urine sample.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LENNOXVILLE, Quebec (AP) _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South
Africa says the world needs to show more tolerance to gay men and
women.
	   People who are gay haven't chosen their sexual orientation, said
Tutu, who received an honorary doctorate Thursday from Bishop's
University, a small university in an English-speakingn enclave east
of Montreal.
	   In an interview, Tutu suggested there's something strange about
the notion that people would make a deliberate decision whether to
be gay or lesbian.
	   ``It must be a crazy person who chooses to be gay in such a
homophobic world,'' said the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner. ``Let's
work for real tolerance.''
	   Tutu, 67, made the remark when asked whether there are causes
today that deserve the same level of world support as the fight
against racism in South Africa.
	   Of the lengthy anti-apartheid struggle, he said, ``They did all
they could to knock the stuffing out of our people. But they had to
acknowledge defeat.''
	   In his speech, the archbishop gave thanks to everyone who helped
the struggle in his homeland. He said the help came in many forms,
including prayers.
	   He recalled a nun on the West Coast of the United States who
prayed nightly for him.
	   ``Here I am, prayed for at two in the morning, in the woods in
California! What chance does the apartheid government stand?'' he
said to laughter.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Calling Boris Yeltsin's government ``squishy as
cabbage,'' the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament has
abandoned his support for the president and called for a transfer
of some powers to parliament. Thursday's statement was remarkable
coming from Yegor Stroyev _ a moderate who had firmly refused to
take sides against Yeltsin _ and another sign that the ailing
president is losing even his most loyal supporters. The Kremlin
released no new details Thursday on the condition of the president,
who remains hospitalized with pneumonia. (RUSSIA)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The fate of rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah
Ocalan, facing terrorist charges in Germany and Turkey and seeking
political asylum in Italy, loomed over a summit of the Italian and
German heads of government. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was to
meet with Premier Massimo D'Alema Friday, and police in Bonn said
they expect up to 30,000 people to show up to demonstrate for a
politicial solution for Kurds in Turkey. Ocalan arrived in Rome on
Nov. 12 seeking asylum. A Rome court rejected Turkey's arrest
warrant Nov. 20, citing Italian law forbidding extradition of
suspects who face the death penalty, as Ocalan would in Turkey.
	   PARIS (AP) _ Security on the strife-ridden African continent was
the focus of a summit that brought 49 African nations, including 34
heads of state, to Paris on Thursday, a meeting sure to underscore
France's bid to expand its sphere of influence. The 20th
French-African summit, which ends Saturday, could possibly take
steps toward addressing the knotty issues at the crux of turmoil in
Central Africa. The main actors in the Congo conflict are attending
the summit, including Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the
leaders of neighboring Uganda and Rwanda. Both countries support
rebels fighting to topple Kabila. (FRANCE-AFRICA SUMMIT)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's opposition leader has rejected Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported attempts to coax him into
joining a unity government, vowing he would never become part of
such a ``terrible'' administration. Cabinet ministers in
Netanyahu's Likud party are reaching out to their Labor rivals in a
scramble to save the premier's shaky coalition, Israeli media
reported. The six-party alliance has been on the verge of collapse
since Israel handed over another chunk of West Bank land to the
Palestinians last week, a move coalition hard-liners oppose. If his
right-wing ministers bolt, Netanyahu would be left without a
majority and would be vulnerable to a vote of no confidence.
Netanyahu will face his next test Tuesday when an early elections
bill is scheduled for debate. (ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Miss Israel has won the 1998 Miss
World contest, held for the second year running on this tiny Indian
Ocean archipelago. Linor Abargil, an 18-year-old students who wants
to be a lawyer, won the top prize of dlrs 100,000 on Thursday. Miss
France, a 23-year old language student named Veronique Caloc, was
the first runner-up. Miss Malaysia, Pick Lim Lina Teoh, a
22-year-old actress and model, took third place. The new Miss World
is due to begin 20 months of compulsory military service in April
1999, but her father, Jackie Abargil, told The Associated Press
that he hopes the army will postpone her induction to enable her to
fulfill the yearlong duties of Miss World. (SEYCHELLES-MISS WORLD)

German chancellor meeting with Italian premier to discuss Kurdish

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The fate of rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah
Ocalan, facing terrorist charges in Germany and Turkey and seeking
political asylum in Italy, loomed over a summit of the Italian and
German heads of government.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was to meet with Premier Massimo
D'Alema Friday, and police in Bonn said they expect up to 30,000
people to show up to demonstrate for a politicial solution for
Kurds in Turkey.
	   Schroeder, who was in Brussels to meet with European Commission
President Jacques Santer at EU headquarters Thursday, said he would
not reveal Germany's decision on whether or not to ask for Ocalan's
extradition until he met with D'Alema.
	   Ocalan arrived in Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum. A Rome court
rejected Turkey's arrest warrant Nov. 20, citing Italian law
forbidding extradition of suspects who face the death penalty, as
Ocalan would in Turkey.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought
a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. The conflict has left
some 37,000 dead.
	   Italian judges have ordered Ocalan to stay in Rome until Dec. 23
to give Germany time to mull over extradition.
	   Germany, which banned the PKK as a terrorist group in 1993 after
a string of arson attacks against Turkish businesses, has two
arrest warrants for the Kurdish rebel chief, one dating back to
1990 and another issued over the weekend.
	   But the German Justice Ministry says it has no immediate plans
to pursue extradition. Germany and other EU countries have no death
penalty.
	   Germany is home to some 2 million Turks, more than 400,000 of
them Kurds and the potential for unrest spreading to German soil
exists.
	   The head of the Kurdish Communities in Germany, Mehmet
Tanriverdi, has asked the German government to help settle the
Kurdish question in Turkey politically. Tanriverdi said that Ocalan
should be given asylum in Italy and be free to travel in Europe.
	   Italian officials are apparently also split over Ocalan. While
Foreign Minister Umberto Dini insists Germany should ask for his
extradition, the leader of D'Alema's Democratic Left Party of
former communists, Walter Veltroni, has said he could foresee
granting Ocalan asylum.
	   On Wednesday, Italy's hardline Communist Refoundation Party
acknowledged responsibility for bringing Ocalan into Italy to seek
political asylum.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The image of a sizzling frying pan
filled Venezuelan television screens after failed coup leader Hugo
Chavez vowed in a presidential campaign speech to ``fry the heads''
of his political opponents.
	   ``They'll have to bring in truckloads of butter to fry us all,''
intoned a woman's voice until electoral officials banned the ad by
anti-Chavez forces last month, declaring it incendiary.
	   Venezuelans terrified about the growing possibility that Chavez
will become president are scrambling to head off his victory on
Dec. 6, organizing publicity campaigns, warning the public of an
impending dictatorship and pressuring several candidates to leave
the race so as not to divide the anti-Chavez vote.
	   Yet this week's efforts to block Chavez's rise to power have
been marred by squabbling among members of Venezuela's economic and
political elite.
	   ``This is an example of how the elites shot themselves in the
foot by a series of misjudgments,'' said political consultant Eric
Ekvall.
	   A former army paratrooper, Chavez, 44, staged a bloody coup
attempt against the government six years ago. In recent months, he
has tried to moderate his populist rhetoric, promising fiscal
discipline and fair treatment of foreign investors. But his
opponents still doubt his democratic credentials and fear he will
roll back free-market economic reforms.
	   ``We must not let him destroy our constitutional order,'' Donald
Ramirez, secretary general of the center-right COPEI Party, told
The Associated Press.
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition already won a
plurality of Congress in regional elections Nov. 8, overnight
becoming Venezuela's largest political force and breaking the
40-year-old political stranglehold of the two traditional parties,
COPEI and the center-left Democratic Action Party, known as AD.
	   In most polls, Chavez is about 10 percentage points ahead of his
closest rival, a Yale-educated former state governor named Henrique
Salas Romer, who is running as an independent.
	   A week-long series of meetings between COPEI and AD failed to
come up with a unity candidate who could defeat Chavez because of
what Ramirez called ``individualism and conflicting
personalities.''
	   In those meetings, the 76-year-old AD candidate, Luis Alfaro,
torpedoed an agreement by insisting on being the unity candidate.
AD leaders then voted overwhelmingly to ask Alfaro, who has led the
party with an iron fist for decades, to bow out. He refused.
	   COPEI's official candidate, former Miss Universe Irene Saez, is
also refusing to quit, despite having gone from first place in the
polls to fourth in recent months.
	   Salas has refused to accept the backing of AD or COPEI,
understanding that most Venezuelans blame the two traditional
parties for squandering the nation's vast oil wealth and for a
corrupt political culture that has contributed to sharply to
declining living standards.
	   ``People want a president that has free hands to unite the
country,'' Salas told The Associated Press in an interview on his
campaign plane Thursday.
	   One of Chavez's closest advisers, former Caracas mayor
Aristobulo Isturiz, said all the scrambling to unite the
anti-Chavez forces was futile since no one can beat the former army
officer anyway.
	   ``Let them fabricate a Martian to see if he could do it,''
Isturiz told reporters.
	   Yet efforts to stop Chavez continue unabated. Governors-elect
from nine states on Wednesday accused Chavez of plotting violent
protests if he doesn't win next month _ an allegation Chavez's
campaign manager called ``absolutely false.''
	   In another TV ad banned by the National Electoral Council,
Chavez opponents showed actual footage of the candidate's 1992 coup
attempt that killed 15 soldiers and dozens of civilians.

Students demanding ex-President Suharto be put on trial

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ When Indonesian soldiers opened fire
and killed nine student protesters, some feared the bloodshed would
break the demonstrators' resolve.
	   Instead, the violence two weeks ago seems to have emboldened
them.
	   After a few days of mourning, protests calling for greater
democracy for the world's fourth-most populous nation have become
daily, almost festive affairs tolerated by security forces.
	   On Thursday, more than 1,000 students taunted troops that
blocked them from marching on the home of former President Suharto,
demanding he be put on trial to face corruption allegations.
	   Students have tried repeatedly to march to Suharto's heavily
guarded home.
	   On Thursday they were blocked by dozens of security personnel
armed with rattan shields and bamboo sticks. But the troops stood
well away from the crowd as a precaution against further shootings.
	   Many jeered and made fun of the soldiers blocking them. Some
danced and sang. ``The armed forces are no better than boy
scouts!'' one protester shouted.
	   ``We want revolution, not just reform,'' cried another.
	   The standoff occurred in a park adjacent to the U.S.
ambassador's residence about a half-mile from Suharto's home, where
the former leader lives as a virtual recluse.
	   Many students held up pictures of Suharto dressed as a bandit.
	   Several members of one Muslim student group carried posters of
the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution Ayatollah Khomeini and its
current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   ``We want a charismatic leader like Khomeini. This would inspire
Indonesians,'' said one protester called Budi, who like many
Indonesians uses only one name.
	   There were no arrests.
	   Earlier, 200 protesters were stopped from staging a sit-in at
the attorney general's office.
	   The peaceful demonstrations in the capital contrasted with a
clash between police and students in the provincial city of
Semarang on Wednesday.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that 54 demonstrators
were injured.
	   Student activists who helped oust Suharto in May have stepped up
their demands that the former army general be held accountable for
wrongdoing during his 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, announced last week
that he would set up a new inquiry into his former mentor's wealth.
	   A previous investigation by Attorney General Andi Muhammad
Ghalib turned up no evidence of corruption and critics labeled it a
whitewash.
	   Earlier this week, hundreds of students occupied the attorney
general's office before army negotiators convinced them to leave
and military trucks ferried them back to their campuses.
	   As many as 31 people have been killed in demonstrations and
riots in Jakarta the past two weeks. Rioting earlier this week was
ethnically motivated, with mainly ethnic Chinese and Christians
targeted.

For the NBA, Thanksgiving without a game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Like other National Basketball Association
players around the United States, Marty Conlon of the Miami Heat
sat at the festive dinner table on the Thanksgiving holiday,
explaining his unemployment predicament to his family.
	   On Thursday, everybody wanted to hear from the big fellow at the
end of the table who, through no fault of his own, naturally,
hadn't done an honest day's work in months.
	   ``Guys are home talking to their families and friends, and it's
hard because the average person can't comprehend the complexities
of this lockout and how bad this deal is for the players,'' Conlon
said Thursday before leaving for his family's Long Island home.
	   ``It's tough when you have all these people wondering, but as
long as we stay informed and together, standing behind our union,
we'll be OK.''
	   A negotiating session that had been scheduled for Saturday was
canceled, and it's now clear the season will not begin until
January _ if at all.
	   Like many people on the players' side of the dispute, Conlon
suspects the league orchestrated a breakup of talks on the day
before the holiday to turn up the pressure on the players.
	   ``It's one of their tactics,'' said Conlon, who is one of 200
free agents among some 400 NBA players whose lives have been put in
limbo.
	   With the lockout wiping out the first two months of the season,
players have lost more than dlrs 300 million in salaries, and the
total grows as the days pass. At least another dlrs 100 million
figures to go down the drain before a settlement is reached.
	   ``The union leadership continues to make a mockery of the
collective bargaining process at a tragic economic cost to its
members,'' chief NBA legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin said.
	   The latest breakup of talks came after the owners said the union
had reneged on its acceptance of certain terms. In response, the
union said the owners were now requesting unacceptable
preconditions for a resumption of talks.
	   ``We're obviously not going to negotiate with a gun to our head,
especially after having been locked out for almost six months,''
union director Billy Hunter said.
	   Before talks can resume, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said
the owners need assurances from the players that:
	   _they accept the league's version of a disputed tax formula that
would be part of a new labor agreement;
	   _they will be flexible in their demand for tying their main
concessions to receiving 57 percent of revenues;
	   _they will back off their statement that they will accept no
changes to the timing rules for free agency signings.
	   ``If these are going to be preconditions, we're not going to
meet. And if the season gets jeopardized, it gets jeopardized,''
Hunter said. ``We didn't cancel the meeting, the league did. We
assumed there was a chance to make great progress this weekend.''
	   If the sides remain at odds for another few weeks, the
commissioner could explore two options. He could declare an impasse
and impose new work rules, which would inevitably lead to the
players decertifying their union or playing a shortened season and
then going on strike when the playoffs begin. Or Stern could ask
Hunter to put the owners' proposal to a vote.
	   Hunter dismisses the last scenario.
	   ``I wouldn't present it,'' he said. ``So there's not going to be
a vote.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Strife-torn Congo took center stage as African
leaders met in Paris for a meeting that was to focus on security
issues.
	   Discussions were to begin Friday morning at the 20th
French-African summit, which has drawn 49 African nations,
including 34 heads of state.
	   But all eyes were expected to be on Congolese President
Laurent-Desire Kabila as he crosses paths with Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur Bizimungu, Rwanda's leader. Both Rwanda
and Uganda support rebels waging an insurgency in the Congo.
	   The Rwandan leader said Wednesday he is prepared to meet with
Kabila in Paris.
	   But Kabila held out little hope that progress could be made at
the summit, saying a pullout of Rwandan and Ugandan-backed forces
from the Congo was a precondition for substantive talks on a peace
settlement.
	   In an interview broadcast Thursday on Radio France
Internationale, Kabila added that his allies Angola and Zimbabwe
``were not pushing (him) to negotiate.''
	   A British decision Wednesday not to grant immunity to former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who faces charges of genocide,
led to questioning about whether the same might apply to some of
the leaders gathered in Paris, particularly Kabila.
	   The Paris-based International Federation of the League of Human
Rights and the French League for the Defense of Human Rights on
Tuesday both filed court complaints against Kabila for ``massive
violation of human rights.''
	   Kabila and the Ugandan president are scheduled for separate
talks with President Jacques Chirac on Saturday.
	   The summit's guest list suggests a bid by France to break out of
its traditional sphere of influence, and expand beyond its former
colonies to other parts of Africa.
	   Among those making first appearances at the summit, which ends
Saturday, are Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan. Annan and Organization of African Unity
chairman Blaise Campaore of Burkina Faso are to address the summit
Friday.
	   Among absentees are Sudan and Libya, uninvited because their
countries are under U.N. sanctions; Algeria, which traditionally
refuses to attend; and Gabon.
	   French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said this week
that France seeks a ``pragmatic reflection'' on the security issue,
including conflict prevention and peacekeeping.
	   A quarter of sub-Saharan Africa is currently implicated in
crises.
	   Since last year, France has moved to redefine its relationship
with Africa after a century as benevolent patriarch across a large
swath of the continent. Former colonies gained prestige and
financial benefits for remaining within Paris' sphere of influence.
	   In 1997 France announced a five-year plan to cut its forces in
Africa from 8,000 to 5,000 and close one of six military bases.

Iraqi POWs freed after years of detention face misery of sanctions

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At Baghdad's ``Victorious Garage,'' a
wasteland of grease, stagnant water, and the carcasses of cars,
Kadhim Fadhil sits wearily in a dank workshop, a broken man.
	   Fadhil was a prisoner of war, one of tens of thousands of his
countrymen captured in Iraq's ruinous 1980-88 conflict with Iran.
	   He spent 16 years of his life hostage to that war and tortuous
prisoner exchange negotiations. In his POW camp, he said, guards
beat him, dead cockroaches turned up in his meals of rice and an
apple or orange were a delicacy he might sample once a year.
	   Now 43, his hair gray and his gestures feeble, he returned home
only in April to another war of sorts, to a city devastated by
eight years of U.N. sanctions that _ in his absence _ have
transformed one of the Arab world's great capitals into a
backwater.
	   ``I think life for me is like a cigarette,'' Fadhil said
timidly, his head cast down. ``It has burned away.''
	   His life is a telling window on the two phenomena that have come
to define today's Iraq.
	   One is the militarization of society, from the olive green
uniforms and black berets its leaders often wear, to the massive
war monuments dotting Baghdad, to the 2 million Iraqis who have
fought in two decades of battles at home and abroad.
	   The other is the embargo on exports of its oil _ the world's
second-largest reserves _ imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990. Oil's bounty in the 1970s ushered in a boom that rivaled that
of the Gulf, bringing wealth and education that were the envy of
the region. Without them, the country has crumbled.
	   Perhaps no one has felt the impact of both like the POWs.
	   ``I thought I would return back to a modern city. The bridges,
the buildings and the hospitals. I thought there would be more. I
thought that the people would be better off. But everyone is
weary,'' said Abbas Ahmed Salah, a 30-year-old held prisoner in
Iran since he was 19 and released in April with Fadhil.
	   He sat on a wood bench against walls of peeling yellow paint in
the poor neighborhood of Sleikh. The room was lit by two candles.
Power cuts, once unheard of, can last six hours a day in Baghdad.
	   Asked what he does now, he answers glumly, ``Nothing.''
	   As 5,584 POWs returned to Iraq in the exchange in April, a story
made its rounds of one POW receiving his government stipend of
50,000 Iraqi dinars at the border and thinking himself rich. He was
ready to get married and buy a car and a house.
	   But disappointment soon followed.
	   Before the prisoner left for the war, the stipend would have
been worth dlrs 150,000. When he returned, the collapse of the
dinar had reduced it to dlrs 85.
	   Fadhil, aged far more than his 43 years show, cannot work at his
family's garage. He is crippled by rheumatism in his legs and hands
and suffers perpetual pain in his stomach from _ as he puts it _
nerves.
	   His 150,000 dinar stipend and back pay of 138,000 dinars (dlrs
79) soon ran out.
	   At market prices, Fadhil's back pay for 16 years as a POW could
buy about 40 chickens or 1,380 eggs. It's not nearly enough for a
bus ticket and government travel permit to neighboring Jordan,
virtually the only place Iraqis can go. It would take nearly seven
times as much to buy the cheapest, 20-year-old Russian-made car.
	   To survive, he lives with his six brothers.
	   And his frustration with his new life? ``I could tell you enough
to fill up your notebook,'' he said to a reporter.
	   On record at least, no POW blames Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
for his plight, nor the years of war nor the misery from the
sanctions that can only be lifted when U.N. inspectors certify Iraq
has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   But the irony of leaving a prison for the confines of a country
sealed off by those sanctions is not lost on the POWs.
	   Sattar Jabbour lived in the same tent for nine years, patching
its holes by sewing scraps of prisoners' clothes on the canvas.
	   There, he said, the food that prisoners could eat and the work
they could do was dictated by the guards. Their life was limited to
the camp's borders. Iraq under sanctions, he said, is much the
same.
	   ``It's the same picture but a bigger area,'' said the
40-year-old Jabbour, who works as a bellboy at the Sigman Hotel in
Baghdad, making the equivalent of dlrs 35 a month.
	   ``Then it was a personal experience,'' he said. ``Here, it's the
experience of a people.''

Report: Finance Minister Miyazawa says plans to resign this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Friday he plans to resign and could quit by the end of this year,
Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Miyazawa told reporters the move was related to supporting
influential ruling Liberal Democratic Party member Koichi Kato in
his bid to succeed Miyazawa as head of the party faction to which
both belong.
	   ``I'll quit the Cabinet. But first I have to make sure the
budget gets done right,'' Kyodo quoted Miyazawa as saying,
suggesting that the move will come once work on the fiscal 1999
budget is completed next month.
	   Miyazawa, a former prime minister, took over the finance
portfolio when present leader Keizo Obuchi formed a Cabinet after
becoming prime minister earlier this year.
	   Miyazawa's return as head of the powerful ministry, which he had
headed in the late 1980s, was heralded by some commentators as he
has been considered one of Japan's most skillful economic experts.
	   Others, however, criticized the move, blaming Miyazawa for
fueling Japan's asset-inflated economic ``bubble,'' the eventual
collapse of which is still adversely affecting the nation's
economy.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stock markets in Asia and Europe advanced Thursday,
as Japanese investors awaited economic stimulus measures and the
European markets percolated with rumors of a big oil merger.
Tokyo's main index, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, gained
134.30 points, or 0.89 percent, closing at 15,207.77. The index
rebounded from a drop of 91.17 points Wednesday. Share prices rose
amid optimism that recent moves to stabilize Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's government will prove beneficial to the ailing Japanese
economy. Most other Asian markets posted slim gains or losses, with
the exception of South Korea, where shares fell 3.8 percent.
Analysts said the losses were caused by massive selling by local
institutional investors to hedge against the futures market. In
London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index rose
72.6 points to close at 5,827.9 points. Volume in most markets was
light, as traders took cues from the United States, where markets
were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission would review
any merger between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. to see if it
violates the European Union's antitrust laws, an EU official said
Thursday. ``It is clear that a deal of this size would prompt an
inquiry,'' the official said, adding that the companies have not
contacted the EU. The Financial Times reported Thursday that the
two companies are contemplating a merger and that an announcement
could come next week. The companies have declined to comment.
(EU-EXXON-MOBIL)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC failed to reach even a basic
agreement to extend oil production cuts, saying Thursday at the
close of a testy year-end meeting that it would review the
situation again in March. With prices hovering near a 12-year low,
analysts predicted before the meeting that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would extend the cuts until the end
of next year. But the secretary-general, Rilwanu Lukman, said OPEC
will wait until March to make any moves. OPEC decided in June to
cut production by 2.6 million barrels per day _ or about 10 percent
of its total output. But the measure is set to expire in mid-1999,
and the cuts haven't worked, partly because of overproduction by
some members but also because of low worldwide demand. (OPEC)
	   PARIS (AP) _ With Europe's single currency about to debut,
leaders of nine European stock exchanges this week hope to forge
plans for a united market that one day could rival Wall Street. The
group was expected to sign a memorandum of understanding at a
meeting in Paris on Friday on how to construct a pan-European stock
exchange. Most European exchanges reacted skeptically _ and some
nervously _ to the announcement this summer of an Anglo-German
market by the London and Frankfurt exchanges. The new European
currency, the euro, which begins Jan. 1, 1999, has also been a
major impetus toward the creation of a pan-European market.
(EUROPEAN STOCK MARKET)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators are
investigating prices charged by airplane manufacturers Boeing Co.
and Airbus Industrie, an EU official said Thursday. The official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the European Commission
had sent the companies questions about price rises to find out if
there is any cartel activity. He told reporters the EU executive
body's inquiries were not a full cartel probe and were not
coordinated with U.S. regulators. Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht
denied any involvement by the European aerospace consortium in
price-fixing. France-based Airbus and Boeing of the United States
share the world's market in large commercial jets.
(EU-BOEING-AIRBUS)
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian government has ordered an
investigation into alleged irregularities in the dlrs 19 billion
sale of federal telecommunications company Telebras. The general
accounting office announced Thursday it will look into unusual
financing practices in the July 29 auction for Telebras, which was
split into 12 companies. (BRAZIL-INVESTIGATION)

Federations seek common ground on doping sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ If Olympic sports are serious about
fighting doping, now is the time to show it.
	   Leaders of 35 international sports federations were meeting with
International Olympic Committee officials Friday in a bid to
strengthen the battle against performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The IOC wants the 28 summer and seven winter federations to
endorse common rules, procedures and sanctions to cleanse the
sports world of steroids and other banned substances.
	   Cycling, whose image was wrecked by revelations of systematic
doping during the Tour de France, and soccer, which has resisted
IOC dictates, will be under particular scrutiny.
	   IOC leaders are intent on getting the federations to fall into
line before the Feb. 2-4 world anti-doping summit in Lausanne.
	   Officials said Friday's meeting would focus on getting consensus
in principle on six key issues:
	   _ a unified medical code,
	   _ minimum doping sanctions,
	   _ a definition of doping,
	   _ creation of a world anti-doping agency,
	   _ cooperation with government institutions,
	   _ educational and ethical intitiatives.
	   Achieving unity on sanctions has proven especially elusive, with
different federations applying different penalties for the same
offense.
	   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical
commission, said total harmonization of sanctions is impossible,
calling it ``an intellectual dream.''
	   ``We can't tell the federations what to do,'' he said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``They have their autonomy.
The IOC can only give guidelines.''
	   De Merode said he advocates the gradual elimination of fixed
penalties in favor of a flexible scale of mininum and maximum
sanctions.
	   A key figure Friday will be Primo Nebiolo, the president of the
International Amateur Athletic Federation and head of the
association of all 28 summer Olympic bodies.
	   Nebiolo said he would like all federations to accept the IAAF's
mininum two-year suspension for a first steroid offense, while
allowing flexibility for ``exceptional circumstances.''
	   ``The main idea is to have a high-profile minimum sanction,''
Nebiolo told the AP.
	   Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, suggested that
federations which don't go along with common ant-doping policy
should be dropped from the Olympics.
	   ``I think some of the federations have to say, `You know, if
we're going to be part of the Olympic movement, we've got to buy
into this. If we don't, maybe some sports will sit out.' I think
that would be an important statement on behalf of the Olympics.''
	   But De Merode said it would be a ``fatal mistake'' to threaten
to kick sports out of the Olympics. And Nebiolo said putting
pressure on federations was not the answer.
	   ``I hope in the sense of responsibility of each federation,'' he
said.
	   On another key issue, the federations will be asked to support
establishment of an independent doping agency to coordinate drug
testing around the world.
	   Pound, who heads the project, said the agency could be up and
running early next year with initial funding of dlrs 25 million,
taken from Olympic television revenues.
	   Officials said Friday's meeting will not take up the specifics
of a controvesial system of drug sanctions proposed by an IOC
working group.
	   The proposals, as described by Gunnar Werner, secretary of the
international swimming federation, divide doping offenses into two
categories _ ``regular'' and ``aggravated'' cases.
	   Suspensions in so-called regular cases would range from one to
six months for minor drugs, and six months to two years for harder
drugs like steroids.
	   For aggravated cases, the proposal calls for suspensions of two
years to eight years, plus life bans for certain ``intentional
doping'' infractions.
	   The proposal also calls for fines of up to dlrs 100,000 for
minor drug offenses and fines of up to dlrs 1 million for serious
infractions.
	   Werner and Pound both criticized the system as too complicated.
The proposals will likely come up at the IOC executive board
meeting in Lausanne on Dec. 11-14.

Sampras stays on top for record sixth year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; will be updated after first match that starts
1300 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras is on top of the tennis
world for a record sixth-consecutive year and he is not ready just
yet to relinquish his throne.
	   ``I'll try to stay on top for as long as possible,'' Sampras
said after breaking the record of five years he held jointly with
Jimmy Connors.
	   There are new milestones to achieve as well: Sampras is one
title short of the 12 Grand Slams won by Roy Emerson.
	   And there is the French Open on clay, the only one Sampras
hasn't won. ``That's the biggest challenge.''
	   Staying No. 1 for six consecutive years, Sampras said, required
a lot of hard work.
	   ``It was well worth the sacrifice,'' he said, just before
champagne was poured over his head at a little ceremony. He
returned the favor, showering ATP Tour chief Mark Miles and
promoter Ion Tiriac.
	   There was also a cake representing the figure six, with a
chocolate tennis ball inside the circle.
	   ``It's an ultimate achievement, it will probably never be
broken,'' he said. ``I'm trying to stay humble through all this,
but the record speaks for itself. It's a little overwhelming.''
	   Sampras was assured of the record when Marcelo Rios of Chile,
the only player with a chance to overtake him, pulled out of the
ATP Tour World Championship, an elite dlrs 3.5 million
season-ending tournament, because of a back injury.
	   Rios trailed Sampras 33 points on the computer rankings.
	   Having won his first two round-robin matches, Sampras was
already assured a semifinal berth before he played Karol Kucera on
Thursday.
	   A relaxed Sampras then demonstrated why he is No. 1, crushing
Kucera 6-2, 6-1 in 45 minutes. Kucera is No. 7 and beat Sampras
once in their three previous matches this year.
	   If Sampras wins the tournament for the fifth time, he will pull
even with Ivan Lendl on the career list. Sampras won the event in
1991, 1994 and the last two years.
	   After Andre Agassi, Rios was the second player to pull out of
the tournament that nominally brings together the top eight players
of the year.
	   Greg Rusedski, replacing Agassi, played Albert Costa, who
replaced Rios, and won 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.
	   Tim Henman became the second player to reach the semifinals when
he beat Alex Corretja 7-6 (7-4), 6-7, (4-7), 6-2.
	   Corretja dropped to 1-1 but remains alive under the round-robin
format. Henman is 2-0.
	   On Friday, Yevgeny Kafelnikov will play Carlos Moya for a place
in the semifinals.
	   Also, Rusedski faces Henman and Costa meets Corretja in matches
determining the other two semifinalists. With Henman already
through, Corretja and Rusedski are still in the running. Corretja
will advance if Rusedski loses to Henman.

Japan's jobless rate steady at record 4.3 percent in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's jobless rate stood unchanged in October at
a record 4.3 percent for the third straight month, the Management
and Coordination Agency announced Friday.
	   Japan's jobless rate first touched 4.3 percent in June, then
improved to 4.1 percent in July, temporarily bucking a trend that
has seen the rate rise steadily in recent months. But it returned
to the record level in August, where it has hovered since amid a
nagging economic recession.
	   Also Friday, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, slipped again to
0.48 _ the lowest level since the government began compiling such
figures in 1963.
	   The figure means that only 48 jobs were available for every 100
people seeking employment.

The pope's dilemma: How to confront the Inquisition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In a driving rain in the Czech Republic, the
pope asked forgiveness for the crimes of Catholics against
Protestants during the Counter-Reformation. On a bleak African
island, he apologized for believers who traded in slaves. In a
stadium built by Hitler, he said too few Catholics resisted the
Holocaust.
	   Now Pope John Paul II is preparing to confront the Inquisition,
one of the darkest chapters in the history of his beloved church.
The Inquisition is a symbol of cruelty and intolerance; the
confrontation is bound to be painful.
	   For centuries, the church's ``thought police'' tried, tortured
and burned people at the stake for heresy and other crimes. The
holy inquisitors went after Protestants, Jews and Muslims; they
persecuted scientists and philosophers; in some countries they even
banned the Bible in anything but Latin, which few people could
read.
	   The Inquisition began in the 13th century and lasted into the
19th century. Its index of banned books endured even longer, until
1966. Galileo, condemned in 1633 for saying the Earth went around
the sun, had to wait until 1992 for rehabilitation.
	   What some view as a modern version of the Inquisition exists
even today: The Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, a
guardian of Roman Catholic orthodoxy which disciplines wayward
theologians and brings restive bishops to heel.
	   Now the church is about to embark on its third millennium and
John Paul says he wants it to do so with a clear conscience, which
means owning up to sins. But whose sins? The sins of believers? Or
those of the church itself?
	   It's a delicate question and inside the Curia, the powerful and
protective Vatican bureaucracy, there is resistance to his call for
a grand ``mea culpa'' in the year 2000. An institutional apology
risks undermining the authority of the church, the rock on which
rests the faith of an estimated 1 billion people.
	   Even acknowledging personal errors could be risky if the people
are popes, supremely powerful leaders endowed with the awesome _
though rarely exercised _ power of infallibility.
	   So far, the Vatican's approach has been to speak of individual,
not institutional, sins. ``We deeply regret the errors and failures
of those sons and daughters of the church,'' it said in its
pronouncement on the Holocaust earlier this year.
	   But, unlike the Holocaust or slavery, the Inquisition was an
ecclesiastical institution, authorized by the popes and run by the
church.
	   The Vatican this year opened most of its secret archives on the
Inquisition and hosted a symposium of some of the world's top
experts, declaring itself unafraid ``to submit its past to the
judgment of history.''
	   But the pope told his guests they had not been summoned to make
moral judgments. Instead, he said, they were being asked to ``help
in the most precise possible reconstruction'' of the Inquisition's
historical context.
	   Skeptics wonder if this was the Vatican's first step toward a
halfhearted acknowledgment of some sort about the Inquisition, a
prelude to what one participant called the ``crocodile tears'' of
an institution unable to express real shame.
	   Others say the Vatican may have little to fear. For several
decades scholars have been reappraising the Inquisition and some
now maintain that the justice it dispensed, although brutal, was
neither capricious nor unusual for the times.
	   ``The `black legend' has been destroyed,'' said historian Carlo
Ginzburg, the author of several groundbreaking works on the
Inquisition. ``But this doesn't erase the ultimate wrongness of
killing people for their ideas.''
	   The statue of a dark, hooded figure stands in the Campo di Fiori
piazza in central Rome, not far as the crow flies from the Vatican
itself. Every Feb. 17, people place flowers there in a quiet
tribute to freedom of thought.
	   Giordano Bruno was one of the most forward-looking philosophers
and scientists of his time. But in the eyes of the Inquisition, he
was a heretic. He said the universe was infinite _ and the Earth
was not its center. He espoused the peaceful coexistence of
religions based on mutual understanding and free discussion. He
said God was everywhere in nature.
	   His trial dragged on for seven years. But Bruno refused to
renounce his ideas. ``Perhaps your fear in passing judgment on me
is greater than mine in receiving it,'' he told his inquisitors
when they pronounced his death sentence.
	   A few days later, on Feb. 17, 1600, he was taken to the piazza.
His tongue was gagged. And he was burned alive at the stake.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In the 1920s a young wealthy Egyptian and
his French fiancee bought a painting in Paris. It showed a topless
Polynesian woman preening herself on a tropical beach and it bore
the signature of Paul Gauguin.
	   Today it hangs in Cairo. The woman's pointed breasts, the pink
of the beach, and a sea painted in blues and yellows catch the eye
of thousands of visitors to the Mr. and Mrs. Mahmoud Khalil Museum.
	   There is a problem, however. Some experts consider it a fake.
	   ``It is a typical fraud that pulls together elements found in
various well-known paintings of Gauguin. I think none of the
Gauguin specialists regard it as genuine,'' says Genevieve
Lacambre, a conservator at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
	   But a former director of the Khalil museum, Ahmed Sami,
disagrees. He says the brush strokes are Gauguin's and the
signature is too natural to be forged. And Khalil _ once president
of the Egyptian senate _ bought paintings only from reputable
dealers, Sami adds.
	   Sami also has scientific evidence, lab tests on a swatch of
canvas, that strongly suggests the painting is the work of the
French master. If he is right, recent sales indicate the picture
could be worth dlrs 1 million to dlrs 5 million.
	   Khalil and his wife left the painting to the Egyptian state with
the rest of their remarkable collection. The museum named for them
holds two indisputable Gauguins, six Renoirs, six Pissaros, five
Monets, an Ingres, a Toulouse Lautrec and a Van Gogh.
	   The disputed painting, 59 by 46 centimeters (24 by 18 inches),
is called ``Dominique Scene'' after the Pacific island better known
as Hiva Oa where Gauguin died in 1903.
	   The very name adds to the confusion. Gauguin moved from Tahiti
to Dominique, some 950 miles (1,520 kilometers) northeast, only in
1901. The painting is dated 1894. Could it have been incorrectly
named after Gauguin's death? Gauguin often painted a title on his
canvases; there is none on this one.
	   Lacambre knows the work well because she helped choose the
paintings borrowed from the Khalil collection for a 1994 exhibition
in Paris called the ``Forgotten Works of Cairo.''
	   She says the topless woman is painted in a ``totally vulgar''
style that is not Gauguin's; that the back of the canvas bears no
mark of a dealer; and that the painting is not found in any book of
Gauguin's complete works.
	   ``It is authenticated by nothing,'' Lacambre says.
	   The painting strongly resembles Gauguin's ``The Day of the
God,'' which also is dated 1894 and hangs in Chicago's Art
Institute. The topless woman, the landscape and other features are
strikingly similar.
	   For Lacambre, these are the marks of a clever forger. But Sami
believes Gauguin painted both works and, as was his custom,
duplicated certain elements.
	   Sami sent two swatches of unpainted canvas to laboratories in
Egypt and Germany for testing. One sample came from the side of the
frame of the disputed painting, the other from one of the museum's
authenticated Gauguins.
	   The tests found the two swatches came from the same roll of
canvas _ supporting the theory that Gauguin painted both works.
	   Sami stumbled on another piece of evidence while paging through
a 1930 book on Gauguin by the French critic Arsene Alexandre. He
came across a print of ``Dominique Scene.''
	   ``I was astonished,'' Sami recalls. He rushed into the gallery
to compare the print to the actual painting. They matched in every
detail.
	   Lacambre says Alexandre ``could have been mistaken.''
	   As for Sami's lab tests, she has no answer. Asked how a fake and
a genuine Gauguin could have come from the same roll of canvas, she
says: ``I would not know. I cannot tell you.''
	   On the other hand, Sami, now the museum's supervisor of cultural
activities, has no documentation for the work. The gallery has no
record of how Khalil came by the painting. Not even Alexandre
mentions it in the text of his book.
	   Lacambre wrote Egypt's Ministry of Culture that it was
``deplorable'' to hang the painting as a Gauguin, arguing it should
be labeled ``in the style of Gauguin.''
	   That advice was rejected, but the painting was hung on the
gallery's ground floor, which is reserved for lesser works.
	   Sami is fighting to have the painting moved upstairs so it can
be seen among the Renoirs, Monets and Pissaros.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC has failed to reach even a basic
agreement to extend oil production cuts or halt a slide in world
oil prices, saying at the close of a testy year-end meeting that it
would review the situation again in March.
	   ``We have already got an agreement, you know,''
secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman said Thursday, seemingly trying to
lift pressure off disappointment that the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to take action over prices
that have hit 12-year lows.
	   But, Lukman said, the ministers had agreed to review the
situation in March, at OPEC's next scheduled meeting.
	   North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in January closed
trading Thursday in London at dlrs 11 a barrel. It closed Wednesday
at dlrs 10.88, the lowest since such contracts began trading in
1986.
	   OPEC agreed in June to slash 2.6 million barrels a day from its
total 26.9 million barrel-a-day production in an effort to boost
prices, though the market, awash with oil, has mostly not
responded.
	   That's partly because of overproduction by some members of the
organization but also because demand just isn't there.
	   OPEC is partly to blame for the slump. It decided last winter to
increase production. That fed into Asia's slump last year, which
cut by half demand growth from that continent and had a knock-on
effect elsewhere.
	   The resulting oil glut has pushed OPEC's average oil price to
just over dlrs 10 from over dlrs 18 last November, hammering OPEC's
oil-dependent economies.
	   Many countries face severe drops in government revenue,
ballooning deficits and tight budgets next year.
	   There was plenty of recrimination at the meeting, which was
delayed by a day because of differences over extending the
production cuts. Saudi Arabia criticized Venezuela and Iran for
allegedly cheating on their production quotas. Iran denies it is
overproducing.
	   Venezuela said it could not commit to an extension of the cuts
because a new government is taking office in February.
	   Iran, the oil cartel's second-biggest producer, says the bulk of
fresh cuts should be made by Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer.
	   Members complain that Saudi Arabia seized market share after
Iraq's departure from the oil market in 1990.
	   Iraq has been barred from exporting crude since its 1990
invasion of fellow OPEC member Kuwait, but is now allowed to sell
limited amounts of oil under U.N. supervision to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods.
	   The Saudis say there is no point to adopting more cuts until
there is full compliance with the June reductions.
	   The lack of agreement at the meeting raised questions about
OPEC's future, said Mehdi Varzi, director of research at the
London-based investment firm Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
	   Varzi predicted continuing low oil prices will trigger
privatization in OPEC's quota-oriented, state-controlled oil
industries, with governments keen to shed costly state subsidies as
prices slump.
	   ``OPEC has become a backwater, because it is not looking at
fundamental things,'' such as factoring in better technology that
has made it cheaper and quicker to produce oil, narrowing profit
margins, Varzi said from Vienna.
	   Others were somewhat more upbeat.
	   ``They have the opportunity in March to do something. That's the
positive side,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at London's
Center for Global Energy Studies. ``On the negative side, markets
expected cuts to be extended and they haven't got that.''
	   OPEC on Thursday elected Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi as
the cartel's new president, replacing outgoing president Obaid bin
Saif Al-Nasseri.
	   It also voted to change its regular meetings from June and
November to March and September.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks lower in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early
Friday in quiet trading, while Japanese stock prices slipped.
	   The dollar bought 122.34 yen, up 0.42 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also higher than its late London level of 122.25 yen
overnight.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar was supported partly by
Japanese fund outflows apparently prompted by disappointment over
stimulus measures recently unveiled by the Japan government,
traders said.
	   Trading was quiet overall, however, as U.S. financial markets
were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Many will also
be closed Friday.
	   On the stock market, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average fell 53.77 points, or 0.35 percent, to 15,154.00 points in
the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the Nikkei closed up
134.30 points, or 0.89 percent.
	   Traders said local media reports that Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa plans to step down as minister and head of his political
faction by the end of this year had not had much impact on the
stock market.
	   ``Miyazawa's job was to stabilize the financial system,'' by
getting a law passed that would allow banks to receive public fund
injections, said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities.
	   Reports said Miyazawa would resign after completing the fiscal
budget process and passage of an extra budget expected next month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.45 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,159.14
points. The TOPIX closed up 10.91 points, or 0.47 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.040 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.035 percent,
driving its price down to 106.60 yen from 106.64 yen.

Report: Finance Minister Miyazawa says plans to resign this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Miyazawa's office, prime minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Friday he plans to resign and could quit by the end of this year,
Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Miyazawa told reporters the move was related to supporting
influential ruling Liberal Democratic Party member Koichi Kato in
his bid to succeed Miyazawa as head of the party faction to which
both belong.
	   ``I'll quit the Cabinet. But first I have to make sure the
budget gets done right,'' Kyodo quoted Miyazawa as saying,
suggesting that the move will come once work on the fiscal 1999
budget is completed next month.
	   A spokesman for Miyazawa's office said that he was aware of the
reports, but could not confirm them.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted by Kyodo as saying he
still hadn't been informed directly of Miyazawa's intentions.
	   Miyazawa, a former prime minister, took over the finance
portfolio when present leader Keizo Obuchi formed a Cabinet after
becoming prime minister earlier this year.
	   Miyazawa's return as head of the powerful ministry, which he had
led in the mid-to-late 1980s, was heralded by some commentators as
he has been considered one of Japan's most skillful economic
experts.
	   Others, however, criticized the move, blaming Miyazawa for
fueling Japan's asset-inflated economic ``bubble,'' the eventual
collapse of which is still adversely affecting the nation's
economy.

Former presidential supporter distances himself from Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament
has joined a growing number of former presidential supporters
distancing themselves from Boris Yeltsin in recent days, while the
president remained hospitalized with pneumonia.
	   Yegor Stroyev _ a moderate who had firmly refused to take sides
against Yeltsin _ called Thursday for a check on presidential power
and a corresponding increase of parliamentary authority.
	   ``The government is as squishy as cabbage in the fall,''
Stroyev, the speaker of the Federation Council, said in an
interview published in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.
	   He said that a weakened president was unable to use the
extensive powers granted him under Russia's Constitution.
	   Stroyev didn't touch upon Yeltsin's health in his interview but
suggested that some powers should be transferred to the parliament.
	   ``No reasonable man doubts that the constitution needs
revision,'' Stroyev said. ``The parliament's functions have been
unreasonably reduced.''
	   Stroyev's statements were another sign that the ailing president
is losing even his most loyal supporters.
	   The Kremlin released no new details Thursday on the president's
condition.
	   A series of illnesses has turned Yeltsin, 67, into a part-time
president and fueled strong doubts about his ability to serve out
the remainder of a term that runs until mid-2000.
	   Yeltsin's most recent health problems come as Russia is facing
its worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Next week, the head of the International Monetary Fund will
visit Moscow for talks on the resumption of aid, frozen in August
after Russia defaulted on loans and devalued the ruble, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   An IMF delegation left Moscow earlier this week with no promise
that it would resume an existing loan, and the fund has remained
critical of the government's plans to tackle the economic crisis.
	   The IMF has insisted on seeing a sound economic program and
signs that is has been implemented, before releasing any more of
the dlrs 22.6 billion aid package.
	   Also Thursday, former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said he
was setting up his own political party that would take part in the
parliamentary elections next fall.
	   Kiriyenko said on the ``Hero of the Day'' television program
that he wanted to make Russia's nascent democratic institutions
work for the people, and to end the ``total lack of understanding
between the government and the society.''
	   Kiriyenko was a political unknown when he was named as prime
minister this March. A former business executive with a reputation
as a technocrat, he was fired by Yeltsin after his government's
Aug. 17 decision to devalue the ruble and default on its treasury
debt.
	   Kiriyenko, 36, left open the question of forging a possible
union with other liberal parties and movements, saying only that

Former presidential supporter distances himself from Yeltsin

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament
has joined a growing number of former presidential supporters
distancing themselves from Boris Yeltsin in recent days, while the
president remained hospitalized with pneumonia.
	   Yegor Stroyev _ a moderate who had firmly refused to take sides
against Yeltsin _ called Thursday for a check on presidential power
and a corresponding increase of parliamentary authority.
	   ``The government is as squishy as cabbage in the fall,''
Stroyev, the speaker of the Federation Council, said in an
interview published in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.
	   He said that a weakened president was unable to use the
extensive powers granted him under Russia's Constitution.
	   Stroyev didn't touch upon Yeltsin's health in his interview but
suggested that some powers should be transferred to the parliament.
	   ``No reasonable man doubts that the constitution needs
revision,'' Stroyev said. ``The parliament's functions have been
unreasonably reduced.''
	   Stroyev's statements were another sign that the ailing president
is losing even his most loyal supporters.
	   The Kremlin released no new details Thursday on the president's
condition.
	   A series of illnesses has turned Yeltsin, 67, into a part-time
president and fueled strong doubts about his ability to serve out
the remainder of a term that runs until mid-2000.
	   Yeltsin's most recent health problems come as Russia is facing
its worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Next week, the head of the International Monetary Fund will
visit Moscow for talks on the resumption of aid, frozen in August
after Russia defaulted on loans and devalued the ruble, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   An IMF delegation left Moscow earlier this week with no promise
that it would resume an existing loan, and the fund has remained
critical of the government's plans to tackle the economic crisis.
	   The IMF has insisted on seeing a sound economic program and
signs that is has been implemented, before releasing any more of
the dlrs 22.6 billion aid package.
	   Also Thursday, former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said he
was setting up his own political party that would take part in the
parliamentary elections next fall.
	   Kiriyenko said on the ``Hero of the Day'' television program
that he wanted to make Russia's nascent democratic institutions
work for the people, and to end the ``total lack of understanding
between the government and the society.''
	   Kiriyenko was a political unknown when he was named as prime
minister this March. A former business executive with a reputation
as a technocrat, he was fired by Yeltsin after his government's
Aug. 17 decision to devalue the ruble and default on its treasury
debt.
	   Kiriyenko, 36, left open the question of forging a possible
union with other liberal parties and movements, saying only that
``in general, all rational people should act together,'' according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Galvanized by the recent killing of Galina Starovoitova, a
prominent liberal lawmaker, Russia's scattered pro-reform parties
have renewed talks about a possible alliance, but no concrete steps
have followed.
	   Police have not announced any major breakthroughs in the
killing, which some reports said was politically motivated while
others blamed mobsters.

Russian bank, Alpha-Bank, has offered a dlrs 100,000 reward for

Surgery on Italian striker Del Piero called a success
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VAIL, Colorado (AP) _ The surgeon who operated on Italian soccer
player Alessandro Del Piero's knee says the surgery was a success
and the striker should be playing again within six to eight months.
	   ``The surgery was successful and we are expecting a good
recovery,'' Dr. Richard Steadman said Wednesday after the
two-and-a-half hour operation on ligaments in Del Piero's left
knee.
	   Steadman said a complete recovery is ``certainly our goal,'' but
that right now it is ``hard to see'' whether Del Piero will return
to 100 percent.
	   The Juventus and Italian national team striker will undergo
therapy for the next six months, he said.
	   The surgery was performed at the Steadman Hawkins clinic in
Vail. Steadman has treated major knee injuries of several
professional athletes, including Italian Serie A notables Nicola
Berti and Maurizio Ganz.
	   Del Piero will remain in the hospital for two to three days and
will stay in Vail for 10 days to two weeks, Steadman said.
	   Del Piero, 24, was injured in a league game against Udinese
three weeks ago. Before the surgery, Juventus doctors said he was
expected to be sidelined for the remainder of the Italian season,
which concludes in May.
	   One of the most popular Italian players and the European
Champions Cup leading scorer last season, Del Piero said in a
recent interview that he was prepared to face a long rehabilitation
``and be back to action, stronger than before, next season.''
	   Steadman and his clinic are world renown for their specialty in
sports-related injuries, having treated former German national team
captain Lothar Matthaeus, five-time overall Alpine World Cup
champion Marc Girardelli, four-time Australian Open champion Monica
Seles, two-time women's World Cup downhill champion Picabo Street
and several prominent American baseball, basketball and football
players.

Japan's jobless rate steady at record 4.3 percent in October
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional statistics in new 5th-7th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's jobless rate stood unchanged in October at
a record 4.3 percent for the third straight month, the Management
and Coordination Agency announced Friday.
	   Japan's jobless rate first touched 4.3 percent in June, then
improved to 4.1 percent in July, temporarily bucking a trend that
has seen the rate rise steadily in recent months. But it returned
to the record level in August, where it has hovered since amid a
nagging economic recession.
	   Also Friday, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, slipped again to
0.48 _ the lowest level since the government began compiling such
figures in 1963.
	   The figure means that only 48 jobs were available for every 100
people seeking employment.
	   The total number of employed dropped by 710,000 people from the
same period a year ago to 65.26 million, the ninth straight month
of declines, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   Those who left their jobs involuntarily rose by 380,000 people
to a record 940,000, said an agency official who declined to be
named.
	   The jobless rate for men aged 25-34 increased one percentage
point to an all-time high of 4.7 percent, while the rate for women
in the same age group rose by 0.8 point to 6.8 percent.

Newspaper: Pinochet's lawyers may argue he is unfit to stand trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous and UPDATES with new developments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet is receiving psychiatric
care for stress-related disorders, which his lawyers might cite in
a bid to have the former Chilean dictator found mentally unfit to
stand trial, The Times reported in Friday's editions.
	   Pinochet, who faces the threat of extradition to Spain on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his
17-year regime, remains under police guard at a London hospital,
where he is recovering from back surgery earlier this month.
	   ``He is undergoing assessment for stress and stress-related
disorders,'' The Times quoted an unidentified ``highly placed
medical source'' as saying. ``It is well documented that elderly
people frequently react badly to stress.''
	   Pinochet had his hopes dashed Wednesday _ on his 83rd birthday _
when Britain's highest court made a landmark ruling that Pinochet's
alleged crimes were beyond the immunity formerly given to heads of
state and former heads of state for any acts committed in office.
	   Upon hearing the court's 3-2 decision upholding his Oct. 16
arrest, Pinochet put his head in his hands and sobbed, according to
Spanish newspapers. An official at the Chilean embassy in London,
however, flatly denied that Pinochet cried.
	   Now Pinochet's fate rests with Home Secretary Jack Straw, who
has wide discretion to decide whether to follow the House of Lords
ruling and send the Spanish extradition request through the courts
_ or to allow Pinochet to go home.
	   Straw was given until Wednesday to decide, however his office
said that he has asked for a one week extension.
	   Pinochet's supporters are pressing Straw to allow the general to
return home on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his frail
health and age. Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza was
expected in London on Friday to press the British government to
free Pinochet.
	   Meanwhile, human rights activists are urging the government to
let the case make its way through the British courts. A Chilean
government report says 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared at
the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's dictatorship,
which began in 1973 when he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist. Allende died in the coup.
	   While politicians and activists continue to make appeals on both
sides, The Times said Pinochet will remain under the care of
psychiatrist Geoffrey Lloyd, medical director of the Grovelands
Priory Hospital where the former dictator is now staying.
	   Chilean businessman Hernan Briones, a close friend of Pinochet,
visited the general in London after the House of Lords' decision
and told reporters later there that Pinochet ``took it very badly.
He hardly speaks.''
	   News of the ruling was also greeted with anger by Pinochet's
supporters in Chile who attacked journalists in Santiago, including
a television crew from the British Broadcasting Corp. The Pinochet
Foundation said it lamented the mistreatment of journalists at its
headquarters in Santiago.
	   Santiago police said 67 people were detained during Wednesday's
clashes, but most of them were released shortly afterward. Only two
were being held Thursday and would likely to be charged with
aggression to officers on duty, according to police.
	   Pinochet is due to appear in Bow Street Magistrate's Court on
Wednesday, a formality required of anyone facing an extradition
order.

Japan's output falls smaller-than-expected 1.2 percent in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade ministry said Friday that industrial
output in October fell a smaller-than-expected 1.2 percent compared
to the previous month, but that there are few signs of a rebound in
production figures.
	   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry characterized
the situation as ``stagnant,'' leaving its assessment unchanged
from last month.
	   ``While some progress in inventory adjustments has been seen,
inventories remain at high levels,'' the ministry said in a report.
``Output continues to stagnate.''
	   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 1.5
percent decline in seasonally-adjusted production at Japan's
factories and mines. The government had projected a 1.1 percent
drop.
	   In September, output had climbed 2.5 percent on the month.
	   Most major industrial sectors posted declines in October, led by
steelmakers and electric machinery manufacturers.
	   The trade ministry forecast a 1.5 percent decline in industrial
production this month and a 0.6 percent rise in December.
	   It also reported retail sales at major department stores and
supermarkets fell for a sixth consecutive month, dropping 4.8
percent on the year to 1.89 trillion yen (dlrs 15.4 billion) in
October.
	   Sales declined in all categories, with clothing sales hit the
hardest, shrinking 6.9 percent.
	   Also Friday, the Management and Coordination Agency said
consumer prices in the Tokyo metropolitan area, an early indicator
of pricing trends all over Japan, rose a non-seasonally adjusted
1.0 percent in November from a year ago.
	   The agency said the nationwide consumer price index for October
rose 0.2 percent on the year, due mostly to a surge in prices for
fresh fruits and vegetables.

Author Faulks wins literary prize no writer wants to win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sebastian Faulks won perhaps the least welcome
prize in literature _ and refused to turn up to claim it.
	   The British author was awarded Thursday the Literary Review's
annual Bad Sex Award for his novel ''Charlotte Gray.''
	   But for the first time in the prize's six year history, the
winner declined to attend the awards ceremony in London.
	   A sample of Faulks' award-winning style: ''Her mind was full of
the picture of Julien being annihilated, as he slumped down gasping
on top of her, breaking into tiny dying fragments.''
	   The point of the prize is to illustrate what literary carnage
can ensue when bad sex happens to good, and not-so-good, writers.
The Review's editor, Auberon Waugh, said the award is intended ``to
draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of
redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel, and
to discourage it.''
	   Last year's winner was Nicholas Royle for ``The Matter of the
Heart.''
	   The 1996 honoree David Huggins, whose ``The Big Kiss'' contained
indelible phrases like ``Liz squeaked like wet rubber'' and ``she
hooked a yoga-leg onto my shoulder,'' took the award in the spirit
in which it was intended.
	   ``This is my first prize,'' he told the glittering assemblage.
``I may celebrate by having bad sex.''
	   Faulks beat out 12 other finalists, including Julian Barnes,
Alice Walker, Mary Gordon and actor Richard E. Grant.

Colombian peace talks hit snag over soldiers' presence in

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian rebels said Thursday that the
government has not honored its promise to remove all troops from an
extensive southern region as a condition for holding peace talks.
	   Meanwhile, at least 11 soldiers were killed and six rebel
corpses recovered after two days of combat in southeastern jungles,
the armed forces said.
	   The impasse _ over the presence of about 120 soldiers on a base
in Caqueta state _ is the first major snag in peace talks still in
the planning stages between the government and the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's most powerful
guerrilla group.
	   Earlier this month, President Andres Pastrana withdrew some
2,000 troops and police from the 16,200 square-mile
(42,000-square-kilometer) area as a security guarantee for
guerrilla negotiators. He left the 120-member contingent at the
base in San Vicente del Caguan, however, insisting they were
necessary support staff for the government's negotiating team.
	   Ignoring weeks of rebel criticism, Pastrana has insisted the
soldiers _ most of them young cadets _ are unarmed and would remain
on the base.
	   In the statement to reporters on Thursday in the pullout zone,
FARC negotiator Fabian Ramirez said that if Pastrana did not change
his mind and remove the troops ``he will bear sole responsibility
for the freezing of the dialogues.''
	   Pastrana responded that he would not back down, and urged the
leftist rebels to press ahead with peace talks to end the country's
36-year civil war.
	   ``The government will manage its own headquarters,'' Pastrana
said.
	   Despite the controversy, presidential peace envoy Victor G.
Ricardo said his preparatory meeting in the southern jungle region
with the FARC's top commander, Manuel Marulanda, would go forward
as planned on Friday.
	   The two are to discuss the FARC's insistence that the government
exchange 452 jailed rebels for some 300 soldiers and police the
rebels have captured over the past year.
	   In the fighting Wednesday and Thursday near Calamar and Retorno,
some 350 kilometers (220 miles) southeast of Bogota,
counterinsurgency troops suffered at least 11 dead and 18 wounded
and killed about 40 FARC rebels, said Fourth Division commander
Gen. Jaime Cortez.
	   Six rebel corpses were recovered, officials said. Because the
guerrillas retrieve their casualties army claims of rebel dead are
frequently impossible to verify.
	   It was not immediately clear how the fighting began in Meta
state, where rebels protect drug trafficking operations.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks lower in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday stock, late morning bond and
currency prices; ADDS trader quote in 7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen on interbank
buying in otherwise quiet trading early Friday, while Tokyo stock
prices slipped.
	   The dollar bought 122.46 yen in late morning trading, up 0.54
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its late
London level of 122.25 yen overnight.
	   U.S. financial markets were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving
holiday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 12.19 points,
or 0.08 percent, to 15,195.58 points as of midday. On Thursday, the
Nikkei closed up 134.30 points, or 0.89 percent.
	   Traders said the Tokyo foreign exchange market was being moved
mostly by interbank transactions as many foreign dealers in Japan
and players based in the U.S. were absent due to the Thanksgiving
holiday.
	   Local media reports that Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa plans
to leave the Cabinet and resign from his post as head of a major
ruling party faction were shrugged off by traders.
	   ``The market was expecting it,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury
manager at Commerzbank. ``And at this point it doesn't matter who
takes his place as the rails have already been laid for the
stability of the financial system.''
	   The reports of Finance Minister Miyazawa's impending departure
also had little impact on trading at the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
where share prices were little changed from Thursday.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange drifted lower by 1.89 points,
or 0.16 percent, to 1,162.70. The TOPIX closed up 10.91 points, or
0.47 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.060 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.035 percent,
driving its price down to 106.41 yen from 106.64 yen.

	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ The brother of former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked a judge Thursday to
dismiss corruption charges.
	   ``I have not committed any offense of illicit enrichment,'' Raul
Salinas de Gortari told Judge Humberto Venancio. ``I request, your
honor, that you clear me of the illicit enrichment charge.''
	   Looking confident but with more gray hair than before, Raul
Salinas asked to be allowed to represent himself, even though some
of his attorneys were present at the hearing in a maximum security
prison west of Mexico City.
	   By law, the judge has three days to decide on Salinas' request.
But his lawyers asked the judge to take up to six days to consider
the request.
	   A second count of illicit enrichment was presented last week
against Salinas, accusing him of the unlawful appropriation of more
than 43 million pesos (dlrs 4.3 million).
	   Authorities did not provide details of the new charges, but the
attorney general's office announced in October that it had
discovered 289 secret bank accounts, 123 homes, ranches, apartments
and land holdings under Salinas' name or those of an alias or
business partner.
	   Some 85 accounts were in foreign banks, totaling dlrs 55.7
million. In Mexico, bank holdings discovered so far amount to some
dlrs 94.6 million. Prosecutors haven't identified the source of
Salinas' money, but have said it is well beyond what he could have
earned in his position with a government food distribution company
during his brother's 1988-94 term.
	   Corruption charges were first filed against Salinas in 1995
before the full extent of his holdings were known. Those charges
are pending.
	   Salinas also faces murder charges stemming from the 1994 killing
of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the secretary-general of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party and Salinas' former
brother-in-law.
	   Salinas has denied any involvement. Prosecutors, who are seeking
the maximum 50-year sentence, and defense attorneys have rested
their cases and are awaiting a judge's ruling.
	   Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is believed to be
living in self-imposed exile in Ireland. He has not been charged
with any crime.

Japanese Finance Minister Miyazawa hints he may resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Miyazawa comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa hinted
Friday he will likely resign his Cabinet post after stepping down
as head of a major political faction in the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
	   ``I have been telling senior members of my faction that I'm
ready to hand over my position as faction head to Koichi Kato,''
Miyazawa told reporters. ``Once I resign, it wouldn't be
appropriate to stay in the Cabinet.''
	   Kato, an influential member of Miyazawa's faction who recently
served as secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, has
been widely expected to succeed him.
	   News reports Friday quoted Miyazawa as having said he planned to
stay put until work is completed on Japan's 1999 fiscal year
budget, which was expected to be drafted next month.
	   But at a regularly scheduled press conference, the 79-year-old
pol said he hasn't decided exactly when he will step down as
faction head.
	   A spokesman for Miyazawa's office said that he was aware of the
reports, but could not confirm them.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted by Kyodo News agency as
saying he still hadn't been informed directly of Miyazawa's
intentions.
	   Miyazawa, a former prime minister, took over the finance
portfolio when Obuchi became premier in July and formed a new
Cabinet.
	   Miyazawa's return as head of the powerful ministry, which he had
led previously, was heralded by some commentators as he has been
considered one of Japan's most skillful economic policy experts.
	   Others, however, criticized the move, blaming Miyazawa for
fueling Japan's asset-inflated economic ``bubble'' in the late
1980s, the eventual collapse of which is still adversely affecting
the nation's economy.

Report: Indonesian president condemns church attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name correct for Suharto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie has condemned
deadly attacks by Muslim youths on Christian churches and schools
in Jakarta last weekend, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Fourteen people died in the ethnic and religious violence
Sunday, which touched off rioting in several parts of the
Indonesian capital. Muslim mobs attacked or burned five Protestant
and Roman Catholic schools and 22 churches, The Jakarta Post said.
	   In a meeting Thursday with economic adviser Frans Seda, Habibie
said he was outraged by the attacks, some of which occurred while
church services were underway.
	   ``This is truly an unforgivable act,'' Frans, a Roman Catholic,
quoted Habibie as saying.
	   According to the Post, Frans presented Habibie with copies of
international protests over the attacks, including one from the
Vatican.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   Habibie is grappling with Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
decades as well as political turmoil over his efforts to reform the
rigid political system of his predecessor, authoritarian leader
Suharto.
	   Student activists who have clashed with security forces want
swifter change.

Philippine economy expands in third quarter, avoiding recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine economy avoided
recession by expanding slightly in the third quarter of 1998, the
government announced Friday.
	   The gross national product, which measures a country's total
output, grew 0.8 percent from a year earlier, said Felipe Medalla,
the Philippines' economic planning secretary.
	   The GNP had contracted by 0.7 percent in the April-June quarter,
and a second quarter of decline would have officially pushed the
country into recession like many of its troubled Asian neighbors.
	   ``The Philippines escaped recession,'' Medalla said.
	   However, gross domestic product, which does not include the
billions of dollars sent home each year by overseas Filipino
workers, shrank 0.1 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, the
government said.
	   The latest data brings the country's GNP growth in the first
nine months to 0.8 percent year-on-year and GDP growth to 0.2
percent.
	   The GNP was able to expand in the third quarter because of
strong dollar inflows, mainly from overseas Filipinos, Medalla
said.
	   The growth indicates that the Philippines will be able to
achieve the higher end of its recently revised GNP growth target
for 1998, Medalla said, adding that the economy has bottomed out.
	   ``The Philippines is now virtually assured of a positive GNP
growth this year,'' he said.
	   The government, together with the International Monetary Fund,
downgraded the country's GNP growth target to between 0.5 percent
and 1.0 percent from the initial 1.5 percent, mainly because of
poor agricultural production in the first nine months.
	   Medalla said the latest figures are better than the IMF
projected in past discussions with the Philippine government. He
said the IMF had predicted GNP growth of -0.5 percent to 0.5
percent for the year.
	   Medalla said he remains bullish about the economy's growth
prospects for 1999, expecting GNP growth of 3.0 percent next year.
	   The government is officially targeting GNP growth of between 1.5
percent and 3.5 percent in 1999.

Indonesian troops patrol northern villages after riot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Troops patrolled several northern
villages Friday after thousands of villagers and students
confronted security forces in fighting that left 24 people injured.
	   The violence Thursday in northern Sumatra island broke out as
demonstrators demanded the release of 70 people who had been
detained after similar clashes earlier this week.
	   Police fired tear gas and plastic bullets and protesters hurled
stones in the town of Porsea, 1,500 kilometers (937 miles)
northwest of Jakarta, the capital. Some of the injured were being
treated at a hospital and security forces arrested 56 protesters.
	   Now 126 people are in custody.
	   ``We were just trying to keep order, but they became violent,''
said Lt. Col. Amrin Karim, police spokesman in North Sumatra
province. There were isolated incidents of looting, he said.
	   On Friday, shops and restaurants were shut amid fears of more
unrest. There were no reports of trouble.
	   In clashes on Sunday and Monday, villagers burned vehicles and
vandalized several buildings in a protest against a troubled pulp
mill.
	   They said the factory, owned by the company PT. Inti Indorayon
Utama, was damaging the environment by cutting down forests and
pumping chemicals into a nearby river. The provincial parliament
had recommended that the government close it down.
	   Indonesia, which is enduring economic and political turmoil, has
suffered frequent outbursts of rioting this year. In Jakarta this
month, ethnic and religious rioting as well as clashes between
pro-democracy students and security forces have killed 31 people.
	   Deadly riots in Jakarta in May led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years in power.

Prosecution resumes attack on Anwar's character
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar's Associate
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A photograph of ousted deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and one of his alleged mistresses was
entered into evidence during his sensational corruption and sexual
misconduct trial Friday.
	   Anwar immediately grabbed a photocopy of the color photograph of
himself and the wife of his private secretary and waved it in the
air for courtroom spectators to see.
	   He appeared to be holding the copy up to show the public gallery
and media that it showed three people looking directly into a
camera, not trying to avoid being photographed.
	   The prosecution is trying to prove that Anwar abused his power
as deputy prime minister and finance minister to force police to
arrest and obtain retractions from those who had written to
authorities accusing him of sodomy and adultery.
	   Anwar has denied the 10 counts of abuse of power and illegal
sex. He calls the charges part of a conspiracy by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad to unseat his former protege because Anwar was
becoming too popular.
	   Anwar's sacking on Sept. 2 and subsequent jailing have led to
growing demands for political reforms in the Southeast Asian
country and a series of anti-government demonstrations.
	   When Anwar appeared at his arraignment with a black eye and
bruises, it caused an international outcry. Dozens of foreign
journalists, diplomats and human rights activists are monitoring
the dramatic case.
	   Ummi Hafilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, had
accused Anwar of having sex with her brother's wife. Azizan Abu
Bakar, the politician's former chauffeur, claimed he was sodomized
by his boss.
	   The prosecution is trying to prove that Ummi and Azizan
retracted their statements only after Anwar sent police to frighten
them into reversing their allegations.
	   Amir Junus, a former deputy chief of police intelligence,
testified Friday that Anwar obtained the retractions so that the
police would have no reason to continue their criminal
investigation against him.
	   ``This would indirectly vindicate Anwar's name,'' Amir said.
``If the accused was an ordinary person and not the deputy prime
minister and finance minister, I wouldn't have obeyed the
instructions that were given to me,'' Amir testified when asked
whether he felt pressured by Anwar.
	   Prosecutors submitted the photograph of Anwar, Ummi and her
brother's wife, though they didn't tell the court why.

Jiang expresses disappointment over lack of written apology
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; TOK101-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Japanese legislators
Friday that history plays an important role in determining
bilateral relations and hinted Tokyo has not yet done enough to
atone for World War II.
	   On the first state visit by a Chinese head of state to Japan,
Jiang met Thursday with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and received a
spoken apology _ first issued in 1995 _ for Japan's brutal World
War II invasion of China.
	   But the joint written declaration that was expected to include
an unambiguous Japanese apology merely said Japan was ``conscious
of its responsibility'' for suffering caused to the Chinese people.
	   At a morning meeting with Japanese legislators on Friday, Jiang
touched on the issue of Japan's invasion, referring to history as a
``mirror'' that was important for the future of bilateral
relations.
	   Japanese media also reported Jiang expressed his disappointment
with the communique by agreeing with opposition leader Naoto Kan
that the statement did not go far enough to express Japanese
remorse.
	   Many editorials and analysts agreed.
	   ``China is sure to be upset,'' said Takehiko Yamamoto, a
professor of international politics at Waseda University. ``For
China, the first-ever visit by its head of state is an extremely
important event, and the apology was one of the main issues.''
	   The mass-circulation Asahi newspaper said in an editorial Japan
must ``face historic facts'' and that its understanding of the past
must match that of the international community.
	   China had demanded the same sort of apology Obuchi extended to
South Korea's Kim Dae-jung in October, when Tokyo issued its
fullest written apology for its 1910-45 colonial rule over the
Korean Peninsula.
	   Many Chinese harbor intense resentment toward Japan for its
invasion of China, which included widespread massacres and
biological experiments. Japan's failure to own up to its past has
been a big obstacle to improved ties.
	   The absence of a full expression of remorse in the joint
statement was widely interpreted as an indication Obuchi was forced
to cave in to opposition from the party's conservatives, who have
strongly opposed apologies for the war.
	   ``China is sure to come away with a impression Obuchi is unable
to control his party,'' Yamamoto said.
	   On Thursday, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura conceded that gaps
remained between China and Japan's approach to the Japanese
aggression during the war.
	   ``Japan and China agree on their recognition of history, but
there are differences on nuance and handling of historical
issues,'' he told reporters.
	   Japan is hoping that its promise of big loans to help Chinese
economic development will offset the diplomatic set-back. Obuchi
offered China new loans of 390 billion yen (dlrs 3.2 billion) for
28 environmental, farming and other development projects for
1999-2000.
	   Obuchi also agreed not to support Taiwanese independence or
membership in international organizations reserved for sovereign
countries.
	   Jiang, who arrived Wednesday, will meet with business leaders,
civic groups and students at a major university before leaving
Tokyo Saturday for visits to two northern Japanese cities, Sendai
and Sapporo.

Report: No cash to replace broken fridges at Jakarta morgue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name for Mardiyono is correct &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Economic turmoil isn't just hard on
the living in Indonesia.
	   Two-thirds of the refrigeration units at the only Jakarta morgue
that conducts autopsies have broken down, a newspaper reported
Friday. And the cash-strapped government has no money to replace
them.
	   Only 10 of 28 units used to preserve corpses before post-mortem
examinations are working, The Jakarta Post quoted morgue chief
Mardiyono as saying Thursday.
	   Even the working units at state Cipto Mangunkusomo General
Hospital don't have enough power to bring the temperature down to
freezing. Thermometers registered temperatures between 10 and 20
degrees Celsius (50 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit), the Post said.
	   Mardiyono urged the public to help buy new equipment for the
morgue because the government was unable to set aside funds to
replace the old units.
	   ``Please help us,'' he said. ``The refrigeration system is badly
need here.''
	   He said the current refrigeration units had been installed
between 1978 and 1992. Autopsies are not common in the capital of
11 million people or in the rest of the country.
	   Indonesia is battling its worst economic crisis in decades. Many
hospitals have been unable to buy expensive imported equipment,
although international aid has partly alleviated the crisis.

India train crash kills at least 120, more than 250 injured

	   KHANNA, India (AP) _ A switchman frantically alerted the nearest
rail station that the Frontier Mail had just derailed and was
sprawled across the tracks of an oncoming express train. But it was
too late.
	   The Sealdah Express had sped past the station and couldn't see
the derailed coaches in the darkness and mist early Thursday
morning. The express train tore into the four disabled cars,
killing at least 120 people and injuring more than 250, police and
railroad officials said. Most of the victims were asleep at the
time of the crash.
	   By Friday morning, rescue workers had pulled 120 bodies from the
wreckage, and police and railroad officials said they believed 45
were still in the mangled mass of trains.
	   The sound of tearing, grinding metal woke residents of the
nearby town of Khanna, sending them hurrying to the wreckage to
collect the dead and tend to the injured.
	   Farmers turned on headlights of cars and tractors to illuminate
the crash site as rescue workers cut open the mangled cars with
acetylene torches to extricate bodies. Others offered tea, bread
and blankets to the stunned survivors, said Shiv Kumar, a
businessman who joined the rescue efforts.
	   Hours after the accident, many people were still trapped inside
the cars.
	   ``They are shrieking. Some are saying, 'Cut off my legs. Cut off
my hands. Just rescue me,''' Kumar said.
	   The Frontier Mail was bound for Amritsar from the capital when
its four rear cars jumped the tracks. The Sealdah Express, en route
from Jammu to Calcutta, plowed into them less than a minute later,
said Ashok Kumar, an official of the government-owned railroad
company.
	   ``I was awakened by a jolt as the train came to a screeching
halt. Before I could realize what has happened, the Sealdah Express
came and collided with the derailed coaches, '' said Usha Rani, who
was on her way to attend a wedding.
	   A total of 1,700 passengers were aboard both trains. In all, 16
cars were damaged in the accident, the worst in three years in
India, Kumar told reporters at the crash site, 150 miles northwest
of New Delhi.
	   Workers took 250 people to local government and private
hospitals, where 36 people were in serious condition, said S.K.
Mirza, an officer at the state police control room.
	   Pharmacies donated medicine to help the small government
hospitals that were overwhelmed with victims and ran out of
supplies. The government was bringing in more doctors from the
state capital, Chandigarh, to help.
	   Kumar, the railroad official, ruled out sabotage as a cause of
crash. ``It was a purely mechanical problem,'' he said.
	   Every year, about 300 accidents occur on India's railways, the
largest network under one management in the world. Most are blamed
on human error or outdated signaling equipment.

England name 14-man squad for test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ England have named a 14-man squad for
the second cricket test against Australia starting in Perth
Saturday following fitness concerns over experienced batsman Graham
Thorpe.
	   Thorpe has been troubled by back stiffness for the past two
days, forcing England to include Graeme Hick for the match at the
WACA ground.
	   Hick joined England's squad last week after injury worries to
another England player, former captain Michael Atherton. Atherton
has recovered from his back complaint and Hick was to have flown
home next Monday, but he was included in the side as a cover for
Thorpe.
	   England also included rookie paceman Alex Tudor in the squad and
recalled fast bowler Dean Headley after both missed the first test
which ended in a draw in Brisbane Tuesday. However, the visitors
will not finalize their starting team until Saturday morning.
	   Meanwhile, Australia have given pace bowler Jason Gillespie
instructions to bowl as fast as possible and to forget about his
injury-plagued past 18 months.
	   Gillespie is rated the quickest bowler in the country and said
he was relishing the prospect of bowling at the WACA, which
traditionally helps the pacemen.
	   In a warning to England's batsmen, the 23-year-old said he had
lost none of his fearsome pace despite suffering stress fractures
of the lower back and leg and foot injuries.
	   Gillespie is certain to be included in a pace lineup alongside
Glenn McGrath and dual purpose bowler Colin Miller at the expense
of either Damien Fleming or Michael Kasprowicz.
	   The squads are:
	   AUSTRALIA (from):
	   Mark Taylor (capt), Michael Slater, Justin Langer, Mark Waugh,
Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Colin Miller, Damien
Fleming, Michael Kasprowicz, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath.
	   ENGLAND (from):
	   Alec Stewart (capt), Michael Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser
Hussain, Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, John Crawley, Graeme Hick,
Dominic Cork, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Alan Mullally, Dean
Headley, Alex Tudor.

Jiang expresses disappointment over lack of written apology

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Japanese
legislators Friday that history plays an important role in
determining bilateral relations and hinted Tokyo has not yet done
enough to atone for World War II.
	   On the first state visit by a Chinese head of state to Japan,
Jiang met Thursday with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and received a
spoken apology _ first issued in 1995 _ for Japan's brutal World
War II invasion of China.
	   But the joint written declaration that was expected to include
an unambiguous Japanese apology merely said Japan was ``conscious
of its responsibility'' for suffering caused to the Chinese people.
	   At a morning meeting with Japanese legislators on Friday, Jiang
touched on the issue of Japan's invasion, referring to history as a
``mirror'' that was important for the future of bilateral
relations.
	   Japanese media also reported Jiang expressed his disappointment
with the communique by agreeing with opposition leader Naoto Kan
that the statement did not go far enough to express Japanese
remorse.
	   Many editorials and analysts agreed.
	   ``China is sure to be upset,'' said Takehiko Yamamoto, a
professor of international politics at Waseda University. ``For
China, the first-ever visit by its head of state is an extremely
important event, and the apology was one of the main issues.''
	   The mass-circulation Asahi newspaper said in an editorial Japan
must ``face historic facts'' and that its understanding of the past
must match that of the international community.
	   China had demanded the same sort of apology Obuchi extended to
South Korea's Kim Dae-jung in October, when Tokyo issued its
fullest written apology for its 1910-45 colonial rule over the
Korean Peninsula.
	   Many Chinese harbor intense resentment toward Japan for its
invasion of China, which included widespread massacres and
biological experiments. Japan's failure to own up to its past has
been a big obstacle to improved ties.
	   The absence of a full expression of remorse in the joint
statement was widely interpreted as an indication Obuchi was forced
to cave in to opposition from the party's conservatives, who have
strongly opposed apologies for the war.
	   ``China is sure to come away with a impression Obuchi is unable
to control his party,'' Yamamoto said.
	   On Thursday, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura conceded that gaps
remained between China and Japan's approach to the Japanese
aggression during the war.
	   ``Japan and China agree on their recognition of history, but
there are differences on nuance and handling of historical
issues,'' he told reporters.
	   Japan is hoping that its promise of big loans to help Chinese
economic development will offset the diplomatic set-back. Obuchi
offered China new loans of 390 billion yen (dlrs 3.2 billion) for
28 environmental, farming and other development projects for
1999-2000.
	   Obuchi also agreed not to support Taiwanese independence or
membership in international organizations reserved for sovereign
countries.
	   Jiang, who arrived Wednesday, will meet with business leaders,
civic groups and students at a major university before leaving
Tokyo Saturday for visits to two northern Japanese cities, Sendai
and Sapporo.

Japanese Finance Minister Miyazawa hints he may resign

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a ruling
party stalwart charged with restoring luster to Japan's moribund
economy, hinted Friday he will resign from the Cabinet.
	   Miyazawa indicated he would make the move after stepping down as
head of a major political faction in the governing Liberal
Democratic Party in favor of an influential protege, Koichi Kato.
	   ``I have been telling senior members of my faction that I'm
ready to hand over my position as faction head to Koichi Kato,''
Miyazawa told reporters. ``Once I resign, it wouldn't be
appropriate to stay in the Cabinet.''
	   Kato is a senior member of Miyazawa's faction who recently
served as secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party.
	   News reports Friday quoted Miyazawa as having said he planned to
stay put until work is completed on Japan's 1999 fiscal year
budget, which was expected to be drafted next month.
	   But at a regularly scheduled press conference, the 79-year-old
veteran pol said he hasn't decided exactly when he will step down
as faction head. He said he will time the move so that it doesn't
affect the passage of crucial bills aimed at jump-starting the
economy.
	   ``I am well aware of the very difficult situation the Japanese
economy is now facing. Thus I will see that (my resignation) will
not cause any delay (in economic stimulus steps),'' Miyazawa said.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted by Kyodo News agency as
saying he still hadn't been informed directly of Miyazawa's
intentions.
	   The government will Friday submit to Parliament an extra budget
bill which will fund the latest economic stimulus package worth
around 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion). The government aims to
pass the bill by the end of the current session which starts Friday
and ends on Dec. 14.
	   Miyazawa, a former prime minister, took over the finance
portfolio when Obuchi became premier in July and formed a new
Cabinet.
	   Miyazawa's return as head of the powerful ministry, which he had
led previously, was heralded by some commentators as he has been
considered one of Japan's most skillful economic policy experts.
	   Others, however, criticized the move, blaming Miyazawa for
fueling Japan's asset-inflated economic ``bubble'' in the late
1980s, the eventual collapse of which is still adversely affecting
the nation's economy.
