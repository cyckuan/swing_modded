<HEADLINE> German Bros. Choose Gas Chamber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) --Given the option of a fatal but painless  
injection, convicted killers Karl and Walter LaGrand have chosen 
slower, more agonizing deaths in a cloud of cyanide fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a calculated move designed to keep the brothers from  
becoming the first German citizens to be executed in the United 
States. Karl LaGrand is scheduled to die Wednesday, Walter on March 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	The LaGrands and their attorneys are gambling that an appeals  
court will buy their argument that lethal gas is cruel and unusual 
punishment -- and therefore unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, condemned to die for killing a bank manager in  
1982, also hope U.S. officials will bow to international pressure 
and commute their sentences to life in prison. Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder and other German leaders have asked President Clinton, 
Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
and Arizona Gov. Jane Hull to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do everything I can that can save a life, even in  
such a difficult case,'' said Schroeder, who opposes the death 
penalty for even the most serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which has no death penalty, has also lodged an appeal  
with the World Court on the brothers' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	It has also appealed to Arizona to spare the lives of two other  
German brothers on death row. Rudi and Michael Apelt were convicted 
of killing Michael's U.S.-born wife in 1988 in hopes of cashing in 
on a $400,000 life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth German citizen is on death row in Florida. In all, 72  
foreign nationals are awaiting execution in the United States, 
according to Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending LaGrand executions have been front-page news in  
Germany, where the brothers were born. Their mother, Emma, married 
an American serviceman who adopted the boys and their sister and 
moved the family to the United States in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, 35, and Walter, 36, were in trouble with the law as  
children. Karl was arrested for shoplifting at 9, and the boys set 
a fire that caused $20,000 damage to a golf course while the family 
lived at a military post in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, the LaGrands robbed three Tucson supermarkets in six  
days. They were free on their own recognizance when they tried to 
hold up the Valley National Bank in Marana, north of Tucson, 
shortly after it opened Jan. 7, 1982. Karl, armed with a toy 
pistol, ordered bank manager Ken Hartsock, 63, to open the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartsock, however, knew only half of the combination. The  
brothers tied up Hartsock, beat him and stabbed him 24 times with a 
letter opener. A clerk was also stabbed but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona prisoners sentenced to death for crimes committed before  
November 1992 have the option of choosing between lethal injection 
or lethal gas. All 13 inmates executed under that provision have 
chosen injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl LaGrand declined to be interviewed. His defense hopes to  
stave off execution by convincing the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco that the gas chamber is barbaric. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the appellate court in 1994 agreed with a lower court  
ruling that concluded prisoners executed in the gas chamber 
suffered ``excruciating pain for between 15 seconds and several 
minutes'' and that a gas chamber execution violates ``evolving 
standards of human decency and has no place in a civilized 
society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen states appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled  
that when the inmate is given a choice of execution, lethal gas did 
not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The high court, 
however, instructed the lower courts to examine the issue further. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument that the gas chamber is unconstitutional when an  
inmate has an alternative, such as lethal injection, ``would be a 
hard one to win in today's courts,'' said Richard Dieter, executive 
director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials say the LaGrands' selection of the gas  
chamber over injection is irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
	The LaGrands are also contending their death sentences should be  
overturned because they were denied their right under international 
law to consult with the German consulate following arrests. State 
officials say the claim is invalid because the brothers failed to 
assert it in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	John Foarde, an attorney specializing in consular affairs for  
the U.S. State Department, said there are no cases where a criminal 
conviction was set aside because of a breach of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is powerless to stop the execution because  
this is a state case, said Paul McMurdie, chief counsel for 
criminal appeals in the Arizona Attorney General's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull cannot commute the brothers' death sentences without a  
recommendation from the State Board of Executive Clemency, which 
will consider Karl LaGrand's case Tuesday.

	Kosovo Talks Start Up Again  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Kosovo peace talks are expected to  
start up again today after yesterday's decision to extend the 
deadline for an accord to Tuesday. NATO had threatened airstrikes 
against the Serbs if they did not reach an agreement with Albanian 
insurgents by noon yesterday, but the United States and five other 
nations allowed the dialogue to continue. Despite the extension, 
preparations for NATO action will continue until the negotiating 
parties accept all provisions for autonomy for ethnic Albanians, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said.

	Talks Fail To Stop Africa Fighting

	ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- A European Union delegation has failed to  
broker a ceasefire between Eritrea and Ethiopia after meeting with 
the leaders of both countries on the Horn of Africa, the leader of 
the team said yesterday. Representatives from Germany, Austria, 
Finland and the European Commission met yesterday with Eritrean 
President Isaias Afwerki following talks Friday with Ethiopia's 
foreign minister in his country's capital, Addis Ababa. Both 
countries blame the other for instigating the renewed fighting at 
four fronts along their disputed common border, which erupted Feb. 
6 following an eight month stalemate.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Concerned about its ability to comply  
with firearms laws, Internet auction company eBay says it will no 
longer allow the sale of guns or ammunition. The said Friday that 
firearms sales was an area of growing concern because online 
sellers cannot guarantee that buyers meet all the qualifications. 
Certain guns and ammunition are illegal to sell in some states, and 
federal laws govern many aspects of firearms purchases, including 
how weapons can be shipped and who may purchase them.

	London Police Accused of Racism  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- London's police force was riven by institutional  
racism that was a key factor in its failure to thoroughly 
investigate the slaying six years ago of a black teen-ager, a 
newspaper quoted a government report as saying. The Sunday 
Telegraph published excerpts of the report on the death of 
18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in 1993. The 
inquiry, ordered in July 1997, has raised serious questions of 
police incompetence and highlighted racial antagonism in some 
rundown London districts. The Metropolitan Police have acknowledged 
they failed to investigate properly and apologized.

to rewrite the Riviera Country Club record and vault into the 
Nissan Open lead. Tryba, who bogeyed the final hole by muffing his 
chip from the fringe and missing a 12-foot par putt, had nine 
birdies to go with an eagle on No. 11, where he sank a 30-foot 
putt. His record round put him at 13-under 200, two shots in front 
of a most imposing trio: Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and Davis Love III.

<HEADLINE> More Delays for NASA Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Two months after launching the  
foundation of its new space station, NASA isn't sure how many more 
flights -- or how many more years -- will be needed to finish the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, NASA's biggest partner is to blame.  
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Space Agency has fallen behind yet again on its main  
contribution, a control module that's meant to double as the crew 
quarters. The upshot is more delays and rising costs for the 
international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for a supply trip by shuttle Discovery this May, all  
assembly missions are on hold until the Russians launch the control 
module, the crucial third piece of the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will launch. It's just a matter of when,'' says Frank  
Culbertson, NASA's deputy program manager for space station 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's so-called service module should have soared in April  
1998, then in December 1998, then in April 1999, then in July 1999. 
Now an engineering evaluation by NASA shows that despite $60 
million in U.S. assistance, the 43-foot compartment won't be ready 
to fly before September. 
</P>
<P>
	And it may not be ready before November.  
</P>
<P>
	Russia's economic crisis is to blame for the 1 1/2-year holdup --  
the Russian government simply is not providing enough money -- 
although computer software problems have emerged in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian space officials expect to more or less complete the  
service module next month and ship it from Moscow to the launch 
site in Kazakstan. Engineers typically need 4 1/2 months to eight 
months at the launch site, however, to prepare a space station 
component for flight, says Culbertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months of work would bump the launch of the service module  
to November. And that would bump everything else, including the 
arrival of the first permanent crew, penciled in for early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Culbertson says that while some Russian space officials are  
embarrassed about the situation, ``most of them are fairly 
pragmatic -- they've dealt with this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They know the schedule pressure that we are under from  
Congress and the need to keep things moving because it costs money 
when you delay,'' he says. ``But they also are not going to ship it 
before it's ready. They've been very clear about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's about the only clear message lately from Russia.  
</P>
<P>
	When NASA revealed last month that the service module would fly  
no earlier than September, two months later than promised, the 
Russian Space Agency's PR office promptly issued a denial. 
</P>
<P>
	Days passed before Russian officials publicly acknowledged the  
delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the same time, word came from Moscow that if benefactors  
could be found, the antiquated Mir would remain in orbit another 
three years rather than face a fatal plunge this summer to free up 
money for the international space station. A deal was close, 
officials insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the head of the Russian Space Agency, Yuri  
Koptev, said the mystery investors had backed off. Explained 
Koptev: ``It was just wishful thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin says Russia can expect ``zero  
dollars'' from the United States to fulfill its share of the 
international space station. At one point last year, an exasperated 
NASA considered paying the Russians as much as $600 million to keep 
them in the 16-nation project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It disincentives the Russian government to fund the Russian  
Space Agency,'' Goldin told reporters at a Feb. 1 budget briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, to cover anticipated Russian shortfalls, NASA proposes  
to spend an additional $2 billion on the international space 
station over the next five years. About $1.2 billion would come 
from within NASA, the result of canceled or shuffled programs; the 
Clinton administration would provide the remaining $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA managers hope to have a better grasp of the service module  
problems -- and the domino impact on space station assembly -- after 
meeting with their Russian counterparts this week in Moscow. 
Another meeting is planned for late March. 
</P>
<P>
	James Oberg, an expert in Russian space affairs, says NASA  
should not expect instant and simple answers. The Russians 
genuinely do not know when the service module will be ready to fly 
because ``it's uncharted territory -- they're trying to operate with 
a skeleton staff and an aging cadre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can rule out September of this year or  
September of next year,'' says Oberg. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, NASA is sticking to its projected 2004 completion date  
for the international space station -- ``if we're able to keep to 
this schedule,'' Culbertson cautions. It's also sticking to 45 
assembly flights, although Culbertson notes: ``I wouldn't put money 
on that number, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the finished product? Estimates vary. Some $60  
billion, counting launches, is as good a figure as any. 
</P>
<P>
	Delays and costs will continue to mount if NASA gives up on  
Russia's service module and launches a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Russia's service module or a U.S. fill-in, the first two  
pieces of the space station would have to be junked. Shuttle 
astronauts painstakingly linked the Russian Zarya and U.S. Unity 
modules in December following a one-year, Russian-prompted delay. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has until April 2000 to get a control module -- any control  
module -- up. That's when the electronics on the two-piece space 
station will no longer be able to handle the load alone, causing 
the outpost to tumble out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a long way off,'' says Culbertson.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so, but the clock is ticking.

<HEADLINE> Search Goes On for 3 Lost in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Rescuers were continuing  
an air and ground search for a woman, her daughter and a foreign 
exchange student who disappeared this week during a sightseeing 
visit to Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, 42, of Eureka, her 15-year-old daughter, Julie, and  
Silvina Pelosso, 16, of Argentina, were reported missing by family 
members on Wednesday, one day after they were scheduled to arrive 
in Stockton after a visit to Yosemite, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	No evidence of a car accident, vehicle breakdown or foul play  
has been found, California Highway Patrol Officer Larry Walton said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a complete mystery,'' said Deborah Downs, a family friend  
who works with Carole Sund's husband. ``We don't know if they've 
driven off the road. We just don't know what to think. It's every 
parent's nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downs described Mrs. Sund as a ``pillar of the community'' and  
said it would be out of character for her and the teen-agers not to 
contact family members for days.

<HEADLINE> American, Attendants Continue Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Negotiations between American Airlines and its  
flight attendants are going relatively smoothly, to the point where 
the company says it will pay for flights canceled during the recent 
pilot sickout -- a sharp contrast to the company's relationship with 
its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600,000 passengers were stranded when the thousands of  
pilots called in sick to protest pilot pay issues resulting from 
AMR Corp.'s recent purchase of smaller, low-cost carrier Reno Air. 
The 10-day job action, which resulted in more than 6,600 canceled 
flights, ended last week after a federal judge held the Allied 
Pilots Association in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants, and pilots, who showed up at the gate during  
the company dispute could have lost out financially since they 
normally do not receive flight pay when a plane doesn't take off. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision Friday by AMR, parent company of American, to pay  
flight crews for scheduled flights scrubbed during the labor rift 
is expected to go a long way during negotiations with both union 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unprecedented and goes beyond the contract. We were  
very, very pleased,'' said Cliff O'Neal, spokesman for the 
Association of Professional Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman John Hotard said the company wanted to pay the  
people who came to work since pilots who did not show up would get 
sick pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did it to protect all of the work groups. We did it for  
pilots and flight attendants who stepped up to the line ready to 
fly,'' said Hotard. 
</P>
<P>
	The leadership for APFA, which represents nearly 20,000 members,  
told flight attendants during the dispute that they could not 
become involved in the pilots' problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot and will not interfere in this dispute,'' union  
president Denise Hedges told flight attendants. ``As painful as 
this is, it is out of our control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hedges said that the faltering of pilot talks over Reno Air  
doesn't really effect the flight attendants contract. 
</P>
<P>
	She said flight attendants from both airlines will be merged  
based on seniority. The method will be voted on at an APFA 
convention in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not expect any serious difficulty in this matter,'' said  
Ms. Hedges. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' flight attendants have been in contract  
negotiations with the company since September and some tentative 
agreements have been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues remaining on the table for the APFA are primarily pay  
and improvements in retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hedges says she's optimistic that the union will be able to  
reach an agreement without a repeat of the contentious round of 
bargaining in 1993 that eventually resulted in a strike. After most 
flights for the airline were grounded for five days, President 
Clinton intervened and forced the company back to the bargaining 
table to settle the dispute through binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this atmosphere, we have a real opportunity for positive,  
productive collective bargaining between the company and our 
union,'' Ms. Hedges said.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Not Quite At Home Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The ice was choppy, the fans subdued. Even with  
an overtime victory to inaugurate their new arena, the Maple Leafs 
had a tough time adjusting to the departure from Maple Leaf 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's that way for the fans, too,'' Leafs president Ken Dryden  
said. ``There is so much to take in, so much new to see, that you 
find yourself looking at other things, not just the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rough ice contributed to sloppy play throughout the Leafs'  
3-2 win Saturday night over Montreal to open the Air Canada Centre. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a tight game against an arch-rival, the crowd was  
passive for long stretches, rarely erupting into the ``Go Leafs, 
Go!'' chant that was a staple at the smaller, 68-year-old Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quiet,'' Leafs forward Derek King said. ``This  
certainly wasn't your average Toronto-Montreal game. It felt like I 
was in a strange place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Leafs had lost 6-2 to Chicago a week earlier in the  
ballyhooed farewell game at the Gardens, and they again had to cope 
with hype Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is such a self-conscious game,'' Dryden said. ``You want it  
to go so right and you play like that, but it doesn't have the 
unconscious energy you need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the ice, there was little criticism from players or  
fans about the spaciousness and amenities at the 18,800-seat Air 
Canada Centre. From the state-of-the-art scoreboard video screens 
to the padded seats to the plush dressing rooms, it made the 
cramped, aging Gardens seem like a relic. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the players missed the raucous bellows of the Gardens crowd.  
They also noticed that many of high-cost seats close to the ice at 
the new arena remained empty for several minutes at the start of 
the second and third periods, while those fans lingered in VIP 
lounges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took awhile for fans to filter into their seats and it took  
away from the atmosphere,'' winger Steve Thomas said. ``I guess 
they were downstairs having a beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas scored the winning goal with 72 seconds left in overtime  
on a precise cross-ice pass from rookie Ladislav Kohn. It was one 
of only 24 shots taken by the Leafs during the game as the choppy 
ice disrupted the passing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be able to pass the puck stick-to-stick,'' Toronto  
coach Pat Quinn said. ``We don't want to bang it off the glass or 
off the boards, the things bad ice makes you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a warm building, I think,'' he said.  
``Hopefully, we'll get it straightened away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were some familiar touches for longtime Leafs fans.  
</P>
<P>
	The 48th Highlanders, a regimental bagpipe and drum corps,  
performed in the pregame ceremony, just as they had done for 
decades at season openers at the Gardens. And public-address 
announcer Paul Morris was on the job, starting a new streak after 
announcing 1,561 consecutive games at the Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadiens, who left the historic Montreal Forum for the  
Molson Centre in 1996, were not daunted by the Leafs' new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much difference with all the new buildings,''  
Montreal captain Vincent Damphousse said. ``It's very similar to 
our building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid all the musings about past and future, Toronto backup  
goalie Glenn Healy offered an incontrovertible observation about 
the new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always beat the Canadiens here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chilean IOC Member May Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The Chilean IOC member implicated in the  
Olympic bribery scandal intends to resign Monday as president of 
his country's national Olympic committee, a Chilean newspaper 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergio Santander faces expulsion from the International Olympic  
Committee in the fallout from Salt Lake City's tainted bid for the

Santiago newspaper El Mercurio that he got a phone call about the 
resignation from a ``completely credible'' friend of Santander's. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno has been acting Chilean committee president since  
Santander was suspended Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander was reported resting at a farm in southern Chile after  
spending nearly 10 days at a clinic recovering from depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander has admitted receiving $4,700 from Tom Welch, former  
president of the Salt Lake City bid organizers, but he called it a 
personal contribution to his unsuccessful political campaign to run 
for Chilean congress in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno was not available for comment Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Santander is one of five IOC officials to be expelled in March.  
Four more already have resigned, three are under investigation 
while another received a severe reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Cristian Rodriguez, secretary general of the Chilean  
Olympic Committee, resigned although he denied accusations that he 
acted as a go-between in gaining favors for Santander.

<HEADLINE> Hawks' Top Scorer Out 7-10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Hawks leading scorer Steve Smith will be  
out of action for seven to 10 days after straining his right knee 
Saturday night in a 76-69 victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawks spokesman Arthur Triche said X-rays on Smith's knee Sunday  
confirmed the original diagnosis of a strain. He said the guard 
will have an MRI Monday to confirm the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision would then be made on whether to place Smith on the  
injured list, which means he would have to miss a minimum of five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Triche said if Smith is placed on the injured list, the Hawks  
might resign Jeff Sheppard or Shammond Williams, rookie guards who 
were recently released. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, averaging 21.4 points a game, tangled his feet with  
Philadelphia's Eric Snow as the two chased a long pass while 
running toward the Hawks' basket with eight minutes left in the 
third quarter Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has led Atlanta in scoring in each of the Hawks' nine  
games this season.

<HEADLINE> Is Common Sense Medical Sense? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The discovery that it is safe -- and sometimes better -- to cut  
back on blood transfusions for critically ill patients may have 
effects far beyond the obvious ones of blood and money. 
</P>
<P>
	It could open the way for more studies of whether common sense  
makes medical sense, said Dr. Gordon R. Barnard, chief of critical 
care service at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Common sense would say that a normal red cell count is better  
than a low one, but the work directed by Dr. Paul C. Hebert shows 
that isn't always so, Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebert, of the University of Ottawa, found that critical care  
patients are as likely to recover if they get transfusions only 
when they become severely anemic as they are when mild anemia is 
the trigger for transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
	And, it found, the more restrictive strategy is better for  
patients under the age of 55 and those who are less critically ill. 
Among those patients, those who got more transfusions were more 
likely to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``If common sense is not reliable, we need clinical trials,''  
Barnard said. ``I think this paves the way for clinical trials that 
seem to fly in the face of logic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Hebert's study asked a very simple question in everyday  
practice: What hemoglobin level is best in the ICU? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of questions like that which remain  
unanswered or inadequately answered, not only in general medicine 
but in critical care, particularly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those questions: What is the best oxygen level to  
maintain? When drugs have to be used to raise a patient's blood 
pressure, what is the best blood pressure to maintain? 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if we should try to achieve normal levels, 10  
percent less than normal, or where. It's probably different 
depending on what physiological breakdown we're talking about,'' 
Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Red-cell transfusions are routine to fight anemia. However,  
critical care doctors disagree on when they are needed. Some give 
them when a patient becomes slightly anemic, with 10 grams of 
hemoglobin per deciliter of blood, compared to the usual 11.5 to 
12.5 grams. Others wait until a patient is severely anemic, at 7 
grams of hemoglobin per deciliter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebert and the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group randomly  
divided 838 critically ill and anemic patients into two groups, one 
for each treatment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expected the two approaches to produce similar  
results, a finding that by itself could save millions of dollars a 
year. And, overall, that was the result, he reported in today's 
edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The 420 patients in the liberal strategy group got an average of  
5.6 units of blood apiece, while the 418 in the restrictive group 
averaged 2.6 units -- about 54 percent less. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, one-third of the patients in the restrictive group  
did not get any transfusions at all. 
</P>
<P>
	And in two groups, less was better: Younger and less critically  
sick patients were more likely to die if they got more 
transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a landmark study. This is bigtime,'' said Dr. Stephen  
Cohn, chief of trauma and surgical critical care at Jackson 
Memorial Hospital-University of Miami School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Dr. Robert Taylor, president of the Society for Critical  
Care Medicine, said they plan to use the more restrictive 
guidelines in their ICUs. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, of St. John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis,  
emphasized that the findings don't apply to several groups of 
patients. He said that includes patients who are bleeding, whether 
from ulcers or wounds; those suffering from heart attacks or 
reduced flow of blood to the heart; and those with emphysema and 
cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he said, ``This is a large study. A well-done study. But  
there needs to be other studies that confirm this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody knows just how many patients the nation's ICUs treat a  
year, or how many transfusions they get. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 68-bed ICU at St. John's Mercy used 337 units in  
November. ``If we could cut that by 54 percent, that's a 
significant issue,'' Taylor said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street on Inflation Watch / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite widespread reports that inflation is  
dead and gone, investors in the Wall Street markets haven't stopped 
worrying about it. 
</P>
<P>
	On the contrary, they have pushed bond interest rates higher in  
recent weeks, registering heightened worries that inflationary 
pressures might be heating up again. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts think this scare isn't going to amount to much.  
Powerful disinflationary forces are still at work in the economy, 
they say, including the revolutionary efficiencies being wrought by 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the situation demonstrates that fears of inflation are still  
easily stirred among a generation of investors that hasn't 
forgotten the bad old days of the 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation is dead and a wooden stake has been driven through  
its heart,'' says Jim Griffin at Aeltus Investment Management Inc. 
in Hartford, Conn. ``We know this for a fact because the world's 
leaders told us so. But markets can be recalcitrant, and so they 
have flirted lately with the idea that inflation lurks among the 
undead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rates on long-term Treasury bonds recently climbed to six-month  
highs above 5.4 percent, reflecting uneasiness in a market known 
for its sensitivity to inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar currents have been visible in the stock market too.  
Utility stocks, for instance, have been retreating lately, amid 
talk that the Federal Reserve might be more inclined to tighten 
credit conditions, and less likely to ease, as 1999 progresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expectations of Fed easing have been taken completely out of  
the curve,'' says Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter &AMP; Co. ``U.S. fixed-income markets are now discounting a 
central bank that effectively remains on hold through midyear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American economy has been stronger over the past few months  
than almost everyone thought it would be in the aftermath of 
currency and debt problems in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many observers who have been warning of the  
dangers of deflation, rather than inflation, say the threat of a 
worsening global economic slump hasn't gone away. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of last year, I expected that weaker profits would  
cause companies to cut back on employment and capital spending,'' 
says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities 
Inc. in New York. ``Instead, job growth and capital outlays remain 
robust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Yardeni argues, ``By the second half a slowdown is  
likely, especially when compared to the current extraordinary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect that pricing will remain weak in energy and basic  
materials, and that disinflationary and deflationary pressures will 
spread to other sectors, especially technology, capital goods, 
consumer staples and consumer durables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On balance, however, the scales on the Street definitely have  
tipped lately in the direction of inflation, rather than deflation, 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
	As Roach puts it, ``Growth is great. And for a fourth year in a  
row, the United States is getting much more of it than many ever 
dreamed possible, including the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the day is coming when growth will be bad -- when a fully  
employed U.S. economy has effectively run out of wiggle room to 
hold on a path of non-inflationary expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a world still perceived to be closer to deflation than  
reflation, most believe these considerations ring hollow. But as a 
vigorous U.S. economy continues to up the growth ante, the denial 
could finally crack.''

<HEADLINE> McNown Impresses Tampa's Dungy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- At least one NFL head coach thinks UCLA  
quarterback Cade McNown will be taken in the first round of the 
April draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy said Sunday at the NFL  
scouting combine that he's sold on the lefty quarterback, 
considered by some to lack a big-league throwing arm. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if McNown would still be on the board when Tampa Bay  
picked 15th overall, Dungy said: ``I hope so. But I wouldn't be 
surprised if he is not. ... I'd like to have a chance at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dungy coached McNown at the Senior Bowl in January. In that  
game, McNown led his team to three scoring drives and was named the 
game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I'm big on production,'' Dungy said. ``Cade is a guy  
who has produced. His arm was better than I heard it was going to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown would welcome the opportunity to play for Tampa Bay, but  
he said the draft remains wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a great situation,'' McNown said of possibly going  
to the Buccaneers. ``I'd love being around Coach Dungy. That's nice 
of him to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown's stock has been rising since the end of the season.  
Unlike some of the high profile quarterbacks -- like Kentucky's Tim 
Couch and Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper -- McNown participated 
in all the drills at the combine. 
</P>
<P>
	He was measured at 6-foot-1, 213 pounds, which is slightly  
taller than NFL scouts were led to believe. Next, McNown must 
convince scouts that his left arm is up to par. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to throw the ball as hard as Brett Favre,''  
McNown said. ``But I have got a strong enough arm to play. I will 
make any throw that is asked of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown comes off an impressive senior season where he threw for  
3,130 yards with 23 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In everything I do, I want to win,'' he said. ``It doesn't  
matter what it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody right now is trying to get into position to get what  
they want. Right now, I'd say 100 percent of these teams don't know 
exactly what they want.''

	NATO Pressure Remains on Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- The deadline for Kosovo peace talks  
may have been extended Saturday, but preparations for NATO military 
action will continue. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said a 
Nato threat will remain until parties at the talks accept all 
provisions for autonomy for ethnic Albanians. ``It would be a grave 
mistake for (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic to miscalculate 
our intentions. ... We're not into endless extensions,'' she said. 
The United States and five other nations agreed to extend to 
Tuesday a deadline for the peace plan. NATO had threatened 
airstrikes against the Serbs if they did not reach an agreement 
with Albanian insurgents by noon Saturday.

	2 Trains Stopped Because of Threat  
</P>
<P>
	HAVRE, Mont. (AP) -- Two passenger trains were halted in north  
central Montana on Saturday after Amtrak received a threat that a 
train was carrying radioactive material, federal authorities said. 
Sheriff Tim Solomon said eastbound and westbound Amtrak Empire 
Builder trains, which run between Chicago and Seattle, were stopped 
in Havre at about 6 p.m. EST. The trains were carrying a total of 
up to 350 passengers, who were being taken to a National Guard 
armory while crews made inspections. Inspectors did not immediately 
report finding any radioactive material.

	London Police Accused of Racism  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- London's police force was riven by institutional  
racism that was a key factor in its failure to thoroughly 
investigate the slaying six years ago of a black teen-ager, a 
newspaper quoted a government report as saying. The Sunday 
Telegraph published excerpts of the report on the death of 
18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in 1993. The 
inquiry, ordered in July 1997, has raised serious questions of 
police incompetence and highlighted racial antagonism in some 
rundown London districts. The Metropolitan Police have acknowledged 
they failed to investigate properly and apologized.

against gun makers, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said. He said he 
would present to the NAACP's 64-member Board of Directors several 
options, ranging from issuing a resolution that voices concern

<HEADLINE> Exercise Programs May Help Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An exercising worker is a happier and  
healthier worker, and may even save the boss a bit on health 
insurance if the worker joins the corporate wellness program and 
stays with it, studies find. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enthusiastic participation in worksite wellness programs can  
yield a variety of health benefits,'' said Dr. Roy J. Shephard of 
the University of Toronto. ``However, only a minority of employees 
participate in worksite wellness programs, and even fewer have the 
enthusiasm needed to achieve health benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The programs put exercise equipment and health advisers close to  
workers. And the programs have an added incentive -- the company 
picks up at least part of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	The result should be that workers' health should improve. And  
Shephard's review in a medical journal, The Physician and 
Sportsmedicine, reports that it does. For instance, studies found 
body fat fell 13 percent on average. 
</P>
<P>
	But weight losses are smaller -- around 2 percent -- when they are  
averaged across entire companies, including people who don't take 
part in the programs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants also were able to lower their blood pressure, and a  
relative few -- 1 percent to 3 percent -- quit smoking, the article 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers also can increase their aerobic power, but the amount  
reported depends on how much aerobic exercise they do and how 
carefully the company tracks the results, Shephard said. At a 
pioneering wellness program at Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the maker of 
healthcare products, women gained 7.4 percent and men gained 4.4 
percent after two years, compared with people who did not take 
part. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise commonly makes people feel better, and working out at  
work is no exception, Shephard said. Exercisers report more 
positive mood states. However, studies also have found that workers 
who worked out didn't necessarily improve their job satisfaction as 
a result, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line for a boss may be whether the program saves  
money on health care. The answer is yes, but not a lot, Shephard 
said. Studies find medical claims for health care are $100 to $400 
less for people who take part in company-sponsored wellness 
programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And program participants take a little less sick time -- maybe a  
half day per worker per year, he said. ``This may reflect an 
improved mood state or an increase in organizational loyalty rather 
than improved health,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, beginning exercisers may take a bit more time  
off with aches and pains they blame on their workouts, Shephard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, however, the programs seem worth the employers'  
commitment, the article said. ``The cumulative benefit has been 
estimated at $500 to $700 per worker per year, enough to cover the 
cost of a modest wellness program,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is in how to get workers to join and stay with the  
programs. That's not easy, because an estimated 25 percent of 
Americans do no exercise, noted Dr. Nicholas A. DiNubile, an 
orthopedic surgeon in Havertown, Pa. Physicians can encourage 
corporate fitness by speaking to executives about the 
cost-effectiveness of corporate fitness programs, he wrote in a 
separate article in the same issue of the medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
	And companies may see non-health-related benefits for wellness  
programs where there's a lot of corporate competition for quality 
employees, commented Tim Larson, human resources manager for Apple 
Computer Inc. at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No.1 reason is attraction and retention of employees,''  
Larson said. ``Silicon Valley is a really, really hot job market 
and most large companies have fitness centers and some wellness 
component.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple has never run the numbers to see if the program saved the  
corporation money or lost it, Larson said. However, Apple does make 
sure the program stays under cost controls, he said. For instance, 
Apple charges employees who take part, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, 75 percent of the program is covered by employee  
fees,'' Larson said. ``You can run a very successful program 
without running it free.'' In fact, requiring a fee may be better, 
because employees who are paying something are more likely to keep 
taking part -- so they get value for their money, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sargent's Work Displayed at Gallery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Singer Sargent, known as a great painter  
of celebrities, came to hate doing portraits. Now the National 
Gallery of Art is showing how beautifully he could do landscapes 
and almost anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and America both claim Sargent, and this is the first  
large-scale exhibit of his work seen in either country -- 113 
paintings and watercolors from public and private collections all 
over the world, including some of his best work. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Florence, trained in Paris, a lover of Venetian canals  
but working most of his life in London, Sargent was 20 when he made 
his first trip to his parents' hometown of Philadelphia. He 
disliked the summer heat and after four months was back in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Sargent's reputation has recently been undergoing a  
reassessment, and he is now recognized as one of the great painters 
of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, say National Gallery 
Director Earl A. Powell III and Nicholas Serota, director of 
London's Tate Gallery, who organized the show, which begins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	They call the exhibit the first attempt to pull together all  
aspects of Sargent's work since the shows shortly after his death 
in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after that, many critics were deriding Sargent as  
old-fashioned, his realistic work out of the swim when painters 
like Pablo Picasso were distorting the outside world to portray 
what was happening inside their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Sargent was indeed no revolutionary, but some of his portraits  
were highly unusual. When he did ``The Daughters of Edward Darley 
Boit'' -- an American expatriate friend -- the picture left out the 
mother who customarily appeared in such pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sargent did not group the girls but scattered them around a  
big room in their Paris apartment: one leaning against a huge vase, 
another next to her but turned away, a third at a distance looking 
at the painter, and the fourth even further, sitting on the floor 
with a doll. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics found it beautiful, but dark, strange, moody, disturbing  
and somehow unnatural. Pretty and wealthy, none of the four girls 
ever married. 
</P>
<P>
	Another portrait created a scandal that helped drive Sargent  
from Paris to London: His dramatic full-length depiction of the 
snooty-looking Virginie Gautreau, an American whose father died in 
the Civil War. She came from New Orleans and married a French 
banker. 
</P>
<P>
	The hubbub of talk and criticism did not concern her relations  
with Sargent, although there was plenty of gossip about her. 
Instead it broke over the picture itself -- the cleavage and the 
slipped shoulder-strap of her long black evening gown, and her 
dead-looking skin. She was said to take small doses of arsenic to 
keep it white. 
</P>
<P>
	Sargent himself described her complexion as ``uniform lavender  
or blotting paper color all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother complained about the picture.  
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter is lost -- everyone in Paris is making fun of  
her,'' she told Sargent. ``My son-in-law will have to challenge you 
to a duel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Sargent painted the strap back onto her shoulder. He  
eventually sold the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 
New York, insisting that it be labeled ``Madame X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hoopla, Sargent continued to find plenty of sitters  
in Britain and America -- maybe too many. Some of his later 
portraits were criticized as weak and superficial, and he himself 
called some of them ``mug shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I paint a portrait I make at least one enemy,''  
Sargent joked. 
</P>
<P>
	A cartoonist depicted a bevy of duchesses lined up in front of  
his studio. Sargent is looking gloomily at them out a window. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, despite his success, Sargent revolted against what he  
sometimes called ``paughtraits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sargent spent much of his last 30 years painting murals for  
public buildings in the Boston area. Although he did much of the 
work in Britain, he supervised the installation himself -- 
occasionally insisting on changes in the architecture. The series 
in the Boston Public library is the ``Triumph of Religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sargent died suddenly in London on the eve of sailing to install  
his murals in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. They are being 
refurbished to be ready when the National Gallery show moves there 
after it closes in Washington May 31. It will be in Boston from 
June 23 through Sept. 26.

<HEADLINE> Italy Telecom To Fight Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Communications ``Goliath'' Telecom Italia plans to  
challenge Olivetti's bold $58 billion takeover bid, which, if 
pulled off by a relative David of the telecommunications industry, 
would be one of Europe's biggest deals ever. 
</P>
<P>
	After a flurry of hastily called board meetings this weekend by  
Telecom Italia SpA and Telecom Italia Mobile, Europe's biggest 
mobile phone operator which is largely owned by Telecom Italia -- as 
well as by Olivetti SpA -- Telecom Italia issued a terse statement 
claiming there were holes in Olivetti's notice of its intention to 
acquire all of Telecom Italia's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countermoves being studied,'' was how Milan daily Corriere  
della Sera on Sunday summed up the strategy at Telecom Italia, a 
former state monopoly and the world's sixth-largest phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's plan is ``that of David, who, with a handful of  
shares and indebting himself up to ears, makes an assault in the 
stock market,'' Corriere della Sera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few years ago, Olivetti was forced to resort to heavy  
layoffs because of its money-losing PC division. It eventually shed 
the computer division, plunging instead into telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	If Olivetti's filing with Italy's stock market regulatory body  
Consob -- made public Saturday -- fails to provide all the 
information required by law, as Telecom Italia has implied, then it 
would be free to try to counter the bid, perhaps by raising share 
prices and making a takeover too costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Among potential problems could be Olivetti's plan to raise some  
of the cash by selling off its mobile operator, fast-growing 
Omnitel Pronto Italia, as well as fixed-line operator Infostrada, 
to Mannesmann AG, a German industrial holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government granted permission for Omnitel's  
operating license on condition that it not be sold off for five 
years, and there is another year to go on that condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti and Mannesman control those two via a holding company  
50.1 percent owned by Olivetti and 49.9 percent owned by 
Mannesmann, the biggest rival to the former German telephone 
monopoly Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany on Sunday, Mannesmann said it will pay Olivetti $8.45  
billion for its stakes in Omnitel and Infostrada if the takeover 
bid succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Possibly further complicating maneuvers is that the Italian  
treasury ministry's so-called ``golden share'' in Telecom Italia, 
which was privatized in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While holding just 3.4 percent of common stock, the ministry has  
veto powers over major decisions through 2000. Specifically, the 
state can block acquisition of more than 3 percent by an investor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government isn't an inert spectator. It's vigilant and  
attentive on this affair,'' communications ministry undersecretary 
Vincenzo Vita said Sunday. ``There are risks of 'denationalization' 
for a great company like Telecom Italia, there are speculative 
risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some union leaders have raised concern that such a costly  
operation would mean lots of job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto Colaninno, with the  
company since 1996, claimed the takeover would be an 
``extraordinary occasion for the entire country'' and described the 
bid as ``an industrial operation, not financial speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out that there was a hidden ally behind the takeover  
bid, specifically Bell Atlantic Co., a U.S. communications company, 
or Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti, a former Olivetti 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid relies heavily on debt financing from three U.S. banks --  
Chase Manhattan Bank, Lehman Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin and 
Jenrette -- as well as Italy's Mediobanca.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Deal Includes Moving Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The deal to bring the New England  
Patriots to Hartford includes expenses that were not part of the 
Legislative spending bill, including up to $750,000 the state must 
pay to physically relocate the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement took three months for more than a dozen lawyers to  
negotiate. The document was signed Feb. 12 by Gov. John G. Rowland 
and Patriots owner Robert Kraft and includes a number of aspects 
favorable to the Patriots that were not in the bill passed by the 
General Assembly in December. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The state will pick up the tab to move the team and its  
offices from Massachusetts to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The state has already begun paying the costs of the $374  
million stadium project, including the team's legal fees and the 
hiring of architects. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal falls through, the state is expected to pay all  
costs incurred up to that point. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The team will be allowed to negotiate an incentive agreement  
if it brings the stadium construction project in below budget. 
</P>
<P>
	--The team can use as collateral for loans the hundreds of  
millions of dollars in revenue expected over the 30-year term of 
the deal. The Hartford revenues would replace revenues from the 
Patriots' current home, Foxboro Stadium, to secure team debts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not intended to be, 'Here's a source of revenue so you  
can build 50 new skyboxes in Foxboro,' '' said Brendan M. Fox Jr., 
executive director of the Capital City Economic Development 
Authority. ``It's to facilitate the move of the team to Hartford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The waiver by the state, Connecticut officials say, made it  
easier to lock the Patriots into a 30-year deal without an escape 
once the stadium is built. If the team breaks the lease, they will 
be required to pay up to $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has made other concessions, including a provision in  
the development agreement that gives the Patriots the right to sue 
the state -- as if it was a private business -- in the event of a 
dispute over the revenue guarantees the state has made for the sale 
of club seats at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is obligated to spend $280 million for the stadium  
construction, and $94 million for site cleanup and acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots must pick up the difference if the stadium exceeds  
$280 million, and invest at least $70 million for an NFL 
entertainment and dining pavilion and convention center as part of 
the Adriaen's Landing project. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement requires the stadium to be built by 2002 barring  
any uncontrollable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	If that deadline is not met because the state failed to prepare  
the site or come up with the money, the Patriots can terminate the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are several deadlines in the meantime at which the  
state or the team could walk away from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The state must come up with a plan by Oct. 31 explaining how it  
will relocate a steam plant considered the main location for the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft and the state can consider building the stadium elsewhere  
if the polluted site can't be cleaned or the plant can't be 
relocated. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is also contingent upon approval from the National  
Football League. If the NFL does not give its blessing to the pact 
by October, both sides can walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials say they will know whether the deal will come  
through by next February -- when the state must certify that it can 
release $280 million in bond funds that will be used to build the 
stadium.

<HEADLINE> Enjoy the Moment Wins Las Flores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Enjoy the Moment went to the lead at the  
start and was never threatened in winning Sunday's $131,200 Las 
Flores Handicap by three lengths over Tomorrows Sunshine at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Laffit Pincay, Enjoy the Moment covered six furlongs  
in 1:08 2-5, one-fifth of a second off the stakes record set by 
Stormy But Valid in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Pincay's 8,704th career winner. The 52-year-old is 130  
wins from breaking Bill Shoemaker's all-time record of 8,833 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very surprised at the fast fractions because she was  
just galloping out there,'' Pincay said. ``But she fools you 
because she's unbelievably fast. She was just very powerful. She 
was back to her best race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enjoy the Moment paid $6.40, $4.60 and $4.80. Tomorrows Sunshine  
returned $12.60 and $6.60, while Closed Escrow was another length 
back in third and paid $5 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was Enjoy the Moment's sixth in nine starts. The  
4-year-old filly was coming off a sixth-place finish in the Santa 
Monica Handicap. She came out of that race with congested lungs and 
was treated with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $78,720, increased Enjoy the Moment's  
earnings to $226,780.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street on Inflation Watch / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite widespread reports that inflation is  
dead and gone, investors in the Wall Street markets haven't stopped 
worrying about it. 
</P>
<P>
	On the contrary, they have pushed bond interest rates higher in  
recent weeks, registering heightened worries that inflationary 
pressures might be heating up again. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts think this scare isn't going to amount to much.  
Powerful disinflationary forces are still at work in the economy, 
they say, including the revolutionary efficiencies being wrought by 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the situation demonstrates that fears of inflation are still  
easily stirred among a generation of investors that hasn't 
forgotten the bad old days of the 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation is dead and a wooden stake has been driven through  
its heart,'' says Jim Griffin at Aeltus Investment Management Inc. 
in Hartford, Conn. ``We know this for a fact because the world's 
leaders told us so. But markets can be recalcitrant, and so they 
have flirted lately with the idea that inflation lurks among the 
undead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rates on long-term Treasury bonds recently climbed to six-month  
highs above 5.4 percent, reflecting uneasiness in a market known 
for its sensitivity to inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar currents have been visible in the stock market too.  
Utility stocks, for instance, have been retreating lately, amid 
talk that the Federal Reserve might be more inclined to tighten 
credit conditions, and less likely to ease, as 1999 progresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expectations of Fed easing have been taken completely out of  
the curve,'' says Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter &AMP; Co. ``U.S. fixed-income markets are now discounting a 
central bank that effectively remains on hold through midyear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American economy has been stronger over the past few months  
than almost everyone thought it would be in the aftermath of 
currency and debt problems in Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many observers who have been warning of the  
dangers of deflation, rather than inflation, say the threat of a 
worsening global economic slump hasn't gone away. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of last year, I expected that weaker profits would  
cause companies to cut back on employment and capital spending,'' 
says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities 
Inc. in New York. ``Instead, job growth and capital outlays remain 
robust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Yardeni argues, ``By the second half a slowdown is  
likely, especially when compared to the current extraordinary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect that pricing will remain weak in energy and basic  
materials, and that disinflationary and deflationary pressures will 
spread to other sectors, especially technology, capital goods, 
consumer staples and consumer durables.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On balance, however, the scales on the Street definitely have  
tipped lately in the direction of inflation, rather than deflation, 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
	As Roach puts it, ``Growth is great. And for a fourth year in a  
row, the United States is getting much more of it than many ever 
dreamed possible, including the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the day is coming when growth will be bad -- when a fully  
employed U.S. economy has effectively run out of wiggle room to 
hold on a path of non-inflationary expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a world still perceived to be closer to deflation than  
reflation, most believe these considerations ring hollow. But as a 
vigorous U.S. economy continues to up the growth ante, the denial 
could finally crack.''

<HEADLINE> `Shakespeare In Love' Wins Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The authors of the romantic comedy  
``Shakespeare In Love'' beat the writers of the harrowing war drama 
``Saving Private Ryan'' to win the Writers Guild of America award 
for original screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard shared the award for  
``Shakespeare,'' which bested ``Bulworth,'' with screenplay by 
Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser; ``Saving Private Ryan,'' by Robert 
Rodat; ``The Truman Show,'' by Andrew Niccol; and ``The Opposite of 
Sex,'' by Don Roos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of Sight'' was the guild's pick for best screenplay based  
on material previously produced or published. The screenplay, 
written by Scott Frank, was based on a novel by Elmore Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
	Other contenders for this award were ``A Civil Action,'' by  
Steven Zaillian, based on the book by Jonathan Harr; ``Gods and 
Monsters,'' by Bill Condon, based on the novel by Christopher Bram; 
``Primary Colors,'' by Elaine May, based on the novel by Anonymous; 
and ``A Simple Plan,'' by Scott B. Smith, based on his novel. 
</P>
<P>
	The guild's 51st annual awards were announced Saturday in  
ceremonies held in Beverly Hills and New York.

<HEADLINE> Berlin Games a Boost for Brundage? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A construction company run by former IOC  
president Avery Brundage stood to benefit by the selection of 
Berlin as host of the 1936 Olympics, The New York Times reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The story also implicates two other past IOC presidents -- Henri  
de Baillet-Latour of Belgium and Sigfrid Edstrom of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	The story in the Times uses the current bribery scandal  
engulfing IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch as a backdrop, 
suggesting the problem facing the Olympic leadership is ``deeper, 
older and more profound than what has been presented as a shabby 
case of some Sydney and Salt Lake City payoffs for IOC votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times drew on the resources of the Simon Wiesenthal Center,  
a Los Angeles organization devoted to keeping alive the memory of 
the Holocaust and combating human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaders of the Olympics violated their own rules; they sold  
their souls,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the 
center. ``They injected politics into sports and they fudged the 
lines between business and amateurism.''

expensive preparations for the Olympic Games if all this unrest 
prevails.''

<HEADLINE> Italy Telecom To Fight Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- In a twist on the David-and-Goliath story,  
relatively small Olivetti SpA is attempting to orchestrate a $58 
billion takeover of Telecom Italia SpA, the world's sixth-largest 
phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Telecom Italia SpA isn't going to be taken down easily,  
issuing a terse statement that there were holes in Olivetti's 
notice of its intention to acquire all of Telecom Italia's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countermoves being studied,'' was how Milan daily Corriere  
della Sera on Sunday summed up the strategy at Telecom Italia, a 
former state monopoly and the world's sixth-largest phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's plan is ``that of David, who, with a handful of  
shares and indebting himself up to ears, makes an assault in the 
stock market,'' Corriere della Sera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few years ago, Olivetti was forced to resort to heavy  
layoffs because of its money-losing PC division. It eventually shed 
the computer division, plunging instead into telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	If Olivetti's filing with Italy's stock market regulatory body  
Consob -- made public Saturday -- fails to provide all the 
information required by law, as Telecom Italia has implied, then it 
would be free to try to counter the bid, perhaps by raising share 
prices and making a takeover too costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is a counter bid by Telecom Italia Mobile,  
Europe's biggest-mobile phone operator. Telecom Italia owns 60 
percent of TIM. 
</P>
<P>
	Among potential problems could be Olivetti's plan to raise some  
of the cash by selling off its mobile operator, fast-growing 
Omnitel Pronto Italia, as well as fixed-line operator Infostrada, 
to Mannesmann AG, a German industrial holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government granted permission for Omnitel's  
operating license on condition that it not be sold off for five 
years, and there is another year to go on that condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti and Mannesman control those two via a holding company  
50.1 percent owned by Olivetti and 49.9 percent owned by 
Mannesmann, the biggest rival to the former German telephone 
monopoly Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany on Sunday, Mannesmann said it will pay Olivetti $8.45  
billion for its stakes in Omnitel and Infostrada if the takeover 
bid succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Possibly further complicating maneuvers is that the Italian  
treasury ministry's so-called ``golden share'' in Telecom Italia, 
which was privatized in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While holding just 3.4 percent of common stock, the ministry has  
veto powers over major decisions through 2000. Specifically, the 
state can block acquisition of more than 3 percent by an investor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government isn't an inert spectator. It's vigilant and  
attentive on this affair,'' communications ministry undersecretary 
Vincenzo Vita said Sunday. ``There are risks of 'denationalization' 
for a great company like Telecom Italia, there are speculative 
risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some union leaders have raised concern that such a costly  
operation would mean lots of job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto Colaninno, with the  
company since 1996, claimed the takeover would be an 
``extraordinary occasion for the entire country'' and described the 
bid as ``an industrial operation, not financial speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out that there was a hidden ally behind the takeover  
bid, specifically Bell Atlantic Co., a U.S. communications company, 
or Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti, a former Olivetti 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid is also relying heavily on debt financing from three  
U.S. banks -- Chase Manhattan Bank, Lehman Brothers and Donaldson, 
Lufkin and Jenrette -- as well as Italy's Mediobanca.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Drop Below $1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices didn't even flinch at moving  
below the $1 barrier, dropping more than 1 1/2 cents to set another 
new all-time low, an industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average, including all grades and taxes, was 99.8  
cents per gallon Friday, down 1.61 cents from two weeks earlier, 
according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Stil it may be nearing its low point, warned analyst Trilby  
Lundberg on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price cutting is faster and deeper than it's been so far  
this year, but it is probably fizzing out,'' she said. ``Behind the 
average price fall are a few lonely no-change (prices) or price 
hikes here and there, from which I infer that retailers and their 
suppliers can't take it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices have been steadily dropping for 1 1/2 years thanks  
to an oversupply of crude and refined oil products, creating the 
lowest prices in the history of the retail gas market when adjusted 
for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	An increased spring demand for gasoline and more expensive  
seasonal antismog blending processes will probably bring the price 
declines to an end soon, Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average prices at self-service stations was 93.63 cents per  
gallon for regular gasoline, $1.0475 for mid-grade and $1.1327 for 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.4027 for regular, $1.4937 for  
mid-grade and $1.5680 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Rod Beck Looks To Duplicate Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- His long hair sweating from beneath his cap,  
Rod Beck stopped on his way between practice fields Sunday to pose 
for a picture, wrapped his arm around a fan he didn't know and 
smiled as he awaited the flash. 
</P>
<P>
	He might be the guy next door. He might be the guy on the next  
bar stool, or the guy flying by on his motorcycle. He is, for sure, 
the guy who saved 51 games last season for the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his on-the-mound delivery where his pitching arm  
dangles and swings just before he throws to the plate, the 
mustachioed Beck is also recognized for a less-than-svelte physique 
that has long been a topic of discussion. It's a subject Beck 
doesn't dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	The reliever known as ``Shooter'' once said: ``I sure don't  
think of myself as a fat person, just someone who carries extra 
weight. I've never seen anyone on the DL with pulled fat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck spent his off-season refurbishing his house in the Phoenix  
area and then headed to New Orleans earlier this year to work with 
trainer Mackie Shilstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I've been doing for 10 years now. I just make  
it a point to go down there. For me it's a boot camp, and it gets 
me going,'' said Beck, who weighed in at about 245 as the Cubs 
started spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first started going down there, I used to go for five  
or six weeks at a time. At this point I go down for a week, maybe 
two and get a jump start and give myself a base to work with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck converted 51-of-58 save opportunities and led the NL with  
81 appearances. He got his 250th career save in the Cubs' 5-3 
victory over his former team, the San Francisco Giants, in a 
one-game playoff for the NL wild-card and then made an appearance 
in Game 3 of the divisional playoffs, where he was roughed up by 
the Braves for three runs in 1 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times I didn't have the fastball I'd like to have,'' Beck  
said of his late-season pitching. ``But my arm doesn't hurt at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the fifth reliever in major league history to reach 50 saves,  
Beck brushed off the mark. It's the percentage that's important to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a lot of saves, but you can't get 51 if you only got  
40 opportunities,'' Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I start out every year in spring training is to get the  
best percentage of saves I can with the opportunities I'm given. 
Other than that, the rest of it is out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And control, not velocity, is what Beck is known for, the reason  
he's been successful. His strikeout-to-walk ratio is more than 
4-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got a lot of movement on the ball, and you don't have to  
really throw that hard to get people out,'' said new Cubs catcher 
Bent Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He uses his head pretty good, and he's got pitches that go  
down and move in and move away. So it's pretty hard to hit. It's 
not that easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs liked what they saw and in the offseason gave Beck, 30,  
a new two-year deal with a club option for a third. Beck will get 
$5.5 million in 1999 and $3.5 million in 2000. The Cubs' option for 
2001 is for $4.5 million with a $500,000 buyout.

<HEADLINE> Restaurant Has Pea-nutty Obsession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Taking the old school lunch standard to culinary  
heights, Lee Zalben is confident his restaurant's peanut butter 
obsession has enough adult appeal to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids aren't the only ones who love the sticky stuff, but most  
people, young and old, are used to smearing it on bread, baking it 
into cookies or even spooning it straight from the jar -- at home. 
</P>
<P>
	But peanut butter in a restaurant? Ordered off a menu and served  
by a waitress for $5 to $6 a sandwich? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the idea behind Peanut Butter &AMP; Co.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to take something that people love and want and  
need and elevate it to another level,'' said Zalben, 25. ``This is 
very much an experience; it's not just a sandwich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The experience goes far beyond the Skippy on Wonder bread  
lunchbox staple of American youth. 
</P>
<P>
	At Peanut Butter &AMP; Co., peanut butter comes in six varieties --  
creamy, crunchy, spicy, cinnamon raisin, chocolate chip and white 
chocolate -- which are mixed into 13 different sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
	Your basic PB&AMP;J is made on fresh-baked bread with gourmet  
strawberry or grape jam. Also available: peanut butter with 
Marshmallow Fluff or chocolate spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Craving something a little wilder?  
</P>
<P>
	How about a peanut butter BLT, or the Thai-inspired spicy peanut  
butter with grilled chicken and a dab of pineapple jelly? The 
biggest seller is the Elvis, inspired by the King's beloved grilled 
peanut butter sandwich with banana and honey. 
</P>
<P>
	Zalben and his staff grind their peanut butter daily and serve  
it on thick slices of fresh bread, with potato chips and carrot 
sticks on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-peanut-butter concept has raised a few eyebrows (and  
stuck to the roofs of a few mouths). 
</P>
<P>
	``If you tell me `Peanut butter and nothing but peanut butter,'  
count me out,'' sniffed Tim Zagat, who publishes the Zagat Surveys 
restaurant guides with his wife, Nina. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``I'm sure, on the other hand, there are people for whom  
peanut butter is the mother's milk,'' conceded Zagat, who has not 
been to Peanut Butter &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant plays hard on the idea of peanut butter as the  
ultimate ``comfort food.'' The shop's bright yellow walls, wooden 
tables and pastel Fiestaware plates are meant to evoke warm 
recollections of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think almost everyone has a special place in their heart for  
peanut butter,'' Zalben said. ``It brings back memories of sitting 
at the lunch table in elementary school, and for most people, that 
makes them smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peanut Butter &AMP; Co.'s food and ambiance bring back ``memories of  
being 5 years old and running home in the middle of the day for 
lunch, and your mom making Fluffernutters for you,'' said Dawn 
Lucas, 23, on her lunch break from a nearby advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Benjamin, a 25-year-old Manhattan product designer, said  
her PB&AMP;J on whole wheat brought her back, but ``not to my 
childhood. Maybe my fantasy childhood. ... 'Leave it to Beaver' or 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those whose image of paradise doesn't include peanut butter,  
the menu does have alternatives -- tuna, grilled cheese, chicken 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Peanut Butter &AMP; Co.'s novelty could wear off, Zagat  
said the narrowness of its niche isn't necessarily a liability. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a bunch of restaurants that just serve french fries,  
and there are some places that really just serve hot dogs,'' he 
said. ``They might have a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But will diners really keep paying $5 to $6 for a meal most  
could put together out of the pantry -- not to mention for much 
less? 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it would be cheaper if we made it ourselves,'' said  
Mark Kawar, 20, a New York University junior. ``But that's why you 
go out.''

	US, British Jets Attack Iraqi Bases  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. and British warplanes attacked an  
Iraqi missile base and two military communication sites today after 
Iraqi jets violated the no-fly zone, the U.S. military said. There 
was no immediate word on damage or casualties from the strikes near 
al-Amarah and Tallil. All the planes returned to their base, a 
statement from the U.S. Central Command said. Earlier, the official 
Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi air defenses may have shot down a 
Western military plane in southern Iraq. But the United States and 
Britain denied any planes were lost.

	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, making scant headway toward a Kosovo peace settlement, 
said today that if neither Serbs nor ethnic Albanians accept the 
six-nation plan, NATO cannot carry through on its threat to attack 
Serb targets. With a new deadline set for Tuesday, Serb negotiators 
``are not engaging at all'' over the critical question of whether 
NATO peacekeepers would enforce the settlement, while the Kosovar 
Albanians must still be persuaded to sign on fully with the plan to 
give them greater autonomy in the Serb province, Albright said.

about moving to New York to straighten things out. Well, let me say 
with all due respect, we don't need liberal Democrats moving from

again that he may need to submit for pre-publication review a book 
expected to criticize the Clinton administration. A spokesman for 
the Defense Threat Reduction Agency said today that a letter was 
sent to Ritter's attorneys, saying that, under the contracts Ritter 
signed with the agency, any publication discussing the work he did 
hunting for illegal weapons in Iraq must first be submitted for 
governmental review. Ritter's lawyer calls the latest Pentagon

under a program that would trace these guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms released an analysis today of its Youth Crime 
Gun Interdiction Initiative. The program traced guns used in 76,260 
crimes in 27 cities over the past three years. President Clinton's

<HEADLINE> Germans Finish 1-2 in Ski Jumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISCHOFSHOFEN, Austria (AP) -- A daring Martin Schmitt produced a  
huge second jump to lead a 1-2 German finish Sunday in the large 
hill ski jumping event at the Nordic Ski World Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt, this year's sensation on the World Cup circuit with  
seven victories, leaped 129.5 meters off the K120 hill in the 
second series to beat countryman Sven Hannawald and Japan's 
Hideharu Miyahira. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to take risks and I was very eager to win the gold,''  
Schmitt said after mastering rainy and foggy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The final result reversed the order of the first heat, when  
Hannawald jumped 127 meters and Schmitt 126. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt's second jump was the longest of the day and gave him a  
total of 263.4 points. Hannawald, whose second leap also was 127 
meters, had 261.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone expected me to win and I was under a lot of  
pressure,'' said Schmitt, only in his third season as a ski jumper. 
Last year, Schmitt helped Germany win the silver medal in the team 
event at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyahira had jumps of 125.5 and 128 meters for 258.8 points and  
third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt, 21, has become hugely popular in Germany with his  
outgoing personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first jump was not 100 percent, but it was still quite  
long,'' Schmitt said. ``The second was super. I showed 
determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitt became the first German world champion since Jens  
Weissflog won on the normal hill 10 years ago. Schmitt won on a 
hill where he lost the overall victory in the prestigious Four Hill 
Tour last month by slipping to a disappointing 14th place. 
</P>
<P>
	Janne Ahonen of Finland, the 1997 normal hill world champion and  
World Cup leader, took fourth place, ahead of Kazuyoshi Funaki of 
Japan, the Olympic normal hill champion, and Masahiko Harada, 
another Japanese who was the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Alborn of Anchorage, Alaska, was the top American. He  
placed 27th after jumps of 109 and 101 meters for 173 points.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Economy Worst Since 1931 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's economy failed to grow last  
year, its worst performance since 1931, a leading association of 
banks and financial institutions said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No growth, as has been calculated for last year, represents a  
true economic and social disaster,'' the National Association of 
Financial Institutions said in its weekly analysis of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	If confirmed by official figures -- which have not yet been  
released -- it would be the first time the economy has failed to 
grow since 1931, when it shrank 1.6 percent, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials had predicted 2 percent growth for 1998,  
but the economy nose-dived during the past few months. Economists 
blame high interest rates, new taxes, guerrilla violence and low 
oil prices in the oil-producing South American nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The government predicts 1 percent growth for this year, but  
Armando Montenegro, head of the association, said zero growth is 
likely again.

<HEADLINE> Madonna: I'm the Lucci of Grammys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The analogy isn't quite accurate, but Madonna  
characterizes her frustration over a career with just one Grammy 
award by saying, ``I'm the Susan Lucci of the music industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing herself to the ``All My Children'' soap opera star  
nominated annually for best actress daytime Emmys but never a 
winner, Madonna won a Grammy for best video in 1991. She'll be up 
for five Grammys at Wednesday's awards show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get too attached to the idea of whether I'm  
going to win or not,'' Madonna says in Sunday's Daily News. ``If 
you get too attached to winning, then you get upset if you lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna latest album, ``Ray of Light,'' is her biggest critical  
success and her best-selling album since 1989's ``Like a Prayer.'' 
At age 40, the pop star has embraced motherhood, a factor she sees 
as a possible reason for her multiple Grammy nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do see me as a less threatening individual now,''  
Madonna said. ``Perhaps that has something to do with it. 
Motherhood has made me, in a lot of people's eyes, more respectable 
and acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna is nominated for record of the year, album of the year,  
dance recording, pop album and short form music video.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Ventura Goes to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tourists gawked and reporters thronged to his  
side. In a town of politicians, this was no ordinary one. Jesse 
Ventura, Minnesota's wrestler-turned-governor, had come to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd better be nice to me at the White House,'' said  
Ventura, reveling in the attention. ``Otherwise I might get Al's 
job that he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al is Vice President Al Gore, who wants to get elected president  
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a more serious vein, Ventura said he doesn't really want to  
be president, but he's still one of the stars of the National 
Governors' Association annual winter meeting that started Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the meeting, which includes dinner Sunday night at the  
White House, will be like ``going to school'' because of the chance 
to seek advice from fellow governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who was elected last fall on the Reform Party ticket,  
made clear he intends to maintain his independence. He declined an 
invitation from Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon, to join a meeting of 
the Democratic governors Saturday afternoon and instead went to the 
Washington Mall to pose for pictures with the nation's other 
independent governor, Angus King of Maine. They were mobbed by 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we are two independents and we're getting more press than  
those two Democratic and Republican parties ever thought of 
getting, because we're the movement,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters are tired of partisanship, said King. ``They just want  
the problems solved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, sitting for an interview with reporters, Ventura  
expressed an eclectic range of views on issues ranging from the 
role of the federal government to Indian policy. 
</P>
<P>
	On the federal government: ``I'm a great believer in power to  
the states. ... If there's a state that you don't agree with their 
policies, then you have 49 more states that you can go to live. If 
the federal government continues to grow and dominate, then that 
limits where you can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned how Indian tribes can claim to be sovereign at the  
same time they ask the government for help. ``Are you part of the 
United States or are you a sovereign nation? If you're your own 
sovereign nation, then take care of yourselves.'' Pressed to 
elaborate, he said he didn't have an opinion on whether the federal 
government should cut aid to tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he respected the presidency but declined to say  
whether he respects President Clinton personally. ``I will just say 
that if I would have behaved in that manner, Minnesota wouldn't 
have to worry, I would have resigned.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Give Bush a Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republican governors rallied Sunday to  
the side of George W. Bush, their Texas colleague who is 
increasingly likely to seek the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who says he's ``warming to the task'' of seeking the White  
House, was the hot commodity at the National Governors' Association 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he will run and be a great president,'' said Oklahoma  
Gov. Frank Keating, chairman of the Republican Governors' 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``He appeals to other-than-Republican voters, African-Americans  
and Hispanics,'' said Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut. ``It's not 
just his compassionate touch; he's very intelligent and politically 
astute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even a Democratic supporter of Vice President Al Gore, Gov.  
Frank O'Bannon of Indiana, commended Bush for focusing on 
education. And he marveled at Bush's star appeal. ``I was walking 
into of one of these meetings when this big crowd started pushing 
and shoving, smashing me aside,'' O'Bannon said. ``Cameras and 
everything. It was him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Bush swept past, the Indiana governor found himself  
apologizing for getting in the way. ``I said, `I'm sorry. I'm 
sorry,''' O'Bannon recalled with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Gov. John Engler is Bush's unofficial point man with  
the governors. He called a handful of chief executives last week to 
ask if they would support Bush. The work continued Sunday. A senior 
Bush political adviser said at least two-thirds of the 31 GOP 
governors have offered their support if he runs for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush advisers, all of whom speak on condition of anonymity, say  
he is more likely than ever to run. A second aide said two weeks 
ago there was a good chance his boss would not seek the presidency; 
the aide had a different view Sunday: ``I can't see him not 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that seems to bother Bush is the prospect of his  
personal life being scrutinized. Bush told Texas reporters Sunday 
that he will not expand on his earlier refusal to discuss whether 
he has ever used drugs. ``I will say that the rumors I'm hearing 
around here are totally ridiculous, and I would hope that the 
Washington press corps would be careful about gossip and rumors,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler said no formal endorsements would be made at this week's  
NGA meeting, but they could come later. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the keys to being successful is having governors very  
involved in the campaign,'' Engler said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he runs, Bush's backing won't be unanimous among the GOP  
governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of them, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Don Sundquist of  
Tennessee, are working for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, 
who ran for president in 1996 and will try again. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson has another candidate in mind:  
himself. Thompson said Sunday he would like to run for president, 
but only if front-runners such as Bush and Elizabeth Dole faltered. 
Thompson, quoted recently as saying Bush has ``not done much as a 
governor,'' said Sunday that Bush would be a good candidate, though 
his record in Texas is not as strong as other governors. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki also is raising his national profile  
with the White House in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the GOP governors Bush expects support from are Tom Ridge  
of Pennsylvania, Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, Marc Racicot of 
Montana and Bill Graves of Kansas, who could become prospects for 
vice president or Cabinet posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Always coy about his intentions, Bush stopped short of  
confirming that Engler was doing his bidding in trying to 
accelerate a Bush bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is talking to people about what `warming to the task'  
means, that's fine by me,'' Bush said during a brief interview in a 
break between NGA sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor ate breakfast with Engler on Saturday, the  
opening day of the conference, and was meeting privately with 
several other state executives before the meeting ends Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also met with potential presidential campaign donors  
Saturday, part of an aggressive nationwide effort to build a 
fund-raising base that can be triggered the day he announces his 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's Texas friends and allies of his father, former President  
George Bush, are already being recruited to join the campaign if 
Bush gives the green light. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush still intends by April to bow out of the campaign or take  
the next step by forming a presidential exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The father of teen-age twin daughters, Bush sounds uneasy about  
the impact a campaign would have on his family. He said the 
daughters have told him, ``Dad, we love you. But don't do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Bush quickly adds, ``Their opinion matters a lot to me, but  
the final decision rests with me. ... My girls mean a lot to me, 
but so does the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and Democratic governors alike were guests at a White  
House dinner Sunday night, where President Clinton exchanged toasts 
with Gov. Thomas R. Carper, D-Del., chairman of the governors 
association. Dancing was on the card afterward, with music provided 
by the J Street Jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was scheduled to address the governors Monday  
morning and then join them for another dinner Monday night at the 
National Building Museum.

	Albright, Albanians Talk Kosovo Deal  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
talked at length today with ethnic Albanians, seeking to lock in 
their tentative approval of a peace plan for Kosovo. Her aim was to 
put additional pressure on the Serbs to accept the deployment of 
NATO peacekeepers to enforce any peace agreement reached for the 
embattled province. But she met with four Albanian leaders for 
about 90 minutes without getting their final approval for the plan 
proposed by the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans. The 
Contact Group -- consisting of the United States, France, Britain, 
Germany, Italy and Russia -- agreed to extend the deadline for peace 
talks from noon yesterday until 3 p.m. on Tuesday after some 
progress was reported.

	Suspects in Ireland Attacked Nabbed

<P>
	DUNDALK, Ireland (AP) -- Police on both sides of the Irish border  
arrested suspects today in last year's car bombing in Omagh, the 
deadliest terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict. 
In the Irish Republic, five men were detained under Ireland's 
Offenses Against the State Act anti-terrorist laws that permits 
suspects to be kept in custody for up to 48 hours before being 
either charged or released. Detectives in Northern Ireland also 
made some arrests, but would only say that a ``number'' of people 
were being questioned. Police have so far arrested more than 60 
suspects, but no one has been charged in connection with the Aug. 
15 car bombing that killed 29 people and wounded 370.

	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The official Iraqi News Agency reported

in southern Iraq, but the United States and Britain denied any 
planes were lost. ``Our air defenses have confronted the enemy 
aircraft and one of them seems to have been shot,'' INA quoted a 
military spokesman as saying. A Pentagon spokesman said that ``all 
morning flights were uneventful.'' Meanwhile, Gen. Henry H. 
Shelton, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, made his first 
stop on a Persian Gulf tour to discuss Iraqi threats against its 
neighbors in the aftermath of U.S. and British strikes. Shelton met 
today with Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan.

	Animosity Lingers for Clinton, GOP

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and congressional leaders  
mark the beginning of the post-impeachment Congress with a White 
House meeting Tuesday, but don't expect much beyond a shaky image 
of bipartisan cooperation. The session will be the first meeting in 
19 months between the president and Republican leaders. While both 
sides feel pressure from the public to demonstrate they are dealing 
with the nation's business, Republican distrust for Clinton runs 
deep, as do partisan divisions on Social Security and tax cuts.

well used as a mass grave on the outskirts of the Algerian capital, 
a newspaper reported. The bodies were retrieved near Oued Allel, 
the newspaper Liberte reported. The decision to search the well was 
based on information provided by a member of the Armed Islamic 
Group who turned himself in to police, the report said. An 
estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the start of the 
insurgency in 1992.

international jury, said the vote was unanimous for Malick's poetic 
film, which contrasts brutal battle scenes with beautiful nature 
shots and carries a strong anti-war message. ``It was important for

will take to finish the job because its biggest partner, the 
Russian Space Agency, has fallen behind schedule yet again. The 
Russian Space Agency's main contribution is a control module that's 
meant to double as the crew quarters. The Russian module should 
have soared in April 1998, then in December 1998, then in April 
1999, then in July 1999. Now an engineering evaluation by NASA 
shows that despite $60 million in U.S. assistance, the 43-foot 
compartment won't be ready to fly before September.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Census Debate Still Divided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Time is running out with neither side willing  
to budge on one the most intractable problems Congress will face 
this year: how to count Americans in the 2000 Census. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake in the once-a-decade measurement of population shifts  
is reapportioning the 435 House seats, redistricting state and 
local legislative bodies and distributing more than $180 billion in 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties say their abiding principle is an accurate census,  
but they're far apart on how to achieve it. In an early sign of 
troubles ahead, Democrats boycotted a House Government Reform 
census subcommittee vote on one aspect of a GOP plan that it says 
would improve the head count. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York,  
was out of the country at the time and accused subcommittee 
Chairman Dan Miller, R-Fla., of breaking an agreement by going 
ahead without her. Any foundation of trust, she said in a letter, 
``has suffered a serious weakening by your actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller fired back that ``bipartisanship is a two-way street.  
Your divisive comments in recent weeks calling into question the 
motives of individual members, including the speaker, leave doubt 
that comity is your goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the harsh words is the dispute over statistical sampling,  
an idea the National Academy of Sciences endorsed after the 1990 
census missed an estimated 4 million Americans, the first census 
that was less accurate than the previous one. Many of those not 
counted were minorities who usually vote Democratic, and 
reapportionment using sampling could work to the advantage of 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the sampling plan, the first 90 percent of the populace  
would be counted by traditional means, the last hard-to-reach 10 
percent by sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insist that sampling violates the constitutional  
requirement for ``actual enumeration'' of all Americans every 10 
years. Democrats say sampling is the only way to ensure equal 
representation. In 1990, Maloney said, counters missed one of every 
10 black males. ``We can't settle for a census that counts blacks 
as nine-tenths of a person,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his State of the Union address this year,  
again backed ``a census that uses the most modern scientific 
methods.'' He also showed his commitment to sampling in 1997 by 
vetoing the first version of a popular disaster relief bill in 
which the Republicans had inserted anti-sampling language. 
</P>
<P>
	In year-end budget talks last October, the two sides were so far  
apart on the census that they finally decided to approve money for 
the Commerce Department, which contains the Census Bureau and other 
agencies, only through June 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court weighed in last month with a decision that  
sampling cannot be used to determine how many members of Congress 
each state should have. But it left unsettled whether sampling was 
proper for state or local redistricting or to determine who gets 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court brought neither clarity nor closure,'' said  
TerriAnn Lowenthal, a consultant on census issues. ``The critics 
and supporters of sampling methods in Congress, at least in the 
short run, have become more polarized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will be a divisive issue if we are not treated  
fairly,'' said Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, the head of the House 
Democratic caucus. Frost is asking House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., to bring up a Democratic bill that would give legal status 
to sampling and supersede the Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau must soon come back to Congress with a new  
plan to reflect the high court's decision. Bureau officials said 
the outcome remains uncertain, and they may in the end offer 
several alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the bureau has spent ``six years and $1 billion in  
planning an illegal census.'' He said the court ruled for full 
enumeration, and ``I'm assuming they are going to agree with 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has not ruled out using some post-census adjustments to  
better determine federal funding but rejects the idea of a 
two-track count where the Census Bureau uses both traditional and 
sampling methods. ``If we have a two-number census,'' he said, ``we 
are going to have two failed censuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the backing of the GOP leadership, Miller has introduced an  
$800 million package of measures aimed at increasing accuracy 
without using sampling. The first part, the bill the committee 
approved over the Democratic boycott, would allow local officials 
to ask the Census Bureau to recheck its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	But both the present Census Bureau director, Kenneth Prewitt,  
and Bush administration director Barbara Everitt Bryant warn 
against congressional meddling in counting methods. 
</P>
<P>
	The census ``is the largest federal peacetime activity,'' Bryant  
told Miller's subcommittee. ``It should not be designed ad hoc at 
the 11th hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``With one year to go, the 11th hour is at hand.''

<HEADLINE> Turner Apologizes for Polish Joke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Ted Turner sought the forgiveness of  
Catholics after telling an ethic joke about the Polish pope. Now 
the media mogul has apologized to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The apology sent Sunday came two days after Poland's government  
threatened to halt cooperation with Turner's broadcasting company 
if he failed to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ted Turner deeply regrets offending the Polish people  
during a speech he made in Washington, D.C., last week,'' the 
statement from Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said. ``He has great 
respect for Poland and its people and extends his heartfelt 
apologies to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The joke came during an address to the National Family Planning  
and Reproductive Association, which advocates abortion and birth 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever seen a Polish mine detector?'' Turner asked. He then  
showed the audience his foot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement sent to the Catholic League on  
Wednesday, Turner apologized for insulting the pope with the joke 
and other comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's Deputy Interior Minister Radek Sikorski said Friday the  
CNN founder also must apologize to Poland or the government 
``reserved the right'' to halt cooperation with Time Warner Inc., 
which bought Turner's broadcasting empire in 1996.

<HEADLINE> More Delays for NASA Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Two months after launching the  
foundation of its new space station, NASA isn't sure how many more 
flights -- or how many more years -- will be needed to finish the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, NASA's biggest partner is to blame.  
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Space Agency has fallen behind yet again on its main  
contribution, a control module that's meant to double as the crew 
quarters. The upshot is more delays and rising costs for the 
international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for a supply trip by shuttle Discovery this May, all  
assembly missions are on hold until the Russians launch the control 
module, the crucial third piece of the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will launch. It's just a matter of when,'' says Frank  
Culbertson, NASA's deputy program manager for space station 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's so-called service module should have soared in April  
1998, then in December 1998, then in April 1999, then in July 1999. 
Now an engineering evaluation by NASA shows that despite $60 
million in U.S. assistance, the 43-foot compartment won't be ready 
to fly before September. 
</P>
<P>
	And it may not be ready before November.  
</P>
<P>
	Russia's economic crisis is to blame for the 1 1/2-year holdup --  
the Russian government simply is not providing enough money -- 
although computer software problems have emerged in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian space officials expect to more or less complete the  
service module next month and ship it from Moscow to the launch 
site in Kazakstan. Engineers typically need 4 1/2 months to eight 
months at the launch site, however, to prepare a space station 
component for flight, says Culbertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months of work would bump the launch of the service module  
to November. And that would bump everything else, including the 
arrival of the first permanent crew, penciled in for early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Culbertson says that while some Russian space officials are  
embarrassed about the situation, ``most of them are fairly 
pragmatic -- they've dealt with this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They know the schedule pressure that we are under from  
Congress and the need to keep things moving because it costs money 
when you delay,'' he says. ``But they also are not going to ship it 
before it's ready. They've been very clear about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's about the only clear message lately from Russia.  
</P>
<P>
	When NASA revealed last month that the service module would fly  
no earlier than September, two months later than promised, the 
Russian Space Agency's PR office promptly issued a denial. 
</P>
<P>
	Days passed before Russian officials publicly acknowledged the  
delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the same time, word came from Moscow that if benefactors  
could be found, the antiquated Mir would remain in orbit another 
three years rather than face a fatal plunge this summer to free up 
money for the international space station. A deal was close, 
officials insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the head of the Russian Space Agency, Yuri  
Koptev, said the mystery investors had backed off. Explained 
Koptev: ``It was just wishful thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin says Russia can expect ``zero  
dollars'' from the United States to fulfill its share of the 
international space station. At one point last year, an exasperated 
NASA considered paying the Russians as much as $600 million to keep 
them in the 16-nation project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It disincentives the Russian government to fund the Russian  
Space Agency,'' Goldin told reporters at a Feb. 1 budget briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, to cover anticipated Russian shortfalls, NASA proposes  
to spend an additional $2 billion on the international space 
station over the next five years. About $1.2 billion would come 
from within NASA, the result of canceled or shuffled programs; the 
Clinton administration would provide the remaining $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA managers hope to have a better grasp of the service module  
problems -- and the domino impact on space station assembly -- after 
meeting with their Russian counterparts this week in Moscow. 
Another meeting is planned for late March. 
</P>
<P>
	James Oberg, an expert in Russian space affairs, says NASA  
should not expect instant and simple answers. The Russians 
genuinely do not know when the service module will be ready to fly 
because ``it's uncharted territory -- they're trying to operate with 
a skeleton staff and an aging cadre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can rule out September of this year or  
September of next year,'' says Oberg. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, NASA is sticking to its projected 2004 completion date  
for the international space station -- ``if we're able to keep to 
this schedule,'' Culbertson cautions. It's also sticking to 45 
assembly flights, although Culbertson notes: ``I wouldn't put money 
on that number, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the finished product? Estimates vary. Some $60  
billion, counting launches, is as good a figure as any. 
</P>
<P>
	Delays and costs will continue to mount if NASA gives up on  
Russia's service module and launches a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Russia's service module or a U.S. fill-in, the first two  
pieces of the space station would have to be junked. Shuttle 
astronauts painstakingly linked the Russian Zarya and U.S. Unity 
modules in December following a one-year, Russian-prompted delay. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has until April 2000 to get a control module -- any control  
module -- up. That's when the electronics on the two-piece space 
station will no longer be able to handle the load alone, causing 
the outpost to tumble out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a long way off,'' says Culbertson.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so, but the clock is ticking.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Grant on Rebounding Tear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- If Dennis Rodman finally decides to play  
for the Los Angeles Lakers, he'll have to compete with Portland's 
Brian Grant for the rebounding title. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, playing with Wormlike aggressiveness, is averaging 19.7  
rebounds and 17 points in his last three games, including a 
career-high 24 rebounds -- the most in the NBA this season -- in the 
Trail Blazers' 90-84 victory over Golden State on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to go out there and play hard and I want us to  
win, so if I only end up with a rebound or no rebounds and we're 
winning, it really doesn't matter,'' said Grant, whose team has won 
four straight and six of seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the best rebounder in the NBA the last seven years, has  
scheduled a Monday morning news conference to announce his 
intentions for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant has worked furiously to get back into playing condition  
after reporting to training camp a few pounds overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9, 254-pound power forward had just 25 rebounds in  
Portland's first four games, but has 70 rebounds in the four games 
since, boosting his average to 11.9, fourth in the league behind 
Chris Webber (14.9), Tim Duncan (12.7) and Shaquille O'Neal (12.5). 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, Grant overpowered the listless Celtics, getting  
18 rebounds and using sheer might to wrest balls away from 
opponents. Saturday, the Warriors' entire starting five barely 
outrebounded Grant, 25-24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two nights, the effort that Brian Grant has put out  
on the floor has been just incredible,'' Blazers coach Mike 
Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, 26, came to Portland as a free agent in the summer of  
1997 after three years of losing in Sacramento. After signing a 
six-year, $56 million contract, he averaged 12 points and nine 
rebounds for the Blazers, but missed 17 games with a stress 
fracture in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant also had surgery on his right shoulder in 1996 and again  
after last season, but says he is free of pain now. And he's trying 
to balance his game by developing some sort of shooter's touch amid 
the crashing bodies underneath the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had this problem here,'' Grant said. ``It's like I was  
able to mentally turn on this aggression. I can turn it on for the 
rebound but I can't turn it on for the shot. So I'm shooting my 
shots real hard off the glass instead of just trying to go up and 
dunk them.''

<HEADLINE> Union University Coach Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- Union University women's basketball coach  
Lisa Hutchens died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchens was found dead at her home Saturday after she failed to  
show up for the team's scheduled departure to play Lyon College in 
Batesville, Ark. She was 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the men's and women's games against Lyon were canceled, as  
were Sunday's games against David Lipscomb. Those games have been 
rescheduled for Monday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchens graduated from Union in 1983, then coached at  
Millington and south Side High schools, and became an assistant 
coach at Union in 1991. She sat out last year to pursue a doctorate 
but returned this season to co-coach the NAIA Division I team with 
David Blackstock. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is ranked second in the division in last week's  
Associated Press Poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Union University is a private college with 2,500 students and is  
affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention. Hutchens was the 
school's first NAIA All-American and Academic All-American in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service for the Union community is planned for 10  
a.m. Monday at the G.M. Savage Memorial Chapel. Visitation will be 
from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Arrington Funeral Home 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchens' family will also hold a public memorial service at 11  
a.m. Tuesday, and she is to be buried at 1 p.m. Wednesday in 
Greenfield.

<HEADLINE> Life Changed for Tornado Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- A year after seven tornadoes swept  
through central Florida, killing 42 people, two survivors are doing 
the best they can to go on with drastically changed lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The twisters came in the middle of the night of Feb. 22-23,  
1998, when most people were sleeping and never heard any warnings. 
They tore a 50-mile path, causing $36.8 million in damage as they 
damaged or destroyed more than 3,600 homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the physical devastation are emotional bruises that  
survivors are still nursing. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Kahn lost his wife and became a crusader for a weather  
warning system in the mobile park where he lives. Shirley Driver 
lost her house and was forced to give up the two 
great-grandchildren she was raising. She now lives in an apartment 
by herself. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	At the Ponderosa RV Campground in Kissimmee, the worst-hit area  
where more than a dozen people were killed, shiny new mobile homes 
are lined up where heaps of twisted metal, siding and shredded 
fabric lay only a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of the park's residents, many of them survivors of the  
tornadoes, chatted and played shuffleboard recently under a clear 
blue Florida sky. 
</P>
<P>
	But the scars from that deadly night were still there -- on the  
still-bruised forearms of Kahn, 78, who spent eight days in an 
intensive care unit. His wife, Theda, 72, was killed when she was 
thrown from their mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had come down from St. Clair Shores, Mich., each  
winter for 16 years. This winter, Kahn returned with a new trailer 
despite his grievous loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did everything together,'' Kahn said of his wife. ``We had  
a good life together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some newly arrived residents of the mobile home park greeted,  
hugged and kissed Kahn as he played shuffleboard. Some discussing 
weekend weather wondered whether strong winds were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the winds get going, people get nervous,'' said neighbor  
Loraine Ruddy, 59, who escaped serious injury in last year's 
twisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn has made it his mission to make sure the mobile home park  
gets a weather warning system. He has lobbied state and county 
officials and hopes the park is one of five that state emergency 
officials use for a pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants construction of a brick wall around the shower rooms at  
the park that would shelter him and his friends in the event of 
another tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I moved elsewhere I wouldn't know anybody,'' Kahn said.  
``This place is like a second home.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Waldick was called the ``Miracle Boy'' after he  
survived being sucked out of his great-grandmother's two-bedroom 
home. It was smashed to pieces and Jonathan, then 18 months old, 
was hurled into the branches of a fallen oak tree. 
</P>
<P>
	He was saved by a mattress that wrapped around him and protected  
him from the slabs of fallen wallboard and plywood. He suffered no 
more than a few scratches on his chin, but his life changed 
dramatically anyway as his great-grandmother was forced to give him 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost my house. I lost my car. I lost my  
great-grandchildren,'' Mrs. Driver said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy and his half-sister, Destiny, are now living with other  
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan had been living with Mrs. Driver since October 1997  
when his mother turned him over to her. Mrs. Driver was also 
raising 4-year-old Destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tornadoes, the children's mother took custody of them  
for a short time before they were placed in foster care because 
their mother was investigated for abuse. Child welfare workers told 
the 69-year-old Mrs. Driver that she was too old to be raising the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all too stressful for Mrs. Driver, who spent several  
months living in Utah with her daughter after she almost had a 
nervous breakdown. After living in successive foster homes, the 
children were put up for adoption last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Driver's daughter and son-in-law, Earline and Dan Riddle,  
decided to adopt them last December and the children now live in 
Salt Lake City, where they are doing well, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Destiny remembers everything from the night of the tornadoes.  
Mrs. Driver's memory is less vivid since she was hit in the head 
with a wood plank. All three of them get nervous whenever they hear 
a plane flying overhead -- the sound too much like a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding not to rebuild her home, Mrs. Driver is now living by  
herself in a two-bedroom apartment. The home's lot sits empty 
between two cinderblock houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life turns in funny ways,'' Mrs. Driver said. ``It's God's  
will.''

<HEADLINE> Australia, New Zealand Talk Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEENSTOWN, New Zealand (AP) -- The prime ministers of Australia  
and New Zealand said Sunday that their countries are considering 
extending a free trade agreement to South America and possibly the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard and New Zealand Prime  
Minister Jenny Shipley discussed the plan in two hours of talks 
Saturday in the south island resort town of Queenstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipley said both countries had benefited from their closer  
economic relationship -- or CER -- signed 16 years ago, and that 
other nations have expressed interest in the trade accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've both had a number of visitors from South America in the  
past 12 months and they've openly talked about CER,'' Shipley told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps that is the next step for CER -- to get the quantum  
leap that we saw we received in the early stages of this trading 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said increased liberalization of trade should continue to  
be a goal for countries such as New Zealand and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every opportunity there is to expand the horizons of freer  
trade we should grab,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he ruled out any immediate action.  
</P>
<P>
	Shipley said the main effort this year would be in establishing  
a broad-based World Trade Organization round of negotiations, and 
then a strong Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in 
November in Auckland.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Pilots Face Union Dues Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The Fedex Pilots Association will ask  
members to pay higher dues to make up for hundreds of thousands of 
dollars spent on threatened job actions and other work that led to 
their first contract with Federal Express Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly elected FPA leaders say they have imposed new cost  
controls, but the union depleted financial reserves late last year 
in preparation for a possible strike or work slowdown. The money 
was used to lease office space, buy computers and telephones, and 
pay pilots, consultants and staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's pilots have been paying double their normal dues  
since August but rejected a measure in January that would have 
extended the higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 12, union secretary-treasurer Jim Straw abruptly  
resigned, saying he had a philosophical disagreement with the 
union's board. 
</P>
<P>
	``FedEx pilots have never wanted to pay for representation,'' he  
said. ``Running a union is a very expensive proposition. Right now 
the FPA has enough money to operate, but it's not building its 
reserves for future contingencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Weiland, who became the association president Feb. 5, plans  
to propose an annual budget of $6 million, or an average of $1,667 
a year for each pilot. He said the union plans to present the plan 
to its members for a vote in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Association members now are billed one hour of pay each month  
for union dues. FedEx pilot pay ranges from $36 to $150 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's absolutely no concern about the financial condition of  
the union right now,'' Weiland said. ``We're on very sound 
financial footing. But we've got some ambitious goals, and we're 
going to be looking for a dues increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Straw said association membership has reached 98 percent, the  
highest level ever among FedEx's 3,600 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the group was bitterly divided between pro- and  
antiunion factions, and those who favored an independent union over 
a national organization. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 4, the pilots approved a contract after five years of  
on-again, off-again negotiations, making them the only FedEx 
employees in the United States represented by organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis-based FedEx is the world's largest cargo airline, with  
145,000 employees worldwide shipping more than 3 million items to 
211 countries each day.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Still Hasn't Met Murdoch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- It's been nearly five months since Davey  
Johnson was hired as the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, but he 
has not yet to met team owner Rupert Murdoch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't met him, but I would like to,'' Johnson said Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Considering Johnson's track record with owners, maybe it  
wouldn't be such a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers' general manager Kevin Malone laughed at the thought.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've only met Mr. Murdoch once,'' Malone said. ``Mr. Murdoch  
is a very busy man, but I'm sure they'll meet and talk. And I'm 
sure they'll get along great. Mr. Murdoch is a successful man and 
Davey's a successful man. They have a lot in common.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chain of command with the Dodgers is a far cry from the  
situation Johnson was involved in at Cincinnati and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Cincinnati Reds and the Baltimore Orioles, Johnson had  
to work for meddlesome owners in Marge Schott and Peter Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
	It was reported Schott didn't like the fact Johnson had lived  
with his wife, Susan, before marriage and preferred to have Ray 
Knight as her manager. Despite leading the Reds to the playoffs in 
1995, Johnson exited gracefully, handing the rein to Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, Johnson's reported dealings with Roberto Alomar's  
fine going to a charity his wife was involved in didn't sit well 
with Angelos. Despite taking the Orioles to the AL championship 
series both years he managed the club, Johnson left because of his 
strained relationship with the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who owns a career 985-727 record, probably has been put  
through a lot more than a successful manager should, although he 
doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel blessed to have been at Cincinnati and Baltimore,''  
Johnson said. ``I had the opportunity to manage a lot of great 
players -- Cal Ripken, Brady Anderson, Barry Larkin. Things happen 
for a reason and things happen for the best. We won a lot of 
ballgames.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Give Bush a Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is a hot commodity  
at the National Governors' Association meeting, with many of the 30 
other Republican state executives urging him to enter the 2000 
presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who was joining his fellow governors at the White House  
today for a roundtable meeting with President Clinton, says he'll 
announce next month whether he'll seek the office once held by his 
father. But many governors believe a bid by Bush, who leads the GOP 
field in early polling, is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he should (run) because the support is there;  
therefore, I believe he will,'' Michigan Gov. John Engler, who has 
been buttonholing governors on Bush's behalf, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut Gov. John Rowland predicted that more than  
two-thirds of the GOP governors would rally swiftly to Bush's side 
if he enters the race. ``He is our best candidate, undoubtedly,'' 
Rowland said. A senior Bush political adviser, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, concurred with the two-thirds estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of the large pool of Republican White House hopefuls,  
some say it's premature to issue endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I've got a senator in Arizona that's running and a  
former vice president in Arizona that's running. And I'm staying 
neutral,'' said Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, referring to Sen. John 
McCain and former Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	Two governors, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Don Sundquist of  
Tennessee, are working for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, 
who ran for president in 1996 and will try again. And Wisconsin 
Gov. Tommy Thompson hasn't ruled out his own bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are jumping enthusiastically into Bush's corner.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just know that in my heart, of all these very fine  
candidates, George is the best of the best,'' said Oklahoma Gov. 
Frank Keating, chairman of the Republican Governors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who allowed last week that he is ``warming to the task''  
of running, said he is gratified by the support. But, he added: 
``The fact-gathering of one weekend is a part of a decision-making 
process that's going to take awhile to come to final resolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference with Texas reporters, Bush said he is  
sticking to a timetable that calls for him to make his announcement 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is one of the heart and one of the head. And in  
the heart, as I've made it clear the last couple of months, I'm 
reconciling what this decision means with my family,'' said Bush, 
whose 17-year-old twin daughters have expressed reluctance about 
being exposed to the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal scrutiny appears chafing at times to Bush himself.  
</P>
<P>
	He said Sunday that he will not expand on his earlier refusal to  
discuss whether he has ever used drugs, but added: ``I will say 
that the rumors I'm hearing around here are totally ridiculous, and 
I would hope that the Washington press corps would be careful about 
gossip and rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engler said no formal endorsements are expected at the  
governors' meeting, which concludes Tuesday after today's White 
House meeting and a dinner for Clinton. The president played host 
to the governors Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Engler advisers said the Michigan governor, who talked  
strategy with Bush over breakfast Saturday, is laying the 
groundwork for endorsements and campaign help if Bush takes the 
plunge. That help would be invaluable, Oklahoma's Keating said. 
``The Republican governors are the leaders of their parties in 
their states. I think it would be an enormous advantage.''

	Bush met Saturday with potential presidential campaign donors,  
part of his camp's effort to build a fund-raising base that can be 
triggered the day he announces his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Texas Legislature in session, Bush said he won't be  
traveling to New Hampshire, Iowa or other states with early 
primaries or caucuses. In a sign of his popularity, however, 
delegations from other states have traveled to Austin to pay 
homage. He already has welcomed elected officials from Iowa, New

<HEADLINE> United States 2, Chile 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Ben Olsen and Eddie Lewis scored  
second-half goals as the United States beat Chile 2-1 Sunday to 
remain unbeaten under coach Bruce Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis broke a 1-1 tie in the 65th minute with a shot that  
deflected off Chilean defender Pablo Contreras. That came just one 
minute after Chile's Roberto Cartes had tied the game with a 
left-footed blast from about 32 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen, who played for Arena last season at D.C. United, scored  
the game's opening goal in the 58th minute in a match played before 
14,896 fans at Lockhart Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States now has won twice and tied twice since Arena  
took over the national team last October. Sunday's lineup included 
just four players from the squad that beat Germany 3-0 two weeks 
ago in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Chile coach Nelson Acosta fielded a team featuring six players  
getting their first international start. The best of the group was 
20-year-old midfielder David Pizzaro, who nearly caught U.S. 
goalkeeper Zach Thornton napping in the second minute with a 
40-yard blast that forced a diving save. 
</P>
<P>
	The first half was remarkable only for the five yellow cards  
handed out by Mexican referee Pascal Rebolledo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans nearly took the lead in the 54th minute, but Brian  
McBride's volley from 12 yards was punched over the bar by 
goalkeeper Marcelo Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsen's goal broke the deadlock after a flurry of U.S. pressure  
in the Chilean end. McBride held off Chile defender Francisco Rojas 
and found Olsen with a short cross in center of the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	Cartes' equalizer six minutes later broke a 335-minute shutout  
streak for the Americans under Arena. But less than a minute later, 
Lewis one-timed a McBride pass that deflected off Contreras into 
the Chilean net.

<HEADLINE> German Bros. Choose Gas Chamber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) --Given the option of a fatal but painless  
injection, convicted killers Karl and Walter LaGrand have chosen 
slower, more agonizing deaths in a cloud of cyanide fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a calculated move designed to keep the brothers from  
becoming the first German citizens to be executed in the United 
States. Karl LaGrand is scheduled to die Wednesday, Walter on March 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	The LaGrands and their attorneys are gambling that an appeals  
court will buy their argument that lethal gas is cruel and unusual 
punishment -- and therefore unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, condemned to die for killing a bank manager in  
1982, also hope U.S. officials will bow to international pressure 
and commute their sentences to life in prison. Chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder and other German leaders have asked President Clinton, 
Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
and Arizona Gov. Jane Hull to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do everything I can that can save a life, even in  
such a difficult case,'' said Schroeder, who opposes the death 
penalty for even the most serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which has no death penalty, has also lodged an appeal  
with the World Court on the brothers' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	It has also appealed to Arizona to spare the lives of two other  
German brothers on death row. Rudi and Michael Apelt were convicted 
of killing Michael's U.S.-born wife in 1988 in hopes of cashing in 
on a $400,000 life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth German citizen is on death row in Florida. In all, 72  
foreign nationals are awaiting execution in the United States, 
according to Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending LaGrand executions have been front-page news in  
Germany, where the brothers were born. Their mother, Emma, married 
an American serviceman who adopted the boys and their sister and 
moved the family to the United States in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, 35, and Walter, 36, were in trouble with the law as  
children. Karl was arrested for shoplifting at 9, and the boys set 
a fire that caused $20,000 damage to a golf course while the family 
lived at a military post in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, the LaGrands robbed three Tucson supermarkets in six  
days. They were free on their own recognizance when they tried to 
hold up the Valley National Bank in Marana, north of Tucson, 
shortly after it opened Jan. 7, 1982. Karl, armed with a toy 
pistol, ordered bank manager Ken Hartsock, 63, to open the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartsock, however, knew only half of the combination. The  
brothers tied up Hartsock, beat him and stabbed him 24 times with a 
letter opener. A clerk was also stabbed but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona prisoners sentenced to death for crimes committed before  
November 1992 have the option of choosing between lethal injection 
or lethal gas. All 13 inmates executed under that provision have 
chosen injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl LaGrand declined to be interviewed. His defense hopes to  
stave off execution by convincing the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco that the gas chamber is barbaric. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the appellate court in 1994 agreed with a lower court  
ruling that concluded prisoners executed in the gas chamber 
suffered ``excruciating pain for between 15 seconds and several 
minutes'' and that a gas chamber execution violates ``evolving 
standards of human decency and has no place in a civilized 
society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen states appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled  
that when the inmate is given a choice of execution, lethal gas did 
not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The high court, 
however, instructed the lower courts to examine the issue further. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument that the gas chamber is unconstitutional when an  
inmate has an alternative, such as lethal injection, ``would be a 
hard one to win in today's courts,'' said Richard Dieter, executive 
director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials say the LaGrands' selection of the gas  
chamber over injection is irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
	The LaGrands are also contending their death sentences should be  
overturned because they were denied their right under international 
law to consult with the German consulate following arrests. State 
officials say the claim is invalid because the brothers failed to 
assert it in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	John Foarde, an attorney specializing in consular affairs for  
the U.S. State Department, said there are no cases where a criminal 
conviction was set aside because of a breach of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is powerless to stop the execution because  
this is a state case, said Paul McMurdie, chief counsel for 
criminal appeals in the Arizona Attorney General's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hull cannot commute the brothers' death sentences without a  
recommendation from the State Board of Executive Clemency, which 
will consider Karl LaGrand's case Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>  First Lady Warned of N.Y. Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's reputation  
for toughness and political smarts will be put to a full test if 
she decides to run for a New York Senate seat, politicians from 
both parties warned her Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a potential rival for the seat,  
said Republicans ``are actually relishing the battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York's combative mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, said a run by the  
first lady would give him an incentive for seeking the Republican 
nomination. ``Starting off from the underdog position would 
probably be a good thing, from my point of view,'' Giuliani said on 
CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the impeachment over and Congress not yet back in full  
gear, the possibility of a Clinton-Giuliani race in New York 
dominated the Sunday news programs. It's the cover story for both 
Time and Newsweek this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New York Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, predicted that Mrs.  
Clinton would win if she runs for the seat being vacated by 
four-term Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat. But ``it'll be 
a tough fight. It won't be a win in a walk,'' he said on CBS' 
``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans differed on the outcome but agreed it would be  
close. A Time/CNN poll of New York residents put Mrs. Clinton ahead 
of Giuliani 52 percent to 43 percent, but Giuliani, on ABC's ``This 
Week,'' said in the end ``we are looking at a 2 or 3 percent 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has said she is talking to people about running and  
has not made up her mind. Time magazine quoted Rep. Charles Rangel, 
D-N.Y., who is urging Mrs. Clinton to run, as saying he had 
discussed her candidacy with President Clinton and ``he was more 
excited than I've ever seen him about anything.'' Publicly, the 
president has said only that she would make a good senator, and he 
would support whatever decision she makes. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing against a run is New York's notoriety for expensive,  
no-holds-barred negative politicking. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
like Mrs. Clinton a native of Illinois, said that even as a person 
familiar with tough Chicago politics, ``I'm not sure why anybody 
from Illinois wants to stick their nose in New York politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former New York Rep. Susan Molinari, a Republican, said her gut  
feeling was that the first lady will not enter the race. ``This is 
not the kind of rough and tumble she wants to put herself back 
into,'' she said on CNN. Giuliani ``is going to be an extremely 
formidable candidate and will beat her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geraldine Ferraro, in Time, recalled how she twice lost bids for  
a New York Senate seat, ``and I can tell you that it is no walk in 
the park. The tabloids try to eat you alive every day. Much worse, 
they go after your family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraro said she hoped Mrs. Clinton would run, but another  
Democrat, former White House aide George Stephanopoulos, writing in 
Newsweek, advised otherwise. ``Whitewater billing records, cattle 
futures, the travel office and Castle Grande will all be back,'' he 
wrote. ``Do you really want to spend your last year in the White 
House reliving the most painful episodes of your tenure?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said he had no intention of attacking Mrs. Clinton over  
the impeachment of her husband or accusing her of being a 
carpetbagger who doesn't live in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But, when asked on ABC about the first lady's statements last  
year that she favored an independent Palestinian state, he noted 
that he agreed with the official White House position that the 
status of Palestinian-controlled lands are to be negotiated. ``Mrs. 
Clinton is out there much more heavily favoring the Palestinians,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch said most American Jews are for a Palestinian state. ``For  
Giuliani to raise that shows you how low a blow he's willing to 
strike,'' the former mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat who expressed enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton's  
candidacy was New York Rep. Nita Lowey, whose own decision on 
whether to enter the senatorial race has been put on hold as a 
result of the first lady's possible entry. ``Hillary Clinton is in 
a very special class of her own,'' she said on CNN and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Amato, who lost his New York Senate seat last November after a  
nasty campaign against Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer, said 
Republicans aren't afraid of a Clinton candidacy and are ``actually 
relishing the battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Giuliani, he said, New York moderate Reps. Jack  
Quinn and Rick Lazio would be strong contenders. Asked on Fox if he 
would consider running, D'Amato said it was ``very tempting.'' He 
said it would be a race that those who enjoy politics ``kind of 
salivate over.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pitcher, Congressman Mizell Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP) -- Former congressman and major league  
baseball pitcher Wilmer ``Vinegar Bend'' Mizell died Sunday while 
visiting his wife's family in Texas. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members believed Mizell died from the lingering effects  
of a heart attack suffered four months ago while attending a high 
school football game, his son, David Mizell, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizell, who lives in Midway, served from 1968 to 1974 as the  
U.S. representative from North Carolina's 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizell acquired his nickname from the place where he grew up,  
Vinegar Bend, Ala. From 1952-62, Mizell pitched for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, Mizell helped the Pirates win the World Series. He  
posted a 13-5 record with a 3.12 ERA that season with the Cardinals 
and Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizell died in Kerrville, Texas, while he and his second wife,  
Ruth Cox Mizell, were visiting her family. The couple also had a 
home in Alexandria, Va., David Mizell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be Thursday in Midway.  
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from baseball, Mizell was elected as a  
commissioner in Davidson County. 
</P>
<P>
	After he lost his U.S. House seat in 1974, President Gerald Ford  
appointed the Republican as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for 
Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Ronald Reagan picked him to become an assistant  
secretary of agriculture for governmental affairs -- the agency's 
top lobbyist in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Even Memory Champ Is Absent-Minded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Give Tatiana Cooley 15 minutes to memorize 100  
faces and names and she'll remember 70 of them in a snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Give the reigning and only USA National Memory Champion strings  
of 4,000 numbers, ``70093518555899 ...'' or 500 words: ``liquid, 
dairy, digit, district, garden, hair ...'' and she'll repeat them 
better than most. Same with a 54-line poem or a deck of cards. 
</P>
<P>
	So why does Tatiana Cooley need Post-its?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm incredibly absent-minded,'' said the tall 27-year-old with  
a Julia Roberts grin who recently defeated 16 challengers to keep 
the title she won in 1997. Her feats of recall also won her a 
second trip to London for a spot in a world contest of 
brains-not-brawn. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked how many brothers and sisters she has, she replied  
``six, er seven, er six.'' When did she win the Los Angeles 
regional spelling bee? Grade school -- but she doesn't remember 
which grade. The year she graduated high school in New Orleans, 
seventh in her class? A pause. ``1990.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful of forgetting, she keeps a daily ``to-do'' list. Her  
days hang on sticky little notes. ``I live by Post-its,'' Miss 
Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the ability to memorize things is a different realm,''  
Miss Cooley explained. ``It's not at the same level as remembering 
to call people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modest as well as candid, she insists she's not unique.  
``Anybody can train their mind to memorize,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Cooley said she has two techniques: visualization and  
association. The first entails looking at material and mentally 
photographing it. The other involves making up a story that links 
random numbers and words. 
</P>
<P>
	She came to be champ by chance.  
</P>
<P>
	It was 1997, the Saturday before Thanksgiving. Miss Cooley and  
her boyfriend of a month, Dominick DeMilio, were looking for fun 
and found a competition called Memoriad '97 at a Manhattan hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight hours later, she was America's National Memory Champion.  
She had defeated 17 other contestants in the first U.S. trials of a 
similar competition started in England in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	With the two runners-up, she went to London last August to  
compete in the first international Mind Sports Olympiad. There she 
took second place in the women's division in the memory events, 
losing to Sue Whiting, an astrophysicist from Radlett, England. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's U.S. Memoriad took place on the 19th floor of a  
Manhattan office building on a bitterly cold Saturday, watched by 
several dozen spectators and Miss Cooley's personal cheering squad 
consisting of Dominick, her aunt and a sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The other contestants included nine high school students from  
New Jersey, a real estate broker from Pennsylvania and a computer 
programmer. 
</P>
<P>
	The competitive events proceeded in silence, interspersed with  
lectures by memory experts about the brain and using it. 
</P>
<P>
	Contestants, each seated at a small table, were handed a page  
bearing colored photographs and names, then pages of hundreds of 
words, then pages with thousands of numbers, then a poem which 
organizers said was written for the event by Britain's late poet 
laureate, Ted Hughes. It began: ``A Knight in armour falls pushed 
off his star/By the crow of a cock. A wedding ring/Bounced off a 
coffin by a finger caught it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entrants were allowed to jot notes on a pad of paper. After a  
set time, the jottings and pages were taken away and contestants 
wrote down what they remembered. Each had a judge who used a 
complex scoring system that included bonus points for those who 
broke previous records. 
</P>
<P>
	For the final event, after trying to memorize a standard 52-deck  
of cards in precise order, the contestants handed the decks to 
their respective judges, turned away and called out the cards they 
remembered. Miss Cooley did best, getting 17 in exact sequence. 
</P>
<P>
	When Miss Cooley was proclaimed winner, she bounded onto the  
stage, braided ponytail swinging, to receive a glass trophy. She 
wore corduroys, a white T-shirt emblazoned with a dragonfly and 
combat boots. The whole time she had her mother on a cell phone 
from Texas. ``She was just telling me how proud she was of me,'' 
Miss Cooley recalled, ``and she was just screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Cooley first noticed her retentive edge while earning a  
college degree in communications in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking lecture notes was enough to prepare for tests. ``It sort  
of didn't occur to me that it was anything extraordinary. It was 
nice. It was just a means to get me more free time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She credits her mnemonic prowess to her Brazilian-born mother, a  
political science professor, and her father, a computer engineer. 
Though 2 years old when they broke up, she was raised by both in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The only television they allowed was news and educational  
programs. They nurtured her memory with games. They encouraged her 
appetite for reading and language. She reads books in Portuguese, 
Spanish and French. ``This is fun for me, this whole 
memorization,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always loved to learn. I've been like a sponge my whole  
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A self-described ``free spirit,'' she's an aspiring writer with  
a memoir in the works and has a new job as executive assistant to 
the creative chief of an advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In August Miss Cooley returns to London for the Mind Sports  
Olympiad along with second-place winner Eric Chang, 16, of Fair 
Lawn, N.J., and third-placed Coral Parmar, 15, of Elmwood Park, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Cooley said an important part of her technique in  
competition is breathing deeply and reminding herself to take it 
easy. She sympathizes with people who feel their memory is 
slipping, and blames the pressures of modern life. ``People are 
expected to be more concentrated, and think more and retain more,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice: ``Relax.''

<HEADLINE> AIDS Workers Scour Camden Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- By day and by night, the outreach workers  
known as ``The Condom Ladies'' take to the gritty streets here to 
spread an AIDS prevention message among those most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	They crisscross the city, boldly seeking out prostitutes,  
needle-using drug addicts, the homeless and corner drug dealers to 
personally distribute condoms, pamphlets and advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Their goal is not only to spread the word about AIDS prevention,  
but to encourage those at risk to get tested. They offer referrals 
and will transport clients to testing centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main message is to be out there on the streets,'' says  
Peggy Neumann, who supervises the outreach workers. ``Sitting 
waiting for the phone to ring or someone to come through the doors 
-- the program is not going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling by car, always in pairs, they will go almost anywhere:  
crack houses, brothels, drug corners in some of the most dangerous 
sections of the impoverished city of 87,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost anywhere. They carefully avoid 26th Street, a heavy drug  
trafficking area where dealers politely asked them not to return, 
saying, ``We know what you're trying to do, but we don't want you 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it gets scary and a little intimidating. But I do  
what I have to do,'' says one of the workers, Sadia Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
	Camden ranks ninth among New Jersey cities with more than 600  
people infected with the deadly disease since 1981 when reporting 
began. Nearly 400 more are HIV positive. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-round outreach program was launched two years ago by  
the South Jersey AIDS Coalition. The coalition also serves 
Burlington, Gloucester and Salem counties, but runs the outreach 
effort only in Camden City. 
</P>
<P>
	Distributing condoms is partly an attention-getting device, said  
Tom Sauerman, executive director of the coalition, one of the 
largest AIDS organizations in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``You walk up to a bunch of corner guys and they're going to  
stop what they're doing and listen as long as you're dangling a 
string of condoms,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent cold winter day, the outreach workers were striking  
out -- the regular spots were deserted, unlike the summer months 
when people actually seek out the Condom Ladies, flagging down 
their car to get a fresh supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in a seemingly unlikely location, they encounter a  
rail-thin 20-year-old heroin user standing on a street corner on a 
busy retail strip. Addicted since he was 14, the young man admits 
using needles a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know sharing needles is dangerous?'' they ask.  
</P>
<P>
	In a brief exchange, they tell the man that a testing center is  
located just across the street. He agrees to make an appointment 
and they promise to check on him next time they come around. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very nice. I appreciate it,'' he says. ``Not too many  
people take time to help. There are people out here who need 
help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women say their audience needs more than the ``just say no''  
abstinence message. They try to give a street-tailored message 
without passing judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always tell them, `You only have one life. Why are you  
putting yourself at risk,''' says Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the Condom Ladies accompany a mobile AIDS testing van  
as it makes it rounds. Other times, they go out in the wee hours of 
the morning, when those at risk are more likely to venture outside. 
</P>
<P>
	They log up to 400 miles a month, reaching about 20 to 30 people  
a day. Since the program began in January 1997, the volunteers have 
recorded about 700 encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	They give out advice as freely as they dole out condoms -- two  
per person. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are like, `The condom ladies are here,''' says  
Sanchez. ``I give out the lecture first, then I give out the 
condoms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the coalition launched the outreach program, Sauerman was  
planning to hire two burly men. The women, he says, have a caring 
demeanor that helps them earn the trust of a wary population. 
</P>
<P>
	They turn a blind eye to any illegal activity; their sole  
purpose is to get their message out. Besides, they don't want to 
jeopardize their hard-earned trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't be judgmental of what someone does,'' says  
Sanchez. ``It's not my place to say you shouldn't be doing this 
because it's wrong. Who am I?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Condom Ladies measure success in small doses. They persuaded  
a prostitute to get tested for AIDS, and when the results came back 
negative she entered a drug rehabilitation, moved out of the city 
and is trying to turn her life around. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we saw her, we were like, ``Wow!''' said Sanchez. ``We  
couldn't believe it.''

	NATO Threat Shadows Kosovo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Despite yesterday's move to extend  
the deadline for Kosovo peace talks, preparations for NATO military 
action continue. NATO had threatened airstrikes against the Serbs 
if they did not reach an agreement with Albanian insurgents by noon 
yesterday, but the United States and five other nations allowed the 
dialogue to continue to Tuesday. In an interview with Associated 
Press Television News, Yugoslav Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic said 
that talks were still going on ``is a good signal, which tells us 
there is hope for a political settlement.''

	Film Critic Gene Siskel Is Dead  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Film critic Gene Siskel, known for the thumbs-up  
and thumbs-down reviews he and Roger Ebert shared on their popular 
TV show, died yesterday. He was 53. Siskel had surgery in May to 
remove a growth from his brain, but returned to the syndicated 
television show ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' soon afterward. He announced 
earlier this month he was taking time off from that show to spend 
time recuperating from the surgery. He died at Evanston Hospital 
near Chicago, surrounded by his family.

	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Finance officials from the world's richest  
nations met yesterday in Bonn to try to find ways to prevent the 
spread of the global economic crisis. Germany, the host of today's 
meeting of finance officials from the seven leading industrialized 
nations, was pushing an ambitious campaign to regulate exchange 
rates. The idea is staunchly opposed by the United States.

	'Shakespeare In Love' Script Honored  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The authors of the romantic comedy  
``Shakespeare In Love'' beat the writers of the harrowing war drama 
``Saving Private Ryan'' to win the Writers Guild of America award 
for original screenplay. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard shared the 
award for ``Shakespeare,'' which bested ``Bulworth,'' with 
screenplay by Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser; ``Saving Private 
Ryan,'' by Robert Rodat; ``The Truman Show,'' by Andrew Niccol; and 
``The Opposite of Sex,'' by Don Roos. The guild's 51st annual 
awards were announced yesterday in ceremonies held in Beverly Hills 
and New York.

	Firm Stops Online Gun Sales  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Concerned about its ability to comply  
with firearms laws, Internet auction company eBay says it will no 
longer allow the sale of guns or ammunition. The said that firearms 
sales was an area of growing concern because online sellers cannot 
guarantee that buyers meet all the qualifications. Certain guns and 
ammunition are illegal to sell in some states, and federal laws 
govern many aspects of firearms purchases, including how weapons 
can be shipped and who may purchase them.

	London Police Accused of Racism  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- London's police force was riven by institutional  
racism that was a key factor in its failure to thoroughly 
investigate the slaying six years ago of a black teen-ager, a 
newspaper quoted a government report as saying. The Sunday 
Telegraph published excerpts of the report on the death of 
18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in 1993. The 
inquiry, ordered in July 1997, has raised serious questions of 
police incompetence and highlighted racial antagonism in some 
rundown London districts. The Metropolitan Police have acknowledged 
they failed to investigate properly and apologized.

put in an isolation cell after a disturbance last night at the 
Montgomery County Detention Center. Several TV stations in 
Washington reported that Tyson became upset, either in his cell or 
a break room, and threw a television set. The set narrowly missed 
jail guards, and there were no injuries. A hearing on the 
disturbance has been set for Monday.

	Tryba Takes Nissan Golf Lead

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ted Tryba, continuing this year's  
record-setting run of low scores, shot a 10-under-par 61 yesterday 
to rewrite the Riviera Country Club record and vault into the 
Nissan Open lead. Tryba, who bogeyed the final hole by muffing his 
chip from the fringe and missing a 12-foot par putt, had nine 
birdies to go with an eagle on No. 11, where he sank a 30-foot 
putt. His record round put him at 13-under 200, two shots in front 
of a most imposing trio: Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and Davis Love III.

<HEADLINE> Woman Giving Brother a Kidney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The arrow sliced across the backyard --  
unimpeded, unswerving, from 10-year-old Patty's bow to her kid 
brother's head. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, chaos.  
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Vincent Campbell stumbled into his mother's arms,  
an arrow stuck behind his ear. Patty, fear stricken, fled and hid. 
Their infuriated dad chased the neighbor who owned the bow and 
arrow. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Vinny wasn't seriously hurt. They found Patty  
four hours later, cowering in the garbage bin under the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The day Patty used Vinny for target practice would become family  
legend. In fact, it was an accident -- he had darted in front of 
her. She never wanted to hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vinny was always my baby brother,'' she says. ``I kind of  
always looked out for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-three years later, Patty -- now Patricia McDonough -- was  
still looking out for her brother. Vinny's health was failing; he 
needed a kidney, and Patty had one to give. 
</P>
<P>
	But Patty had something else, too: an intimate understanding of  
the world of organ transplants. She is a nurse, and for the past 
six years her mission has been to ensure that people who need 
organs get them. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, suddenly, Patty was a donor, not a nurse. After all those  
years of counseling patients, how would it feel to BE one? Would it 
happen the way she had always told the donors? Or would she be 
surprised? 
</P>
<P>
	All of these questions were secondary, of course. Her major  
concern was helping her brother cheat death again. 
</P>
<P>
	When Vinny was born, a nurse picked him up, her hand behind his  
head to support his neck. And that is why, 39 years later, he would 
need a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The nurse had a boil on one of her fingers. Staph.  
</P>
<P>
	The infection traveled through Vinny's left ear, and he remained  
in the hospital for a year. Doctors removed part of his mastoid 
bone; they bombarded him with antibiotics. Finally, they sent him 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother said the doctors told her she was bringing him home  
from the hospital to die, that he wouldn't survive his second year, 
that he would be dwarfed and retarded,'' Patty says. ``I tell him 
the retarded part was accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Campbells were a close-knit and devoutly Catholic family;  
the kids, three boys and two girls, watched out for each other. 
Vinny was a sickly child. But his health problems ebbed when he was 
5, and soon he was playing football and hockey in the streets of 
Flushing, Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	What no one realized was the effect of all those antibiotics.  
Vinny was allergic to penicillin, so other, experimental drugs were 
used. The result: two damaged kidneys, ticking like time bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny grew up, graduated from St. John's University, went to  
work at the New York City Transit Authority as a computer 
specialist, got married -- all without a clue that he was in 
less-than-perfect health. 
</P>
<P>
	Patty, too, went to St. John's. But only for a while. ``I wanted  
to take off a year, and while I was working at Waldbaum's 
(supermarket), I decided I better go back to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without too much thought, she decided to become a nurse.  
</P>
<P>
	For years, she worked in coronary intensive care. Then, six  
years ago, she shifted direction and went into transplant medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	First she went to work as a procurement coordinator. Hearing of  
a potential donor -- someone who was brain dead and might offer 
several organs -- she would rush to the hospital. She would help 
supervise the care and would counsel their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're asking families to put aside their own pain and help  
somebody else. ... It's really a privilege to work with these 
families,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, she would consult a list of those awaiting transplants and  
call their doctors: ``I have a 42-year-old man who has a cranial 
hemorrhage. This is a heart offer.'' Finally, she would make travel 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely fascinating work,'' she says. But it is often  
frustrating, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty thousand people need transplants in this country, 6,000 in  
New York alone; they wait, and wait, and sometimes die before 
acceptable donors -- donors who have living wills or whose families 
are willing to allow organs to be removed -- can be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unconscionable that in a country like this, there should  
be so many invaluable organs going to waste,'' says Dr. Vivian A. 
Tellis, head of the kidney transplant program at Montefiore Medical 
Center in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, Mrs. McDonough went to work at Montefiore as  
kidney transplant coordinator, interviewing recipients and matching 
them with donors. ``It's more than a job for her. It's a calling,'' 
said Tellis. 
</P>
<P>
	She also was responsible for managing Montefiore's list of 975  
patients awaiting kidney transplants -- keeping in touch, making 
sure their condition was stable. 
</P>
<P>
	She was well aware of the condition of one patient on the list:  
Vincent Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	When Vinny was 30, he underwent routine medical tests and  
received the surprise of his life: His kidneys were beginning to 
fail. Doctors told him that with a low protein diet, he might slow 
the deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked for five years, and then creatinine levels in his  
blood -- markers of renal failure -- began to rise again. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny and his wife, Trina. resolved not to tell their sons --  
Kevin, 5, and Brian, 8 -- that their father was sick. Trina's father 
had just died of complications of diabetes, and had gone through a 
hellish experience with dialysis; there was no need to frighten the 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had enough steam to go to work and come home and  
crash,'' says Vinny, a jocular man who resembles the actor Nathan 
Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry, I'll find you a kidney,'' his sister, the  
transplant expert, told him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, Vinny's brothers and sisters and his wife decided to  
go en masse for testing to see if any of them might donate a 
kidney. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were good. His sister Judy and brother Christopher  
were perfect matches; Pat matched half of the six antigen markers, 
and Robert and Trina also matched, although not as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy was excluded because she suffers from multiple sclerosis.  
So plans were set: Christopher would donate his kidney in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Except that three days before the operation, doctors determined  
that Christopher had three arteries connected to his kidneys, an 
abnormality that ruled him out as a donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat was next in line.  
</P>
<P>
	All along, ``There was this little voice inside me that said, `I  
know it's going to be me,''' she recalls. And now it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all of her seasoning, despite her commitment to  
transplants, she had an instant of doubt. ``I kind of had myself a 
good cry over it,'' she says, ``and after that, I had this 
peacefulness, this certainty that everything was going to be 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Terence, a telecommunications executive, was  
supportive, as were her three teen-agers, Sean, Terence and 
Kathleen: ``When a teen-ager thinks that you've done something 
cool, it's a very good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her patients ``just thought it was the greatest thing. They  
said, `Maybe we'll be roommates.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Her colleagues did for her what she had done for so many other  
would-be donors. ``They really did their damnedest to make sure 
that I was doing this for the right reason, not just because I was 
a transplant professional and it was expected of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was scheduled for Jan. 13; Vin and Pat were admitted  
the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	``We laughed a lot, my brother and I. We don't take anything too  
seriously. I told him (that with a female kidney), every 28 days, 
he'd probably get a little irritable. He might have to buy some 
Midol. Don't worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, she tears up. ``There's no way to thank anybody for a body  
part. So he just told me that he loved me. And I told him that I 
loved him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were fully armed for surgery. They were both doused with  
holy water from Lourdes. They had rosary beads, and a fragment of 
St. Anthony's bone, and Vinny had a friend's scapular. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellis performed the operation; it was, he says, uneventful.  
Vinny felt better almost immediately. He looks forward to coaching 
his sons' soccer and baseball teams, to ``getting back my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister intends to use her experience as a transplant  
recruiting tool. ``I'll show them my scar, if that's what it takes. 
... They shouldn't say no. If I could do it, they should do it.'' 
</P>

	She was unprepared for one side effect of the operation -- an  
incredible, powerful feeling of bliss. ``It's a really special,

outstanding. You feel so good. ... I look at my brother and think,

their respective recoveries, remembering old times, like that

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Two Spaniards were kidnapped while  
installing telephone cables and an antennae for a company in rural 
Colombia, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Luis Garcia and Marcos Gallegos Jimenez were kidnapped  
Friday by a group of men wearing military uniforms in Supia, 115 
miles northwest of the capital, Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities presume the kidnappers are members of the  
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest rebel 
group, though they have not ruled out common criminals, 
paramilitaries or other guerrilla groups, said Jose Alfredo 
Escobar, head of the government anti-kidnapping office. 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar said a total of 15 kidnapped foreigners are currently  
being held.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's economy failed to grow last  
year, its worst performance since 1931, a leading association of 
banks and financial institutions said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No growth, as has been calculated for last year, represents a  
true economic and social disaster,'' the National Association of 
Financial Institutions said. 
</P>
<P>
	If confirmed by official figures -- which have not yet been  
released -- it would be the first time the economy has failed to 
grow since 1931, when it shrank 1.6 percent, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists blame high interest rates, new taxes, guerrilla  
violence and low oil prices in the oil-producing South American 
nation.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Gunmen in Brazil shot a trade union  
leader, who is a key witness in an alleged corruption scandal 
involving city politicians, media reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Afonso Jose da Silva, president of Sao Paulo's street vendors  
trade union, was shot four times in the organization's headquarters 
Saturday, said the CBN radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Silva was in a serious condition Sunday, said Sueli Maira da  
Silva, a spokesman for the Sacred House of Compassion hospital in 
this city. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Silva alleged council staff had extorted  
money from street vendors to finance politicians' election 
campaigns, the station said. Fifty council workers were 
subsequently suspended.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Fishermen along Mexico's northern Pacific  
coast say nine gray whales have been found dead in a bay where the 
giant sea mammals migrate annually to mate and give birth, the 
government news agency said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Mendez Sanchez, head of a fishermen's coalition in Baja  
California Sur state, said government teams should remove the huge 
carcasses because fishermen fear they could contaminate Magdalena 
Bay, the Notimex agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the deaths.  
Mendez said that while whale deaths are not unusual, local 
fishermen do not recall seeing so many die in one season, Notimex 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a Mexico City environmental organization, the Group  
of 100, urged the government to investigate the deaths of seven 
whales along the coasts of Sinaloa, Sonora and Baja California Sur 
states, including three in Magdalena Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	It charged that a cyanide-based chemical used by smugglers to  
mark drug shipment points could be to blame.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police arrested 10 Greenpeace activists who  
climbed onto Mexico City's Angel of Independence monument Sunday to 
hang banners protesting genetic engineering of plants and animals, 
the environmental group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, wearing masks and white overalls, hung a sign  
reading ``The corn is ours'' in front of a statue of Mexico's 
founding father, Miguel Hidalgo, and draped a large banner reading 
``No to genetic imperialism'' from the base of the monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived an hour after the signs went up and arrested the  
protesters, Greenpeace said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The group accused the United States of leading efforts to block  
an agreement at the Biosafety Protocal summit being held in 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States -- backed by Canada, Australia, Uruguay and  
Argentina -- hopes to protect a rapidly growing industry whose 
proponents insist bioengineering is a safe, proven and 
environmentally sound technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Biotech companies genetically manipulate plants and animals to  
speed their growth, make them more resistant to disease or make 
them more attractive. Developing nations fear genetically 
engineered crops could have devastating effects on their 
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Governors Urge Healing for Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A week after President Clinton's impeachment  
trial ended, the nation's governors are urging the president and 
Congress to put the enmity behind them and get on with the nation's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	And that, they said Saturday at the start of the National  
Governors' Association winter meeting, includes environment, 
transportation, education, health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are hungry for consensus-building,'' said Delaware  
Gov. Thomas Carper, who association's chairman. ``We will certainly 
use our influence to encourage it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Governors, particularly Republicans, generally have been immune  
to political fallout from the impeachment process. But some GOP 
governors said they will have a work with congressional Republicans 
to alleviate damage the events in Washington have caused the party 
in the country's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake: Political discussions will take place,'' said  
Connecticut's John Rowland, a Republican. ``We want to encourage 
our colleagues (in Congress) to get on with life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said reports of more Clinton investigations or campaigns  
to unseat the House impeachment managers in the next election 
``serve no purpose for either party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Governors consider themselves more conciliatory and less  
confrontational than their congressional counterparts. In recent 
years, Republican governors generally have fared better in the 
public's view than their party mates in Congress, particularly on 
issues such as healthcare reform and education. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors, however, parted ways somewhat on the education  
issue Saturday. The Democrats gathered at a news conference with 
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley to lend their support to the 
president's education platform. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a nearby Republican governors' business meeting to  
highlight tax relief proposals, John Engler of Michigan said: ``We 
would ask Congress to improve the president's proposals by rolling 
up some of these programs in block grants. We need flexibility at 
the state level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Education dominated the opening day of the midwinter conference,  
but the governors also introduced other issues they will take to 
the president and to Congress as they seek a state-federal 
partnership: 
</P>
<P>
	--Fewer federal mandates on programs such as welfare, children's  
health care and job training. 
</P>
<P>
	--More flexibility for more states in using federal education  
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	--Protection of the states' tobacco settlement funds from any  
federal seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	--Greater progress on environmental reform for cleaner water,  
cleanup of contaminated lands and endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting included a general session on technology, at which  
governors met with industry executives to discuss how to adapt 
their computer systems to deliver better services to state 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Governors from all 50 states and most U.S. territories boosted  
the meeting's attendance to its highest levels in years, organizers 
said.

<HEADLINE> Winter Robins Baffle Birdwatchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Flocks of robins, traditionally regarded as  
harbingers of spring, have been descending on snowy Northern 
gardens and hedgerows in surprising numbers this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Does their presence herald an early spring?  
</P>
<P>
	Not necessarily. While many robins flock to the sunny South in  
winter, there have always been some hardy souls who remain to wing 
it up North. In recent years, however, the number of overwintering 
robins has risen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ornithologists and bird enthusiasts have various opinions about  
what is going on with the orange-breasted birds. Theories include 
include global warming, fewer farms and sturdier birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Robins aren't the only warmth-loving birds that have grown  
increasingly common in colder climes. But they've gotten the most 
attention, perhaps because they're easy to identify and are 
associated with springtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``All over the Northeast, as far west as Michigan, people have  
been reporting robins where they've never seen them before, or in 
unusual numbers,'' said Wes Hochachka, an ornithologist who 
monitors bird populations at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	Hochachka compiles data from Project Feeder Watch, a survey of  
backyard bird populations as reported by volunteers across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are duelling opinions about what might be happening,''  
Hochachka said. One theory is that robins which always have 
wintered here are being noticed more, because they're congregating 
closer to residential areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is that they're moving northward, that it's  
essentially an early spring migration,'' Hochachka said. ``They've 
been in fairly large flocks, whereas overwintering birds are 
usually in ones or twos. And they're behaving as migrating birds 
do, feeding madly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This year is clearly unusual,'' Hochachka said. ``We've also  
been getting phone calls and e-mails about flocks of red-winged 
blackbirds and common grackles,'' species that usually winter from 
North Carolina to the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Poughkeepsie, about 70 miles north of New York City, people  
have been calling the local newspaper in recent weeks, baffled by 
unusual numbers of robins. One man counted 150 in his yard one day, 
gorging on cedar berries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have thousands and thousands of birds,'' Joanne Robisheaux  
of Wingdale told the Poughkeepsie Journal, noting that they were 
roosting in trees near her housing development. ``The sky is black 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In summer, robins eat worms, grubs, and other insects. In  
winter, those that remain up North switch to berries and sometimes 
suet from birdfeeders. Their diet includes the fruit of hawthorn, 
buckthorn, mountain ash, holly, wild grapes, cedar, crabapple, 
sumac and multiflora rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Experienced birders say robins have long been more common in  
winter than most people think. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conventional wisdom is that they come in spring,'' said Bill  
Lee of the Hudson-Mohawk Bird Club. ``But there always are 
overwintering robins here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It does appear that there are more than usual this year, said  
Lee, who lives near Schenectady. In the 1998 Audubon Christmas Bird 
Count, Schenectady County birders reported nearly 2,600 robins, 
more than any year since the local club started doing the annual 
one-day count 70 years ago, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a one-day count can be misleading. ``A lot of it is timing,  
and where you look,'' said Rich Guthrie, a seasoned birder whose 
home overlooks the Hudson River south of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	About eight winters ago, Guthrie visited a dense stand of pines  
near the Hudson River and counted about 100,000 robins flying in to 
roost. A one-day count could miss such a flock if the birds were 
concealed in the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just anecdotal information to go on, but my sense is  
that robins have been increasing over the last few decades,'' said 
Guthrie, who's retired from the state Department of Environmental 
Conservation. ``I remember when a robin in winter was an unusual 
sight. Now, it's expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robins aren't the only birds on the rise. ``I delight at the  
song of my Carolina wrens out back,'' Guthrie said. ``When I was 
growing up, you didn't see them around. There also has been a 
dramatic increase in mockingbirds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 species of birds have expanded their range northward in  
the past 25 to 30 years, including orchard orioles, boat-tailed 
grackles, blue grosbeaks, cerulean warblers, and blue-gray 
gnatcatchers. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of factors could figure into the rise of robins and  
certain other songbirds, Guthrie said. Global warming may be making 
winters milder. Abandoned farms are being overgrown with 
blackberries and buckthorn. Suburban sprawl provides backyards 
filled with fruit-laden ornamental shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Birds that are expanding their ranges also seem to be getting  
hardier, Guthrie said. The population rebounds faster after a 
severe winter decimates the flocks. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are more people counting birds, which means birds that  
might have been overlooked in years past are now being counted. 
</P>
<P>
	Project Feeder Watch and the annual Great Backyard Bird Count  
(Feb. 19-22), joint projects of the National Audubon Society and 
Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology, seek to shed more light on 
population trends by enlisting thousands of people to count birds 
around their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: Robins that weather the winter have a  
distinct advantage over the birds returning in early spring. The 
early bird may get the worm, but the one who never left gets the 
best nesting sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a firm rule among robins,'' Guthrie said. ``The first  
male to stake out a territory prevails.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Williams Glad To Be Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Bernie Williams is glad to still be on the  
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The center fielder reported to the team's spring training  
facility on Sunday, returning to the team he nearly left during the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to know that I'm back here where I know the system,  
I know the coaches and I know the organization,'' Williams said. 
``I don't have to start all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AL batting champion was on the verge of signing with Boston  
when Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's last-minute pitch resulted 
in a seven-year, $87.5 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fame, security, money, whatever, it's good -- but it's not what  
really drives me as a player and I think that will never change,'' 
Williams said. ``The fact is I'm a baseball player. That's what I 
love doing, that's what drives me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams received a loud ovation when he took the field for a  
35-minute batting practice session with teammate Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you feel great,'' Williams said. ``Still, if I play  
bad, they're going to run me out of town. I need to perform and 
play up to my expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had a stellar 1998 season, hitting .339 with 26 homers  
and 97 RBI during the Yankees' march toward a 125-win season and 
the team's second World Series title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people, however, including Williams and Yankees manager Joe  
Torre felt the outfielder's final appearance for the Yankees had 
come in Game 4 of last fall's World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to have him back with a smile, instead of coming in  
like he did last year worrying about causing a distraction in the 
clubhouse,'' Torre said. ``It's good to be able to put that to 
sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Williams called the acquisition of Cy Young Award  
winner Roger Clemens ``a great addition,'' the deal did have a 
sobering impact. In that trade with Toronto, the Yankees gave up 
18-game winner David Wells, a key component last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how great a year you had, you're as expendable as  
the next guy,'' Williams said. ``The biggest example came several 
days ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Most of the position players, who are scheduled to report  
on Monday and formally work out Tuesday, are already in Tampa. 
Derek Jeter, Tino Martinez, Chili Davis and Chuck Knoblauch are 
already working out at Legends Field or the Yankees' nearby minor 
league complex. ... Hideki Irabu may have lost a friend when Wells 
was traded, but likely gained a mentor in Clemens. Through his 
interpreter, Irabu said he planned on watching and learning from 
Clemens regarding conditioning and game day preparation. ``He's a 
pretty good guy to watch,'' Torre said, who is seeking more 
consistency from Irabu this season. ... Clemens' first full day at 
Legends Field included a workout just after 7 a.m., the regular 
spring session at 11 a.m. and a photo shoot at 4 p.m.

<HEADLINE> New Brucellosis Vaccine Eyed / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Oklahoma State University researchers would  
like nothing more than to put an end to a worldwide disease and 
give U.S. enemies one less option during a war. 
</P>
<P>
	A research group in the College of Veterinary Medicine is  
developing a vaccine for brucellosis, one of the most serious 
diseases of livestock and a potential agent in biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	In livestock, the brucellosis bacteria causes cows to abort,  
makes calves sick, decreases milk production and interrupts 
breeding cycles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each aborted fetus has enough bacteria to infect the entire  
herd of cattle in the U.S.,'' said project leader John Wyckoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Through eradication efforts in the United States, only six  
affected herds of cattle exist in Texas, Missouri and South Dakota, 
down from 124,000 nationwide in 1956. The state and federal 
eradication programs included livestock quarantines, costly 
vaccinations and widespread animal tests. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wyckoff said the disease still affects tens of thousands of  
livestock and people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Current vaccines contain live bacteria that in some cases have  
infected veterinarians in contact with the medicine. Wyckoff's team 
is looking to create a vaccine with fewer drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of trying to work with a live vaccine, we are trying  
to come up with one or two components of the bacteria that, 
although they are dead, will still stimulate very strong 
immunity,'' Wyckoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is three to four years away from experimental trials  
on cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyckoff said the disease is still a problem in American cattle,  
but not to the degree it is with people and animals in developing 
nations. He said the disease is ingested worldwide mainly by eating 
unpasteurized dairy products such as soft cheeses. Bacteria can 
live up to 18 months in such foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Espe, area veterinarian for the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture said the work of Wyckoff's team is still needed even 
though the disease is found in only a few of the nation's cattle 
herds. 
</P>
<P>
	Espe said the presence of free-ranging bison in Yellowstone  
National Park and Grand Teton National Park threatens the 
brucellosis status of the surrounding states free of the disease. 
``Sooner of later, if the United States is considered free of 
brucellosis, bison will need to be free in that population,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, wild elk that gather for winter feeding can  
potentially spread the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Following reports that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was  
threatening the use of biological weapons armed with brucellosis, 
the U.S. Army started asking for human vaccines, Wyckoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	If humans were exposed to brucellosis, it would be a long-term  
and disabilitating disease, he said. It's usually not fatal, but 
can cause irregular fevers and infections of the brain and central 
nervous system along with heart disfunction. Although Wyckoff's 
work is for a vaccine in cattle, he said the research into a 
vaccine will help in developing a cure for infected humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's takes a high level of antibiotics for a long period of  
time (to treat the disease),'' he said. ``It's not high on the list 
as a (potential) agent, but it is definitely on the list.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Critical of Serbs at Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- The Kosovo peace talks moved into  
overtime Sunday with Western nations -- trying to salvage a deal and 
hold off NATO airstrikes -- split over Serbian rejection of foreign 
peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials mediating the talks said Saturday the deadline  
had been extended from Saturday noon until 3 p.m. (9 a.m. EST) 
Tuesday because ``very substantial progress'' had been made on the 
political part of a three-year interim agreement for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright and ministers from five European countries spent a day in 
heated discussions with the Serb and ethnic Albanian sides in the 
14th-century Chateau de Rambouillet near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright returned to the chateau Sunday, saying ``there is an  
awful lot of work to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We always knew that these were going to be very difficult  
discussions,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
Albright would meet with the ethnic Albanians. She had no meetings 
planned with the Serbs, though her schedule was fluid. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright made clear Saturday who she felt was preventing a deal,  
accusing the Serb negotiators, led from Belgrade by Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic, of ``evasion and delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that Milosevic will wake up and smell the  
coffee,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a grave mistake for Milosevic to miscalculate our  
intentions. ... We're not into endless extensions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the Serbs had shown a lack of desire to negotiate  
on the main sticking point: a NATO force of up to 30,000 
international troops to enforce a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs' refusal to even consider the peace implementation  
force is largely responsible for our failure to reach an 
agreement,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also said that until the Serbs accept all provisions,  
``the preparations for NATO military action will continue.'' NATO 
has said it would strike against Serb-led Yugoslavia if a deal was 
not reached at the conference which started Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, in remarks contrasting  
sharply with Albright who put the blame squarely on the Serbs, said 
Kosovo Albanians are also to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment we have on the Belgrade side a government that  
is accepting the constitutional settlement for a self-governing 
Kosovo, but we don't have the Kosovar side that is doing so,'' Cook 
said on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s Breakfast with Frost 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that context, airstrikes on Belgrade are not going to  
help,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav media Sunday presented the decision to extend the  
deadline as a triumph for Belgrade, which managed to split the 
foreign powers mediating the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discord in the Contact Group,'' said the headline on the  
state-controlled newspaper Politika, referring to the United States 
and five European powers conducting the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian president, said late Saturday  
that more time will be needed to solve the Kosovo problem ``that is 
several decades old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also indicated that Serbia would allow foreign troops, but  
only after the political part of the agreement was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can discuss everything after the agreement,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands been  
displaced in a year of fighting in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians make up 
90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million population, and most favor 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed peace plan grants the southern Serbian province  
wide autonomy. It calls for most Serbian security forces to 
withdraw from the region and the disarming of ethnic Albanian 
rebels. But it keeps the province within Yugoslav borders. 
</P>
<P>
	An annex to the plan provides for the NATO troops, including  
4,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has come out strongly against the use of force. On  
Saturday, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov echoed those 
sentiments in a telephone conversation with British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, China joined Russia in its opposition of airstrikes  
against Yugoslavia if a Kosovo peace agreement cannot be reached, a 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	China disapproves of any military action against Yugoslavia and  
instead wants a peaceful solution ``on the basis of respecting the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and ensuring 
the lawful interests of all ethnic groups in the Kosovo region,'' 
the state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue as 
saying.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon May Want Look at Iraq Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Defense Department agency, coming full  
circle, is telling former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter once 
again that he may need to submit for pre-publication review a book 
expected to criticize the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter's lawyer calls the latest Pentagon position an attempt at  
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	David J. Rigby, spokesman for the Defense Threat Reduction  
Agency, said Sunday that a letter was sent Feb. 18 to Ritter's 
attorneys, telling the former Marine intelligence officer that, 
under the contracts he signed with the agency, any publication 
discussing the work he did hunting for illegal weapons in Iraq must 
first be submitted for governmental review. 
</P>
<P>
	That reverses last month's Pentagon position in which the agency  
stepped back from an initial request to review the book, saying 
that because Ritter no longer was under contract to the Defense 
Department he was not legally obligated to submit it for review. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in January, there was not as thorough a legal review of  
what the requirements of the contract were,'' Rigby said when asked 
about the new letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest letter states, ``No prior statements or actions by  
D.T.R.A. should be construed in any way as waving its rights under 
the contract or in permitting Mr. Ritter to ignore his 
responsibilities under his contract.'' Ritter said publication 
review clauses are standard in military contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter was technically under contract with the agency -- the  
Pentagon office that deals with threats from weapons of mass 
destruction -- during the time he was working for the United Nations 
Special Commission on Iraq. He resigned last fall and accused the 
Clinton administration of undermining the commission's job of 
rooting out Saddam Hussein's attempts to produce chemical and 
biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter's lawyer, Matthew L. Lifflander, told The New York Times  
that ``You could easily conclude that this is a last-minute effort 
to delay publication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ritter continues to believe that nothing in the manuscript  
could possibly be contested on a national-security basis by 
government censors, although some of what he has to say may be 
distasteful to some significant policymakers,'' Lifflander said in 
a letter to the agency, according to the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Lifflander's office Sunday were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Rigby said the book -- titled ``The Iraq Solution'' and due out  
in April -- requires a review if it contains material -- classified 
or unclassified -- from Ritter's work for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ritter has to make the determination whether the book  
material developed as part of this contract,'' Rigby said. ``If Mr. 
Ritter were to submit the book for ... review, and there was 
material that was determined to be inappropriate, we would bring 
that to his attention, and he would have to make a decision on 
whether that needed to be changed, deleted, left in, published, 
whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rigby declined to say how Ritter could be punished if he ignores  
a required review.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Workers Unfazed by Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has  
hired only 170 of the 800 employees it will need for the 2002 
Winter Games, and the bribery scandal apparently has not slowed the 
flow of resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Resources director Ed Eynon said only one prospective  
employee and one volunteer hesitated because of the scandal, but 
both later changed their minds and joined. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst corruption scandal in Olympics history began unfolding  
in December. An investigating panel said this month that two 
executives of the bid committee spent more than $1 million on 
International Olympic Committee members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Working for SLOC is a risky proposition -- a three-year or  
four-year stint with a guaranteed layoff after the 2002 Olympic 
Games. Yet the organizing committee has little trouble attracting 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	``How often do the Olympic Games even come to the United  
States?'' asked Karen Koppel, an architect from Boulder, Colo., who 
moved to Utah to work for SLOC. ``This was a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koppel said her SLOC salary is comparable to what she earned in  
Colorado. She'll have to find a new job when the Olympics are over, 
but that's just part of the adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, SLOC has 14 jobs posted on its Web site and hundreds  
more will appear in coming months and years. Most of the remaining 
positions are lower and midlevel jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've hired the majority of our directors up front because a  
lot of the planning and execution has to be done by the 
leadership,'' Eynon said. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC is seeking those with what Eynon calls ``world-class  
experience,'' and many of the jobs have technical requirements, 
such as experience running racing venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Eynon said he expects to draw about 80 percent of the staff from  
Utah and 20 percent from other states or countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``All things being equal, it's nice to have a Utahn in a  
position, because the Games are here,'' Eynon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay is better than for most similar jobs in Utah, although  
it's comparable to national rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretaries make between $25,000 and $30,000, and the directors  
of some 45 functions within SLOC earn upward of $80,000 each. 
SLOC's six or seven managing directors, the next tier in the SLOC 
hierarchy, make anywhere from $115,000 to $175,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization's senior vice presidents, who are directly  
beneath president Mitt Romney, earn a little less than $200,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, hired Feb. 11, said he'll be paid the same salary as his  
predecessor, $285,000 a year, but he won't collect the money until 
the games are over and it's clear they are in the black. 
</P>
<P>
	He notes that most of the senior staff members are earning less  
than they would in the corporate world. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other rewards here beside career advancement or  
money,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Toyotas, Hondas Popular for Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Toyota and Honda make some of the nation's  
best-selling cars. And the nation's thieves have noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 21 of the 25 most-stolen vehicles were made by the  
Japanese automakers; nearly all were Toyota Camrys and Honda 
Accords. For the first time, the top 10 most-stolen vehicles were 
all Toyotas and Hondas. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for owners of all makes is that claims for major  
vehicle thefts were down about 22 percent last year, according to 
CCC Information Services Inc., which tracks trends in theft and 
other vehicle damage claims for the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very significant,'' said Jack Rozint, senior vice  
president of CCC. He credited police agencies' heightened focus on 
stolen car parts and manufacturers' increased practice of marking 
many parts with the vehicle's identification number, which makes 
tracing stolen parts easier. 
</P>
<P>
	According to CCC's annual list, to be released Monday, the  
most-stolen car for the second straight year was the 1989 Camry, 
followed by the '88 and '90 Camrys. The most-stolen Honda was the 
'94 Accord EX at No. 4. Thirteen Accords ranked among the top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The formula that put Camrys and Accords atop the list is simple:  
There were a lot of them sold, they last a long time and, as a 
result, their parts are in high demand. It's a lot easier and more 
profitable to fence a fuel pump from an '89 Camry than an '89 Yugo. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of those models also is popular because many of its parts  
are interchangeable over several model years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can steal a car and the parts can be used across  
five, six, seven or eight model years, obviously those parts have a 
high value,'' Rozint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota spokesman John McCandless said the dubious distinction  
was a credit to the longevity of the Camry and Accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our cars and the others on the list are extremely durable,''  
he said. ``It's not unusual for me to talk to the owner of a 
Corolla or Camry who has a 9-year-old car with 200,000 miles on it 
and it's still going strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Camry was the top-selling car in the United States for the  
past two years, followed by the Accord. McCandless noted that the 
top Camry on the most-stolen list was 10 years old and said 
customers shouldn't be wary about buying a new model for fear of 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda spokesman Art Garner said Accord thefts are ``pretty  
average'' if calculated on a per-capita basis. ``On total volume, 
they come out just like the sales figures: the Accord and Camry 
rise to the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honda added an antitheft system that includes an electronically  
coded key beginning with the '98 Accords. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four models by U.S. automakers appeared on the 1998 list --  
the fewest in years -- and none was ranked among the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oldsmobile Cutlass disappeared from the list for the first  
time since CCC made it public in 1990. The Cutlass, a big seller in 
the 1980s, still made the most-stolen lists for some states, 
including Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The most stolen U.S. nameplates were the '97 Ford F150 XL 4x2  
pickup at No. 14, followed in order by the '95 Ford Mustang, the 
'89 Chevrolet Caprice, and at No. 22, the Chevy C/K series 4x2 
pickup. The most-stolen sport utility vehicle was the '93 Jeep 
Grand Cherokee 4x4 at No. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Insurance Crime Bureau in October reported that the  
Honda Accord was the most stolen vehicle nationwide in 1997. It was 
followed by the Toyota Camry, Oldsmobile Cutlass, Honda Civic and 
Ford Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau, which also tracks thefts for insurance companies,  
combines theft reports for all years of a particular make and 
model. CCC ranks the cars by specific model years and 
equipment-trim lines. 
</P>
<P>
	CCC's ranking also is based only on those stolen vehicles that  
were never recovered or were stripped to the point that they were a 
total loss. It does not include temporary ``joy ride'' thefts. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional theft rankings can vary widely from the national trend.  
</P>
<P>
	In Michigan, where American cars are still king, the 1995  
Plymouth Neon ranked No. 1 and its Dodge twin ranked second. 
Illinois was partial to Chevys: the top three were the '87, '89 and 
'88 Caprices. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas thieves favored the '97 Ford F150 XL 4x2 pickup, followed  
by the '98 version. And in New York, two sport utility vehicles 
made the list: the pricey '97 Toyota 4x4 at No. 4 and the '97 
Toyota Runner 4x4 at No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	CCC, based in Chicago, tracked 102,635 vehicle thefts that  
resulted in a total loss last year, as well as crash and other 
damage claims. That's down from 131,278 in 1987. Those numbers 
reflect the vast majority, but not all, of such claims filed 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	CCC handled about 1.7 million of the industry's 2.2 million  
total-loss claims last year, including those from crashes. A 
vehicle is considered a total loss if its salvage value and the 
cost to repair combined exceed its fair market value.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Still High in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Although the worst of Asia's financial crisis  
appears over, there's still plenty of pain going around. Some 
economies remain mired in recession, millions of people are without 
work, and already-low wages are lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound from the devastating collapse that began in Thailand  
in July 1997 and spread across Asia and then to Russia and Brazil 
will be slow and uneven, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any optimism one has on the region has to be hedged, has to be  
cautious,'' said Russell Jones, chief Asia economist for the 
investment bank Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis was caused by heavily indebted banking  
systems, overvalued currencies, excessive government spending and 
over-reliance on foreign loans. ``Crony capitalism'' -- the tight 
links between government officials, bankers and favored companies -- 
also gets blame. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea, forced to seek a $58 billion bailout from the  
International Monetary Fund, is considered the best prospect for 
recovery from the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's ample evidence that Korea is turning around nicely,  
and that's probably the big success story at the moment,'' Jones 
said. ``Elsewhere, the picture is a lot less rosy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts predict South Korea's economy will grow by around 2  
percent this year, following a contraction of nearly 6 percent in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Although critics say South Korea has not gone far enough to  
reform its business conglomerates, known as ``chaebol,'' whose 
heavy debts were blamed for dragging down the economy, most 
analysts say the recovery looks real. 
</P>
<P>
	But unemployment hit 7.9 percent in December, and many Koreans  
are tempering any optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the situation is getting better, but I'm afraid  
that the government and the media may be exaggerating the recovery 
pace,'' said Lee Jong-in, 35, who runs a small trading company in 
the capital, Seoul. ``I think it would take many years to see the 
economy become solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists say the rest of the region, too, has weathered  
the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Schulte, chief Asian investment strategist for ING Baring  
Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd., puts it this way: ``We're looking at a 
very, very mild recovery in 1999'' -- except for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, the world's second largest economy, is stuck in its worst  
recession since World War II and has been unable to help pull 
neighboring economies out of their gloom. Japan's joblessness rate 
hit a postwar high of 4.4 percent in November, easing only to 4.3 
percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some government officials predict the Japanese economy  
will grow this year, private economists and many Japanese have 
their doubts. Critics say the government has not made enough 
necessary reforms to cut the wasteful, cozy ties between too many 
bankers and business leaders that are holding back growth 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the economy will bounce back,'' said Hitomi  
Hayashi, 38, a housewife who was shopping in Tokyo's busy Ginza 
district. ``My husband's salary has been cut little by little for 
some time, so I buy things in bargain sales. I am worried about the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hideyoshi Hagimoto, 25, thinks Japan will bounce back because  
sales at the ad agency where he works bottomed out in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it is true my bonus was cut,'' he said. ``I don't think  
things will ever get as good as they used to be, but I think they 
can be a little better than how they are now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service recently  
noted positive changes in Japan's business culture, with some 
companies focusing on profits and cutting out wasteful spending 
rather than depending on limitless loans from friendly bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big issue now is Japanese banks for the first time ... are  
asking companies, `Are you profitable?''' said Masaharu Kakutani, 
representative director of Moody's Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, once a booming success story, the economy has been  
shrinking in its worst recession in years. Unemployment hit a 
record 5.8 percent, with many people who keep their jobs still 
seeing their pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Filipino women who work as maids in Hong Kong recently saw the  
government slash their minimum salary by 5 percent, to the 
equivalent of $470 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the lowest paid workers in Hong Kong. And we have the  
meanest job,'' said Rosa Pimental, 41, who works six days a week to 
support her husband and two sons back in the Philippines. ``I would 
go home at once if I had a permanent job, but there's nothing back 
home and I have to stay here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's response: Lots of other people are getting their  
wages cut or losing jobs in a recession that shows no immediate 
signs of ending, so the maids should get less, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, instability persists in Indonesia, where the crisis  
abruptly ended the 32-year-reign of President Suharto. Indonesia's 
economy is still shrinking, although analysts don't expect the 
devastating 14 percent decline of last year. It was forced to get a 
$43 billion rescue package from the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	The government puts Indonesian unemployment at 22 percent,  
though some outside experts say that may be exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia is a bit of a wild card. The government predicts 1  
percent growth in its economy, although private economists have 
estimates ranging from a 3 percent gain to a 3 percent contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's economy ended 1998 in recession, and due to the  
problems in neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia, Singaporean 
officials have said 1999 could be even worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The economies of Taiwan and China, which so far have escaped  
recession, are likely to see slower growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, where the crisis began with the devaluation of the  
baht currency, experts predict an end to the sharp economic 
contraction. The economy, which shrank nearly 8 percent last year, 
could grow slightly this year.

<HEADLINE> Temple Coach Sets Wins Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Leave it to John Chaney to protest the game  
that made him the winningest coach in Temple history. 
</P>
<P>
	And excuse the 67-year-old coach for changing his mind when  
victory No. 374 was in the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll change it now,'' Chaney said after passing Harry Litwack  
for No. 1 on the Owls' victory list with a 72-56 win over George 
Washington on Saturday. ``What would I look like out in the middle 
of the ocean and throwing the paddles out of the boat? That's 
stupid, isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney, in his 17th season at Temple, got his 599th career  
victory and 374th for the Owls in a game that had all the elements 
that have come to define him. He chastised his team, belittled and 
intimidated the refs and, yes, announced that he was protesting the 
game because he disagreed with the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he accepted the game ball and made a moving tribute to  
the 91-year-old Litwack at center court, Chaney couldn't pass up 
the chance for a punchline. 
</P>
<P>
	``He set a record that should never be broken,'' Chaney said to  
a standing ovation. ``He's a great man, and I feel bad because this 
is the worst team I've ever coached in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney is 374-157 (.704) since taking over the Owls program in  
1982 and goes for his 600th career victory at home Wednesday night 
against Fordham. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack, a cigar-smoking gentleman known as ``The Chief,'' was  
373-193 (.659) from 1952-73. After the game, Chaney got a call from 
the man he surpassed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could be there with you,'' Chaney told Litwack, who  
lives in Miami Beach. ``I'll come visit you. I love you very much. 
I wish I could have played for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney seemed determined to coach this game as if he were in the  
Final Four -- the one goal he has failed to attain at Temple (18-8, 
12-2 Atlantic 10). 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney jumped out of his seat to yank freshman Ron Rollerson  
after a brief stint in the opening minutes, screaming, ``Get him 
out of there!'' He slammed his clipboard on the court during a 
timeout in the second half -- after the Owls had seized their 
second-biggest lead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got kids who come from different backgrounds,'' Chaney  
said. ``And many times, most of the backgrounds are losing 
backgrounds -- all negative. Everybody knows, everybody has the will 
to win. Very few people know how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After flirting with technicals in arguments with referee Reggie  
Greenwood, Chaney motioned for official Tom Clark to join him for a 
discussion. ``Come here!'' the coach screamed, and Clark jogged 
over for his tongue-lashing. When he was finished, Chaney ripped 
his sports coat off and rolled up his sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	``A game like this, this late in the season, and they give me  
these refs,'' Chaney lamented early in the game.

<HEADLINE> Rodman's Decision May Come Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- After all the waiting and all the  
guessing, Dennis Rodman may finally say Monday whether he's going 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, there's no telling what he might talk about.  
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time NBA rebounding champion has called a news  
conference at Planet Hollywood, and might announce whether he 
intends to play for the Los Angeles Lakers this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had been expected to join the Lakers ever since a  
newspaper report Feb. 13 that quoted sources close to Rodman as 
saying he had decided to play for the Lakers. A source close to the 
Lakers told The Associated Press on Feb. 14 the team expected to 
have him signed within a couple days. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then Rodman, who turns 38 in May, has offered conflicting  
comments about his plans. He told a Chicago Sun-Times reporter 
Wednesday he would sign with the team by the end of the week and 
even met with Lakers owner Jerry Buss that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Rodman said on ESPN's ``Up Close'' he hadn't  
come to a decision and would make an announcement after using the 
weekend to ``put my mind at ease and at peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has apparently been annoyed because he can't earn more  
money under the NBA's new labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who are over the salary cap, can sign him only for  
the veterans' minimum of $1 million, pro-rated to $600,000 for the 
shortened season and now under $500,000 because of the 10 games the 
team has already played. 
</P>
<P>
	However, one of the terms of Rodman's contract with Converse is  
that he receives $3 million if he plays in Los Angeles, Chicago or 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman made clear his resentment concerning the NBA's new labor  
agreement on ``Up Close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It ain't about Dennis Rodman trying to be greedy, it's not  
about that,'' he said. ``They've put me in a bind where I can't do 
anything but make the minimum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former Lakers great Magic Johnson, now a part-owner  
and vice president of the team, said on David Letterman's ``The 
Late Show'' Thursday night he was tired of the distraction Rodman 
was causing and he would ``love us just to say forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Rodman joins the Lakers, he could make his debut with the  
team Thursday, when the Lakers face the Los Angeles Clippers at the 
Anaheim Arena, or the following night when the same teams meet at 
the Forum in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers are currently out of town, playing at Denver on  
Monday night and Vancouver on Tuesday night before returning home.

<HEADLINE> N. Carolina, Virginia Play Classic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Calling it a mismatch appeared to be  
an understatement with No. 14 North Carolina facing undermanned, 
under-the-weather Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wound up as one of the most exciting games of the college  
basketball season, with Ademola Okulaja hitting a 3-pointer with 
1.4 seconds left to give the Tar Heels a 67-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``They worked hard,'' Okulaja said after rescuing his team from  
the upset. ``They punished us for every mistake we made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 15-0 and missing their first 10 shots, the  
Cavaliers, who have only six scholarship players, came back. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia even took the lead before halftime and stayed with the  
Tar Heels throughout the second half, leading seven different times 
and never allowing their hated rivals to go ahead by more than 4 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Okulaja connected on a 3-pointer and Ed Cota made a basket,  
giving North Carolina a 64-62 lead, but a 3-pointer by Cavaliers 
freshman Adam Hall with 49 seconds left enabled Virginia to regain 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Chezley Watson converted only one of two free throws, making it  
66-64 with 14.3 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the play that kept Cavaliers fans from rushing onto  
the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Cota penetrated into the lane and found a wide-open Okulaja, who  
nailed the game-winner -- which may have ended Virginia's postseason 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This meant a lot to us and to the alumni,'' Watson said.  
``We're still searching for one more win to get us into the NIT and 
it just slipped right out of our hands. When it happens like that, 
it's tough to swallow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Tar Heels' victory, Ronald Curry's return to  
Virginia was far from memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia high school phenom scored only 3 points in 19  
minutes. Curry verbally committed to Virginia before changing his 
mind and heading to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs like ``Benedict Curry,'' ``I Hate Curry,'' and one  
comparing his numbers to those of Cavaliers walk-on Josh Hare 
served to ``welcome'' Curry home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They love me here, don't they?'' Curry quipped after being  
jeered each time he touched the ball.

<HEADLINE> Strauss' ``Elektra'' Revived at Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Louder!'' composer Richard Strauss is said to  
have shouted to the conductor of the 115-piece orchestra during 
rehearsals for the world premiere of ``Elektra'' in 1909. ``I can 
still hear the voice of Frau Heink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contralto Ernestine Schumann-Heink, in the role of Klytemnestra,  
was not amused and returned the compliment by describing the music 
as ``a dreadful racket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety years later, Strauss' one-act masterpiece still tests the  
ability of orchestra and singers alike -- not just to make 
themselves heard, but to bring out the beauty and grandeur in a 
score that with its raucous dissonance often seems to stretch 
tonality to its limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metropolitan Opera's revival Friday night met most of  
``Elektra's'' challenges extremely well. The orchestra, conducted 
by James Levine, played with hair-raising intensity and splendor. 
And much of the singing was first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Where the performance fell short was where it usually does -- in  
the casting of the title role, which demands a dramatic soprano 
with lungs of steel who can declaim at full throttle for two hours 
with scarcely a rest. 
</P>
<P>
	As the daughter of Agamemnon, obsessed with avenging his murder  
at the hands of her mother, Gabriele Schnaut sang with energy and 
plenty of volume, but her voice lacked security in the crucial 
upper register. Any note above the staff -- and there are many, 
including a couple of high Cs -- tended to come out harsh or 
off-pitch. Her few quiet moments, such as the beautiful Recognition 
Scene with her brother, Orest, were more effective. 
</P>
<P>
	To Schnaut's credit, her performance was carefully thought out  
and at times compelling, within the confines of the garish Otto 
Schenk production. At the end, the audience cheered her for sheer 
survival in what may be the most punishing role in the repertory. 
</P>
<P>
	Listening to her scenes with her sister, Chrysothemis, one  
wondered what it would be like to hear Deborah Voigt in the title 
role. Her soft-grained soprano showed startling power and freedom 
in the climaxes, enveloping her high notes with a creamy tone and 
no trace of strain. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the casting was exemplary: Mezzo Hanna Schwarz sang  
and acted vividly as their mother, Klytemnestra; baritone Monte 
Pederson made an impressive debut as an Orest of warmth and 
nobility, and veteran tenor Kenneth Riegel did well in his brief 
scene as Aegisth, Klytemnestra's paramour.

<HEADLINE> Joyner Seeing Clearly After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Wally Joyner can see it clearly now -- he  
probably should have fixed his eyes a while ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Padres first baseman underwent corrective eye  
surgery on Nov. 24 to fix his vision, which had deteriorated to 
20/3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	After undergoing a laser procedure, Joyner now sees 20/20 out of  
his right eye and 20/25 out of his left. He plans to see how he 
does in spring training before deciding whether to go back for some 
touch-up work in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he's glad he went through with it after three years of  
contemplating whether he should. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some reservations,'' said Joyner, who has 1,881 hits in  
13 seasons. ``But I talked to the doctor about it and said, 
`Obviously my eyes are my livelihood, so what are the risks?''' 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me that with contacts, putting things in my eye every  
day and taking them out, was 500 times more dangerous than that 
surgery. There's bacteria, there's dust, there's all kinds of 
things that can go in and scratch your cornea,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres manager Bruce Bochy also underwent the laser surgery in  
mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner said Sunday his doctor had performed the procedure about  
10,000 times, so he knew the risks were limited. 
</P>
<P>
	In late October, Joyner had signed a two-year, $6.7 million  
contract, with a club option for 2001. He decided not to tell the 
team about the surgery, but said he was willing to risk voiding his 
contract if he could no longer play. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres general manager Kevin Towers said the 36-year-old Joyner  
had little to worry about. His contract certainly wouldn't be 
voided for trying to better himself. In fact, Towers said, the 
players are welcome to give the surgery a try. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I hear something that throws up some red flags, I don't  
know why not,'' Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire surgery lasted only five to seven minutes. Joyner  
said he didn't feel pain, just slight discomfort for about 50 
seconds in each eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seeing the ball well, I'm hitting, my fielding's fine,''  
Joyner said. ``I was thinking, I've got a couple more years to 
play. I've played with these bad eyes all my career. If there's a 
possibility of getting better eyesight, let's see if it helps.''

<HEADLINE> 2-Year-Old Stabbed in 'Horseplay' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE ELSINORE, Calif. (AP) -- A 4-year-old boy allegedly stabbed  
his 2-year-old sister to death with a fishing knife while the 
children were exploring a tackle box. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Cathers had been playing with her two older brothers in  
the yard behind their mobile home about 3 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	They entered a tool shed and found the tackle box. The  
4-year-old allegedly picked up the knife and struck the girl in the 
chest with it, according to Riverside County Sheriff's Detective 
Dave Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	He said investigators don't know why the boy stabbed his sister,  
but said the incident was being treated as an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children that age don't form intent,'' Collins said.  
``Obviously, there was some kind of horseplay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's department and the coroner's office were  
investigating the death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The child was pronounced dead at 3:30 p.m. in Menifee Valley  
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	No other information was available Saturday.

<HEADLINE>  Albright Makes No Headway on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, making scant headway toward a Kosovo peace settlement, 
said Sunday that if neither Serbs nor ethnic Albanians accept the 
six-nation plan, NATO cannot carry through on its threat to attack 
Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	With a new deadline set for Tuesday, Serb negotiators ``are not  
engaging at all'' over the critical question of whether NATO 
peacekeepers would enforce the settlement, while the Kosovar 
Albanians must still be persuaded to sign on fully with the plan to 
give them greater autonomy in the Serb province, Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are dealing, and I think we have to appreciate this, with  
decisions that affect their lives,'' Albright said. ``It is a 
question of war and peace for them. In think we need to understand 
the difficulty of the decisions that they are making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright will return to this small town southwest of Paris on  
Monday for more talks with the ethnic Albanians, a senior U.S. 
official told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, talking to reporters, declined to explain what was  
holding up Albanian approval. In fact, she said, U.S. officials 
thought the Albanians had given her a green light on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But other U.S. officials said the renewed negotiations focused  
on the Albanians' quest for independence after the plan's interim 
three-year period, and the U.S. refusal to endorse independence. 
And Albright, ruling out any independence referendum in the 
agreement, said she was looking for a way ``the voice of the 
people'' could be expressed in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``if this fails because both parties say no, there will not  
be bombing of Serbia and we will try to figure out ways of trying 
to deal with both sides,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Albright said that if the Albanians give their total  
endorsement to the complex plan -- which would give the majority 
Albanians significant autonomy but stop short of independence for 
Kosovo -- and if the Serbs keep holding out, then the Serbs would be 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbian side is not cooperative. The Serbian side believes  
that it can have half the deal, which is to talk about the 
political part of the document. ... There is no deal and no 
cooperation if they are not willing to engage in what is a basic 
aspect of the agreement,'' she said, referring to the NATO 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said she left U.S.  
Ambassador Christopher Hill -- the U.S. special envoy to the talks -- 
to continue negotiating with the Albanian representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	And British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also tried to put  
pressure on the ethnic Albanians to accept the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't sign up to these texts, it is extremely difficult  
to see how NATO could then take action against Belgrade,'' he said 
told the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	German Foreign Minister Jodvhka Fischer, at a European foreign  
ministers meeting in Luxembourg, ruled out another extension of the 
peace talks. ``There will not be another extension,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, on CNN, took a much more sympathetic tone with the  
Albanians, saying ``their lives are in the balance,'' but restated 
the U.S. opposition to granting them full independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we really need to do is to focus on this interim period,  
help them to really make sure that the various instruments that are 
part of this agreement that has local elections, local police, the 
possibility of schools that teach the Albanian language ... plus a 
presidency and a constitution, that we ought to focus on making 
those institutions real,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a widespread six-republic nation, Yugoslavia has shattered  
since 1991 to the point of having only two republics, Serbia and 
tiny Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kosovo's 2 million people are about 90 percent ethnic  
Albanian, the Serbs consider the province the cradle of their 
culture and their Orthodox faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright met for three hours with Albanian leaders and then for  
nearly an hour with Serbian President Milan Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said  
the negotiations centered on trying to find a way not to foreclose 
the option of independence in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the reporters in a light drizzle outside the  
Rambouillet town hall, where she was greeted by local dignitaries 
at the end of her day's talks, Albright said her next move own 
plans were up in the air. ``I have made no decision how long I will 
stay here,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told CNN that Milutinovic, reiterating the position of  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, said Serb resistance to the 
agreement's call for a NATO peacekeeping force was due to concern 
for the Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The six nations sponsoring the talks -- the United States,  
France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Russia -- agreed Saturday to 
extend the deadline they had set for noon that day until 3 p.m. (9 
a.m. EST) Tuesday. They are trying to end the fighting in which at 
least 2,000 people have died in Kosovo and 300,000 have been left 
homeless.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Says No to Drugs, Yes to Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Juliette Lewis is back making movies after a  
break to kick her drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising star of the late '80s and early '90s, who received an  
Academy Award nomination for ``Cape Fear,'' dropped out of sight in 
1996 after playing Shirley MacLaine's granddaughter in ``The 
Evening Star.'' 
</P>

	``The bravest thing I ever did was continuing to live when I  
wanted to die,'' Lewis says in Sunday's Daily News. ``That's all 
melodramatic, but it's not melodramatic. Actually, I lived it, but 
that moment in time. But continuing past that point and having some 
kind of faith that I could be strong and love life again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' new film is ``The Other Sister,'' in which she plays a  
mentally retarded woman trying to achieve some independence and 
pursue a romance. After that, she'll appear with William Hurt in 
the thriller ``The 4th Floor.''

<HEADLINE> Gates Foundation Now Sixth Largest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Boosted by a new donation this month of more  
than $3 billion, a philanthropic foundation created by Microsoft 
Corp. founder Bill Gates is now the sixth largest in the country, 
the latest edition of The Chronicle of Philanthropy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The William H. Gates Foundation, named after Gates' father, is  
now worth $5.2 billion, the biweekly said in its edition dated Feb. 
25. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lilly Endowment, in Indianapolis, is the largest foundation,  
with assets of more than $15 billion, followed by the Ford 
Foundation, $10.7 billion; the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, 
$9.6 billion; the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, $7.8 billion; and 
the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Gates foundation, others in the top 10 are the Pew  
Charitable Trusts at $4.7 billion, the John D. and Catherine T. 
MacArthur Foundation at $4.1 billion, the Robert W. Woodruff 
Foundation at $3.7 billion and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation at 
$3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle said the nation's largest foundations increased  
their giving by 28 percent last year with grants from 122 surveyed 
foundations rising to $6.24 billion. It said 138 foundations that 
reported endowment sizes held combined assets at the end of the 
year of $154.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The William H. Gates Foundation provides grants for health,  
population and education projects worldwide. In addition, Gates 
established the Gates Learning Foundation, which works to spread 
Internet access and computer training and is worth $1.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> NYC Water System Said Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Terrorism and pollution are major  
threats to New York City's drinking water because the police agency 
protecting the watershed is understaffed and underequipped, 
environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The city under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has ``turned a blind eye''  
to the needs of the 2,000-square-mile watershed north of the city, 
Kennedy said. It provides drinking water to 9 million New Yorkers. 
His comments came as he issued a report for Riverkeeper Inc., a 
Hudson Valley environmental watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giuliani administration has ``systematically underpaid,  
undermanned, overworked, undersupplied, undersupervised and 
undertrained its bedraggled and demoralized officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But state Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner  
Joel Miele said the Kennedy report is ``stale'' and that many of 
its 15 recommendations are already being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	The watershed ``is not a building where I can put a guard at the  
front door and a guard at the back door and say that I've got it 
under control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the problems Kennedy alleges is that there are dozens of  
unguarded areas where terrorists could poison the water or 
otherwise sabotage the system. He also said there are too few 
officers on patrol at a time and that their top salary is less than 
$24,000 a year, guaranteeing the loss of experience that comes with 
heavy turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	Miele said Kennedy's complaints about staff, salary and  
equipment shortages are legitimate, but not necessarily realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby may believe I have a magic wand and when I approve a  
list, Poof! the stuff appears,'' Miele said. ``But in the city of 
New York that's not the way business works.''

<HEADLINE> Animosity Lingers for Clinton, GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and congressional leaders  
mark the beginning of the post-impeachment Congress with a White 
House meeting Tuesday, but don't expect much beyond a shaky image 
of bipartisan cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides feel pressure from the public to demonstrate they are  
dealing with the nation's business and moving beyond the Senate 
impeachment trial, which ended Feb. 12 with Clinton's acquittal. 
The White House session will be the first meeting in 19 months 
between the president and Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican distrust for Clinton runs deep, as do partisan  
divisions on Social Security and tax cuts, the major issues facing 
the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the lingering animosity and the differences on issues,  
there is little chance that much will occur at the White House 
beyond symbolic gestures of intent to work together. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like something that's more for show,'' said Bill  
Connelly, a political scientist at Washington and Lee University in 
Lexington, Va., who has studied Congress. ``The gulf between 
congressional Republicans and the Democratic White House is 
enormous, and not likely to be bridged by a single meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That distrust was sown in 1995, well before the start of  
Clinton's 13-month-long impeachment ordeal. Republicans say Clinton 
used that year's failed White House budget talks to create an 
illusion that he was working with them but was actually planning to 
use GOP proposals on revamping Medicare to bash them during his 
1996 run for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has long denied the allegation. Even so,  
Republicans like Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a top House 
conservative and member of the House leadership, says GOP trust for 
Clinton just isn't there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamental question of whether you can trust him on  
anything he says will be there,'' McIntosh said. ``Even if he says 
`I'll work with you on Social Security, tax cuts, education,' 
nobody would take that promise to the bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton ``fully intends''  
to work with GOP leaders this year and next on a range of issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be up to the Republican leadership to decide if  
they're going to work with him or not,'' Toiv said. ``The American 
people would not be particularly pleased by any suggestion by one 
side or the other that they won't work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side is likely to show up with specific new proposals on  
the major issues confronting them, which will leave gaping partisan 
and substantive differences to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	The top agenda item is to shore up Social Security for the  
pending retirement of baby boomers. Clinton favors putting some 
money in government-run investments, while Republicans want 
individuals to control that money. And neither side seems willing 
to suggest benefit reductions or tax increases that many experts 
say likely are needed to buttress the massive pension system. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major split is over tax cuts, where Republicans want  
bigger, broader reductions than Clinton does. The two sides say 
they favor more spending on defense and improved schools but differ 
over details. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Clinton met at length with top congressional  
Republicans was July 15, 1997, as they wrapped up talks on the 
budget-balancing plan enacted a few days later. Last year, during 
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, there were no such sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 11, 1997, Clinton journeyed to the Capitol to meet with  
congressional leaders in what both sides hoped would be a 
demonstration of bipartisan resolve to address major issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides emerged listing balancing the budget and five  
other topics as their top priorities, and they appointed working 
groups to work on them. They did work out a budget-balancing 
package and cut some taxes that year, but the other matters -- 
including fighting juvenile crime and helping welfare recipients 
find jobs -- were mostly unaddressed.

<HEADLINE> New Speaker Vows To Work With Dems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dennis Hastert, the new House speaker,  
promises a no-nonsense, hardworking Congress where Republicans will 
try to work with Democrats, even on such normally partisan issues 
as increasing the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people want Congress to work, and they don't want  
it to work exclusively on a Republican way or exclusively on a 
Democratic way,'' Hastert, R-Ill., said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
``There's good ideas that come up on both sides of the aisle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and other GOP leaders meet President Clinton on Tuesday,  
both sides trying to show they can lay aside partisan differences 
and work for the country's good. That's been a common theme for 
Hastert since he succeeded former Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said middle ground could be found on the question of  
increasing the minimum wage, strongly supported by Democrats but 
opposed by most Republicans who warn of its effects on small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress should improve the quality of life for entry-level  
workers without threatening their jobs, Hastert said. ``There needs 
to be a balance, and I think we can come to that balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said the two parties will differ over how to spend  
education dollars -- Democrats want more money for teachers and 
school construction, and Republicans want to shift more power to 
the states and local level -- but he said his party won't pursue its 
earlier goal of abolishing the Education Department. ``We've been 
through that route before,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On tax cuts, Hastert said disputes between the GOP demand for an  
across-the-board cut and the White House support for more limited 
reductions could be narrowed. ``I think you can do a little bit of 
both,'' Hastert said. ``I think you can do a small 
across-the-board, and you can start to look at targets and areas 
that you want to address. For instance, a capital gains is a 
target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My mantra is that we get our work done on time,'' Hastert  
said, promising to finish work on this year's budget bill by 
mid-April as required by law. Last year no budget bill was passed 
because of differences within the Republican party. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert also refused to criticize the administration over its  
handling of the crisis in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the secretary of state. They have their plan, what  
they think they need to do,'' he said. ``What we're trying to do is 
give the administration enough time to negotiate and do what they 
have to do.''

<HEADLINE> American Seeks To Arbitrate Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines, mired in a stalemate  
with pilots over the purchase of low-cost carrier Reno Air by its 
parent company AMR Corp., has renewed its offer to have an 
independent arbitrator help resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said in a release Sunday that its arbitration offer  
was made to the Allied Pilots Association during talks on Thursday. 
The release called Monday's scheduled meeting of the APA's board of 
directors a ``critical next step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At the present, we are essentially negotiating with  
ourselves,'' American said. ``If we cannot resolve this matter on 
our own, we are prepared to bring in a mediator or a neutral 
arbitrator, if APA will agree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	APA officials could not be immediately reached by The Associated  
Press on Sunday. A telephone recording at the union headquarters, 
last updated on Friday, mentioned nothing about the possibility of 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	American was forced to cancel more than 6,600 flights over a  
10-day period because of a sickout that ended last week after a 
federal judge held the APA in contempt.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Attendant Talks Disrupted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A group of Northwest Airlines flight  
attendants hope hand-delivered petitions with more than 8,000 
signatures will have an impact on negotiators hammering out a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine flight attendants tried to barge in on negotiations in  
downtown Minneapolis Saturday and deliver the petitions, which said 
the attendants will ``fight for a fair contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants were stymied when federal mediator  
Laurette Piculin initially refused to let them into the room, said 
Billie Davenport, chairwoman of the flight attendants' negotiating 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport, the highest elected officer of Teamsters Local 2000,  
said the surprise visit rankled Northwest's bargaining team because 
the protesters had invited the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Piculin opened the door and quickly shut it. But about 10  
minutes later Davenport led her negotiating team into the hall to 
accept the petitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the group said they were disappointed because they  
wanted to confront the company's negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to strike, but we will if we have to,'' flight  
attendant Amy Morton of San Francisco told Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the company is optimistic  
that an agreement will be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said she hopes a settlement can be reached by the end  
of March.

<HEADLINE>  Red Sox Lefties Eager To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Two lefty relievers are eager to return  
to Fenway Park, hoping to help the Red Sox win. That's about where 
the similarities end. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Guthrie, expected to be the top lefty in the bullpen, grew  
up in the Boston area and spent several birthdays watching the Red 
Sox in person. 
</P>
<P>
	Rheal Cormier, a longshot for a job, grew up in Canada, spent  
1995 with Boston but pitched only one major league game the past 
two years because of arm troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice situation to be in as a left-handed reliever  
because of their scarcity,'' Guthrie said Sunday, the first workout 
day for pitchers and catchers, ``but you still have to go out and 
produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie signed as a free agent after spending the last 3 1/2  
seasons with Los Angeles. He spent his other 6 1/2 years with 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Cormier was 7-5 with Boston in 1995 in 48 games, 12 of them  
starts, then was traded to Montreal. He was 7-10 the next year then 
pitched one game in 1997 before undergoing tendon transplant 
surgery in his left elbow that ended his season. He signed with 
Cleveland before the 1998 season but pitched just 9 2-3 innings for 
Double-A Akron before a sore shoulder ended his season. Boston 
signed him as a free agent last Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Cormier said his arm feels strong but there appears to be only  
one open spot on Boston's projected 11-man pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I just want my arm to feel good and be able to take  
the ball and go out there when they ask me to go,'' he said. ``I'm 
just going out there knowing I don't have any pains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he chose Boston over other interested teams because he  
enjoyed his season with the Red Sox and had worked with Boston 
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan when both were in Montreal in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He basically knows all my mechanics,'' Cormier said. ``If I  
would do something wrong early, he'd be able to correct me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cormier, 31, figures to start the season at Triple A-Pawtucket  
since Boston has 29 pitchers in the major league camp and only 
plans to keep 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie, 33, figures to spend the season as Boston's primary  
lefty reliever. In his time with Los Angeles, he had a 3.67 ERA and 
5-10 record in 216 innings over 205 games. He can serve as a setup 
man for Tom Gordon, who converted 46 of 47 save opportunities last 
season, his first as a closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to help to get him on the mound and put him in that  
situation again,'' Guthrie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie attended elementary school in Scituate, a suburb south  
of Boston, before moving to Venice, Fla., where he didn't even make 
his high school team. But he won a spot as a walk-on at Louisiana 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	He was glad when the Red Sox called.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't really want to be on the West Coast because we live  
in Florida, so it's an easy trip for us'' to Boston, Guthrie said. 
``We're familiar with the area and I have a lot of memories through 
my youth of baseball at Fenway Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They always had good teams and it was always a special feeling  
going back there to play them when I was with Minnesota,'' he 
added, ``so it was an exciting opportunity for me to get a chance 
to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cormier feels the same way, even though there's no guarantee  
he'll stay in the majors. At least he's pitching without pain 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a ballplayer has major surgery, almost career-ending,  
you're always thinking, `Am I ever going to be the same?' '' 
Cormier said. ``I feel good right now. I feel my arm is really 
coming back where it was before.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Set for a 1st Lady Senate Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says a  
decision by Hillary Rodham Clinton to run for the Senate from New 
York would only add to his desire to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans also gave notice that the first lady would  
face a rough-and-tumble battle for the seat. It's the kind of race 
that lovers of politics ``kind of salivate over,'' former Sen. 
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of Democrats are urging Mrs. Clinton to run for  
the Senate seat that opens up next year when Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D-N.Y., retires. She has said she is giving serious 
thought to the idea, and President Clinton has said he would 
support her if she decides to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls put her ahead of Giuliani, who also has yet to  
formally enter the race, but both sides agree it would be a 
bruising affair where Mrs. Clinton would have to sacrifice her 
privacy and face attacks over Whitewater, her support for liberal 
causes and her statement last year in favor of a Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you it's no walk in the park,'' former Democratic  
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, who twice lost bids for a New York Senate 
seat, said in an interview with Time magazine. ``The tabloids try 
to eat you alive every day. Much worse, they go after your 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said he would be more inclined to run if Mrs. Clinton  
is his opponent. ``It would be the most focused-on race in the 
country,'' he said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``Starting off from 
the underdog position would probably be a good thing from my point 
of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Amato, who lost his seat last November after a bitter battle  
with Democrat Charles Schumer, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that 
trying again next year was ``certainly very tempting.'' He said 
there were at least two other attractive Republican moderates who 
could run successfully against Mrs. Clinton -- Reps. Jack Quinn and 
Rick Lazio. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton would be formidable but ``this is not a laydown,''  
D'Amato said. He speculated that the longer she waits to make her 
decision, the more likely it was that she will run. Republicans 
``are actually relishing the battle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat who thinks she shouldn't is former White House aide  
George Stephanopoulos, who, in an open memo to the first lady in 
this week's Newsweek, wrote that ``Whitewater, billing records, 
cattle futures, the travel office and Castle Grande (real estate 
development) will all be back. ... Do you really want to spend your 
last year in the White House reliving the most painful episodes of 
your tenure?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who has expressed her interest in  
the Senate seat, said she would gladly give up her plans to run if 
Mrs. Clinton enters the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she decides to run I will support her enthusiastically,''  
she said on Fox, adding that ``it's just a week after the 
impeachment is over and she deserves the time she needs'' to make 
that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Time also quoted Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who is urging the  
first lady to run, as saying he discussed the matter with Clinton 
when he joined him on an Air Force One flight to Mexico last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more excited than I've ever seen him about anything,''  
Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the Sunday news programs, including the Republicans,  
made much of the fact that Mrs. Clinton, raised in Illinois and a 
longtime resident of Arkansas and Washington, has not lived in New 
York. New York has a history, with Robert Kennedy of Massachusetts 
and James Buckley of Connecticut, of electing out-of-staters to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said on Fox that even  
as a person familiar with tough Chicago politics, ``I'm not sure 
why anybody from Illinois wants to stick their nose in New York 
politics.''

<HEADLINE> Role of Blacks in Civil War Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Like other members of the Sons of Confederate  
Veterans, Emerson Emory says he wants to preserve his Southern 
heritage. His mission, however, is especially challenging -- and 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74-year-old Dallas psychiatrist is black, and his insistence  
that many black Southerners not only supported the Confederacy but 
fought for it in the Civil War often draws reactions ranging from 
skepticism to outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the reaction was among my friends in the black race --  
they couldn't understand,'' Emory said. ``I think it's one of those 
things that they don't want to hear anything about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While recognition of the role black soldiers played for the  
Union -- dramatized in the movie ``Glory'' -- has grown in the past 
decade, there remains little recognition -- or even acknowledgment -- 
of black Confederates. There is sharp debate about their numbers, 
if any, and why they would have supported the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Emory, a World War II Army veteran, was turned down last summer  
in his request to pay tribute to black Confederates at ceremonies 
in Washington that honored nearly 200,000 black soldiers who fought 
in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	The African-American Civil War Foundation's historian wrote that  
the memorial was dedicated to the troops who fought to end slavery 
and expressed doubt that black men served the Confederate Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights leaders also criticized the teachers of a class  
last fall at Randolph Community College in North Carolina. The 
teachers -- Sons of Confederate Veterans members like Emory -- 
contended that some slaves were loyal to the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Kelly Barrow, a Zebulon, Ga., high school teacher who is  
white, has spent years researching blacks in the Confederacy. 
Besides many disbelieving blacks, he said, there are whites who 
don't want to admit that blacks fought for the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in opposition either way. Certain people have always  
tried to divide white and black Southerners,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrow's 1995 book, ``Forgotten Confederates,'' is an anthology  
that draws upon wartime newspaper accounts, later accounts of Civil 
War reunions, essays, obituaries and pension records to offer 
evidence of blacks serving the Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Southern heritage buffs estimate their numbers at anywhere  
from 38,000 to 90,000 men, mainly serving as laborers, teamsters, 
musicians and cooks. 
</P>
<P>
	As early as 1863, Confederate Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne urged  
that blacks be enlisted as soldiers. There was opposition from 
Confederates who questioned whether men serving as soldiers could 
be returned to slavery after the war and who would work the 
region's farms if slaves were taken away. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1865, the Confederate Congress authorized black  
soldiers, but there's little indication that any all-black 
Confederate units went to war. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are accounts that, from the war's beginning,  
blacks in gray sometimes were armed in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the Negroes had arms, rifles, muskets, sabers, Bowie  
knives, dirks, etc.,'' Union Capt. Isaac W. Heysinger wrote in an 
1862 account of the Maryland campaign. He said there appeared to be 
thousands among the Confederate Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrow also found numerous anecdotal accounts, from blacks  
manning Confederate artillery at the first Battle of Bull Run to 
stories of black sharpshooters being used to harass Union troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides examples of loyalty and even bravery on behalf of the  
Confederacy, Southern heritage buffs also note that there were no 
wide slave insurrections during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why? This was their home,'' Emory said.  
</P>
<P>
	However, those on the other side of the debate point to the  
thousands of slaves who fled to the North and joined the fight 
against the Rebels. Many of those who remained behind likely did so 
out of fear and an expectation that they would soon be free 
regardless, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the star of the Confederacy waned, the Negroes within its  
shrinking orbit continued to enact the roles in which they had cast 
themselves,'' wrote Morgan State College professor Benjamin Quarles 
in his 1953 book, ``The Negro in the Civil War.'' ``They were 
convinced that the fated hour of freedom was drawing nearer by the 
minute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nash Boney, a retired University of Georgia history professor,  
said it's hard to tell why blacks apparently remained loyal to the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot who were never officially in the Confederate  
Army but damned near to it -- and there were an awful lot of them 
that ran away when they could,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rep. DeLay Dismisses Lawsuit Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Tom DeLay, the House Republican leader  
who led the drive to impeach President Clinton for statements he 
made under oath, now finds himself at the center of his own 
controversy over truthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay got a lot of media attention as he kept up a steady stream  
of invective against Clinton. But now the spotlight has turned and 
is focused on the Texan. DeLay is being asked about discrepancies 
between statements he made in a legal proceeding and in financial 
disclosure forms he is required to file as a member of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, it's my opinion he lied to me under oath,'' said  
Gerald DeNisco, the Houston lawyer who questioned DeLay for a 1994 
deposition in a civil lawsuit filed against the congressman by a 
business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The former pest exterminator, whose profile rose after the  
former speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich, resigned, blames Democrats for 
critical media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the most investigated man in America. They're trying to  
bring me down,'' DeLay, the No. 3 GOP House leader, said this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the man who repeatedly exhorted Clinton to provide facts  
isn't rushing to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally loquacious, the majority whip is brushing off  
inquiries regarding the lawsuit filed against him by a business 
partner who claimed DeLay and a third partner were trying to oust 
him from a pest control firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have answers to all of that,'' DeLay said in a brief  
hallway encounter. ``It ain't worth talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides have been equally tightlipped. Questions about DeLay's  
business dealings were first raised by an alternative Houston 
weekly in 1995 and were resurrected recently by The New Republic, a 
liberal-oriented magazine. ``These stories are being forwarded by 
political enemies of Tom DeLay, and we choose not to fight them out 
in the press,'' said spokesman Michael Scanlon. 
</P>
<P>
	The roots of DeLay's current troubles reach back to that 1994  
deposition, taken 10 months before he got the GOP leadership post. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay, who owned a third of Albo Pest Control, testified that he  
had not been an officer of the company for two or three years. But 
on congressional financial disclosure forms filed for several years 
preceding the deposition -- and one filed three months afterward -- 
he listed himself as chairman of Albo's board of directors. He 
dropped the title on his 1995 report. 
</P>
<P>
	DeNisco, the lawyer, said he believes DeLay was attempting to  
limit financial liability by denying he was a corporate officer. 
DeLay later retreated somewhat from his claim, saying he couldn't 
remember when he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The spat with former Albo partner Robert Blankenship, ultimately  
settled with an undisclosed payment to Blankenship, wasn't DeLay's 
first business dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	A court imposed a $32,000 judgment against DeLay in 1984 after  
he stopped making payments to Robert Bartnett for the purchase of 
Bartnett's pest control company. DeLay, elected to Congress in 
1984, didn't report that debt on his disclosure form. 
</P>
<P>
	Business isn't the only arena where the 51-year-old DeLay has  
come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The blunt-spoken Texan, known as ``The Hammer,'' has had ethical  
scrapes since joining Congress. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	--In an affidavit given to House Democrats last year, a  
Republican donor said DeLay urged him to evade campaign finance 
laws and funnel more money than legally allowed to a GOP 
congressional candidate in East Texas. DeLay denied the accusation 
by Orange, Texas, businessman Peter F. Cloeren, who pleaded guilty 
to funneling $37,000 in corporate contributions to the Brian Babin 
campaign. Cloeren and his company paid $400,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House ethics committee investigated complaints accusing  
DeLay of granting favors to his lobbyist brother and demanding 
campaign contributions for Republican causes from other lobbyists. 
The ethics committee dismissed the complaints in 1997 but reminded 
him that House members are prohibited from soliciting contributions 
in the Capitol or House office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Allies trace DeLay's recent troubles to his high-profile  
impeachment role. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minions of the politics of personal destruction have  
focused their guns on Tom DeLay,'' said lobbyist David Rehr, a 
longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Bill Paxon, who found himself shoulder-to-shoulder  
with DeLay when both were implicated in a failed plot to oust 
Gingrich as House speaker in 1997, said that ``Tom DeLay is without 
question one, if not the, most hard-rock-solid men of integrity 
I've worked with in two decades in elective office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through a conversation about DeLay, Eric Thode, chairman  
of the Republican Party in the congressman's home district, 
launched into a discussion about term limits. Lengthy tenure in 
Congress ``changes people -- and not for the better, usually,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that description applies to DeLay, Thode answered  
slowly: ``Has it happened to everybody in the process? Probably.''

<HEADLINE> Washington Monument Deck Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The observation deck atop the Washington  
Monument reopens to visitors Monday behind a scaffolding grid for 
workers cleaning and repairing the monument's marble walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Its interior has been closed since Oct. 5 to allow workmen  
unhindered time to erect the metal and fabric web now enclosing the 
outside surfaces of the 555 foot obelisk. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, work is nearing completion on the monument's  
first-ever interpretative center, which uses sections of the 
scaffolding to frame display panels focused on George Washington's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	When the temporary center opens next weekend, visitors can pose  
with a replica of the monument's aluminum-capped tip, listen to 
recordings of workmen reporting the progress of the repair work and 
view a televised kaleidoscope of images of demonstrations and 
ceremonies at the monument's base. 
</P>
<P>
	A central chamber reproduces the observation deck, down to the  
water and rust stains on its marble-sided walls. Visitors can see 
the topside views via video screens without ever venturing into the 
monument itself. The $2 million center was financed by a donation 
to the National Park Foundation by Discovery Communications Inc., 
parent company of Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	All repair work is to be completed and the scaffolding removed  
by the middle of 2000. The visitor center will close in September 
of that year, although the National Park Service eventually hopes 
to replace it with a permanent facility.

	NATO Plan Stalls Kosovo Peace Deal  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, making scant headway toward a Kosovo peace settlement, 
said Sunday that if neither Serbs nor ethnic Albanians accept the 
six-nation plan, NATO cannot carry through on its threat to attack 
Serb targets. With a new deadline set for Tuesday, Serb negotiators 
``are not engaging at all'' over the critical question of whether 
NATO peacekeepers would enforce the settlement, while the Kosovar 
Albanians must still be persuaded to sign on fully with the plan to 
give them greater autonomy in the Serb province, Albright said.

There was no immediate word on damage or casualties from the 
strikes near al-Amarah and Tallil, about 170 miles southeast of 
Baghdad. All the planes returned to their base, a statement from 
the U.S. Central Command said. There was no immediate comment from

deadliest terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict. 
In the Irish Republic, five men were questioned under Ireland's 
Offenses Against the State Act anti-terrorist laws. Detectives in 
Northern Ireland, ruled by the British, arrested two men. Police

Congo's human rights record led to the new inquiry. The rebels have 
been accused of massacring hundreds of civilians in eastern Congo, 
where the war-weary population has shown little faith in the 
six-month-old insurgency against President Laurent Kabila and often

season, costing coach George Karl his job. The Lakers got 27 points

<HEADLINE> Exercise Programs May Help Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An exercising worker is a happier and  
healthier worker, and may even save the boss a bit on health 
insurance if the worker joins the corporate wellness program and 
stays with it, studies find. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enthusiastic participation in worksite wellness programs can  
yield a variety of health benefits,'' said Dr. Roy J. Shephard of 
the University of Toronto. ``However, only a minority of employees 
participate in worksite wellness programs, and even fewer have the 
enthusiasm needed to achieve health benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The programs put exercise equipment and health advisers close to  
workers. And the programs have an added incentive -- the company 
picks up at least part of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	The result should be that workers' health should improve. And  
Shephard's review in a medical journal, The Physician and 
Sportsmedicine, reports that it does. For instance, studies found 
body fat fell 13 percent on average. 
</P>
<P>
	But weight losses are smaller -- around 2 percent -- when they are  
averaged across entire companies, including people who don't take 
part in the programs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants also were able to lower their blood pressure, and a  
relative few -- 1 percent to 3 percent -- quit smoking, the article 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers also can increase their aerobic power, but the amount  
reported depends on how much aerobic exercise they do and how 
carefully the company tracks the results, Shephard said. At a 
pioneering wellness program at Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the maker of 
healthcare products, women gained 7.4 percent and men gained 4.4 
percent after two years, compared with people who did not take 
part. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise commonly makes people feel better, and working out at  
work is no exception, Shephard said. Exercisers report more 
positive mood states. However, studies also have found that workers 
who worked out didn't necessarily improve their job satisfaction as 
a result, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line for a boss may be whether the program saves  
money on health care. The answer is yes, but not a lot, Shephard 
said. Studies find medical claims for health care are $100 to $400 
less for people who take part in company-sponsored wellness 
programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And program participants take a little less sick time -- maybe a  
half day per worker per year, he said. ``This may reflect an 
improved mood state or an increase in organizational loyalty rather 
than improved health,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, beginning exercisers may take a bit more time  
off with aches and pains they blame on their workouts, Shephard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, however, the programs seem worth the employers'  
commitment, the article said. ``The cumulative benefit has been 
estimated at $500 to $700 per worker per year, enough to cover the 
cost of a modest wellness program,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is in how to get workers to join and stay with the  
programs. That's not easy, because an estimated 25 percent of 
Americans do no exercise, noted Dr. Nicholas A. DiNubile, an 
orthopedic surgeon in Havertown, Pa. Physicians can encourage 
corporate fitness by speaking to executives about the 
cost-effectiveness of corporate fitness programs, he wrote in a 
separate article in the same issue of the medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
	And companies may see non-health-related benefits for wellness  
programs where there's a lot of corporate competition for quality 
employees, commented Tim Larson, human resources manager for Apple 
Computer Inc. at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No.1 reason is attraction and retention of employees,''  
Larson said. ``Silicon Valley is a really, really hot job market 
and most large companies have fitness centers and some wellness 
component.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple has never run the numbers to see if the program saved the  
corporation money or lost it, Larson said. However, Apple does make 
sure the program stays under cost controls, he said. For instance, 
Apple charges employees who take part, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, 75 percent of the program is covered by employee  
fees,'' Larson said. ``You can run a very successful program 
without running it free.'' In fact, requiring a fee may be better, 
because employees who are paying something are more likely to keep 
taking part -- so they get value for their money, he said.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad-De La Hoya Bout May Happen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Pernell Whitaker was en route to a  
hospital with a busted jaw, the talk back at Madison Square Garden 
was about Felix Trinidad fighting Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Don King as a promoter wants to promote that fight, I as a  
fighter want to knock him out,'' Trinidad said after his one-sided 
decision over Whitaker in defense of the IBF welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker, a former champion is four weight classes, is 35 and  
has lost to both Trinidad and De La Hoya. However, he said the 
latest loss and injury will not keep him from continuing his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker underwent surgery for a fractured right jaw just before  
dawn Sunday in St. Vincent's Hospital, according to Donald 
Tremblay, a spokesman for Main Events, Whitaker's promoter. His jaw 
was not wired and he is able to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Lou Duva said he thought Whitaker was hurt when he was  
hit by an elbow in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Sunday, King was bellowing about getting Trinidad a shot  
at De La Hoya, who kept the WBC welterweight title on a split 
decision over Ike Quartey on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Trinidad is to make a mandatory defense against Vincent  
Pettway in May, and De La Hoya is to make a mandatory defense 
against Oba Carr in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Arum, who with Oscar De La Hoya Enterprises promotes De La  
Hoya, has reserved a Sept. 18 date for a pay-per-view fight between 
the two unbeaten champions. He reportedly has offered $8 million to 
Trinidad. De La Hoya, easily the biggest attraction outside the 
heavyweight division, would get more. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there are obstacles to such a match, and one of them  
could be King. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad and Evander Holyfield, the WBA-IBF heavyweight  
champion, are the two jewels in King's crown. Should Holyfield lose 
to WBC champion Lennox Lewis on March 13, King could be reluctant 
to let Trinidad, with whom he has a multiyear contract, fight De La 
Hoya, who has a deal with HBO and TVKO, it's pay-per-view arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad of Puerto Rico has no deal with HBO or Showtime, but  
King has a deal with Showtime, and that could present a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya wants to remain a welterweight for now. Trinidad, who  
has trouble getting down to the 147-pound limit, said he would be 
willing to fight at that weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after his loss, Whitaker said, ``Trinidad is better  
than De La Hoya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Whitaker lost the WBC title on a split decision to De La  
Hoya, however, on April 12, 1997, it was his fourth fight in a 
year. On Saturday night, he was fighting for the first time in 16 
months, and he spent time in drug and alcohol rehabilitation during 
the layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker's performances against Trinidad and De La Hoya will  
help fuel arguments that will add to the fight's attractiveness, 
especially if it does happen this year.

<HEADLINE> Three Ring Wins Davona Dale Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Three Ring, who never has finished out  
of the money, ran away with the Grade 2 $100,000 Davona Dale Stakes 
for 3-year-old fillies at Gulfstream Park Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In front from the start, the 4-to-5 favorite turned it on at the  
top of the stretch and won by 14 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden Temper was second and Gold From The West finished third  
in a field of five going a mile and 70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida-bred daughter of Notebook, ridden by John R.  
Velazquez, was timed in 1:41 2/5 and paid $3.60, $2.80 and $2.10. 
Golden Temper paid $4.40 and $2.10. Gold From The West paid $2.10 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring broke on top and was in control throughout. She led  
Golden Temper by two lengths turning down the backstretch, with 
Gold From The West next. The order of the first three did not 
change the rest of the way -- but the margin surely did. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning for home, Three Ring opened her lead to three lengths  
and increased it with every single stride. Golden Temper finished 
second by three-quarters of a length over Gold From The West. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Barry Schwartz, Three Ring has won four of seven  
starts, with two seconds and one third, earning $533,440. Last 
year, she won the $125,000 Susan's Girl and the $408,000 My Dear 
Girl divisions of the Florida Stallion Stakes at Calder Race 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Eddie Plesa Jr. tried blinkers on Three Ring Sunday for  
the first time, and it obviously made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked her with blinkers a couple of weeks ago, and I could  
tell right away she was much better with them on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Velazquez, who rode two earlier winners Sunday, has ridden Three  
Ring in all but her first start.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks To Expand Gun Tracing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying they've identified a potent new tool in  
fighting youth crime, Clinton administration officials are asking 
Congress for money to expand a program that traces guns routed 
illegally into the hands of young people. 
</P>
<P>
	The call came as the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms released an analysis Sunday of its Youth Crime Gun 
Interdiction Initiative. The program traced guns used in 76,260 
crimes in 27 cities over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	ATF found that one-third to one-half of the traced guns were  
purchased from licensed dealers by people acting as ``straw'' 
intermediaries for the real owners, and only 35 percent were 
stolen. The rest came from private sellers not required to obtain 
identification or subject their customers to background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, President Clinton said the figures go a long way  
toward helping authorities find and punish those responsible for 
providing guns for young criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``With more police on the streets and tougher gun laws on the  
books, crime has dropped to its lowest level in a generation. But 
we must do more,'' he said. ``Tracing crime guns to their source, 
and putting gun traffickers out of business for good, will make our 
streets even safer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget request for fiscal 2000 includes an additional  
$11.2 million to expand the tracing program to 10 additional 
cities: Charlotte, N.C.; Dallas; Denver; Louisville, Ky.; New 
Orleans; Oakland, Calif.; Omaha, Neb.; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; and 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	That 25 percent of the guns moved quickly from sale to recovery  
by police indicates they were bought legally, then resold, 
officials said. Semiautomatic pistols were the most commonly 
recovered weapon in each city, making up 52 percent of all trace 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the traces, 397 people have been referred to  
state and federal courts over the past year for prosecution as gun 
traffickers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't stop them from buying the guns, but as soon as they  
turn those guns over to felons, we can prosecute that,'' ATF 
director John Magaw told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Dunleavy, an attorney for seven families who won a $4  
million negligence verdict against gun manufacturers in a Brooklyn, 
N.Y., court last week, said, ``If the manufacturers took more 
rigorous precautions up front, you wouldn't have the guns being 
trafficked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooklyn case, brought in 1995 by a mother whose son was  
shot to death two years earlier, is being watched closely by cities 
anxious to sue manufacturers to recover costs from gun violence. 
ATF's report ``proves our evidence was certainly on the right 
track,'' Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that new guns reaching the hands of young  
criminals from straw purchasers made up between 25 and 36 percent 
of all firearms recovered from juveniles over the past three years, 
and between 32 percent and 49 percent of firearms recovered from 
offenders aged 18 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The report identified five types of semiautomatic pistols that  
move rapidly from dealers to young offenders: the Lorcin 9 mm, the 
.40-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson, the Bryco 9 mm, the Hi-Point 9 mm and 
the .40-caliber Glock. 
</P>
<P>
	It said 11.3 percent of the offenders involved were under 17  
years old, and 32 percent were between 18 and 24. Thirty-one 
percent of the guns were used in drug offenses, 28 percent in 
assaults and 18 percent each in homicides and robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was the result of Clinton's 1996 directive that the  
Treasury and Justice departments establish a program to identify 
and reduce the illegal transfer of firearms to young people. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27 cities involved in the report are Atlanta; Baltimore;  
Birmingham, Ala.; Boston; Bridgeport, Conn.; Chicago; Cincinnati; 
Cleveland; Detroit; Gary, Ind.; Houston; Inglewood, Calif.; Jersey 
City, N.J.; Los Angeles; Memphis, Tenn.; Miami; Milwaukee; 
Minneapolis; New York; Philadelphia; Richmond, Va.; Salinas, 
Calif.; San Antonio; St. Louis; Seattle; Tucson, Ariz.; and 
Washington.
