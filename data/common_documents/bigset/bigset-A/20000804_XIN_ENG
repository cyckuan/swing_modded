ISLAMABAD, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Thursday captured Ishkamish, a key town in the northern
province of Takhar, the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported.

<P>
CAIRO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's non-oil exports reached 930 million U.S.
dollars in the first four months of the current Iranian calendar
year starting March 21, 11.8 percent lower than the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the customs department, carpets are the largest
non-oil export item in the four-month period, reaching 155 million
dollars. The figure, however, was a 4.2 percent decrease compared
to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals came second at 99 million dollars, showing a sharp
fall of a 47.7 percent from the same period of last year. Pistachio
ranked third at 77 million dollars, which was 45 percent lower than
the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that imports of the country over the
four-month period was as high as 4.53 million dollars, a 4 percent
higher than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Main imported goods are machinery, metals, electrical
appliances, wheat and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, Ismail Hassan,
said the country's foreign exchange reserves were stabilized and
the foreign debts went down.
</P>
<P>
The bank's new board of directors reviewed in its meeting on

</P>
<P>
The share quotas of some state-owned banks in joint banks have

followed the implementation of bank budgets of fiscal year 1999-
2000.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel'S economic growth rate will hover between 5.
5 and 6 percent in 2000.

Israeli Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Israel (CBI)
said in July the percentage hiked to 4.5 since the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Israel will maintain the growth rate of 5.5-6 percent over the

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Iraqi Joint Committee Resumes Work After 20-Year Halt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Trade Mohammed
Mahdi Saleh and his party arrived here Friday afternoon to attend
the meeting of the Syrian-Iraqi Joint Ministerial Committee, the
first over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Saleh told reporters that he would discuss
with Syrian leaders ways of enhancing economic, trade and
scientific cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also discuss the resumption of technical and
cultural ties and cooperation in the field of land and marine
transport, including exploitation of the Syrian Latakia seaport as
a transit point for Iraqi imports.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria have recently signed an agreement on Iraq's
importation of 1 million tons of commodities through the Syrian
Tartous port this year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the preparations for the meeting, Saleh visited
Damascus in July and a Syrian economic delegation has visited the
Iraqi capital of Baghdad recently.
</P>
<P>
During the preparatory meetings, an agreement was reached on
convening the meetings of the joint committee, from August, in
Damascus and Baghdad alternately.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Iraqi ties, severed since 1980 due to Syria's support
to Iran in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, have been improving since
1997. Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf visited Syria
in June to attend the funeral of late Syrian President Hafez Al-
Assad.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Oil Officials Say Baku-Ceyhan Project "Unfeasible" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, aimed at
transferring Caspian oil to western markets via Turkey, is "
unfeasible" and unlikely to be realized in the near future, Iranian
Deputy Oil Minister Muhammad Nejad has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Turkish Daily News on Wednesday, Nejad said
that Tehran considered the Baku-Ceyhan project to be "uneconomical"
and difficult to be constructed due to its route.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-backed project, signed by Turkey, Azerbaijan and
Georgia on the sidelines of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit in Istanbul last November, will
run from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku via Georgia to a Turkish
terminal at Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the 2,000-kilometre pipeline is estimated at between
2.7 and 3.3 billion U.S. dollars and should become operational in
2004.
</P>
<P>
The paper published on Friday quoted the Iranian minister as
saying that even though Turkey and the United States had worked
intensively on the project, "it was clear that the route was not
practical."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has promoted the Baku-Ceyhan project and rejected
alternative routes, including one going through Russian and another
one through Iran, in a bid to curb its strategic rivals Moscow and
Tehran's influence over Central Asia and the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Nejad said that even if the Baku-Ceyhan project should succeed
eventually, "it will without doubt take a long time."
</P>
<P>
Nejad, who concluded his two-day visit to Ankara on Wednesday,
signed a protocol with Turkey regarding Iran's supplying natural
gas to the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, Turkey promises to buy 3 billion cubic
metres of gas annually from Iran as of July 30, 2001 by a pipeline
linking Tabriz in northwestern Iran to Ankara, which is still under
construction.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1996 agreement, Turkey pledged to buy natural gas from
Iran for 23 years, supplied by the pipeline, and complete its
section of the conduit by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But it has failed to meet the deadline and said in February that
it will not be able to complete the pipeline until the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
With full U.S. backing, Turkey is pursuing a multi-million
dollar pipeline project -- which excludes routes through both
Russia and Iran -- to carry natural gas from Turkmenistan through
the Caspian Sea to western markets via Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has voiced opposition to the Turkish-Iranian deal on
the grounds that it was a rival to the trans-Caspian gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
To appease Washington, Ankara has repeatedly said the trans-
Caspian pipeline is a priority and ever postponed the construction
of the Tabriz-Ankara pipeline.
</P>
<P>
But the completion of the trans-Caspian gas pipeline, as well as
the Baku-Ceyhan oil project, seems nowhere in sight.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Unveils Monetary Policy Measures to Stabilize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
Friday announced a number of monetary policy measures as part of
the already endorsed package of short-term measures meant to
stabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
The measures focus on the review of the bank rate, concessional
export finance facility, corporate foreign currency accounts for
gold producers and lending rates, all in the aim of limiting the
adverse effects of the budget deficit on money supply and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The measures, long awaited by the business community, came in
the wake of Tuesday's 25 percent devaluation of the Zimbabwean
dollar and Thursday's short-term government expenditure control
instruments announced in the parliament by Finance and Economic
Development Minister Simba Makoni.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in a statement that it would effectively
lower the bank rate by 12 percent to 61.7 percent and maintain it
within a range of 2 to 2.5 percentage points above the rate of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
"This rate will be reviewed from time to time and such review
will take cognizance of actual inflation as well as trends in
aggregate demand," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of inflation remains critical for economic
growth to occur," it noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the bank would simultaneously
release 50 percent of the pool of commercial and merchant bank
statutory reserves for onlending to exporters at an all inclusive
concessional final interest rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
This would make available about 100 million U.S. dollars for
onlending to export sectors through 180-day pre- and post-shipment
export bills drawn on and accepted by banks, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
This arrangement, the statement said, should provide a quick
supply response to enhance foreign currency availability, thereby
stimulating the productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the reduction in the bank rate and the
release of statutory reserves for use by banks would significantly
lower the cost of funds by as much as 15 to 20 percent for
commercial and merchant banks.
</P>
<P>
The first half of the year has shown that the Zimbabwean
economy was in a deep inflation mode, with the year-on-year rate
of inflation rising to 59.3 percent by June from 48.9 percent in
February.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Needs Over 1.3 Million Tons of Relief Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia on Friday appealed
to donors to increase relief food aid from 900.000 to more than 1.
3 million tons as the drought victims in the country had grown
from eight million to 10.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The officials of the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
Commission (DPPC) said that 784,000 tons of food aid have been
pledged and 494,000 tons have been delivered so far.
</P>
<P>
The delivered amount of relief food included the 100,000 tons
purchased by the Ethiopian government from local markets, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, four ships are unloading 115,000 tons of relief food
at the Port of Djibouti, while a ship was discharging 15,000 tons
of relief food at the Berbera Port of Somalia, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPPC officials, an average of 5,000 tons of
relief food were being transported from central warehouses to
drought-affected areas per day.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 500 Foreigners Detained in Western Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 500 foreigners,
mostly refugees from neighboring Burundi and Rwanda, are being
detained or serving their sentences in prisons in Tanzania's
western Kagera region for various crimes ranging from armed
robbery to rape.
</P>
<P>
Such a big number of offenders contribute a lot to the
congestion of inmates in local prisons, said Kagera regional
prison officer Luxas Mwitwa while briefing Minister for Home
Affairs Mohamed Seif Khatib on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khatib is on a four-day inspection tour of refugee camps in the
western regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Mwitwa, of the 477 foreigners in Kagera prisons,
267 are Burundians, 187 Rwandans, 22 Ugandans and one Kenyan.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Ngara district prison as an example, Mwitwa said
almost half of the inmates there are refugees from Burundi and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He said the prison, which was expanded recently under the
facilitation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
has the capacity of accommodating 186 inmates, but presently it is
congested with 457 inmates.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the wave of crime involving refugees in the
region is on the decrease, despite enhanced security by the police
and the army forces in refugee camps and along the border.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is home to over 800,000 refugees from Burundi, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan,
Rwanda and Uganda. However, more than 450,000 refugees nation-wide
are not residing in camps or settlements.
</P>
<P>
The influx of refugees has resulted in the increase of
illegally owned firearms, most of which are used in armed
robberies involving murders, according to Tanzanian authorities.

JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The facilitator in the
political dialogue of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
and former Botswana president Ketumile Masire is to brief the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit on the inter-
Congolese peace talks, South African Press Association reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state from 14 SADC member countries including the
DRC will meet in the Namibian capital of Windhoek on Sunday and
Monday to assess their role in bringing peace to the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
"It will be up to the heads of states as to whether they will
help him (Masire) to persuade DRC President Laurent Kabila to
cooperate," Masire's spokesman Archibold Mogwe said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether that will lead to a breakthrough leading to peace
talks is everybody's guess," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, backed by forces from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola, has
been fighting rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda since August 1998
and a peace deal signed in Lusaka last year has failed to halt the
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Peru to Have Re-export Center in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official said that a business mission recently made a
visit to Panama and to other Central American countries to explore
the possibility of creating a center for the physical distribution
of Peruvian commodities being exported to that region.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian exports to the Central American countries amount now
to 50 million dollars a year, expecting to grow 20 percent with
the creation of a center of distribution in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said that one of the direct benefits for exporters
would be the reduction of export costs, because with this
warehouse the orders would be directly supplied.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage is that Central America will become a center
for the transfer of goods toward Mexico, which has an ample market
that will start working on January 1 of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said that the Central American market is very
attractive for small metal-mechanic, steel and iron, and building
material manufacturing enterprises.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Regrets at Cancellation of Visits Between Cyprus Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Friday
expressed regret at the cancellation of exchange of visits between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. heard late Thursday afternoon from the Turkish
Cypriots that they will not agree to the Greek Cypriot request to
have the check point at Strovilia removed and the measures against
UNFICYP (U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus) lifted," spokeswoman
for the U.N. Sarah Russell said.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots had planned to visit the monastery of
Apostolos Andreas in Turkish Cypriot area and Turkish Cypriots to
the village of Kokkina in Greek Cypriot area.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government had told the U.N. that it would not allow
safe passage for some 800 Turkish Cypriots to go to Kokkina, on the
northwestern part of the island, unless the Turkish Cypriot regime
lifted the restrictive measures it is implementing against the U.
N..
</P>
<P>
It has also said a recently-set-up Turkish army checkpoint at
Strovilia village on the eastern part of the island violates the
status quo in the area and should be removed.
</P>
<P>
Russell said that following the reply from the Turkish Cypriots
neither visit will take place.
</P>
<P>
"Such visits are an important element in our work to retain
normal conditions and bring the two communities closer together,"
she said, expressing "regret" at their cancellation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the Mediterranean island after a failed pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, nearly 1,200 Greek Cypriots had
planned to visit the monastery of Apostolos Andreas on August 15,
an important date in the Greek Orthodox religion.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 Turkish Cypriots had been scheduled to visit the
memorial of those killed at Kokkina in the 1964 conflict on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Just before the third round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks in
early July the Turkish army advanced in Strovilia, in southeast
Cyprus, and set up a military outpost enclaving a small number of
Greek Cypriot families.
</P>
<P>
The move was part of retaliation measures of the Turkish Cypriot
side after the U.N. Security Council refused to give it a say in
the deployment of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP).

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi Friday
called for the launch of an African economic bloc, saying "the new
world map is charted by great economic spaces and we are concerned
with the African space."
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi made the remarks in Tunisia when addressing a group of
Tunisian businessmen. He said "Africa is our future and the future
of all Arabs if they want to join us."
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader has held three meetings with Tunisian
President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali on bilateral cooperation and ways
of speeding up the implementation of the signed trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
The agreements provide for increasing the bilateral trade
volume, launching a free-trade zone, and exploiting the Kabis gas
fields in southeast Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The annual trade volume between the two neighbors is expected to
hike from the current 700 million U.S. dollars to 1 billion U.S.
dollars by the end of 2000. Gaddafi ended his visit to Tunisia
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Occupiers to Stay on Designated Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe insisted on Friday
that black war veterans and peasants will not be removed from the
occupied white-owned farms earmarked for acquisition under the
resettlement program, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
However, occupiers will be removed from non-designated farms,
Zimbabwean Information Minister Jonathan Moyo told a press
conference during the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
council of ministers meeting in the Namibian capital of Windhoek
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has identified a total of 3,041 farms
or some five million hectares of farmland for acquisition.
</P>
<P>
When he addressed members of the Commercial Farmers' Union in
Bindura, Zimbabwe, on Thursday, President Robert Mugabe
backtracked on an apparent undertaking to remove self-styled
veterans from the more than a thousand white-owned farms they have
occupied since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Zimbabwe wishes to make it quite clear that
there has been no change whatsoever in the land reform policy,"
Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government stands firm in its intention to
complete the removal of 500,000 landless families to the
designated land before the start of this year's rainy season in
October.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Lands and Resettlement Minister Joseph Made,
speaking at the same briefing, said that to date about 211 land
acquisition orders have been served for farms on an original list
of 804 properties.

<HEADLINE> French Investigators Find Metal Strip on Runway of Crashed Concorde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- French investigators have found a
thin metal strip of 40 centimeters on the runway of the Air France
Concorde supersonic aircraft which crashed Tuesday last week, said
the Bureau of Accident Investigation (BEA) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The metal strip was found among the debris on the runway and it
did not belong to any part of the plane, said BEA.
</P>
<P>
But the investigators still cannot draw any conclusion from the
new finding.
</P>
<P>
The BEA said that one of the wheels on the left-wing of
Concorde was replaced before the take-off, but the wheel was found
among the wreckage and its tire had not burst.
</P>
<P>
Among the debris found by BEA on the runway was the piece of a
machine which served to avoid the injection of water into the
engine when the runway was wet, and a piece of a valve which
served to protect the undercarriage.
</P>
<P>
The investigators also found that the plane leant toward the
left when it was taking off.
</P>
<P>
They said that the debris of tire found on the runway more
probably belongs to one tire instead of two.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and fourteen people were killed in the Concorde
crash, 96 of them German tourists.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Solution Not Expected in 2000: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Alvaro de Soto, United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan's special adviser for Cyprus, said
Friday that he doubted whether a Cyprus solution could be found by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closure of the third round of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks on Cyprus in Geneva, which started on July 5, de
Soto said the two sides of the island will meet again on September
12 in New York.
</P>
<P>
De Soto said the whole process is about building bridges and it
is ongoing and that one must see the talks in the long term.
</P>
<P>
The only satisfying result, he said, would be one which
satisfies all Cypriots and in which no one is a loser or a winner.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the eastern Mediterranean island after a failed
coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks had been held
between the two communities since December 1999, aimed at preparing
the ground for substantive negotiations leading to a comprehensive
settlement.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, de Soto had separate meetings
with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash on Friday, the last day of the third round.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with de Soto, Clerides said the Greek
Cypriot side will discuss and analyze its positions. He did not
reply to other press questions because of a news blackout imposed
by the U.N. on the talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, on his side, said he is satisfied that he has put
forward his positions during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side wants a bizonal, bicommunal federal
republic in Cyprus, while the Turkish Cypriot side is now demanding
a loose confederation of two separate states.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Unchanged in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
United States remained at 4 percent in July despite the loss of
108,000 jobs during the month, the Labor Department reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
All of the jobs lost came from 290,000 temporary government
workers laid off in July because their work on the census was
finished.
</P>
<P>
The private sector actually added 138,000 jobs in the month, a
sign that the nation's labor market remained extremely tight. The
strength was spread across a number of sectors with manufacturing,
financial services and retail trade all posting strong gains.
</P>
<P>
The nation's jobless rate dipped to a 30-year low of 3.9
percent in April, rose to 4.1 percent in May and then edged down
to hold at 4 percent in June and July.
</P>
<P>
The tight labor markets and the difficulty employers are having
in filling jobs was seen in a further rise in average hourly
earnings, which climbed by 0.4 percent in July to 13.76 U.S.
dollars an hour, an acceleration from gains of 0.3 percent in June
and 0.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
For July, the drop in payroll jobs of 108,000 was the first
decline since a fall of 69,000 in January 1996, a decline blamed
on severe winter weather. And it was the biggest drop since a fall
of 185,000 in April 1991, a period when the country was struggling
to pull out of the 1990-91 recession.
</P>
<P>
The rise in private sector jobs of 138,000 indicated that the
economy has continued to power ahead despite the Federal Reserve
raised the interest rates six times in the past 14 months in an
effort to slow the economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Jobs in manufacturing rose by 46,000 last month after
exhibiting little growth during the first six months of this year.
Construction employment edged up by 6,000, down slightly from a
monthly average gain of 17,000 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
In services, where most Americans work, retail trade showed a
gain of 49,000 workers with restaurants and bars posting strong
job gains that helped offset the continued declines at department
stores.
</P>
<P>
The Fed next meets on August 22 and economists are divided over
whether it will feel the need to increase rates for the seventh
time.

The inflation rate eased to 2.5 percent in June from 2.9

<HEADLINE> Economic Cooperation Figures on Mori's Agenda: Bangladeshi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Greater economic cooperation,
including increase of investment, expansion of trade and
assistance in Bangladesh's infrastructure sector, would feature
Dhaka-Tokyo talks during Japanese Prime Minister's forthcoming
visit, Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad told reporters here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yoshihiro Mori, who assumed office after the death of Obuchi,
will arrive here on August 19 for a two-day official visit, on the
first leg of his three-nation South Asian tour. From Dhaka, the
prime minister will fly for New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Besides economic matters, other bilateral as well as regional
and international issues would come up for discussion at the talks
between Mori and host Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Azad said,
adding that boosting cooperation between Japan and regional
organizations like the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation would also figure at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Although one of the main objectives of Mori's South Asia trip
is expected to be campaigning for expansion of the United Nations
Security Council with Japan as its new permanent member,
Bangladeshi diplomats, politicians and business leaders consider
his Dhaka visit very significant.
</P>
<P>
As an important trade partner of Bangladesh, Japan's actual
investment in the country as of August 1999 was 57.8 million U.S.
dollars in 25 units. Japan's total loan aid up to 1998 was 3.01
billion dollars and grants (grant aid and technical cooperation) 2.
8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from trade and business, Japan provides scholarships for
students, teachers and government officials every year. Many
skilled and semi-skilled laborers are working in Japan. An
official source said there are some 6,422 registered Bangladeshi
people living in Japan, while the number of unrecognized workers
is likely to be double the official figure.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Adopt Resolution on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is expected to adopt a resolution Friday to renew the mandate of
the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as UNAMSIL, but not to
authorize the immediate increase of the U.N. force in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council began a closed-door session Friday to
discuss the draft resolution, and it will approve only a one-month
renewal of the UNAMSIL mandate, rather than the six-month
extension proposed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, U.N.
officials said here.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL commander told the Security Council on Thursday
that he needs many more troops quickly, but the United States
remained opposed to an immediate increase in the 13,000-strong
force.
</P>
<P>
Indian Major-General Vijay Jetley said rebels from the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), who took 500 U.N. soldiers
hostage in May and kept 233 others surrounded for two and a half
months, still pose a serious danger to the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very much under control at the moment, but
it's tense," he said. He told reporters that he needs many more
troops as quickly as possible, but he did not give any specific
figure.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council on Tuesday, Annan
recommended a six-month renewal of the UNAMSIL mandate when the
current one expires on August 7. He said it would have to be
increased beyond its current authorized strength of 13,000 people
drawn from more than 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council initially sent 6,000 peacekeepers to
Sierra Leone to help implement a cease-fire accord signed in July
last year by the government and the rebels who later violated the
accord by attacking U.N. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Council raised the ceiling to 13,000 in May after the
rebels reignited the civil war. At the time, Annan recommended an
addition of 3,500 peacekeepers to help the Sierra Leonean
government to regain authority over the rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke
said last week that the United States believes that 13,000 troops
are sufficient to do the job if they are better equipped and if
the mission is restructured to better deal with the hostile
situation it is currently confronting. A U.S. official reiterated
the position Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A brutal 8-year civil war, financed by rebel sales of illicit
diamonds and marked by widespread atrocities, was supposed to have
ended with an accord signed in Lome, capital of Togo, in July 1999
that brought rebel leader Foday Sankoh into the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
However, fighting broke out again in the war-torn country
early this year and more than 500 U.N. soldiers were taken hostage
by RUF rebels in May. Sankoh is currently in government custody in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Annan Names Head of U.N. Office in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday appointed Mussagy Jeichande as head of the
United Nations Office in Angola (UNOA).
</P>
<P>
The appointment came in a letter from Annan to the president
of the U.N. Security Council, which is being circulated here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jeichande, who is from Mozambique, was also appointed as
representative of Annan in Angola.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted on October 15, 1999, the Security
Council authorized the establishment of UNOA for an initial period
of six months until April 15. On April 13,  a Security Council
resolution extended the mandate of UNOA until October 15.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Office will be staffed with personnel necessary to
maintain liaison with the political, military, police and other
civilian authorities, with the view to exploring measures for
restoring peace, assisting the Angolan people in capacity-building,
humanitarian assistance, the promotion of human rights, and
coordinating other activities.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations set up UNOA after the failure of its decade-
long peacekeeping operations in the southern African country and
the withdrawal of the peacekeepers at the request of the Angolan
Government.
</P>
<P>
Angola was plunged into a 36-year civil war between the
Angolan Government and the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), which is engaging in sales of
illicit diamonds to finance its war capabilities.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Short-Term Debt Continues Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's short-term foreign
debt rose to 47.5 billion U.S. dollars in June, accounting for 33.
4 percent of its total external debt of 142 billion, the Ministry
of Finance and Economy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The short-term debt in proportion to the total foreign debt has
grown in the past six months from 27.9 percent in December to 33.4
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The record high was registered in March 1998, exceeding 34.7
percent, while the nation was gripped by a financial crisis caused
by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The short-term debt has risen from 30 billion U.S. dollars in
February 1999 along with the nation's economic recovery from the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The country's total external debt hit 142 billion U.S. dollars
in June, up 500 million from May, but the long-term foreign debt
fell 200 million to 94.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of short-term debt to foreign reserves, an indicator
representing the nation's ability to pay external debt, was 52.7
percent, down 1.3 percent from last month's figure.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign reserves stood at 91.3 billion U.S.
dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
When looking back on the fact that soaring short-term debt was
the main culprit in driving the nation into the financial crisis,
the mounting short-term debt is a worrying development, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise of the short-term debt to the
fact that South Korean companies increased their credit purchases
and overseas branches of South Korean banks increased their
borrowing.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' West to Retire from Executive Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Jerry West, part of seven NBA
championships in four decades as a player, coach and executive
with the Lakers, will retire on Monday, but continue as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
West who won a championship with the Lakers as a player and six
more as an executive, was one of the NBA 50 Greatests for his 14
professional seasons started from 1961 when he was drafted out of
West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
He also coached the team for three seasons before moving into
the front office.
</P>
<P>
Former Lakers coach Kurt Rambis is expected to become assistant
general manager under Mitch Kupchak who is to assume most of West'
s duties, and coach Phil Jackson will have a stronger say in
roster decisions, the Los Angeles Times said.
</P>
<P>
West previously signed a four-year contract extension that runs
through the 2002-2003 season. The deal reportedly is worth 3.5
million US dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
He has repeatedly talked about leaving, most recently after the
Lakers won the NBA championship in June, citing health reasons for
an irregular heartbeat caused by nervous tension.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Selects Officials By Soliciting Public Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Beijing municipal government has
not promoted two officials after gauging what public opinion had
to say about them.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government began to publicize the name list of
officials that it intended to promote to bureau chief or section
leader positions in the latter half of last year. The municipal
government solicited opinions about the officials who were to be
promoted from the general public and then decided whether they
would be promoted or not.
</P>
<P>
The local government is using such methods when considering the
appointment or promotion of officials.
</P>
<P>
The city government publicized the names of 222 officials to be
promoted, but two of them was not promoted.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Personnel Bureau of the city government
said that so far Beijing has publicized names of officials to be
promoted in 18 administrative districts and counties. It will
extend the practice of soliciting opinions from the general public
on what they think about officials so as to make the selection
more open and fair.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang said Friday that he hoped that Hong Kong and Australia could
forge even closer links in the years ahead, according to a news
release from the Information Service Department.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in Adelaide with Australia's Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer, the financial secretary, who is now paying a
four-day visit to Australia, said he was sure that the bilateral
economic relationship would become stronger.
</P>
<P>
With China's accession into the World Trade Organization, Tsang
said he was sure that relationship will be even further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that there would be opportunities for closer co-
operation in industries covering food and wine, seafood,
environmental products and Australia's information technology,
which he described as 'among the most advanced anywhere in the
world'.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Hong Kong and Australia already had a very strong
trading and investment relationship. And politically the
Australian government has backed Hong Kong very strongly since
1997, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"And we have been delighted how the 'One Country, Two Systems'
formula has worked out for the people of Hong Kong, and our
relationship with the leaders in Hong Kong is a very strong one,"
Dower said.

<HEADLINE> Tung Updates Himself on Residents' Daily Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa Friday afternoon visited two families and a youth center in
Hung Hom to update himself on the daily life of the local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the economy is recovering very strongly but not
all members of the community are benefiting from this recovery
because it does take time for this effect to filter down.
</P>
<P>
"But the fact is that all the figures show the economy is
growing strong and it will be sustainable and therefore we are
very confident that the benefit will eventually filter down and it
will not take too long," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the purpose of the visit is really to try to get
a better understanding of the livelihood of the low income group
of citizens of Hong Kong. "I hope this will help me and my
colleagues in formulating our policies for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
when he found out that the two families that he visited, both
focused very much on the education for the next generation, he
said, "To me, like all the other families in Hong Kong, we are all
very interested in better education for our younger generation,
because at the end of the day it is education which is going to
help people to get out of poverty to improve the quality of life."
.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive had also seen single parents and talked
with them. "I was deeply touched by the fact that they all take
time-out to do voluntary work," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is a tremendous spirit that makes Hong Kong work, he added,
hoping that the whole of Hong Kong will continue to move forward
in that kind of spirit of giving.

<P>
News Analysis: Sri Lankans Still Divided Over Political
Solution to Ethnic Conflicts
</P>
<P>
 By Lian Guohui
</P>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Five years ago, the Sri Lankan
government for the first time unveiled a landmark devolution
package which aims at politically ending the long-running ethnic
conflicts between majority Sinhalese dominated government troops
and separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, after five years of bargaining, conflict-ridden Sri
Lankans are still divided over a draft constitution which embodies
the devolution package, analysts here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government of ruling People's Alliance (PA) on Thursday
presented the draft constitution to the parliament amid protests
in and around Kotte, the venue of the parliament in eastern
suburban Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a parliament member from the opposition United
National Party (UNP) burned in public one copy of the draft
constitution distributed to him. Some other UNP parliament members
tore up and crumpled the copies before throwing away. Thousands of
leftists and Buddhist monks staged a sit-down protest near
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliament was summoned by President Chandrika Kumaratunga
for an emergency session for the government to unveil the new
constitution that seeks to turn the country into a de facto
federal state and end the bloody ethnic war by devolving more
powers to regional councils to win over moderate minority Tamils,
sidelining the LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for a separate
homeland called Eelam for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
However, President Kumaratunga sometimes cannot make her voice
heard in a speech to present the draft constitution as the
parliament members from the opposition United National Party (UNP)
shouted her down and made lots of noises.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, which holds the balance of power to make or break
reforms, has pledged to work for peace but withdrew their support
at the last minute, claiming that the government had not given
sufficient time for the Buddhist clergy and the people to study
the provisions of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan talks between the PA and the UNP initiated in
March. However, the four-month talks failed to reach consensus on
the draft constitution with the UNP resorting to the strategy of
dragging on and beating around the bush.
</P>
<P>
Besides the UNP, the influential Buddhist clergy in this
predominantly Buddhist country has voiced strong opposition to the
government's draft constitution, arguing that it gives too many
concessions to the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
19 million people.
</P>
<P>
They have expressed the fear that under the new constitution
Buddhism would lose its status as the dominant religion in Sri
Lanka. In Sri Lanka, Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, account
for 74 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Despite preaching nonviolence, monks have urged the government
to carry on its war against LTTE rebels as part of protecting
their religion and said the country's minority Tamils, who are
mostly Hindus, should not be given any special privileges.
</P>
<P>
"We now advise you to act as a patriotic head of state by
ceasing all negotiations immediately, crushing this cruel
terrorism without delay by the use of state power. Toward this end
you will get our blessings," Sri Lanka's top four monks had said
in a joint letter in March to President Kumaratunga, who is
herself a Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
The government is bound by the present constitution, which says
it is the duty of the state to protect and foster Buddhism. The
country's 30,000 monks could wield immense influence and they have
affected political decisions in the past.
</P>
<P>
Two key monks last month signed a letter calling on
parliamentarians to vote against the new constitution after
meeting Constitutional Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris, the
government's emissary sent to placate the monks.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga could not afford to alienate the influential
Buddhist clergy with parliamentary elections, which have to be
held by early November, around the corner.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels were banned by the Sri Lankan government in
1998 as the Buddhist clergy was enraged by a rebel suicide attack
which killed 17 people and damaged Sri Lankan Buddhists' holiest
shrine, the Temple of the Tooth, in the central hill city of Kandy.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed nationalist Sinhala Urumaya (heritage) party
has begun to take center stage in the growing movement opposing
the reforms. The party, working hand in glove with the monks, has
been told by the National Sangha Council (Council of Monks) to "
fight for the rights of the Sinhalese" and block the new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced the draft constitution would be
taken up for debate on August 7 and 8 and put to vote on August 9.
The government needs the votes of 150 members in the 225-seat
assembly, but the ruling party is short of at least 12 votes even
if it is able to hold all its allies together. The government will
face an uphill battle to engineer the defections of a sufficient
number of UNP lawmakers to avoid an embarrassing defeat.
</P>
<P>
In a ruling read out by Parliament Speaker K.B. Ratnayake, Sri
Lanka's Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the government to hold a
national referendum for the new draft constitution. The ruling
said that the parliament must approve the draft by a two-thirds
majority before the national referendum.
</P>
<P>
With obstacles ahead, the government also has to deal with the
intransigent LTTE rebels who have rejected the draft constitution,
claiming that they will settle for nothing less than an
independent state.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Suspects Said To Be Ruled out in Jakarta Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian probers ruled out the
possibility of Filipinos being behind the Tuesday bombing attack
at the residence of Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia in Jakarta,
Vice Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine biggest TV network ABS-CBN, Arroyo
said this information was relayed by Indonesian authorities to the
Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs after injured
Ambassador Leonides Caday himself downplayed the theory of a
Filipino being behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
The authorities reportedly said they are looking into the angle
that Indonesian militants staged the attack to embarrass the
Indonesian government.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Currency Weakens Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 4 Xinhua -- Nepal's currency rupee weakened
by 0.25 rupees Thursday following the depreciation of Indian
currency, according to a notice issued here Friday by Nepal's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central bank, refixed the
buying and selling rates of the dollar at 70.90 and 71.60 rupees
respectively from Wednesday's 70.65 and 71.35 rupees, said the
notice.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time within two months that the Nepali rupee
are devaluated against dollar in the wake of Indian currency's
depreciation.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali rupee is pegged to the Indian rupee at a fixed rate
of 1.6:1.
</P>
<P>
Nepali economists fear that consecutive depreciation of the
Nepali rupee will have tremendous pressure on the overall Nepali
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The devaluation will inflate price, which in turn poses
negative impact on foreign trade and economic growth," said Shiva
Sharma, an economist with Nepali Agricultural Development Bank.

<P>
GENEVA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa announced on Friday
that it will no longer campaign to get international soccer's
governing body FIFA to vote again for which country to host the
2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
South Africa soccer federation vice-president Irvin Khoza said
in Zurich the decision was influenced by FIFA's announcement on
Thursday that it will adopt the principle of rotating World Cups
from 2010 among the different continents.
</P>
<P>
Khoza said: "What we know about the rotation is that, when it
starts, it will start in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"If that does happen, our criteria shows we are very well
qualified. We feel confident of our chances."
</P>
<P>
South Africa had been greatly displeased by FIFA's decision on
July 6 which awarded Germany the hosting of the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The South African soccer federation had even planned to bring
the matter to court but changed its mind after consulting the
African soccer confederation.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition on China's Space Technology to Open in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition showing the
history of space development in China is expected to open at Hong
Kong Science Museum on August 22.
</P>
<P>
An array of historical objects and artifacts related to Chinese
rockets and satellites will be featured at the exhibition. Among
them are the newly developed Long March 2F Launch Vehicle, the "
Shenzhou" spacecraft which is intended for future manned space
mission and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region flag once
flown on board the "Shenzhou" spacecraft in orbit.
</P>
<P>
"Conquering new frontiers in space has not only fulfilled our
dream but also yielded spin-offs that improve our standard of
living," Acting Director of Leisure and Cultural Services Lolly
Chiu said at a contract-signing ceremony here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Satellite TV, communication and global positioning technology
are just a few examples of the facilities made possible by space
exploration. The development of aerospace science will be
indispensable in future.
</P>
<P>
"Through the launching of this exhibition, it is our wish that
Hong Kong people could learn more about the development and
contribution of Chinese aerospace science and technology and their
application in our daily life," said Chiu.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 items of mock-ups and models as well as pictures and
display panels will be shown in four zones, namely "Shenzhou"
Spacecraft, Launch Vehicles, Satellites and Application of
Aerospace Technology.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibits, there are nine different models of the Long
March launch vehicles. The Long March series are indigenously
designed and developed by China for aerospace transportation.
</P>
<P>
An array of these Long March launch vehicles is able to launch
satellites of various functions into low earth orbits, sun-
synchronous orbits and geostationary-transfer orbits. By the mid-
2000, a total 61 launches of the Long March rockets have deployed
68 satellites into the destined orbits, of which 27 were developed
by other countries.
</P>
<P>
With a success rate of over 90 per cent, China has reached the
world's standard of launching rockets. China has also achieved a
record of successfully launching 19 rockets in a row over the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is jointly organized by  Hong Kong Science
Museum, Hong Kong Space Museum and the China Aerospace Science and
Technology Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Romania Researchers Invent New Method of Gold Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Romanian researchers have
invented an ecologically-friendly method to recover gold from
various compositions or tailings, a local newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The invention, called Hydrometallurgical Gold Recovery, is the
result of teamwork among researchers headed by Rozalia Radulescu
and Filip Gheorghe, at the Institute for Rare Metals, which is
located in Bucharest, the Curentul daily newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The method, free of cyanide or mercury ions, recoups the gold
from various compositions or tailings, and can be applied to waste
resulting from ores and pyrite drosses at sulfur acid mills.
</P>
<P>
Unlike classical methods, which provide about 70-80 percent of
gold recovery, this invention has a gold recovery yield rate of 97
percent.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Land Price Falls For Eighth Straight Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The average price of land in Japan
as of January 1 dropped 7 percent from the previous year for the
eighth consecutive year, the National Tax Administration Agency
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The average land price, based on data on 400,000 privately held
plots facing main roads and streets across Japan, fell to 146,000
yen (about 1,348 dollars) per square meter, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Land prices declined in all 47 prefectures except Shimane
Prefecture, where the average land price remained flat.
</P>
<P>
Chiba Prefecture had the largest rate of decline of 11.9
percent, followed by Osaka Prefecture's 10.9 percent, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
In the Tokyo area, which is formed by the central areas of
Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama prefectures, the year-on-year
decline rate was 7.2 percent, down from 7.6 percent in the
previous year. The figure for the Nagoya region, comprising
central Aichi Prefecture and part of Mie Prefecture, declined from
8.8 percent to 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In key locations across the country, the average price in
residential areas fell 3.6 percent from a year earlier to 107,000
yen (987.9 dollars), while the average price in commercial areas
and industrial areas dropped by 12 percent and 6.2 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The continued decline of land prices shows that Japan's economy
is still struggling to overcome the effects of the collapse of the
asset-inflated bubble economy of the late 1980s, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Former Concorde Team Chief Calls for Resumption of Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,August 4(Xinhua) -- The former chief pilot for Air
France's Concorde aircraft,Franck Debouck,said Friday that he
hopes the supersonic planes can resume flights as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with radio Europe 1,Debouck said he hopes the
French Bureau of Accident Investigation, which is in charge of
investigating the crash of the Air France Concorde on July 25,
would publish "in the coming days" an explanation on what happened
during the crash.
</P>
<P>
Air France has grounded all of its Concorde planes after the
tragic crash in which 114 people were killed,96 of them German
tourists.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of aviation officials on Thursday decided to maintain
the suspension of the flight of Concorde,because the
investigation has not found the definite causes of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Another air company using Concorde aircraft, British Airways,
resumed the flight of the supersonic plane one day after the Air
France crash.
</P>
<P>
"With all my heart I hope for a rapid return to the plane,"
said Debouck, who is now general director of Air France Consulting
after retiring from the post of director of exploitation of
Concorde six months ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that before the planes resume their flights, one should
give a clear answer to the causes of the crash "to explain what
happened and why it will not happen again."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the entire company of Air France was badly
shaken by the July 25 crash, and the trauma it has caused will not
be forgotten for years.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in U.S. leading newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Republicans emerged from their national convention Thursday
night believing that they can fight and win the November election
on the Democrats' turf.
</P>
<P>
-- North Korea has reaffirmed to Russia in a confidential
exchange of letters that it will drop its intercontinental
ballistic missile program if other countries will launch two or
three satellites a year for Pyongyang at their expense.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Texas governor George W. Bush and Republican presidential
nominee pledged Thursday night to confront the hard issues -
threats to national security, health security and retirement
security that he said the Clinton administration had consistently
ducked.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. army is proposing to give the National Guard a
greatly increased role in combat, which would mean that tens of
thousands of part-time soldiers would almost certainly be
mobilized and sent to fight if war broke out on the Korean
Peninsula or in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- George W. Bush's speech to the Republican convention called
for the nation to seize a "unique moment" of prosperity to win
bipartisan support for cutting taxes, building up the military and
overhauling social security and education.
</P>
<P>
-- California power disruptions continue to be a near-constant
threat during a heat wave as state officials begin to realize that
deregulation has stripped them of many of the tools they used to
control the old centralized system.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Organizers Ready to Tune Up for Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite an 18-month distance,
the organizers for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City said
Friday that they're ready to fine-tune plans for everything.
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake Organizing Committee will stage 17 test events
from October to March, just weeks after the Summer Olympics in
Australia, with competition ranged from figure skating to ski
jumping.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, events will be staged simultaneously at
different venues, designed to simulate the steady pace of the
Olympics, which run from February 8-24, 2002.
</P>
<P>
"We want our staff and volunteers to get a close sense of what
it feels like to have several events going on at the same time,"
said Cathy Priestner-Allinger, SLOC's managing director of sports.
</P>
<P>
The first test event, a short-track speedskating World Cup meet
at The Peaks Ice Arena in Provo, will take place on October 27,
just 26 days after the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee has approved its 78-event
schedule for the largest Winter Games ever.
</P>
<P>
This winter, Utah venues will host competitions of biathlon,
curling, speedskating, figure skating, ice hockey, slalom and
downhill skiing, Nordic skiing, freestyle skiing, ski jumping,
snowboard, bobsled, luge and skeleton.
</P>
<P>
Among the venues opening next winter are the ski jumps, the
speedskating oval and a hockey practice rink.

<HEADLINE> Michael Johnson Backs to Training After Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Three-time Olympic gold
medalist Michael Johnson is back to training for the first time
since suffering a hamstring injury at the U.S. Olympic Track and
Field Trials last month.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who walked away after some 80 meters in the 200-meter
finals at the trials, will run the 400 meters and 4x400 relay in
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I started back training this week after taking off all of last
week with a sore hamstring," Johnson said in a letter to fans
posted on his web site.
</P>
<P>
"After all of the swelling went down, we determined that the
cramp I suffered in the 200 final at the trials had actually
caused a slight strain in my hamstring."
</P>
<P>
"My Achilles, hamstring, and the quadriceps that cramped in the
preliminaries of the 200 at the trials are all still sore as a
result of all the cramping."
</P>
<P>
But while the soreness has caused Johnson some discomfort, he
said he would be completely recovered in time for the Olympic
Games in September.
</P>
<P>
"I'm fortunate that my injuries were not major or season-ending.
I will be fully prepared to go into the Olympics and defend my
title in the 400 meters -- and become the first man to do so."
</P>
<P>
As far as his competition schedule leading up to the Olympics,
Johnson canceled an appearance scheduled for this weekend in
Sweden and is undecided about a meet next week in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He has reiterated that he will only be running 400s for the
remainder of the year and has not thought about his race plans
beyond 2000.
</P>
<P>
Johnson also made it clear that there is no way he will be
running the 200 in Sydney. "I will not be appealing to the Olympic
Committee for any special treatment or exemption into the 200 at
the Olympics. I would not accept any type of exemption if it was
offered to me."

<P>
MACAO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Local favorites China lived up to
expectations by outclassing their arch-rivals Japan 3-0 here
Friday on the opening day of the 2000 World Women's Volleyball
Grand Prix Macao Leg.
</P>
<P>
"We know the Japanese very well, and our players performed very
well today," said Chinese Head Coach Hu Jin.
</P>
<P>
"China played better than us today," the Japanese Head Coach
Yoshida Nobuyuki said.
</P>
<P>
China, who beat Japan four matches in a row a week ago in
Fujian province, China, totally controlled the first set with
their superiority on the net and solid defence. They took the set
by a big margin of 25-14.
</P>
<P>
After levelling at eight all in the second, Asian champions
China stormed back by powerful offence and blocks, winning the set
at 25-20.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese spikers, who finished third in Asian
championship last year in Hong Kong, came back to take the lead
for the first time in the match at 7-4 in the third set mainly due
to the errors from the Chinese and their own attacks.
</P>
<P>
With the ability of defense and block and quick changes in
tactics, the Chinese dominated the following set, sealing the
match by winning 25-16.
</P>
<P>
In another match on Friday, Brazil did not meet much resistance
from the Americans, winning in consecutive sets 25-23, 25-16, 25-
15.
</P>
<P>
There are six legs in this year's 1.04 million-U.S.-dollar
tournament with world top eight women's teams involved.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the above four teams, Cuba, Russia, South Korea and
Italy are competing simultaneously in Yala, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The eight teams then will be re-grouped and contest in Chinese
Taipei, Malaysia, China, and the Philippines respectively in the
following two weekends.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous seven tournaments, all eight teams will
join together to vie for the title at this year's Grand Prix
finals in Manila at the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> Magic Lead Frenzy of NBA Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Orlando Magic, who were 20
million under the salary cap, as expected have spent the most on
free agents since the NBA signing frenzy began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Magic have spent about 200 million US dollars, which will
be spread over the next seven years, to lure Grant Hill away from
Detroit and Tracy McGrady and Dee Brown from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The Magic signed both Hill and McGrady to seven-year 93-million
US dollars deals, the maximum they were eligible to receive, after
engineering sign-and-trade deals. Brown signed a one-year 1-
million deal.
</P>
<P>
"All of this is gratifying, but we're not finished," said Magic
coach Doc Rivers, "Now we've got to go out and win."
</P>
<P>
Orlando was 41-41 last season and missed the playoffs by one
game. General manager John Gabriel called it a relaunching season
after he gutted the roster by trading several high-salaried
players to clear room under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
The Indiana Pacers, who were over the 35.5 million per team
salary cap, have also emerged as big spenders, spending 146.25
million dollars over seven years to re-sign swingman Jalen Rose,
Austin Croshere and Sam Perkins.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers aren't done spending. Indian president Donnie Walsh
is negotiating to re-sign guards Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson
and center Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
Miami, which will pay All-Star guard Eddie Jones 86.5 million
dollars over seven years after obtaining him in a nine-player sign-
and-trade deal with the Charlotte Hornets, are next on the list of
spenders.
</P>
<P>
Miami is followed by the Milwaukee Bucks, 67 million dollars on
re-signing Tim Thomas, and the San Antonio Spurs, 63.4 million on
re-signing Tim Duncan, Antonio Daniels and Avery Johnson.

Resolution No. 2758, adopted by an overwhelming majority during
the 26th U.N. General Assembly in 1971, completely resolved the
issue concerning the representation of the People's Republic of
China in the U.N., he said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since then, Zhu said, the government of the People's
Republic of China represents the entire Chinese people, including
the people of Taiwan. There is no such issue of Taiwan's "
participation" in the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the General Committee of the U.N. General Assembly
has clearly refused to put the so-called "Taiwan issue" on the
agenda of the U.N. General Assembly, demonstrating the firm stand
of a vast majority of the U.N. member states in safeguarding the
authority of the U.N. Charter and the Resolution 2758, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that any conspiracy and attempt that goes against
the purpose and principles of the U.N. Charter and the will of a
majority of U.N. member states is unpopular, added Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Despite some new tricks in the proposal made by a small handful

<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao today expressed strong resentment and firm
opposition to a proposal by Senegal and a few other countries
calling for discussions of Taiwan's "participation" in the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Senegal and a handful of other countries on
August 3 (New York time) sent a letter to the U.N. secretary-
general asking for a discussion of Taiwan's "participation" in the
U.N. and for putting the Taiwan issue into the framework of the U.
N. peace and security mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"They are attempting to create 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one
Taiwan' in the U.N.," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a flagrant violation of the purpose and principles of
the U.N. Charter and a distortion of the nature of the U.N., and
represents a gross interference in China's internal affairs. We
strongly resent and firmly oppose this."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said there is only one China in the world, and the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
representative of the entire Chinese people, and Taiwan is a part
of China.
</P>
<P>
This is an internationally recognized fact and therefore Taiwan
has no qualifications whatsoever for joining the U.N. and its
special agencies in any form, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is by no means a place to solve the domestic issue of
a country, he stressed.

The Taiwan issue, purely China's internal affair and the

the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
To settle the Taiwan issue at an early date and accomplish the
complete reunification of the motherland are common aspirations of
the entire Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots, he added.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities have sincerity, they should clearly
accept the one-China principle, and recognize that they are
Chinese, and make a commitment to pursuing reunification and
translate it into action, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Under the one-China framework, he noted, the two sides across
the Taiwan Straits are able to find approaches to a peaceful
settlement of the Taiwan issue through consultation.
</P>
<P>
"Accomplishing China's peaceful reunification according to the
policy of 'one country, two systems' will be in the fundamental
interests of the entire Chinese people, including Taiwan
compatriots," he said.

<P>
"We are convinced that in the just cause of safeguarding state
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese government and

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli Minister Appeals for Rehearing of his Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Aryeh Deri, former Israeli
Interior Minister and former leader of the ultra-Orthodox religious
Shas party, Friday morning submitted to Israel's High Court a
request for a rehearing of his case, his lawyer announced.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was filed because there are reasonable chances to
cancel Deri's conviction on charges of accepting bribe, breach of
trust and aggravated fraud, or even to overturn his three-year jail
sentence, said lawyer Yigal Arnon.
</P>
<P>
The Deri case deserves a second deliberation before an expanded
judge panel, the lawyer argued, as the public ramification of his
conviction was unlike any case since the establishment of the state
of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Israel's High Court rarely accepts requests for new hearing. But
if the demand was accepted, the court would organize a panel
including at least five justices to rehear the case.
</P>
<P>
Deri, the country's youngest interior minister in history and a
once rising political star, was sentenced to four years in prison
in March 1999 on charges of bribery taking, breach of trust and
fraud while he served as the interior minister in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Shas later astonished the country by seizing 17 seats in the
120-member parliament in the 1999 general elections, arguing that
Deri's conviction was ethnical discrimination against Sephardi
Jews, who are Shas' constituents and originate from Arab countries
in North Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Deri resigned from Shas party leadership soon after the
elections, clearing the way for the party to join in the coalition
led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Deri case has been the haunting specter plaguing
the relations between Barak and the Shas party.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the High Court upheld Deri's bribery conviction but
reduced his sentence term to three years. Deri was also ordered to
begin to serve his prison term on August 13.
</P>
<P>
Deri will not appeal for a probation of execution of the prison
service, said the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
If the charismatic young politician, who enjoys father-son-like
ties with Shas' spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, is thrown
behind the bars finally, he will be prohibited from running for
public office, or acting as ministers, for 10 years after he
finishes his prison term.

<HEADLINE> No New Proposal for Shas's Return to Coalition: Barak's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has not made any new proposal to the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party on its return to the coalition, Barak's Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The reports were groundless that Prime Minister Barak had made
some proposals to Shas for its return to the new coalition, but
Barak did discuss the coalition reformation issue with Shas leader
Eli Yishai," the office added.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports earlier Friday did not specify what
proposals Barak has raised to Shas, but said Yishai has asked for
five cabinet ministerial posts, including the Interior portfolio,
in the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shas held four minister portfolios in Barak's coalition before
July.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted a source of the ruling One
Israel as reporting on Friday Barak is expected to give top
priority to forming a new coalition with Meretz and Shas.
</P>
<P>
Barak believes he can overcome the differences between Meretz and
Shas that led to the June coalition crisis which resulted in the
resignation of three Meretz cabinet ministers, including Education
Minister Yossi Sarid, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Three Meretz ministers quit their cabinet posts during the June
crisis, but the party has remained in the coalition. The powerful
ultra-Orthodox Shas party pulled out from the cabinet and coalition
in July after Barak decided to go to the Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak's options for a new coalition are limited since he plans
to pursue a framework agreement on the final-status issues with the
Palestinians, the source pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Barak held talks with Meretz leader Sarid and
Shas leader Eli Yishai, and both expressed frustration over the
past, but did not rule out a new partnership.
</P>
<P>
Barak also views Am Ehad (One Nation) and Democratic Choice,
each holding two Knesset (parliament) seats, as the next in line
for the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
But none of these options is considered automatic. Sarid will
have to compromise on funding for the Shas educational network, and
Yishai will have to come to terms with the peace process, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Am Ehad, led by National Trade Federation Chairman Amir Peretz,
will be asked to compromise on social issues, while his colleague,
Haim Katz, will face the task of softening his position on the
peace process, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The secular Democratic Choice may not agree to join the new
coalition that includes Shas, but has already said it will support
the peace process from the outside.
</P>
<P>
A coalition that includes all these parties will give Barak 61
seats in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
According to Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer, Barak
wants talks to take place with as wide a range of factions as
possible on forming a new coalition.
</P>
<P>
A negotiating team is expected to be set up next week,
compromising One Israel ministers and Knesset members, to conduct
such talks, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A number of One Israel ministers and Knesset members on Thursday
vented their anger toward Barak for his poor handling of the recent
domestic political affairs, in which Labor's presidential candidate
Shimon Peres lost in the vote, while the opposition's bill calling
for early elections passed its preliminary reading in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister's Office also expressed their
anger on Thursday over reports that senior Labor members plan to
challenge Barak's party leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon spoke of
making preparations for the next elections, stating on Thursday
that Likud will hold a party primary to determine its prime
ministerial candidate.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Due in Turkey on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will arrive in Turkey on Saturday to update Turkish leaders on the
latest developments of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to meet with Turkish President Ahmet Necdet
Sezer, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
during his brief visit, Anatolia News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S.-brokered peace talks between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak failed at Camp David last month, the
Palestinian leader has embarked on a long journey to seek
international support for the justified Palestinian position on the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief Turkish leaders on his steadfast stance on
declaring an independent Palestinian state on September 13 no
matter whether there is a peace agreement with Israel or not.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is currently on a visit to South Africa. He has visited
Egypt, France, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey believes it is a major power which has all kinds of
vested interests in the region, said the report. The Ottoman Turks
ruled over Jerusalem, as well as the rest of the Middle East, for
400 years until the early years of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was one of the first Muslim countries to recognize Israel
in 1948, but lowered its level of diplomatic representation to
charge d'affaires in Tel Aviv in 1981 when Israel declared
Jerusalem as its "eternal" capital. Ankara also closed its
consulate-general in Arab East Jerusalem as well.
</P>
<P>
As the Middle East peace process was launched in Madrid in 1991,
Turkey reciprocally upgraded its diplomatic relations with Israel
to the level of ambassador. At the same time, the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) Office in Ankara was turned into an
embassy.

<HEADLINE> Pakistanis Generally Feel Hard Work Rarely Pays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A majority of the people in
Pakistan do not attribute wealth to hard work or education and
instead believe that wealth comes out of "inheritance, ill-gotten
money or sheer luck", Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a recent survey by Gallup Pakistan, the report said
that some people attribute it to an opportunity to work abroad.
Following the same argument, a majority do not attribute poverty
to laziness or lack of devotion to work and instead attribute this
phenomenon to birth in a poor family, fate and abstention from
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among nearly 1500 men an women
statistically selected from the rural and urban areas of all the
four provinces, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 percent attributed wealth to hard work and six
percent to good education but the majority (30 percent) attributed
it to birth in a rich family. As many as 22 percent were of the
view that it comes through ill-gotten money and 12 percent
believed that the luck or fate has a role, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Southern Airlines Takes over Provincial Aviation Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China Southern Airlines, one of
China's major civil aviation companies, today took over a
provincial aviation company.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a national pillar aviation company
took over a local aviation company since the General
Administration of Civil Aviation of China, also known as CAAC,
announced that China would form three big airline groups-- Air
China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The local aviation company, Zhongyuan Airlines, was founded by
central China's Henan Province in 1986. The total asset of the
local company was 1.46 billion yuan. The company has five Boeing
737s and two home-made aircraft in operation. It offers more than
100 flights each week. It has had no air crashes in the past 14
years.
</P>
<P>
China Southern Airlines is one of the biggest airlines in China.
It provides over 2,600 flights each week and has flown more
passengers among all other civil aviation companies across the
county in the past twenty one years.
</P>
<P>
The merger will make China Southern Airlines more competitive
and be conducive to an orderly development of civil aviation in
central China.
</P>
<P>
The three new groups will include ten airlines run by the CAAC,
including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern
Airlines, China Northern Airlines and Yunnan Airlines.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these ten companies, China has 24 local airlines.
</P>
<P>
The three groups expect to have assets worth more than 40
billion yuan each, and almost equal market shares.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge to Stop New Cable Car Project at Taishan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Some well-known Chinese heritage
experts recently urged the immediate stop on the expansion of
cable-car project on Mount Taishan, one of China's five most
famous mountain resorts.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen experts, including Hou Renzhi, an academician from the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Wu Liangyong, an academician
from the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), Xie Ninggao,
heritage professor from Beijing University, and Luo Zhewen, an
expert on ancient architecture with the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage (SACH), suggest pulling down existing cable-car
facilities and replant trees and vegetation on the peak to protect
the world-famous cultural site, according to today's "Guangming
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The cable car, linking the peak and Zhongtian Gate, is long due
for servicing. It has been operating for some twenty years.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that the expansion planned by local
authorities will further destroy the environment and view of the
majestic mountain.
</P>
<P>
Taishan is located in Tai'an City in Shandong Province and is 1,
545-meters high. In 1987, Mount Taishan was added to the list of
World Heritage sites.

<HEADLINE> China To Establish Journalists' Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese journalists will have
their own festival -- "Journalists' Day" on November 8 if a
relevant proposal is approved, according to a report in the China
Youth Daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the proposal for establishment of the festival is
being considered by the Legislative Affairs Bureau of the State
Council, and will be promulgated after going through the
legislative procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Journalists' Day will be a work-as-usual holiday for
journalists, just like the country's Teachers' Day and Nurses' Day,
when teachers and nurses have to work on their posts.
</P>
<P>
The date was chosen because on November 8, 1937 the China Young
Journalists Association was founded by left-wing reporters headed
by Fan Changjiang in the city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of Journalists' Day will encourage all
Chinese journalists to carry forward the fine traditions and do
their best for the just cause, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Journalists Association is expected to hold
various activities to mark the new festival, it said.

<HEADLINE> Half of Chinese Advocate Restriction on Rising Divorces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Worried about the rising divorce
rate, more and more Chinese are in favor of setting tougher laws.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the All-China Women's Federation shows that
47.6 percent of the 4,000 men and women respondents agree with
tougher laws against divorces, while only 27 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted over 10 provinces and provides
information for Revision of China's 1980 Marriage Law.
</P>
<P>
China's divorce rate has been rising at an annual rate of 9.08
percent. In 1999, 1.19 million people divorced.
</P>
<P>
Couples who want to separate may either sign divorce letters
prepared by themselves or go to court. However, 55.3 percent of
the respondents said divorce is too easy in China because the only
statutory condition is the "breakdown of mutual affection."
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent said clear stipulations on conditions for
divorce should be listed in the Marriage Law.
</P>
<P>
ACWF has proposed the following amendments:
</P>
<P>
-- those who are physical handicapped are not allowed to marry
</P>
<P>
-- marriage arranged by parents without agreement of one or
both partners
</P>
<P>
-- those who live separately for more than one year and half
because of bad relations
</P>
<P>
-- one side has been engaged in adultery or illicit affairs
</P>
<P>
-- one side has committed bigamy, and
</P>
<P>
-- those abused or abandoned without being provided with
financial assistance.

BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese PC producer TCL is going
to install a Red Flag Linux operating system in its personal

operating system in the booming Chinese PC market.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bo, chief executive officer of Red Flag Software Co. and
Zhu Xuefeng, vice-general manager of TCL, signed an agreement here
today on the installation of the operating system, known as Red

see the monopoly of Microsoft's Windows operating system reduced.
</P>
<P>
The Linux operating system, widely believed safer and use-
friendly than Windows, is enjoying growing market shares around
the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The 2000-2001 edition of the
Romanian first soccer division begins on Friday under a new format
and with at least three teams aspiring to the national title.
</P>
<P>
There are 16 teams (comparing with 18 last season) in the first
division and the relegation system has also been changed.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the season, the teams ranking 15th and 16th will
be automatically relegated to the second division and the 13th and
14th ranked will be given the chance of a play-off with the second
ranked of the two B divisions on condition they have at least 30
points.
</P>
<P>
The main favorites for the title are Steaua, Rapid and Dinamo,
all from Bucharest. Steaua has made several good acquisitions and
the results of the training matches are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Rapid benefits from the experience of the best Romanian coach
over the last period - Anghel Iordanescu - and has a well-balanced
team.
</P>
<P>
Dinamo, who holds the title, has certain difficulties after the
transfer period and started on the wrong foot in the international
competition season - they were prematurely eliminated by Polonia
Warsaw in Champions League.
</P>
<P>
In the inaugural match, Universitatea Craiova will play against
FC Brasov. The program of the first round to end on Monday
includes a first derby: FC National vs. Dinamo Bucharest.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Moving Eastward, Scientists Find </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-U.S. joint survey
indicates that each year Shanghai moves 8 mm eastward and Urumqi,
capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
shifts 14 mm northeastward.
</P>
<P>
This results from the northward movement of the Indian
subcontinent, which has also caused the uplift of the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in Shanghai, Urumqi, Alaska, Hawaii,
Japan's Kashima and Australia's Tasmania by Shanghai Observatory
and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
"The findings conform to the earlier theory of crustal plate
movements," said Wang Guangli, a researcher with Shanghai
Observatory, who participated in the survey.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Another Suspect Responsible for June 30 Explosion Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Local police in Jiangmen City
in south China's Guangdong Province today detained Liang Zhijian,
another suspect held responsible for a major explosion in a local
fireworks factory which took place on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Six other suspects have also been detained by police.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that in March 1993, the 47 year old Liang
was an employee with the Pengjiang Branch of the Jiangmen Bureau
of Public Security. He was in charge of explosives, but abused his
power and approved Jiangmen Local Product High-Grade Fireworks
Factory to add four more workshops. This clearly violated safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The investigators concluded that Liang was directly
responsibility for the June 30 explosion.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, at least 35 people were killed,
and 167 others were injured during the explosion. The State
Council sent a special team to investigate the cause of the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
After the explosion, Guangdong Provincial Government convened
an emergency meeting to cease the production of all fireworks
factories and manufacturers of cigarette lighters in the province.

BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Composite Index
closed at 2,026.36 points Friday, up 13.57 points or 0.67 percent
from last week's 2,012 points.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover this week stood at 64.59 billion yuan, 5.52

Homeway, a leading online financial and securities advisory
company.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the Shanghai Composite Index created new highs
almost everyday and touched 2,041.28 points Friday. However, the
slow bullish trend indicates that the turnover was not greatly
expanded.
</P>
<P>
High-tech and Internet companies became bellwethers again this
week, boosted by the news about Tsinghua Tongfang. The company
might create 100 millionaires, each with a wealth of 10 million
yuan, and the company's price will jump up to 150 yuan per share,
according to Lu Zhicheng, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
Steel companies, ST shares and mutual funds also performed
actively. But investors were still concerned about the market
which is on the historic high level.
</P>
<P>
Another feature was that the IPO market expanded slowly. Only
four new shares debuted on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses and
two new A-share companies issued new shares on the Shanghai bourse.
All IPOs rose a little on the first listing day.
</P>
<P>
Fueled by sound economic development and favorable government
policies towards the stock market, the Shenzhen Composite Index

<HEADLINE> Weekly Review of China's T-Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond market went
bullish this week, led by the three bonds listed after 1999, all
of which hit record highs with expanded turnover, according to
Homeway, a leading online financial and securities advisory firm.
</P>
<P>
009905 (3.2 percent, due 2007), 009908(3.3 percent, due 2009)
and 010004, a newly listed bond with the coupon rate floating 0.62
percentage points above the interest rate of one-year time
deposits at banks, grew 0.31 yuan, 0.34 yuan and 0.91 yuan to
create new highs of 102.71 yuan, 102.48 yuan and 103.49 yuan,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
As this year's interest payments of the first two are
approaching, they witnessed apparent expansions in the trade
volume, indicating active capital inflow.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 (9.78 percent , due 2007) rose 0.80 yuan to 144.90
yuan by its good intrinsic yield at 2.88 percent, the highest
among all current bonds. 000696 (11.83 percent, due 2006) and
000896 (8.56 percent, due 2003) saw rises of 0.04 yuan and 0.21
yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The gain this week reflected ample capital supply. As the A-
share stock market has kept bullish for seven straight months,
potential corrections pose mounting risks to investors. Thus more
and more capital might be thrown into the fixed income treasury
market to drive up T-bonds.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the future operations of open-ended fund and Sino-
foreign co-operative funds are also expected to help revive
treasuries.

HONG KONG, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Piracy in Hong Kong is firmly
under control, Commissioner of Hong Kong Customs and Excise, John
Tsang Chun-wah, said on Friday.

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Vocational Education in Ethnic Minority Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The State Ethnic Affairs
Commission and the Ministry of Education issued an circular
recently, calling for improving vocational education in China's
ethnic minority regions.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that "experiences in the past two decades
show that reliance on science and technology, as well as education,
is an inevitable route for the economic rejuvenation of China's
ethnic minority regions".
</P>
<P>
By 1997, the total number of students enrolled by secondary
vocational schools in minority regions was much less than the that
of students at senior middle schools. The layout of vocational
schools and the curricula could not meet the needs of minority
regions.
</P>
<P>
"For comparatively developed minority regions, efforts should
be made to help the junior and senior middle school students to
learn techniques applicable to modern agriculture."
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the total number of students enrolled by secondary
vocational schools in ethnic minority regions will be the same or
even surpasses the total number of students in senior middle
schools.
</P>
<P>
China has 56 nationalities, and its ethnic minority population
surpasses 100 million, accounting for more than eight percent of
the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Acknowledges Correction of Israel's Border Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
has said the verification process of Israel's post-withdrawal
border violations is over, asserting that U.N. peacekeeping forces
are free to fan out across the liberated zone, local press reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The verdict that all border encroachments have been corrected
was made in a three-hour meeting at the command headquarters of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in Naqoura between
U.N. and Lebanese army officers who conducted the on-the-spot
verification operation.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Lebanese government has given the green light for the
U.N. peacekeepers deployment, and the operation now hinges on field
arrangements and logistics, An Nahar newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been notified that the encroachment that was existing
in a Yaroun hill has been terminated," Hoss said in a telephone
interview with As Safir newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) can now carry out
the plan of deployment along the entire border line any time it
deems adequate since the Lebanese political decision approving this
deployment has already been made," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Mines in the central border district of Yaroun had made U.N. and
Lebanese army verifying teams unable to reach the border line to
certify the correction of Israel's last encroachment in that area,
Asharq newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
But An Nahar and As Safir papers said the 10-day verification
process has finally confirmed that Israel has corrected all
infringements on the U.N.-drawn withdrawal Blue Line, clearing any
excuse for a further deployment delay.
</P>
<P>
As Safir paper reported that some 1,000 troops from UNIFIL's
Irish, Finnish, Ukrainian, Nepalese, Ghanaian and Fijian
contingents are poised to roll into 12 to 15 border outposts
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Once the troops fan out to the outposts, UNIFIL's deployment
will cover the entire Blue Line from the Mediterranean town of
Naqoura, some 100 kilometers inland, to Hasbaya and Kfar Shouba
near the foothills of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 UNIFIL troops were deployed in six Blue Line locations
in the Israeli-vacated zone earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese task force of 500 army troops and 500 policemen
will roll into the liberated zone 24 hours after UNIFIL completes
its deployment, As Safir paper said.
</P>
<P>
The force will take up positions in and around towns and
villages away from the immediate border proximity. UNIFIL troops
will patrol the borderline to monitor and report any future Israeli
violations.

the development of the Second Bangkok International Airport agreed
this week that the removal of all facilities to the Nong Ngu Hao
Airport must be completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
This will be in line with the scheduled completion of Second
International Airport in 2004, he said.
</P>
<P>
The committee also authorized the Airports Authority of
Thailand (AAT) to draw up a personnel transfer plan and inform all
airline companies of the plan, he stated.

<P>
The Don Muang Airport would then be used as shopping center or
aircraft maintenance center, said Pradit.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Asks Militant Groups to Come Forward For Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current dialogue between the Indian central government and
Hizbul Mujahideen, a major militant outfit in Kashmir, was part of
the peace efforts, Vajpayee said while making a statement in the
Lok Sabha, or the Indian parliament, here on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Other (militant) groups which have chosen the path of violence
should also realize that the people of Jammu and Kashmir want
peace...It is futile for them to continue on the path of violence,
" Vajpayee was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
These militant groups should come forward for talks with the
government for redress of their grievances, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I may add that while the fight against terrorism will continue,
India will not give up efforts for restoration of peace in Jammu
and Kashmir," stressed the prime minister, who on Thursday paid a
day's visit to Kashmir where a series of militant attacks against
civilians on August 1 evening killed at least 100 people and
injured nearly 100 others.
</P>
<P>
The perpetrators of the massacres were obviously trying to
sabotage the recent peace initiative by the Indian government and
Hizbul Mujahideen, which reached a ceasefire last week and started
talks in Kashmir on Thursday for the first time in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report of the PTI, U.S. Ambassador to India
Richard F Celeste said here on Friday that his country "fully
supports" India's attempt for dialogue in Kashmir and hopes that
the dialogue would be successful.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Asked to Speed Up BIMP-EAGA Project Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ministers from all the four member countries expressed their
concern over the lack in progress in the implementation of
projects for BIMP-EAGA at their three-day meeting which ended in
Labuan, off Sabah, East Malaysia, Friday, Malaysian Finance
Minister Daim Zainuddin who chaired the meeting said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that the private sector must use the East
ASEAN Business Council (EABC) to sort out whatever problems they
face implementing projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there were various memoranda of understanding (MoUs)
signed among BIMP-EAGA members but many delayed the implementation
of the projects.
</P>
<P>
"The reason given (for the delay) was the economic recession.
But now, we hope that with the economic recovery, they can move on,
" Bernama quoted Daim as saying in Labuan.
</P>
<P>
The private sector must be aggressive in seizing opportunities
to undertake projects which were viable and beneficial to all
economies, he said, adding the government is only playing the role
of a facilitator in such matters.
</P>
<P>
The minister asked the private sector to use the public sector
to accelerate the pace of implementation, given the latter's
obvious advantage in facilitating the process administratively,
legally and across borders.
</P>
<P>
Daim regretted that although the grouping had been in existence
for more than six and half years, it had yet to yield the level of
dynamic growth that had been initially anticipated.
</P>
<P>
He said the less impressive performance may have been partly
due to the economic recession but it is timely for now that member
countries review the BIMP-EAGA process.
</P>
<P>
Daim said the meeting agreed that states would be given more
powers to make decisions to expedite investments implemented in
their territories.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Brunei's delegation was headed by its Industry
and Primary Resources Minister Pehin Datuk Abdul Rahman Taib,
Indonesia was represented by its Forestry and Estate Crops
Minister Nur Mahmudi Isma'il while Undersecretary for Industry and
Investments Raul C.Hernandez represented the Philippines.

Identification documents show the deceased mercenaries were
from Yemen, Morocco and other Arab states, according to the press
center.
</P>
<P>
The office of Kremlin spokesman for Chechnya Sergei
Yastrzhembsky confirmed on Friday the reported routing of the
group of foreign mercenaries in the Sharoi district of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-one mercenaries were killed and several more captured,

mercenary group incurred no losses," said the office, adding that
the other details of the operation are being clarified.

PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Comoros' separatist island of
Anjouan has called for the lifting of economic embargo imposed by
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on March 20.

The "president" of Anjouan, Said Abeid, made the appeal when

The OAU imposed economic embargo on Anjouan, which broke away

<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese top sports official
said on Friday that China has made remarkable achievements in its
anti-drug campaign over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, who heads the Chinese Olympic Committee, the State

<P>
He noted that China had set up anti-doping committee,
formulated laws and regulations, and established drug-testing
institutions. He continued that China has been always adopting
the "Three Stricts" policy, namely, strict on prohibiting the use
of drugs, strict on doping tests and strict on punishing the
offenders.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said China has increased the number of drug tests in
recent years, with the percentage of the positive results dropping
from 1.6 in the early 19909s to today's 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Illegal Immigration (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
determined to take immediate measures to intensify the strike
against illegal immigration following June 20's case of 58 Chinese
stowaways suffocated to death in an airtight truck of tomatoes at
Dover, England.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, illegal immigration has skyrocketed,
especially from the coastal province of Fujian, the latest weekly
of Beijing Review reported.
</P>
<P>
The destinations of the immigrants are varied, but are mainly
the United States, Canada and Australia, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
From December 15, 1999 to March 15 this year, police and
frontier defense army in Fujian conducted a special operation
focusing on seeking out the snakeheads, punishing the criminals,
cleaning up the ports and strengthening security.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jiansen, captain of Fujian public security and frontier
defense army, catalogued the accomplishments of the operation.
</P>
<P>
Many stowaways and organizers were caught. Among the 207
captured criminals, 89 people were arrested, 88 detained, one
reformed through labor and 29 punished through other means.
</P>
<P>
The Fuzhou public security and frontier defense army discovered
14 organizers of illegal immigration in 1999. Police in Putian
City dispersed three family-organized immigration gangs, and
arrested the rampant snakehead Wen Jinshun.
</P>
<P>
The impetus of illegal immigration has been checked. During the
special operation, only 22 stowaways were discovered in Fujian, 95.
5 percent less than the year-earlier figure of 490.
</P>
<P>
In particular, through its special measures, the local
government put an end to the large-scale illegal immigration
taking place in the coastal areas of Fujian on ocean-going ships.

Xining Customs statistics show that the province's exports were
54.03 million US dollars in the six-month period, up 21.3 percent
from the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Illegal Immigration (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The profits of the snakeheads are tremendous as an illegal
immigrant to Britain has to pay some 210,000 yuan (25,000 U.S.
dollars). If only 30 percent of the immigration activities are
successful, they will still make a considerable income, Beijing
Review reported.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of traveling to Britain is actually only 60,000
to 70,000 yuan, leaving the head snakeheads with a profit of about
140,000 to 150,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Dover case involved perhaps two or three head snakeheads.
The snakeheads usually work separately, but will cooperate when
there are extremely large profits involved.
</P>
<P>
Given the high profits involved, it is understandable why the
snakeheads are willing to risk imprisonment. However, their
incentive makes it more difficult for the police to eliminate
these activities.
</P>
<P>
Despite these challenges, the Chinese government will not
slacken in its efforts, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jiansen has indicated that the situation with illegal
immigration in Fujian Province is serious and the task of
eliminating it is formidable.
</P>
<P>
At present, the entire province is laying special emphasis on
seeking out the organizers, the main collaborators at home and
abroad, the would-be illegal immigrants and the snakeheads.
</P>
<P>
With the heavy blows dealt by the Chinese government against
illegal immigration and the tragic lesson learned from the Dover
immigrants, illegal immigration will abate, according to the
weekly.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, illegal immigration is still rampant, the weekly said.
The major reason for this is that main collaborators on the
mainland collude with those abroad, making the business of helping
illegal immigrants an international dealing.
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons contributing to this phenomenon, such
as the increasingly clever and clandestine methods employed by the
criminals, the high profits involved and the non-interference of
other countries, which often welcome the illegal immigrants into
their countries as "refugees," said Beijing Review.
</P>
<P>
These all aid the illegal immigrants and make it more difficult
for the Chinese government to take definitive action, it noted.
</P>
<P>
With each illegal immigration operation, there will be one head
snakehead in charge of the entire process. Usually, the
forerunners will first go abroad and obtain green cards from other
countries involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
The snakeheads will then look for clients. In order to attract
the would-be illegal immigrants, the head snakehead will not ask
for too much money up front; the "traveling fee" is paid gradually
with the snakeheads taking all the risks.
</P>
<P>
Under the head snakehead there are always several dozens of
lower-level snakeheads who control their respective links in the
entire chain operation.
</P>
<P>
Organizing the illegal immigration operations is a profitable
profession, giving the snakeheads the incentive to risk
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The snakeheads will negotiate with their clients as to how much
the entire trip will cost. The prices fluctuate depending on the
economic and employment situation in the destination country. (

<HEADLINE> Barak to Seek New Shas-Meretz Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is expected to give top priority to forming a new coalition
with Meretz and Shas parties, The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted a
source of the ruling One Israel as reporting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak believes he can overcome the differences between Meretz
and Shas that led to the June coalition crisis which resulted in
the resignation of three Meretz cabinet ministers, including
Education Minister Yossi Sarid, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Three Meretz ministers quit their cabinet posts during the June
crisis, but the party has remained in the coalition. The powerful
ultra-Orthodox Shas party pulled out from the cabinet and coalition
in July after Barak decided to go to the Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak's options for a new coalition are limited since he plans
to pursue a framework agreement on the final-status issues with the
Palestinians, the source pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Barak held talks with Meretz leader Sarid and
Shas leader Eli Yishai, and both expressed frustration over the
past, but did not rule out a new partnership.
</P>
<P>
Barak also views Am Ehad (One Nation) and Democratic Choice,
each holding two Knesset (parliament) members, as the next in line
for the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
But none of these options is considered automatic. Sarid will
have to compromise on funding for the Shas educational network, and
Yishai will have to come to terms with the peace process, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Am Ehad, led by National Trade Federation Chairman Amir Peretz,
will be asked to compromise on social issues, while his colleague,
Haim Katz, will face the task of softening his position on the
peace process, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The secular Democratic Choice, may not agree to join the new
coalition that includes Shas, but has already said it will support
the peace process from the outside.
</P>
<P>
A coalition that includes all these parties will give Barak 61
seats in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
According to Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer, Barak
wants talks to take place with as wide a range of factions as
possible on forming a new coalition.
</P>
<P>
A negotiating team is expected to be set up next week,
compromising One Israel ministers and Knesset members, to conduct
such talks, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A number of One Israel ministers and Knesset members on Thursday
vented their anger toward Barak for his poor handling of the recent
domestic political affairs, in which Labor's presidential candidate
Shimon Peres lost in the vote, while the opposition's bill calling
for early elections passed its preliminary reading in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister's Office also expressed their
anger on Thursday over reports that senior Labor members plan to
challenge Barak's party leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon spoke of
making preparations for the next elections, stating on Thursday
that Likud will hold a party primary to determine its prime
ministerial candidate.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Calls for More Courtesy in Politicians' Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Moshe Katsav
has called on Knesset (Parliament) members (MKs) to tone down their
rhetoric and "treat each other with more respect," a local daily
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli society has not learnt the right lessons from the
assassination of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, said
Katsav, who was sworn in Tuesday as the country's eighth president.
</P>
<P>
Katsav made the appeal in an interview on Thursday with The
Jerusalem Post, a day after some particularly fiery exchanges were
reported from the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
In his second day at Beit Hanassi, the presidential residence,
Katsav said that during his seven-year term of office, he will try
to tone down the rhetoric in the national political dialogue, so
that different political fractions will treat each other with more
respect.
</P>
<P>
He said he is "worried that none of the sectors of society has
properly learnt the lessons of the Rabin assassination."
</P>
<P>
The new president, said the paper, had issued a similar warning
in his inaugural speech on Tuesday, to apparently little effect.
</P>
<P>
"The politicians' behavior influences the public," Katsav told
the paper. "If we want to be good leaders, we must remember to be
careful in our speech."
</P>
<P>
The president, who was named the most sportsmanlike MK in 1982,
said he will also begin a series of visits next week to different
areas of the country in an effort to promote unity. The first stop
will be Jerusalem and will be led by Mayor Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question whether he will call on Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to form a national unity government, Katsav reiterated
his desire to avoid politics. He has repeatedly pledged to steer
clear of politics.
</P>
<P>
"I have to stand above political issues, because I was elected
by MKs belonging to all the sectors - leftist and rightist, Jews
and non-Jews, Sephardim and Ashkenazim," said Katsav, an Iran-born
Sephardi.
</P>
<P>
Katsav is also the first Likud candidate to win a presidential
election, breaking into one of the final institutions that was
considered reserved for the country's elite Ashkenazi Labor Party
ruling class.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president, whose post is largely a ceremonial
one, said, "I believe the job of the president is to form the
national and public agenda of Israeli society and I have no
intention to publicly criticize the prime minister."
</P>
<P>
Barak, whose government has been reduced to a crippling minority
one holding only 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset with the
resignations of ruling partners, has vowed to reshuffle the
government in the next few weeks. There have also been calls for
him to form a national unity government with the opposition Likud
faction.
</P>
<P>
Katsav was elected president in a secret ballot by the Knesset
on Monday, beating the leading Labor candidate, a long-time
statesman and Minister of Regional Cooperation Shimon Peres.

<HEADLINE> Manila Expects Release of Malaysian Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary Robert Aventajado, the chief negotiator for the
government, said in a radio interview that the Malaysians could be
freed after a meeting he would conduct with Malaysian officials in
Zamboanga City on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If we can come up with an agreement, we could work out their
release Sunday or Monday," Aventajado said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting with Malaysian officials, whom he did not
name, would likely involve the demand of Abu Sayyaf leader Ghalib
Andang alias Commander Robot for livelihood projects.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said Robot's latest demand is a mango plantation.
Robot had relayed his demand through a designated go-between
identified only as Dragon, he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that the meeting was intended to discuss a 45-
million-peso (1.12-million-U.S. dollar) ransom payment for the
Malaysians' freedom.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aventajado reiterated that the government has not
deviated from its no-ransom policy, notwithstanding speculations
to the contrary, in some sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has no choice but to follow that policy,
pointing out that it has already been spelled out at the early
stages of the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Aventajado said that the government had no hand in the
release of German journalist Andreas Lorenz, who was abducted and
released twice after paying ransom.

<HEADLINE> Human Capital, Limiting Factor in New Economy: Singapore Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing a scholarship award ceremony Friday held by the
Economic Development Board (EDB), Minister of State for Trade &AMP;
Industry and Communications &AMP; Information Technology Lim Swee Say
said that the limiting factor for Singapore in the New Economy and
Information Society is human capital.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that this means that Singapore will increasingly
be competing in the world for human capital and with human capital.
</P>
<P>
After listing Singapore's major achievements in the 35 years
since its independence in 1965, Lim said that his country will
face new challenges and threats of structural unemployment,
widening income gap and digital divide in the new age of New
Economy and Information Society.
</P>
<P>
He said, "For 35 years, we competed with the world for jobs,
technology, markets and capital because these were the leading
contributing factors to economic growth and social progress."
</P>
<P>
"However, in the new world of technology and globalization,
technology, infrastructure and even financial capital will no
longer be the limiting factor of economic growth and social
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To remain competitive and cohesive as we continue the journey
of nation building, our key challenge is to be able to further
strengthen our human capital to the best of our ability," he
concluded.

the capture of former Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin
and his extradition to Kazakhstan to face trial on criminal
charges.

<P>
Competent Kazakh authorities have opened a criminal case

opposition leader of Kazakhstan. The Interfax news agency quoted
Kazakh Procurator General Yuri Khitri as saying on Thursday that
Kazhegeldin is charged with taking bribes, illegal amassing of
property, abuse of power, illegal possession and transfer of
weapons and tax evasion. He is also under investigation for
dereliction of duty. An international warrant has been issued for
his capture for criminal investigations. (Kazakhstan-Former

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The FIFA Executive Committee has
expressed a clear opinion in favor of some form of rotating the
FIFA World Cup among the six continental confederations, as from
the year 2010, according to a FIFA press release received here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Committee, meeting Thursday in Zurich under the
chairmanship of the FIFA President, Joseph S. Blatter, unanimously
backed Blatter's suggestion to ensure that all continents be given
an equal opportunity to host the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The issue will now go to the FIFA Strategic Study Committee,
which includes the presidents and general secretaries of the six
confederations as well as the FIFA President, the Senior Vice-
President and the General Secretary, to elaborate further details
of this basic principle.
</P>
<P>
President Blatter also informed the committee of developments
since the same committee decided on July 6 to designate Germany as
host nation of the FIFA World Cup in 2006. He reiterated that the
decision was taken in conformity with all regulations, and was
final. He also added that the initiative taken by the defeated
South African Football Association to take the matter to
arbitration was inappropriate, and not supported by the African
Football Confederation (CAF).

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is expected to give top
priority to forming a new coalition with Meretz and Shas parties, a
One Israel source said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Barak believes he can overcome the differences between
the two parties that led to the June coalition crisis that resulted
in the resignation of three Meretz ministers. Meretz has remained
in the coalition. Shas pulled out of the cabinet and the coalition
last month after Barak decided to go to the Camp David peace
summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak's options are limited since he plans to pursue a framework
agreement with the Palestinians, the source said. He has recently
met with Meretz leader Yossi Sarid and Shas leader Eli Yishai, and
both expressed frustration over the past, but did not rule out a
new partnership.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak met in Alexandria, Egypt Thursday for talks on the
peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and to
discuss the results of the Camp David summit. The two leaders met
privately and then had a lunch meeting in which their aides took
part.
</P>
<P>
The trip to Alexandria was Barak's first outside Israel since
his return home from the United States last week.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Barak told Israeli reporters during a
separate press conference that he believes the Egyptian president
understands the difficulties and complexities of the problems
facing the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived unexpectedly in
South Africa Thursday to ask former president Nelson Mandela to
help revive the peace talks. Mandela had managed to advise Arafat
last year to shelve his planned unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in South Africa, Arafat said he believes U.S.
President Bill Clinton can help the Palestinians and Israelis
resolve their two major remaining differences, which are the status
of Jerusalem and the right of Palestinian refugees to return home
or receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
"If we solve these two problems, we feel it is still possible to
reach an agreement before the 13th of September," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Officials in the Israeli prime minister's office reacted in
anger Thursday to reports that senior Labor party members plan to
challenge Ehud Barak for party leadership. According to the
reports, initial steps are already being taken to choose one
agreed-upon candidate to run against Barak in order not to split
the vote among his opponents.
</P>
<P>
The officials pointed an accusing finger at Knesset (Parliament)
Speaker Avraham Burg, who they said is constantly undermining the
prime minister's position.
</P>
<P>
Burg told Tel Aviv's Non Stop Radio that if a peace agreement
with the Palestinians is not reached and the elections are
advanced, "there is a high probability of a race for the party
leadership. Whether or not I am a candidate is less relevant."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami announced
Thursday that he will not challenge Barak for the party leadership
even if the peace process fails.

<P>
ANKARA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Thursday both sides in
Cyprus should "mutually recognize each other's political equality
and sovereignty" in order to create a common ground for negotiation
on the island.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the ministry said the purpose of the
proximity talks on Cyprus in Geneva is to "prepare necessary ground
for face-to-face talks. Only after this ground is created,
negotiations could be initiated."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots in
1974 when Turkey sent its troops to the north following an
attempted pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- A report prepared by the Italian police said the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) is raising fund from drug-trafficking
and organization of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the PKK, which has waged a 15-year
armed struggle for self-rule in southeast Turkey, is transferring
illegal immigrants from northern Iraq via Turkey to Greece, Italy
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Devlet Bahceli, leader of Turkey's ruling partner Nationalist
Action Party (MHP), is launching a new campaign to improve his
party image by forming women and youth branches within the party.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an armed clash took place at one of the party's
grassroots congress due to some youth members' radical actions. One
party member was killed in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- One Turkish official said that if Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat declares an independent state on September 13, Turkey
will not have to face a hard dilemma whether to recognize it or not
because Turkey has already recognized Palestine and has diplomatic
relations with it.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian administration has an embassy in Ankara while
Turkey has a consulate accredited to the Palestinian administration
in East Jerusalem.

</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>

<P>

billion Egyptian pounds (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) for sale at the
Stock Exchange as of September. They comprise 29 public business
sector companies and others that belong to different ministries.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The Conference of Nile Basin Irrigation Ministers will start

coastal city of Alexandria, hoping to revive the stalled Middle
East peace process.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Sturgeon Spotted in Qiantang River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Fishermen have caught a tail of
Chinese sturgeon, a rare variety of fish, at the mouth of the
Qiantang River in east China.
</P>
<P>
Elder fishermen said they can hardly find any Chinese sturgeon
in the river since the Xinanjiang Reservoir was built in the
northern part of the coastal province in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir has changed the temperature of water in the river,
which is not suitable for the fish to live in.
</P>
<P>
The 30-centimeter-long fish, with black spots on its back, is a
young Chinese sturgeon. It was caught late July but released three
days later.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jianrong, the fisherman who caught the fish, did not know
what fish it was until experts from Zhejiang Provincial Nature
Museum determined its identity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon, on the verge of extinction, is on the
state's first-class protection list.
</P>
<P>
Referred to as a kind of "living fossils," the fish is highly
valuable for scientific research on geology, ocean and ecology.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon, the largest fish in the sturgeon family,
is peculiar to China.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese sturgeons has decreased drastically in
recent years due to river pollution, a busier navigation, illegal
fishing and building of dams.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken steps to protect Chinese sturgeons
over the past two decades. During 1983 and 1998, millions of fries
were put into the Yangtze River for breeding.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has banned the fishing of Chinese
sturgeons and controlled pollution to protect the fish, one of the
oldest vertebrates on earth.

<HEADLINE> Anti-cancer Drugs Expected to Be Developed from Shark Cartilage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully extracted from shark cartilage two angiogenesis
inhibitory factors, which are likely to be turned into anticancer
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The two factors, named SCAIF (Shark Cartilage Angiogenesis
Inhibitory factor)-I and SCAIF-II, were obtained by a group of
researchers from Shanghai's Fudan University and the Shanghai
Institute of Naval Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the development of tumor depends on
newly emerging blood vessels and that inhibiting the growth of
blood vessels results in withering tumor.
</P>
<P>
Finding angiogenesis inhibitory factors and deriving effective
anticancer drugs from them have therefore become a key research
project in the world in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopeful on Extra Powers Bill for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
he and other Cabinet officials have adequately explained before
the Senate Thursday the need for these powers.
</P>
<P>
"We explained to senators the government's position on the bill
Thursday and the senators received this positively," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained the government is only after the fast-track
implementation of development projects in Mindanao, especially
those backed by foreign assistance, in seeking extra economic
powers for the President.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the proposal presented by the presidential palace
involves the adoption of the electronic billboard bidding system
that would promote transparency in the bidding process for
development projects covered by the extra powers measure.
</P>
<P>
The president earlier assured the public that his sole reason
for asking Congress to grant him these extra powers was to jump-
start Mindanao's economy, which, he said, has long been neglected
by previous administrations.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Consumers Gaining Mastery of PC, Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A global study released this
week has found rises in PC ownership and Internet use around the
world, but the divide between developed and developing countries
is only modestly closing.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of global consumers own a PC, up six percentage
points since 1998, while nearly one in five went on-line in the
past month, up seven points in the same period, according to the
study by Roper Starch Worldwide, a U.S. marketing research and
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on 30,000 face-to-face interviews with 1,000
consumers in each of 30 countries and regions, is projectable to 1.
39 billion people.
</P>
<P>
The biggest regional jump in PC ownership occurred in Asia, up
12 points from 1998. In second place, half of North Americans own
PCs, an eight-point gain over 1998. Third-place Latin America saw
a seven point rise.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gains in many parts of the world, Roper Starch
Worldwide said, the digital divide between developed and
developing countries is only modestly closing. The rate of
adopting information technology in more nascent economies is
faster than in developed countries, but it's from a base still
quite small, the research firm said.
</P>
<P>
Internet use is expanding at a pace similar to PC, according to
the study. North Americans are more likely than people in other
regions to have access to the Internet in the past 30 days, up 12
points since 1998.

<HEADLINE> World Chip Sales Rise To Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to data released by the Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA), chipmakers made a record sale of 16.6 U.S.
billion dollars in June, 48 percent from last June's 11.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It's also the fourth consecutive month in which the SIA
reported chip sales had reached a record high.
</P>
<P>
"June's numbers exceeded our expectations and affirm our
forecast for a strong 2000," George Scalise, SIA's president, said.
Earlier this year, the SIA revised upward its growth-rate forecast
to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Scalise said soaring demand for consumer products such as
wireless telephones, personal digital assistants and set-top boxes,
drove sales of flash memory, field programmable logic devices (
FPLDs), digital signal processors (DSPs), analog and
optoelectronics chips to the most substantial gains.
</P>
<P>
Flash sales were up 167 percent; FPLDs were up 106 percent; DSP
sales were 51 percent higher; analog sales rose 70 percent; and
optoelectronics chips sales came in 65 percent higher, the SIA
said.
</P>
<P>
Chips used in personal computers also rose substantially.
Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) sales were up 75 percent,
while microprocessor sales were 36 percent higher, the SIA
reported.
</P>
<P>
From a geographic standpoint, sales growth was stronger in Asia-
Pacific and Japanese markets, where they were up 52.8 percent and
50.8 percent, respectively. Sales in the Americas rose 42.7
percent. Europe's sales grew 48.1 percent, the SIA said.

<HEADLINE> Individual Housing, Car buying Booming in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 4 (Xinhua)-- Individual consumption on housing
and cars in this port city of Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning
Province has vigorously increased in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The city sold houses with a total floor space of 406,000 square
meters to individual buyers, soaring 49.3 percent from a year
earlier. It amounted to 77.6 percent of the city's total housing
sales space, up 7.9 percent over the same period of last year,
local statistical bureau showed.
</P>
<P>
Sales of individual houses reached some 1.03 billion yuan (over
124 million U.S. dollars), accounting for 75.7 percent of the city
's total sales value during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the booming individual houses sales
to the government's sound reform on its traditional housing system,
to the increasing loans for home buyers and the rising income of
people along with the improvement of marketing services.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of cars by individuals also claimed over 30
percent of the city's total car sales in the first six months,
which is 29.3 percent higher than the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Home telephone installation has
become a hot consumption spot in rural Zhejiang, one of China's
leading economic developed provinces in east coastal region.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhejiang Telcom Company's Statistics, over 800,000
lines were fixed in the countryside in the first six months of
this year, almost doubling the figure in the urban areas in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
To promote information exchange of the rural areas with outside
world and push their economic development, Zhejiang has over
recent years stressed telecommunications networks construction in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Through strengthening telecommunications infrastructure, the
province has realized the goal that optical cables stretched to
all the townships in 1997 and every village could have access to
telephones in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the higher growth rate of telephone installation
in rural areas than in cities, the telephone-possessing rate for
rural families is drawing close to that in cities.

<P>
In her speech, which was released by the Prime Minister's
Office here Friday, Helen Clark noted disarmament and arms control
are a major foreign policy priority for New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at ways of developing the concept of a southern
hemisphere free of nuclear weapons, as a further step towards a
nuclear-weapan-free world," she said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said disarmament and arms control are
processes that must constantly be pushed and in the processes, her
country can and should continue to play a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear, however, that New Zealand's pushing alone will
not be enough. Other countries must fulfill their commitments to
the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. There will need to
be more of the bold steps that New Zealand took in the mid-1980s.
We need public opinion world-wide mobilized again," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the abolition of nuclear weapons will come
within reach when the tide of international opinion turns
decidedly against any role for nuclear weapons," the prime
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Rampant in Western U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 wildfires that
have scorched more than 700,000 acres of land are still burning in
11 U.S. western states, injuring firefighters, forcing hundreds of
evacuations, creating a haze that shrouded mountains and deserts,
according to local press reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Four firefighters suffered second-degree burns Wednesday as the
wind suddenly shifted while they were fighting against one of
several big blazes that have blackened some 83,000 acres of
California timber and bushes. Two of them were hospitalized and
remained in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, California firefighters made big gains against a
giant fire burning atop the southern Sierra Nevada, and
California's biggest blaze, which had burned 72,200 acres in
Sequoia National Forest on the east side of the Southern Sierra,
was 40 percent contained.
</P>
<P>
August is traditionally the worst month for wildfires which are
a natural part of the ecosystems of the western United States. The
current combination in the area of high temperatures, low humidity
and lightning unaccompanied by rain create perfect conditions for
them.
</P>
<P>
Dry lightning during the past two days sparked hundreds of new
fires, including 17 major blazes in California, Utah, Montana and
Nevada. Fires are also raging in Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, New
Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said this year's fire season could be the
worst in 30 years. They said the cost incurred in suppressing the
fires could exceed one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The federal government is spending 15 million dollars a day to
support the 20,000 civilian and military firefighters from 46
states and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Marines and the Army are providing 1,200 troops for fire
duty, and nearly 500 National Guard and Reserve troops are
involved at the request of various state governors.
</P>
<P>
In Montana, two new fires started on Wednesday evening and
burned 900 acres in the southwestern part of the state. Eleven
other blazes have burned at least 131,100 acres. Throughout the
state, residents have been evacuated from more than 300 homes.
</P>
<P>
A fire sparked by lightning burned 4,000 acres and forced
evacuations in southwest Reno, Nevada. But firefighters said
Wednesday that improving weather overnight let them contain 65
percent of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
Utah firefighters are battling against nearly 55,000 acres of
wildfires, including six that have consumed more than 48,000 acres
in the Fishlake National Forest, as they await reinforcements from
the state National Guard. Crews have contained about 30 percent of
the Fishlake inferno.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck toured the Idaho and
Montana fire lines to review the safety of fire crews and pledged
that they will be given adequate resources.
</P>
<P>
Canadian firefighters are on the lines, and resources have been
stretched so thin that federal officials were considering bringing
in crews from Mexico and technical experts from Australia.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 62,000 wildfires have been reported across the nation
this year, scorching more than 3.7 million acres, the highest
total since at least the mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Southwest Airlines Fires Two Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Southwest Airlines has
fired the pilot and the co-pilot of a Boeing 737 that crashed
through a fence in March on landing in Burbank, California, in the
carrier's worst accident, the airline said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Southwest Airlines spokesman, Ed Stuart, declined to name the
pilot and the co-pilot, or to specify on what grounds they were
dismissed, saying the causes of the accident were part of an
ongoing investigation by the U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB).
</P>
<P>
Their contracts "were terminated as a result of what we
uncovered in our investigation," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal came after the company completed an internal
investigation of the March 5 crash of Flight 1455, the first major
accident in the low-fare carrier's 29-year history.
</P>
<P>
The flight from Las Vegas, carrying 142 passengers and crew,
overshot the runway at Burbank Airport, ran through a chain link
fence and across a six-lane road before stopping just short of the
fuel pumps of a gas station.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people were hurt, including the pilots, but no one was
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association filed a grievance
after the sacking, which were effective on July 17, a spokeswoman
for the association said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the plane made its final descent into
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport at such a steep angle that a
cockpit warning system went off, and it was going 208 mph (333
kilometers per hour) at touchdown when it should have been going
around 161 mph (258 kilometers per hour).
</P>
<P>
Safety board officials said the captain, a 12-year Southwest
Airlines veteran with 18,000 flight hours, was at the plane's
control during the landing. The co-pilot was hired by the company
in 1996 and had been flying for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Southwest Airlines, the seventh largest air carrier of the
United States, has not had a fatality in its 30-year history.

<HEADLINE> Population of Chinese Sturgeons Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The population of the Chinese
sturgeon, one of the oldest vertebrates in the world considered to
be at risk of extinction, has grown, thanks to the successful
artificial breeding technology.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 human-bred sturgeon samplings have been
released to the major rivers in south China including the Yangtze
and Pearl rivers over the past two years. They were born in a
dozen breeding farms for Chinese sturgeons in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the giant panda, the endangered fish species has a
fairly high reproductive ability, according to Wei Qiwei, a
research fellow with the China Association of Fishery Sciences. A
mature sturgeon can spawn 630,000 eggs.
</P>
<P>
China has developed an advanced artificial breeding technology
of the Chinese sturgeon, which can increase the eggs' incubation
rate to 95 percent, from one percent in natural condition.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Receives 19.11 Bln U.S. Dollars of Remittances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has earned over 19.11
billion U.S. dollars of remittances from expatriates serving
abroad till June 2000, according to the statistics of the Bureau
of Manpower, Employment and Training released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 3 million people have managed their livelihoods
abroad, mainly in the Middle East countries, since beginning of
foreign employment for Bangladeshi citizens in 1976, the
statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Of the Bangladeshi people doing jobs in different countries in
the world, more than 0.11 million are professional workers, 0.88
million are skilled workers, 0.63 million are semi-skilled workers
and 1.27 million people are unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
The country earned the highest amount of remittance from non-
resident Bangladeshi people in 1999, amounting to 1.9 billion
dollars. More than 0.26 million people were expatriated to
different countries around the globe that year.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the single largest country where the maximum
number of Bangladeshi people work. More than 1.35 million people
representing 45.07 percent of the total expatriates have found
jobs in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the second largest country employing Bangladeshis
whose number stood over 0.38 million representing 12.81 percent of
the total number of expatriates.
</P>
<P>
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are in third and fourth
positions with over 0.34 million and 0.30 million people
respectively working there.
</P>
<P>
Besides, significant numbers of Bangladeshis went to Qatar,
Iraq, Libya, Bahrain, Oman, South Korea, Singapore and Brunei in
search of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many Bangladeshis are working in the United States, Briton,
Italy, Canada and some other European countries.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt to Assess Status of Dengue Prevalence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is going
for a scientific study to assess the current status of dengue
prevalence and its type in Dhaka city, The Daily Star reported
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a high-level meeting at the Health
Ministry, which was also attended by representatives from Local
Government Ministry, Dhaka City Corporation and non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The month-long study titled Integrated Approach of Prevention
and Control of Dengue in Bangladesh, began Thursday at the Dhaka
Shishu Hospital where blood samples of dengue patients are being
collected and stored.
</P>
<P>
The government is funding the study conducted by the Institute
of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) which covers
10 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Two more people died of dengue hemorrhagic fever Thursday,
bringing the total number of deaths from the dreaded disease to 17
in the city, according to hospital sources.
</P>
<P>
"We've experienced dengue fever since 1964, but it was largely
classic dengue. What really worries us is the high incidence of
dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is caused by cross infection of
two distinct types of viruses," said Dr. Alamgir, a senior
virologist at the IEDCR.
</P>
<P>
There is substantive evidence that serial infection by
different dengue viruses may increase the risk of being affected
by more serious diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Bush Accepts Nomination for Republican Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W.
Bush accepted U.S. Republican nomination for presidential
candidate at the party's National Convention here Thursday, vowing
to "change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect."
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech meant to run against Vice President Al
Gore for the White House, Bush told Republican delegates that he
would work to forge agreement on problems long stuck in
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
"We will confront the hard issues, threats to our national
security, threats to our health and retirement security, before
the challenges of our time become crises for our children," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the Clinton era as "so much promise, to no great
purpose," Bush said that "now is the time for Republicans and
Democrats to end the politics of fear and save Social Security
together."
</P>
<P>
Bush's appearance before 2,066 Republican delegates and
thousands of party activists who packed the convention hall was
his first major challenge on his way to the White House and last
act of a four-day political drama.
</P>
<P>
Bush's speech included a call to reform public schools,
strengthen social security, modernize Medicare as well as add a
prescription drug benefit, rebuild the military and provide tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that if he is elected president of the United States,
he will deploy missile defenses to "guard against attack and
blackmail" at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of education, Bush said: "Now is the time to
make Head Start an early learning program, teach all of our
children to read, and renew the promise of America's public
schools."
</P>
<P>
"We are now the party of ideals and innovation... The party of
idealism and inclusion... The party of a simple and powerful hope.
My fellow citizens, we can begin again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush and his running mate, former defense secretary Dick Cheney,
are leaving Philadelphia for Pittsburgh Friday to board a train
bound for the key electoral battleground of the Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Federal Agencies To Cut Power Use In California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton
Thursday ordered federal agencies in California to cut their power
use by an estimated five percent to ease a crunch in the state's
electricity supplies because of near-record demand inspired by
broiling heat.
</P>
<P>
"Currently the supply of electrical power is tight in
California due to record demand for electricity. The state faces
rolling blackouts in some areas. These conditions put both
customers and businesses at risk," Clinton said in the order to
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
He also said federal agencies that produce or market
electricity must do what they could to increase power availability
in California.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, California Gov. Gray Davis ordered a probe into
possible market manipulation. Davis also vowed to seek to speed up
the approval process for desperately needed new power plants.
</P>
<P>
California's power emergency escalated Thursday afternoon as
scorching heat held demand near record level and some industrial
and commercial customers lost electricity for the fourth
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
The California Independent System Operator (ISO), which manages
most of California's power grid, said peak demand for electricity
Thursday afternoon was expected to reach 45,723 megawatts (MW),
close to the record 45,877 MW set on July 12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
California's power problems are rooted partly in surging demand
linked to strong economic growth in the western United States.
</P>
<P>
The state is the home of Silicon Valley, the center of the
nation's booming high-technology industry. Economists estimate
that power outages would cost companies in that region at least 75
million dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Instead of building more power plants, some experts point out
that intense heat occurs typically about 15 days a year and
building power plants just for those occasions might be a very
expensive approach.
</P>
<P>
They urge people to reduce power consumption by closing drapes
or blinds to keep out sunlight, refrain from opening refrigerators,
cook and do laundry during off-peak hours and use fans instead of
air conditioners.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Mark Philippoussis
has hit back at his teammates and critics who condemned him for
withdrawing from last month's Davis Cup semifinal against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis cited a long Wimbledon campaign and a knee injury
for pulling out of the Australian team the weekend before
Australia chalked up a perfect 5-0 win over Brazil in Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old player said in a statement released on Friday,
he had to take his physical conditions into consideration and he
was surprised and disappointed at his teammates' words.
</P>
<P>
But Australian captain John Newcombe plus singles players
Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt have expressed that they don't expect
any change to the lineup for the Davis Cup final against Spain
from December 8th to 10th in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis said he respected that decision and wished the
team luck.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 U.S. Open finalist lifted Australia to its 27th Davis
Cup title last year with two critical singles victories in the 3-2
win against France in Nice.
</P>
<P>
He returned for the opening match of the defense against
Switzerland in February, winning the deciding fifth match to break
a 2-2 deadlock and ensure Australia advance to the quarterfinal
against Germany.

MANILA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rose to 4.2 percent in July against 3.9 percent in June,
driven by higher inflation in food and services, the government
said Friday
</P>
<P>
The latest inflation figure brought the January-July average to
3.6 percent, still well below the government's 5-6 percent goal

the earlier reported 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year inflation in July last year stood at 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Food, beverages and tobacco and services contributed mainly to
the increase in the year-on-year inflation rate," the government
agency said.

Month-on-month inflation, however, decelerated slightly to 0.5
percent in July from 0.7 percent in June, the NSO said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Endemic Mangroves Face Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Rizophora, a mangrove species
endemic to Sri Lanka, is on the verge of extinction, according to
a latest report by the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The report said Rizophora on the southwestern coat of Sri Lanka
has almost disappeared due to the clearance of mangrove areas to
make ponds to raise fish and prawns.
</P>
<P>
"Mangrove forests have been cut for fodder, timber, firewood,
production of charcoal, cultivation and land reclamation. These
have attributed to their alarming reduction," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that about a million hectares of mangrove
forests have been converted to aquaculture ponds all over the
world and the genus Rizophora is becoming rare on the southwestern
coast of Sri Lanka and the eastern coast of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Mangroves cover nearly 24 million hectares all over the world,
of which a third occurs in the Asia-Pacific region. But widespread
clearance has led to mass destruction of this valuable flora.
</P>
<P>
The report cited mangrove areas as a particularly important
ecosystem, providing vital feeding and nursery grounds for prawns
and fish while protecting the coastal areas from erosion. They act
as a buffer against tidal current, flood and storm, it said.
</P>
<P>
It warned that since mangroves forms an indispensable link in
the aquatic ecosystem, it is extremely important to protect the
mangrove cover and that neglect to do so could seriously break
down the functions of this vital link.

BANGKOK, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Road accidents in Bangkok have
fallen by 43 percent after a year-long police campaign against
drunk driving, and the number of damaged wire poles has dropped
accordingly, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai traffic police chief Adul Saengsingkaew was quoted as
saying that there were 21,411 road accidents reported in the
capital from June 1999 to May this year, a 43.68 percent drop from

<HEADLINE> Two Thirds of Austrians Against Referendum on EU Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- A new poll result showed that
about 67 percent Austrians opposed holding a referendum to force
the other 14 EU states to lift political sanctions against the
country, the Austria Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Only 25 percent people inquired welcomed the referendum
scheduled for this autumn, while more than 60 percent considered
the plan as "an absolute nonsense".
</P>
<P>
The referendum plan was approved by Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel and far-rightist Joerg Haider in early July, after other
EU governments froze political contacts with Austria because of
Haider's Freedom Party's entry into the government in February.
</P>
<P>
Haider, governor of Carinthia and a figure Austria's EU
partners view as racist and unfit for government, has resigned as
the leader of the party but remains as a political guru.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that 74 percent of Austrians wanted their
country to stay in the EU, although 49 percent of Austrians were
angered by the EU's sanctions. Austrians' attitude toward the EU's
eastern enlargement seems even more positive.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous employee working for the poll explained the reason
of the contradictions, saying that "although Austrians like to
grumble, they are true realistic opportunists".
</P>
<P>
Last year, trade volumes with central and east European
countries accounted for 9.7 percent and 15 percent of Austria's
total foreign trade, respectively. Austria has thus gained
thousands of job opportunities and registered a trade surplus of
31.3 billion Schilling (22.8 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> IMF, W.Bank Urge Bosnian Serbs to Take Swift Action to Improve Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank Thursday urged the Bosnian Serb
authorities to take swift action to improve the republic's
flagging economy, otherwise future economic assistance from
international financial institutions could be affected.
</P>
<P>
Bruno De Sacen, IMF representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Thursday said in Banja Luka that the budget deficit of the Serbs'
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegoniva may have reached up to about 200
million German marks (90 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
To solve the imbalance, the Serb government must take actions
against peculation and graft and also fight against rampant
smuggling, Bruno advised.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling in cigarettes alone last year resulted in 200
million German marks (90 million dollars) worth of losses for the
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a World Bank official based in Bosnia-Herzegovina
also urged the Bosnian Serb government to take measures to ensure
workers and pensioners receive their pay properly and on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The two financial organizations warned that if the government
failed to improve its economic conditions, their future economic
assistance and loans to the republic would be in doubt.

was only 0.92 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has been attaching great importance to
providing professional, technical and continuing education for
women.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 1999, Hope Project, initiated by the China Youth
Development Fund in 1989 to help dropout children to resume
schooling, had aided the construction of 7,812 primary schools,
with 2.29 million dropouts in the poverty-stricken areas returning
to schools and half of whom were female children.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a special project for female dropouts funded by
the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) has helped over 900,000
female children go back to school since 1989.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chinese women are assuming active roles in
many cutting-edge scientific fields, ranging from microelectronics
to satellite launching.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Engineering and the Chinese Academy of
Sciences now have 70 women academicians, accounting for 6 percent
of the total academicians. The ratio is believed higher than that
in other countries.

<HEADLINE> City Dwellers Enjoy More Spare Time: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- City dwellers in China are
enjoying more spare time now thanks to decreased time spent on
work and housework, the Beijing-based Guangming Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, the average spare time for the urban
Chinese has increased by 64 minutes, while the time spent on
routine work has shrinked by 114 minutes, according to an academic
survey carried out by a professor from the People's University of
China.
</P>
<P>
Spare time almost made up one third of the life of an ordinary
Chinese, while the work time only accounts for a mere 10 percent,
the survey found.
</P>
<P>
However, half of the spare time of the city dwellers was spent
before the TV sets. The time spent on TV watching soared to three
hours and 38 minutes, doubling that of ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
How to properly arrange one's spare time is a challenge for not
only the individuals but also the nation as a whole, Guangming
noted.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the time the average Japanese and
Americans spent on watching TV were just one hour and 37 minutes,
and two hours and 14 minutes, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to those countries, our way of dealing with spare
time seems too monotonous," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, that also means that the prospects for China to
develop industries of recreation and traveling are fairly bright,
the paper added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese periodicals are striving
for more market share by shortening publishing periods and linking
themselves with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Readers, one of China's most popular magazine with a monthly
circulation of over five million, has added two urban editions and
one rural edition aiming at some 80 percent of country's
population, the Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Its editing authorities said that the average monthly
circulation of the magazine has reached 5.2 million, a growth of
60 percent compared with that last year. The magazine is also
planning to launch an electronic edition on the web next year, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many publishing houses in localities kicked
off new magazines, most of them featuring entertainment and life-
style, for earning profits.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that of the country's 566 publishing houses,
164 run their own magazines. And more than one fourth of their
income from running magazines in many publishing houses, the
newspaper noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Divided Over Whether to Sign Pre-nuptial Agreement: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese are almost evenly divided
over whether couple to marry should sign pre-nuptial agreement to
avoid legal disputes if they divorce, a recent survey covering 10
provinces on the revision of the Marriage Law shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by All-China Women's Federation, found
that 57.4 percent out of the 4,000 respondents believe signing the
document would bring negative emotional effect to their impending
marriage life, if they still would take the oath.
</P>
<P>
Of those surveyed, 48.1 percent were men, 51.9 percent women.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese custom, the mere mention of divorce in
time of marriage is a bad omen, and thus pre-nuptial agreement
with a unlucky implication used to be rather sensitive to people
planning to tie the knot.
</P>
<P>
However, as they are becoming ever more wealthy, they turned to
more concerned with their personal possessions, and would worry
others might be trying to share their fortunes through marriage,
the survey report says.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows 42.6 percent respondents said antemarital
property should be notarized,.
</P>
<P>
Before China took the reform and opening up policy in 1979,
Chinese held little money after life-supporting expenditures, let
pre-nuptial agreement be, the survey report explained.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed only 36 percent rural respondents
favor the property notarization, while the urban supporters
reached 49.3 per cent.
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of the ACWF officials, much more middle-income
people favor the notarization than high-income or low-income
respondents.
</P>
<P>
The survey report also suggests that the increase of divorce
and disputes out of it also contributes to people's inclination to
pre-nuptial agreements.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of divorce cases increased by
an annual rate of 9.08 percent in the last 20 years, reaching to 1.
199 million in 1999, with the majority of which involved property
disputes.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President: Foreign Role seen in Muluku Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said that foreigners have been involved in the protracted
communal bloodshed in the country's North Maluku and Maluku
provinces which has killed thousands of people, leading newspapers
here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Making a statement in Kutai, East Kalimantan province Thursday,
the president said that at least two foreign parties are involved
in the 18-month long conflict in the two provinces, the Indonesian
Observer daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"They were planting their influences in the two provinces,"
Wahid was quoted as saying, but he did not identify the names of
the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed a prolonged
communal bloodshed involving Muslims and Christians in which
thousands of lives were claimed while thousands of others were
forced to seek refuge in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The central government has declared that the two provinces were
closed to outsiders and imposed a civilian emergency and a curfew
there.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no sign that the bloodshed is about to finish.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another report said that the United Nations has
established what it said as "a U.N. Resource Center" in Ambon,
capital of Maluku Province. The center will become a base camp for
a mixed U.N. team from different backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
The Observer quoted a press statement released by the U.N.
Development Program (UNDP) as saying that the establishment of the
center came after the U.N. and the Indonesian government discussed
the U.N. mission in various parts of Maluku.
</P>
<P>
The mission, which consists of staff from the humanitarian unit
at the world body such as the UNDP, the U.N. Children's Fund (
UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) is aimed at supporting local and international
efforts to address humanitarian needs in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Indonesian government has strongly opposed any
possible foreign intervention in the Maluku's conflict, but said
it may open to the humanitarian aid as well as infrastructure
relief.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Customs Duties Income Drops Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar received 861.75 million U.
S. dollars from customs duties in the fiscal year 1999-2000, which
ended in March, a drop of 0.1 percent from the previous year,
according to the latest figures released by the country's Central
Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
The main source of Myanmar's customs duties income comes from
import through normal trade and border trade.
</P>
<P>
Of the customs duties income obtained in 1999-2000, that from
import through normal trade amounted to 746.38 million dollars,
accounting for 86.6 percent of the total, while that from import
through border trade was 114.5 million dollars, representing 13.28
percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar made relatively large adjustments to
the rate of customs duties. One of these is that to promote the
development of its agriculture, the Myanmar government exempted
import duties on agricultural implements, pesticide, improved
varieties and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar mainly trades with Singapore, China, Thailand, Japan,
Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea, having border trade with

competition, such as counterfeiting of trade marks. The value of
such offenses almost doubled the figure of the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, local administrations also cracked
down on 1,879 smuggling cases, with goods implicated valued at 640
million yuan (88.7 million U.S. dollars), a slight drop from the
same period last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Urban Heat Islands Simmering Big Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua)-- " Urban heat islands" are
simmering big cities and to be blamed for the skyrocketing
temperatures, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the traditional evils of vehicle emissions and
heat from kitchen ranges, the scorching days in big cities can be
attributed to the reflections from glass-fronted buildings.
</P>
<P>
"Glass fronts on high buildings contribute greatly to the hot
weather because they reflect sunlight and create both light and
heat pollution," said Li Yanfu, an engineer with the Beijing
Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
A survey was done at 2:30 pm on July 25 in a popular shopping
area in Beijing, where many buildings with glass fronts stand side
by side.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that temperature in the reflection area was
38 C while the unreflected area was 37.4 C, and in the nearby
shade of trees, it was only 35.8 C.
</P>
<P>
With no regulations to curb the construction of buildings with
glass fronts, China has seen increasing number of complaints about
light and heat pollution caused by the shining buildings in recent
years, sources from environmental protection departments said.
</P>
<P>
To ease the pressure on environment, the most important thing
is to plant more trees and grass in downtown areas to replace high
buildings, according to Lian Kaiming, a professor from the Qinghua
University.

<HEADLINE> Silver Iodide Used to Improve Rainfall Outside of Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have succeeded in
increasing rainfalls in Beijing's Miyun County simply by burning
silver iodide in a gas stove at the top of a mountain.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Huanyong, a senior engineer with the county's
meteorological bureau and his colleagues climbed to a mountain top,
800 meters above the sea level in Miyun County Wednesday morning
and burned silver iodide for more than four hours till it began to
rain in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The method has worked well and we got 20 mm of precipitation
north of the Miyun Reservoir and 64 mm of precipitation in the
northeast part of the county," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
He explained that when the smog produced by the boiled silver
iodide enter the cloud, it will have chemical reaction with vapor
in the cloud and help increase the precipitation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Beijing has used such a method to
increase rain, said Zhang Qiang. He said if the method continues
to prove successful, it will be widely used in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, another group of experts failed to use
airplanes to increase rainfall in Changping County because of
thunder and lighting.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Navy Ends High Sea Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 3 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian navy ended a 17-day
standoff on the high seas off Newfoundland Thursday by boarding
and escorting the GTS Katie cargo ship toward the Gulf of St.
Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian navy began boarding the Katie on order of the
government of Canada," and then two navy ships were escorting the
ship to the Canadian coast, military spokesman Daryl Morrell said
in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
The action followed Wednesday's ultimatum by the Canadian
government that the owner of the ship, the U.S.-based Third Ocean
Marine Navigation, accept an offer of 90,000 Canadian dollars (60,
800 U.S. dollars) as a first step to end the dispute that delayed
the docking of Canadian military equipment in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Third Ocean rejected the offer, insisting on an initial
agreement of payment of 190,000 Canadian dollars (128,350 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company also claims that the Montreal-based Andromeda
Navigation owes it 294,000 Canadian dollars (198,600 dollars) for
transporting about 580 army vehicles and 390 sea containers with
munitions from Kosovo to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Peter Margan of the Third Ocean said late Thursday that the
National Defense Department of Canada is now brokering the
negotiations between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
"There are negotiations going on, but there's no update just
yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Katie has been circling in international waters off the
coast of Newfoundland since mid-July, when it was due in Montreal
with a treasure-trove of Canadian military equipment worth 223
million Canadian dollars (151 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> 7,000-Year-Old Site Discovered in Three Gorges </HEADLINE>

<P>
CHONGQING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered a site dating back to 7,000 years ago in the Three
Gorges on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
They said that this is the first time a Neolithic site at its
early stage was found in Chongqing Municipality and Sichuan
Province on the upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
A large number of stone, bone and pottery tools and vessels
have been unearthed in Fengdu City, inscribed with simple patterns.
</P>
<P>
The relics are believed to have relations with prehistoric
cultures in the middle reaches of the Yangtze. The finding
overthrew the conclusion that cultures in the upper and lower
reaches of the Yangtze were isolated.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists guess that the Three Gorges once served as a
cultural link between tribes in different regions in ancient times.

<HEADLINE> Type Specimen Discovered in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A group of scientists from China,
Australia, Britain and Germany have recently discovered a number
of type specimen that had remained unknown for more than a century
in Shanghai Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
These specimen are all mammal bones, including a boar skull, a
roe deer skull and a bear skull.
</P>
<P>
A species has only one type specimen, which acts as the object
of reference in species classification.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have confirmed the newly discovered type
specimen were made by a French scholar surnamed Heude, who
discovered these mammal species in India, Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia in mid-1900s.
</P>
<P>
These type specimen, along with another 20,000 specimen of
other animals, had been kept in the Heude Museum, predecessor of
Shanghai Museum of Natural History, one of China's largest museums.
</P>
<P>
They had not come to light until three scientists from Britain,
Germany and Australia read about the type specimen in a natural
history book by Heude in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The scientists then joined their Chinese counterparts and
sorted out these rare specimen from a collection of some 240,000
items in Shanghai Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
"These specimen are priceless because man has discovered nearly
all mammal species on earth and it's almost impossible to obtain a
new mammal type specimen, " said Zhang Nianshi, an expert on
mammal specimen with the museum.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Museum of Natural History now boasts more than 900
type specimen.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Philosopher to Give Lecture at Confucian Temple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese philosopher Tang Yijie
will step to a rostrum that has been fallen into disuse for
thousands of years at the Temple of Confucius (B.C.551-B.C.479) in
Qufu of east China's Shandong Province this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tang, also vice chairman of China Society of Confucius, will
discuss global issues ranging from rational development of the
nature, peaceful sharing of resources, to rescuing the mankind
from spiritual crisis in his lecture entitled "Thoughts in Pursuit
of Global Ethics".
</P>
<P>
Tang will take the style of Confucius, who was said to lecture
3,000 disciples while being seated at the rostrum inside the
Temple of Confucius, which was put onto the UNESCO World Heritage
List in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tang's lecture giving will be televised by Hunan Provincial
Satellite Television Station, sources from the TV service said.
The event is part of the program "2000 Forum" launched by the
station.
</P>
<P>
Previously, a number of other Chinese specialists or overseas
scholars of Chinese origin, including Charles Zhang, President of
Sohu. Com, a Chinese website portal, and Chinese economist Fan
Gang were also invited to give lectures at renowned Yuelu Academy
based in Changsha, capital of Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Confucius was a great thinker, philosopher and educator who
lived in the late Spring and Autumn Period (B.C.770-B.C. 476). He
set up a sort of private school -- the earliest in Chinese history.
He taught all who came to learn from him, bringing education to
the ordinary people and breaking the monopoly of education by the
nobility.  He also founded Confucianism.

<HEADLINE> Open-end Funds to Revive Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- China's securities authorities
are considering plans to allow open-end investment funds to trade
on its stock market in the near future to boost business,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing for the launch of open-end investment funds
because they would be more efficient at activating the stock
market and more attractive to investors," the English-language
paper quoted Tu Guangshao, secretary-general of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But a concrete date for such a launch depends on the
development of the market," Tu said.
</P>
<P>
Open-end investment funds will allow more people to get
involved in the market, as opposed to close-end funds which
restrict involvement.
</P>
<P>
Tu's words were echoed by Anthony Francis Neoh, the chief
adviser of CSRC, who confirmed the watchdog for China's securities
industry was now drafting the detailed rules for the launch of
such funds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of the funds would help improve
market transparency and the structure of China's stock market.
</P>
<P>
Open-end funds, which have already dominated the world's fund
market, have not yet arrived on the Chinese market, which is
controlled by more than 20 nascent close-end funds.
</P>
<P>
Tu also said that the commission would allow experienced
foreign fund management firms to form partnerships and joint
ventures with their Chinese counterparts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has primarily shaped the
bio-medicine base which is full of high-tech pharmaceutical
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
All the enterprises in the Zhangjiang High-tech Industrial Park,
in the Pudong New District, reached productive value worth of 2.4
billion yuan (290 million U.S. dollars) in 1999, with a 50 percent
rise compared with that in 1998, Wenhui Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 pharmaceutical internationals, such as Roche,
Smith-Kline Beecham (SB) Pharmaceutical Corporation, 999
Enterprise Group and others, have invested more than 2.5 billion
yuan into their affiliated plants in the industrial park.

<HEADLINE> Experts Suggest Heritage Research Institute in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A relics expert in Shanghai
recently suggested that the country's most populous metropolis
have its own research center for ancient cultures.
</P>
<P>
Although lots of cultural ruins have been unearthed and the
city is abundant with academic force, Shanghai lacks systematic
research on its history and traditional culture, which was dated
back to about 5,000 years ago, Cai Dafeng, a local archaeologist,
said.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered Guangfulin cultural ruins are big and
valuable enough to compare with the well-known Songze and Maqiao
heritage ruins, both in suburban Shanghai, according to a report
in Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
To become an international metropolis, Shanghai must remain its
unique cultural features and it needs a specialized research organ
to promote its cultural atmosphere and academic level, said Zhang
Minghua, associate professor with the Cultural Relics Preservation
Committee of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that Shanghai is also a birthplace of remote
Chinese civilization along the Yangtze River, with treasured
heritage sites of Songze, Fuquanshan, Maqiao and Guangfulin, the
Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Cai, also a professor at Fudan University, said that Shanghai
has strong economic strength and academic force for establishing
such kind of institution.

<HEADLINE> Business as Brisk as Usual in Shanghai Bars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Business is as brisk as usual in
Shanghai bars this summer, despite more people prefer stay home
all night surfing on the net.
</P>
<P>
Neon lit up every Shanghai bar street -- Hengshan Road,
Xiangyang Road, Yandong Road and Shaoxin Road, all jammed with
youngsters whose hair styles are as fashionable as their dresses.
</P>
<P>
"It is a place just for relaxation and relieving feelings, why
not come here?" said a university teacher, who was reluctant to
give his name.
</P>
<P>
Bars in Shanghai sprang out over night several years ago. They
were first venues for foreigners and white-collar Chinese working
in foreign-invested companies, but now they entertain all kinds of
people.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai bars have always been cool, offering not only beverage
and rock'n'roll but also other things.
</P>
<P>
For example, there is a cloth bar on Guangyuan road, which
provides antique sewing machines for funs of dress making. "It is
trendy for young people to weave something with their own hands,"
said a client.
</P>
<P>
Yanghua, a clerk of the bar, said that most of her clients are
weaving the colorful cloth as gifts for their boy friends.
</P>
<P>
"Swordplay Bar", decorated with huge pictures of Zorro, a
French Robinhood, and princess Harmlet, has something special -- a
place for hero admirers.
</P>
<P>
People come here for due, and the bar provides them with a
platform and fleurets. The fights always end in happiness in
accordance with the spirits of the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
"We had thought that the place was boys' favorite, but to my
astonishment, more girls prefer it," said the bar's boss.
</P>
<P>
Although some bars were reported to have been involved in drug
abuse and prostitution, and a vice crackdown is being carried out,
Shanghai authorities say most of the bars are providing legal
service.

<HEADLINE> Ecology of China's Largest Urban Wetland Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of ducks and
gulls have returned to the Lhalu Wetland in southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region as ecological environment has been greatly
improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The wetland, covering 6.2 square kilometers meters near Lhasa
City with an elevation of 3,645 meters, is considered as the
largest wetland in China's urban districts. Over 95 percent of the
wetland is covered with grass and other plants.
</P>
<P>
The wetland produces oxygen all day long, which is quite
valuable for Lhasa, an oxygen-deficient highland city. It also
plays important role in sucking up suspending dust and maintaining
underground water level.
</P>
<P>
However, the area of the wetland has shrunk from 10 sq. km. in
the 1960s to present 6.2 sq. km. due to construction of new houses,
fish ponds and crop cultivation in the past three decades. Some
parts of the wetland have been dried up. Wildlife and fish species
were reduced. Over 5,000 heads of sheep and cattle nibbled grass
on the wetland.
</P>
<P>
To curb ecological deterioration, the government of Lhasa
issued a regulation on protecting Lhalu Wetland last April and
allocated 100 million yuan for its protection.
</P>
<P>
Business operations and construction are banned on the wetland.
Over 75,000 pine and willow have been planted around the wetland.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Fuel Supply to Be Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The continuing running-short of
fuel supply in Nigeria will be much improved with the re-
production of the Port Harcourt Refinery in the oil-rich Delta
state following a turn-around maintenance, a senior government
official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said the Port Harcourt
Refinery, currently under production at 91 percent installed
capacity, would be fully operational by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The re-production would ease off the fuel shortage in eastern
parts of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said the importation of fuel would
continue until all refineries go into full operation.
</P>
<P>
He called on his fellow Nigerians to be patient because the
turn-around maintenance campaign being effected in the country's
refineries needs to be done properly.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to oil-producing communities to assist the
NNPC to arrest the pipeline vandalization by enlightening the
people on the risks concerned.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the biggest oil-producing country in Africa with a
daily output of over 2 million barrels, but it has to depend on
the importation of fuel to meet the domestic market because of the
collapse of three of the country's four refineries.

<HEADLINE> UNAMSIL Asks for More Troops in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Missions in
Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) has asked for more troops as quickly as
possible to strengthen the peacekeeping missions in the war-torn
west African country, a report reaching here on Friday said.
</P>
<P>
Vijay Jetley, commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in
Sierra Leone, was quoted as saying on Thursday that the situation
there is currently under UNAMSIL's control, but it is still tense.
</P>
<P>
He said he needs "many more" troops to bolster defenses against
heavily-armed rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and
push forward the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 13,000 personnel in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL is
already the biggest peacekeeping operation in the world ever
launched by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Following the abduction of about 500 U.N. peacekeepers by the
RUF in May this year, the United Nations Security Council resolved
to enlarge the force of UNAMSIL to 16,500 to help the Sierra Leone
government regain territory still controlled by the RUF.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Start Deploying Peacekeepers Throughout Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since
it was established 22 years ago, the United Nations Interim Force
in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is now able to implement Security Council
Resolution 425 by deploying throughout southern Lebanon, a U.N.
spokesman said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. deputy Spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said the green
light for expanded deployment of the Force was given by Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud to U.N. Force Commander Major General Seth
Kofi Obeng this morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers will start the final phase of their
deployment along the Lebanese-Israeli border on Saturday, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a historical moment for UNIFIL that after nearly 22
years it is able to implement United Nations Security Council
Resolution 425 of 1978," Silva said.
</P>
<P>
"The troops, supported by the Force Mobile Reserve, will move
to more than 20 new positions in villages and along the Blue Line,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers should have been deployed in southern
Lebanon 10 days ago. The deployment did not began until last
Friday due to the new Israeli violations of its border with
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced the complete withdrawal of its troops from
southern Lebanon on May 24 which ended its 22-year-long occupation
of the area.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line was drawn by the United Nations to verify Israel
's complete withdrawal of troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According the United Nations, the expanded deployment will
involve about 800 troops, with 35-40 peacekeepers occupying each
position. Currently, about 150 troops are deployed at six
positions along the Blue Line.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
would have 300 million dollars over three years to improve its
security at the accident-prone buildings that runs U.S. diplomacy,
U.S. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The money is to be used to implement recommendations presented
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by an expert team in May,
including a proposal to increase by 150 percent the number of
security officers employed by the department.
</P>
<P>
Under one of the 43 recommendations contained in the report,
900 new security positions -- including uniformed agents, couriers,
security engineers and technicians -- would be created to
supplement the existing 400-500 uniformed guards who patrol the
building and grounds now, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions include creating guard posts outside the
State Department's headquarters for identification checks and bag
searches and instituting thorough checks of cars that park in the
building's underground garage.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the spending plan has not passed through all
State Department procedures and has not gone to Congress, which
would have to approve the spending.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has been tightening security gradually for
more than a year.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Rwanda, Others to Pull Out of D.R. Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- France Friday urged Rwanda and
other countries involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo to pull their troops out of the country, after Uganda
announced that it is pulling out its troops.
</P>
<P>
"France takes note of the announcement on the pullout of the
Ugandan battalion, which the observers of the Mission of the
United Nations are yet to confirm. France calls on Rwanda, then
the other countries militarily present in the Democratic Republic
of Congo to make the same gesture in their turn," said French
Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Bernard Valero.
</P>
<P>
In its Resolution 1304, the United Nations Security Council
calls on all the foreign countries involved in the war in Congo to
pull out their troops and foresees the deployment of a
peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda support the two rival rebel groups while
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia support the government forces of
President Laurent-Desire Kabila since a civil war broke out in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
France also wishes that Kabila will support and guarantee the
deployment of a 5,500-man United Nations peacekeeping force in his
country, including the capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels, supported by Ugandan and Rwandan troops,
now control the northern and eastern parts of the country, while
Kabila's forces and their allies control the western and southern
parts.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Extends Mandate of U.N. Force in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday voted unanimously to extend the mandate of the U.N. Mission
in Sierra Leone, called the UNAMSIL, until September 8, while U.N.
officials prepare recommendations to beef up the peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
Although UNAMSIL Commander Indian Major General Vijay Jetley
told reporters Thursday he had asked the Security Council for "
many more troops" to increase from the current authorized strength
of 13,000 troops, the council resolution did not mention the
increase.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
provide recommendations as soon as possible for restructuring and
beefing up the force.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also gives the UNAMSIL a tougher mandate to
deal with rebels violating a peace accord signed by the rebels and
government in Lome, capital of Togo, in July last year. The
UNAMSIL was sent into the war-torn country to monitor the peace
accord, which was intended to end the eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said attacks on the UNAMSIL by the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) had "revealed serious inherent
weaknesses in the mission's structure, command and control and
resources."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force is also due to "deter, and where necessary,
decisively counter the threat of RUF attack by responding robustly
to any hostile actions" or threat of imminent use of force, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The RUF, led by Foday Sankoh, violated the peace accord by
taking more than 500 U.N. soldiers hostage and surrounding 223
others for more than two months in the eastern part of the West
African country. Sankoh is currently in the government custody in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the "widespread and serious
violations" of the Lome agreement by the RUF "constitute a
breakdown of the prior generally permissive environment based on
the agreement" and predicted on the cooperation of the parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Until security conditions allow progress toward the peaceful
resolution of the conflict, "there will continue to be a threat to
UNAMSIL and the security of the state of Sierra Leone," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said that it intended to strengthen the
UNAMSIL's capability, resources and mandate and set out a number
of priority tasks. These include maintaining the security of the
Lungi and Freetown peninsulas, where the main airport and capital
are located, as well as their major approach routes.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to recommend adding several battalions,
raising the force strength to around 16,500 troops, although in a
recent report he said increasing the UNAMSIL's strength would
depend on the willingness of U.N. members to provide the necessary
well-trained, well-equipped soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Online Travel Revenues Make Up Third of All Online Sales in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Growth in consumer-directed
online travel-related sales is accelerating, presently makes up 33.
5 percent of all online consumer revenues in the United States,
according to a new report released this week.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the travel market unseated the computer hardware and
software category as the leader in total online revenue, said the
report from Internet statistics monitor eMarketer. The market will
take off from 6 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 to 12.4 billion
dollars by the end of 2000, eventually touching down at 25.2
billion dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Factors contributing to the growth include the growing
population of people buying online, the rise in individual
spending on the Internet, travel planning on the Internet enabling
the consumer to compare costs and services, the convenience
services such as electronic tickets and online reservations, and
the growing number of American travelers.
</P>
<P>
There is a large untapped market potential for online travel-
related services in Europe, Asia and Latin America, the report
said. The worldwide business-to-consumer sector of e-commerce will
rise from 30.1 billion dollars in 1999, accounting for 29 percent
of total e-commerce globally, to 187.6 billion dollars in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Higher Court Ends Pinochet's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Supreme Court
session ended at midday Friday without announcing the contents of
its decision to either revoke or confirm the appeal against the
stripping of Augusto Pinochet's congressional immunity.
</P>
<P>
Judge Marcos Libedinsky said that the court adopted an
agreement and will work in the final draft of the document.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said that the decision will be, as in normal
situations, a reasoned exposition of the law in force, "and that
obliges us to study the matter to confirm it or to revoke it, and
that necessarily takes time," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was known that the 20 lawyers of the court had stripped
Pinochet of his congressional immunity on August 2, but they had
agreed not to reveal the result before the signing of the
agreement because of the narrow margin of the vote.
</P>
<P>
In May, a Santiago court voted 13-9 to strip Pinochet, 84, of
his immunity from prosecution. Pinochet appealed against that
ruling in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, judges heard testimony from lawyers representing
the families of victims of Pinochet's 17-year rule and from
lawyers defending him.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet ousted socialist President Salvador Allende in a
bloody September 1973 coup. More than 3,000 people died or
disappeared while Pinochet was president and tens of thousands of
other Chileans fled the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the most infamous incidents of the era involved the so-
called Death Caravan, a military helicopter unit that blitzed
through northern Chile in October 1973 in search of union leaders
and left-wing supporters of Allende. At least 72 people were
killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Queen Mother became the
royal family's first centenarian on Friday and took the nation's
100th birthday salute from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
A huge crowd -- police estimated the figure topped 40,000 --
surged towards the palace gates to hail the House of Windsor's
perennially popular matriarch.
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mother expressed her gratitude to the thousands of
well-wishers who helped to mark her birthday in style.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Queen Mother said on Friday that she had
been "very touched by the warmth of the welcome she received from
the many people on the route from Clarence House and outside
Buckingham Palace".
</P>
<P>
She added that the Queen Mother "deeply appreciated the
tributes she has received from this country and around the world."
</P>
<P>
Crowds had lined the streets of central London to watch the
Queen Mother as she made a ceremonial birthday journey from her
home to the palace.
</P>
<P>
She was greeted by a rendition of Happy Birthday sung by a 40,
000-strong crowd as she stepped out onto the palace balcony.
</P>
<P>
She was joined by the Queen, her grandchildren and great-
grandchildren to look over a sea of flags, cameras and smiling
faces.
</P>
<P>
After the appearance at Buckingham Palace, the family retired
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations started when the Queen Mother left Clarence
House on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles accompanied her in an open horse-drawn carriage,
decked with flowers in her gold and blue horseracing colors, along
The Mall.
</P>
<P>
As the procession reached Buckingham Palace, the National
Anthem was played. A 41-gun salute sounded from Green Park,
coinciding with 21-gun salutes in Northern Ireland, Scotland and
Wales.
</P>
<P>
The event ran smoothly despite fears that dissident Irish
republicans might attempt to disrupt the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair joined the tributes, describing the
Queen Mother's "immense understanding, not just of the country's
history and traditions, but also this dedication and commitment
and service to others."
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mother later left Buckingham Palace and returned by
car along The Mall to Clarence House on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mother rounded off her 100th birthday celebrations
with a trip to the ballet accompanied by her two daughters on
Friday evening.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Russia
have agreed to make joint efforts in imposing additional U.S.
Security Council sanctions against Taliban-led Afghanistan for
refusing to hand over suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said Friday that the
agreement was reached when a bilateral working group on
Afghanistan met here earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Reeker said the two sides called for full implementation of a U.
N. resolution approved last November under which all member states
are required to freeze the overseas assets of Afghanistan and ban
flights owned, leased or operated by the Taliban from taking off
or landing.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that a multifaceted approach, including
diplomatic, law enforcement and other legal means, is required to
counter the "threat of international terrorism from Afghanistan
and to create conditions for the establishment of a broad-based
government in the country," Reek added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington and Moscow also condemned "Taliban's
promotion of the illicit production and trafficking of drugs in
territory under their control and the use of drug profits to
support terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Washington has accused Bin Laden of being responsible for the
August 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa.

ADDIS ABABA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Airlines (EAL) has

Bisrat Negatu, chief executive officer of the EAL, was quoted

Preliminary figures for the last fiscal year reveal that EAL's
revenue increased by only 19.5 percent while its cost rose by 23.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The commercial loss of the EAL was also attributed to the two-
year-old Ethio-Eritrean border war, during which the decrease in
the number of passengers and volume of cargo has been significant,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
During its latest round of border conflict with Eritrea between
May and June, EAL had to stop its commercial flight to northern
border cities.
</P>
<P>
The EAL official said that its running cost has also increased
remarkably due to diversion of routes for security reasons. Last
year, the EAL had to transfer its hub to Nairobi, Kenya, for a
period of time which witnessed a fierce battle between Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
According to Bisrat, his company will maintain its routes, but
refrain from introducing new ones.
</P>
<P>
The EAL, established 53 years ago, currently flies to about 50
international destinations, out of which 25 are in Africa.

<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Gunmen in south eastern Nigeria
left two oil rigs on Friday afternoon where they had held 165
workers hostage, according to reports by the multinational oil
company Royal Dutch Shell here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All the workers, who had been held hostage for the past five
days on the rigs in the Niger Delta, are safe, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The local ethnic Ijaw gunmen stormed the rigs on Monday,
demanding jobs and cash, seizing hostages included 145 Nigerians,
seven citizens from the United States, five Britons and a number
of Australians and Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The company reached an agreement with representatives of the
hostage takers on Wednesday to free the captives after their hard
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Militant youth in the Niger Delta where most of Nigeria's oil
wealth is produced frequently take foreign workers hostage in
order to draw attention to their cause for more government
allocation, demanding money or jobs.

country's National AIDS Control Council.
</P>
<P>
Meshack Ndolo, national coordinator of the council in charge of
advocacy and information, said in Kuria District in western Kenya

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
established an Emergency Electricity Coordinating Committee on the
implementation of the emergency power supply project.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Finance Minister Chris Okemo, will
oversee an emergency thermal power project of 105 megawatts, the
state-run Kenya Times newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also review and approve the decision of the
emergency power technical team and coordinate with relevant arms
of the government in the implementation of emergency power supply.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has experienced a prolonged drought which has led to the
lower levels of the dams, affecting the hydropower generation. The
country introduced power rationing last September and intensified
the rationing in early June.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has also taken a series of measures to
combat the drought and power shortage, including importing more
power from Uganda and installing emergency diesel generators.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the power rationing crisis has made the
country's economy losing 8 billion shillings (about 107 million U.
S. dollars) monthly.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army's Withdrawal From Congo Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The withdrawal of Uganda People's
Defence Forces (UPDF) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (
DRC) has been hampered by bad weather and technical problems, Army
Spokesman Phinehas Katirima told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two planes, which left the Entebbe International Airport on
Thursday to pick the second batch of soldiers, returned empty
after failing to land at the Buta airport in the northern DRC due
to the poor weather.
</P>
<P>
"The planes could not land because of the weather, they had to
come back," said Katirima.
</P>
<P>
The planes which were supposed to fly back to Buta on Friday
failed to make it again after one of them reportedly knocked a
building.
</P>
<P>
Katirima said however that the planes did not go back because
of some technical problem.
</P>
<P>
The second batch of forces or some 300 soldiers were expected
to return in Friday's aborted trip. The first batch of 450 solders
arrived at the Entebbe Airport on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The five battalions, a total of some 4,000 soldiers, were given
order in June to pull out of the DRC. They have been assembled in
Buta waiting to be flown home.
</P>
<P>
According to Katirima, the withdrawal continues until the last
soldier is flown out of Buta to the Entebbe Airport.
</P>
<P>
The return of soldiers follows the demilitarization of the
northeastern city of Kisangani, the third largest city of the DRC,
where they had been deployed. The Ugandan troops and their Rwandan
counterparts fought each other in Kisangani in May and June this
year, causing heavy civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda send their troops to the DRC to back rival
rebel factions fighting against President of the DRC Laurent
Kabila.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Popocatepetl volcano,
located in the center of Mexico, spewed Friday in two occasions
columns of steam and ashes up to 5,000 meters above its crater,
according to sources at the Disasters Prevention National Center (
Cenapred).
</P>
<P>
The Cenapred specialists said the colossus exhalations that
lasted two minutes in its most intense phase do not mean a danger
for the almost half a million people, who live on the volcano
slopes.
</P>
<P>
The yellow alert flag is kept up and people are asked not to
get more than seven kilometers from the crater, in prevention of a
sudden explosion, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
Civil Protection authorities warned of the possibility of a
rain of ashes in the next hours over the settlements close to the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
The Popocatepetl summit, 5,452 meters above sea level, is
located on the dividing line between the central states of Morelos,
Mexico, and Puebla, some 75 kilometers east of Mexico City.

PRAGUE, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's foreign exchange
reserves reached 5.97 billion U.S. dollars by August 2, an
increase of 1.59 billion dollars from that at the end of last year,
the Slovak National Bank announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the Slovak National Bank's
foreign reserves rose 516 million dollars to 3.94 billion dollars
in the same period. The foreign reserves of commercial banks
jumped by 1.08 billion dollars to 2.03 billion dollars in the
mentioned period.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts attributed the growing foreign reserves to
strong investment flows. Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest
telecommunication company, paid 1 billion euro (950 million U.S.
dollars) for a 51 percent stake in Slovak Telecom last month.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Modestly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended higher
Friday as a new unemployment report lessened the threat of more
hikes in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 61.17 at 10,767.75,
extending its gain of 19.05 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 27.48 at 3,787.
36, slipping from a gain of more than 70 points earlier in the
trading. The composite rose 101.42 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 10.37 at 1,462.93.
</P>
<P>
The market rose after the U.S. Labor Department reported that
the nation's unemployment rate held steady at 4 percent in July,
near a three-decade low. The report showed a fresh sign that the
tight job market might be easing a bit and the new data relieved
fears of more interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
The overall jobless rate touched a 30-year low of 3.9 percent
in April before rising to 4.1 percent in May and then edging back
down to 4 percent for the past two months. The Federal Reserve has
closely watched the jobless data because the extremely tight labor
market would accelerate inflation.
</P>
<P>
A stew of the recent reports indicated that the U.S. economy is
slowing after six hikes in interest rates in the past 13 months.
But last week's report showing a stronger-than-expected economic
growth of 5.2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter
renewed worries about more rate hikes among investors.
</P>
<P>
Investors believed the new jobless report today may prompt the
Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged at the August 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 6.08 at 657.79 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 1.39 at 907.97. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 4.18 at 503.63.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,727 up, 1,124 down and 506
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 943.74 million shares from 1.04 billion

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stance was expressed through a letter by its Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Wang Yingfan and addressed to
the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in response to an act by
Senegal and a very few other countries intended to include Taiwan'
s "participation" in the U.N. in the agenda of the 55th session of
the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Delivered by Wang Yingfan, the letter said such an act is not
only an flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the U.
N. Charter, but also a brazen challenge to the one-China principle
widely recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"It has severely encroached upon China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and grossly interfered in China's internal
affairs. The Chinese Government strongly condemns and firmly
opposes such an act and requests these countries to immediately
correct this illegal act, which has obstructed the lofty cause of
China's peaceful reunification," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Since China's legitimate rights were restored at the U.N. in
1971, the Government of the People's Republic of China rightfully
represents all Chinese, including 23 million Taiwanese compatriots,
in the U.N. and all its subsidiary bodies and there is simply no
such issue as the so-called "Taiwan's representation at the U.N.,"
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that more than 160 countries have established
diplomatic relations with China on the basis of one-China
principle. Since 1993 the U.N. has flatly refused to include in
the General Assembly agenda the so-called Taiwan's participation
in the U.N., and the efforts by a few countries this year are
doomed to fail as before.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the U.N. is an inter-governmental
international organization composed of sovereign states, he said.
As a province of China, Taiwan is not eligible to participate, in
whatever name and under whatever pretext, in the work or
activities of the U.N. and its specialized agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The question of Taiwan is purely an internal matter of China
and a question for the Chinese people themselves to solve, Wang
said, adding that China firmly believes that the question will
come to an appropriate solution on the basis of the policy of "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Reemphasizing China's position of peaceful reunification
through equal dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
on the basis of the one-China principle, Wang said if Taiwan
authorities really have the sincerity to get the question solved,
they should unequivocally accept the one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the new leaders of Taiwan have stuck to an
evasive and ambiguous attitude towards the one-China principle and
that the separatist moves of Taiwan authorities are the source of
tension in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The act of the handful of countries "will only serve to add
fuel to the separatist moves of the Taiwan authorities, undermine
the lofty cause of China's reunification and jeopardize peace and
security in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large. The
Chinese Government firmly opposes this," Wang declared.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the letter in absence of Annan who is on a visit to
Africa, U.N. Under-Secretary-General and Chief de Cabinet of the
Secretary-General's Executive Office Riza S. Iqbal said the U.N.'s
one-China policy is clear.

<HEADLINE> Annan Concerned at Detention of Four Foreigners by Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday voiced his concern over the detention of two
Britons and two Canadians, who were accused by Yugoslavia of
terrorism and spying, and called for their earliest release.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement issued by his spokesman here that he
"is much concerned over the detention" by the Yugoslav Army since
Tuesday of the two British members of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The two Britons are seconded to the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the statement said. "He
also expresses his concern over the detention of the two Canadian
citizens who were arrested at the same time."
</P>
<P>
"The seconded OSCE officials are members of the UNMIK mission,
" and they "are entitled to the privileges and immunities of
United Nations staff members," the statement said. "He demands
immediate access to the staff members by representatives of the
Organization."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General also calls upon the Yugoslav
authorities to honor their obligations under the Vienna Convention
on Consular Relations and grant immediate access to those detained
by representatives of the United Kingdom and Canada," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He calls for the earliest release by the Yugoslav authorities
of the detained personnel," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav army arrested the Britons with two Canadians on
Tuesday night in the area between Montenegro, a Yugoslav republic,
and Kosovo, a Serb province in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia broke off diplomatic relations with Britain in 1999
when the NATO launched 78-day unilateral air strike on the Balkan
country. Both Britain and Canada are NATO members.

Berlin, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's seasonnally-adjusted
index of manufacturing orders rose by 0.4 percent in June for the
fifth consecutive month this year, according to the Ministry of
Finance on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The continued rise is mainly attributed to foreign orders
which increased by 1.6 percent in June, while domestic orders
dipped by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures have been surprising to many economists who
expected a slump after months of surge in demand for German

Germany, which saw a weak increase of 1.5 percent in GDP, is

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges Taliban to Reverse Edict on Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday urged the Afghan warring party the Taliban to
reverse its edict barring Afghan women from working with U.N.
agencies and international non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, the largest warring party in Afghanistan, issued
an edict early last month which barred Afghan women from working
with national and foreign agencies and non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Annan, who is now in Africa for a visit,
expressed deep concern over the humanitarian impact of the edict.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief noted that these restrictions on women's
employment came at a time when Afghanistan was facing a severe
drought and an unprecedented food deficit, and were expected to
impact negatively on the aid community's ability to provide
urgently-required humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable,
particularly women and children.
</P>
<P>
Annan underscored the critical need to provide humanitarian
assistance to the Afghan population and urged the Taliban to
reconsider their position in order to avert further unnecessary
human suffering.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations began the negotiations with the Taliban on
the issue three weeks ago, hoping that the issue would be resolved
soon so as to avoid any negative impact on the provision of
humanitarian aid at such a critical moment for the Afghan people.
The country is currently suffering from one of the worst droughts
in addition to the effects of the 22 years of civil strife.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Relaxes Restrictions on Export of High-Speed Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration has
relaxed export rules for high-speed business computers in a bid to
keep the U.S. high-tech industry competitive in international
markets, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The White House's decision Thursday was the fifth time since
1993 that the government has revised upward the top speed of
computers that can be sold overseas without prior government
approval.
</P>
<P>
The revised restrictions doubles to 28,000 million theoretical
operations per second (mtops) the speed of computers that can be
exported to places including India, Pakistan, the Middle East, the
former Soviet Union, China, Vietnam and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
The new rules raises from 33,000 to 45,000 mtops the speed of
computers that can be exported to countries including those in
Africa, South Korea and Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
No prior government review is needed to export computers to
western Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand,
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Brazil. The new rules add
Argentina to this group of nations.
</P>
<P>
The government maintains its virtual embargo on computer
exports to Iraq, Iran, Libya, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, Cuba, Sudan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, the nation's top computer makers say the government's
decision Thursday is only a short-term fix that will soon become
obsolete because of the lightning speed of technological advances.
</P>
<P>
"We fully support the goal of maintaining U.S. national
security, but restricting the export of business-level computers
does not advance this goal," said Lou Gerstner, chairman of IBM
Corp. and co-chairman of the Computer Coalition for Responsible
Exports.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Sets Deadline for U.S. To Fulfill Sugar Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in compliance with the elimination of customs tariffs
agreed on in the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), said
president of the Chamber of the National Sugar and Alcohol
Industry Carlos Seoane on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sugar sector will not accept to export less than the
surplus of the sweet substance, equivalent to almost 575,000 tons,
because so far at this time, 200 million U.S. dollars worth of
sugar exports have been lost, said Seoane.
</P>
<P>
Seoane said after meeting with Commerce and Industry Minister
Herminio Blanco that the chamber will demand to stop the imports
of U.S. fructose, according to a safeguard foreseen in NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
The sugar producers position is radical because they will only
accept to export to the United States the total of their surplus,
as agreed in NAFTA, said the chamber official.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Department of Commerce representatives said the way to
solve the problem is to continue the dialogue, and that the
contacts within the parts will continue next week.
</P>
<P>
This situation has seriously damaged the Mexican sugar industry,
which produces sugarcane on 650,000 hectares and has 60 sugar
mills in 15 states of the country which give direct employment to
360,000 people and two million indirect jobs, said Seoane.
</P>
<P>
"We only demand what is just, to export all the sugar surplus,
as agreed. We insist that it must be the whole surplus of 550,000
tons," Seoane added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Asks Its Female Employees in Afghanistan to Stay Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Friday asked its female employees in Afghanistan to stay home out
of concern of their safety.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Taliban, the largest warring party in
the country, refuses to reverse its edict barring Afghan women
working with U.N. agencies and international non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the United Nations had no choice
but to caution all Afghan women directly employed by the
organization and its programme to stay at home until further
notice, for their protection.
</P>
<P>
Annan pressed the Taliban to lift the edict.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban issued an edict early last month which barred
Afghan women from working with U.N. agencies and international non-
governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations began negotiations with the Taliban three
weeks ago in an attempt to solve the issue. But no result has
yielded.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, women play a key role in
providing relief in impoverished, war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's restrictions will cause negative impact on the
provision of international humanitarian aid to the country. In
Kabul alone, an estimated one-quarter of the population of 1.8
million are dependent on aid for survival.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President To Visit OPEC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
will visit the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
member countries from Aug. 7 to 15, announced Mines and Energy
Minister Ali Rodriguezon on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will examine in those nations, in defense of the oil
prices, compliance with the agreements on the extraction of oil
adopted by the OPEC, said Rodriguez, who is OPEC president and
will accompany Chavez during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will personally invite each one of the OPEC heads of
state to attend the second summit of the organization scheduled
for the last days of September in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the OPEC has an excess production of 200,000 to
700,000 barrels per day, and the quotations that have dropped last
month from historical records will collapse by the end of the year
if the market is bloated.
</P>
<P>
The 11 OPEC nations agreed in March and June to increase their
output to stop the rise in the oil price, which went to its higher
levels of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC basket of crudes for export was quoted August 4 at 26.
12 dollars per barrel, 14 percent under the top 29.97 dollars of
the middle of June.
</P>
<P>
The experts attributed the drop in the price to reports that
Saudi Arabia, the most important producer of the OPEC,
unilaterally increased its production.
