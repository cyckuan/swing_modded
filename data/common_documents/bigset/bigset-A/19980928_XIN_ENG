<HEADLINE> High Turnout in German General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- German election officials said
that they have registered a record turnout so far in the general
elections on Sunday which were described by pollsters as the
closest one in the country's post-war era.
</P>
<P>
By 2. p.m. local time (1200 GMT), about 47 percent of the 60.5
million eligible voters have cast their ballots, the highest level
since the German reunification in 1990, officials said.
</P>
<P>
At stake is whether German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's current
centre-right ruling coalition, consisting of his CDU, its Bavarian
sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) as well as the junior
partner Free Democratic Party (FDP), would remain in power, or
whether the leftist Social Democratic Party (SPD) will take over
in alliance with the Greens after 16 years in opposition.
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling fine, but I don't want to conceal the fact that
I'm a little bit excited," said Gerhard Schroeder, SPD's
chancellor candidate, at a polling station in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who is fighting for an unprecedented fifth term in
office, also told reporters at his polling station in Ludwighafen
that he had a good mood as the moment of the truth approaching.
</P>
<P>
"We have fought a good campaign. I'm confident we'll win," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all pre-election opinion polls have pointed to a
cliffhanger vote, with Schroeder's SPD only enjoying a marginal
lead over Kohl's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Polls will be closed at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) with the
first exit polls due to be released by major German television
networks shortly afterward. However, due to Germany's complex
electoral system and the possible neck-to-neck race, the first
preliminary official results could only be expected around
midnight.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabs Clash with Police, 38 Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- violent clashes broke out
between Israeli Arabs and Israeli police Sunday over a land
dispute in north-central Israel, injuring 38, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes took place near the Arab town of Umm Al-Fahem,
30 kilometers southeast of the port city of Haifa, when police
moved in to tear down a tent erected by Arab protesters three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The protesters claimed the land was unfairly confiscated by
the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The Arab protesters threw rocks and firebombs at the
police, who responded with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine Arabs, including mayor of Umm Al-Fahem, and nine
policemen were injured.
</P>
<P>
A protester told the radio that police also fired
rubber-coated bullets and live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities have said that the disputed area, near the
northern edge of the West Bank, is within an Israeli army firing
range.
</P>
<P>
They also said that an agreement had been reached with the
residents there to nationalize about 50 hectares of land in
exchange for about six times as much land elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said they sent police to evict the protesters
after they failed to negotiate a leave on their own.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of Israel's 5.9 million population are Arabs,
living within the original boundaries of the state. Enitem

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) came clearly ahead of incumbent Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative Union parties in the general elections
Sunday and appeared to have enough votes to form the next German
government in alliance with the Greens, the first exit polls
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary projections broadcast by the German ZDF
television network immediately after the close of the polls put
the SPD at 41 percent, six percentage points ahead of Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party,
the Christian Social Union (CSU), which came at only 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The projections put the SPD's possible allies, the Greens, and
Kohl's junior partner, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), both at
6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which grew out of the
East German communist party, received 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The projections point to the end of the Kohl era. Kohl has been
German chancellor since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Due to Germany's complex electoral system, the first official
preliminary results were expected at around midnight (2200 GMT).

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Iran not to Threaten with Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has warned Iran not to threaten Israel with its
Shihab (Meteor)-3 ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the warning at a meeting of Knesset (Parliament)
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai noted that Israel has been monitoring the Shihab
project for some time and Israel has the capability to defend its
territory and residents, and to deter Iran from doing anything
against the Jewish country.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai stressed that the anti-missile Arrow defense system,
which is developing under the support of the U.S., together with
other defense approaches will provide the country with a solution
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's words came after Iran formally unveiled its
Shihab-3 missiles during a military parade on Friday. The newly
developed weapon has a range of 1,300 kilometers, which means it
is capable of reaching Israel and the U.S. military bases in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said Saturday that Iran
will develop a new missile that will outdistance medium-range
Shihab-3.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Knesset member Ephrain Sneh told the meeting that
it is not a matter of if but when Iran will develop a nuclear
missile capable of hitting Israel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel must consider planning a preemptive strike
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai criticized Sneh's talk about the preemptive
strike as "damaging and unnecessary."

<HEADLINE> Spencer: Cyprus Will Join EU Regardless of Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Spencer stressed in
Greece Sunday that Cyprus would join the European Union (EU)
regardless of developments in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki while
attending a conference, Spencer said that Cyprus' entry to the EU
would reduce the possibility of any Turkish offensive on the
divided island, according to the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA).
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two rival sectors since the
Turkish invasion and occupation of its northern part in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided last December that Cyprus be included in its
list of countries waiting to join the group. The Cypriot
government led by President Glafcos Clerides welcomed the EU
decision because it believed that this would help speed up the
settlement of the protracted Cyprus problem, but Turkey, which
also wants to be a member of the EU, and the Turkish Cypriots in
northern Cyprus opposed the EU decision.
</P>
<P>
The situation on the island has now been tense with the nearing
of the planned deployment later this year of the Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus, which says that such a
move should be seen as a self-defense measure to partially
counterbalance Turkey's military superiority on the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which keeps some 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus, has
threatened to use force to prevent the missile installation,
claiming that the missiles would be a threat to the Turkish
Cypriot community and to the Turkish mainland.

<HEADLINE> Nile Water Under Control: Egyptian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Public
Works and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid said Sunday that the
water level of the River Nile is dropping gradually thanks to the
flood diversion of the Lake Nasser.
</P>
<P>
The water level in the man-made Lake Nasser behind the Aswan
High Dam rose to record 180.43 meters Sunday and a large amount
of the excess water is being discharged through the Toshka
spillway to irrigate a swath of desert to the northwest of the dam.
</P>
<P>
A total of 567 million cubic meters of water were discharged
Sunday to meet the needs of irrigation, power generation, drinking
water, industry, navigation and other purposes, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time since the dam was erected in 1971 that
the Nile water has been diverted to the Toshka canal. The first
time was in 1996, when the water behind the dam hit a record level
of 178 meters.
</P>
<P>
The current diversion began early this month when the water
exceeded the dam's safety level of 175 meters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt used to suffer periodic flooding from the River Nile
until the completion of the Aswan High Dam.
</P>
<P>
The average annual flow of the Nile is 84 billion cubic meters,
with 80 percent of the volume passing during the flood season from
August through October.
</P>
<P>
The 1,670-kilometer Nile is Africa's longest river, running
south-north through several countries before pouring into the
Mediterranean.

ATHENS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Sorin Matei, the escaped
Romanian criminal who held four hostages in central Athens
Wednesday, died after breathing in his own vomit, showed an
initial autopsy report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Four coroners assigned to conduct an autopsy on Matei, who died
suddenly Saturday in the Korydallos prison hospital, said that
Matei had choked to death while he was heavily sedated and bound
and that he should never have been moved to the prison.
</P>
<P>
The 27-Romanian convict had been under sedation and heavy guard
since late Wednesday after holding police at bay for some six
hours and threatening to detonate a hand grenade, which exploded
and injured 12 people, including 10 police officers.
</P>
<P>
Matei's lawyer said after the announcement of the coroners'
findings that there were still many questions about Matei's death
that demanded answers.
</P>
<P>
A report on the definitive cause of Matei's death will be
issued on completion of all toxicology and other tests.

<HEADLINE> Folk Dances, Symphony Back on Stage in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Folk dances and symphony are
back on the stage in Iran after nearly two decades, as the
government vows to promote the status of tourism in the country.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in local colorful costumes, of course in light of
Islamic dressing codes, six Iranian actresses on Sunday performed
a ground-breaking folk dance for senior Iranian officials and
foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the life of women in mountainous areas in the
northern Gilan province, the actresses walked around on the stage
with tea baskets on their shoulders, picked tea leaves and brought
them back home.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied with traditional folk music played with waist
drums and tambourines, the actresses then joined 12 actors to
show the countryside life on the threshing ground: men are
thrashing rice with sticks while women are winnowing the chaff.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time to perform folk dances in Iran publicly,
particularly by actresses in front of senior officials and foreign
diplomats," an official said after President Mohammad Khatami left
the theater in the Vahdat Hall, downtown Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The 1979 Islamic Revolution has influenced every aspect of life
of the Iranian people, and performances of folk dances and western
symphony have been rare since.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's programs were presented to mark the World Tourism Day
and the beginning of Iranian Tourism Week.
</P>
<P>
Folk dances of Iranian Kurds are the miniature of pastoral life
and the Busheri dances present fishing in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
A grand symphony orchestra also appeared on the stage,
performing Iranian classic music and songs in praise of the
beautiful land of the Iranian nation and their civilization.
</P>
<P>
Iran has the attraction to world tourists due to its rich
culture, varied natural scenes and historical remains, officials
here said.
</P>
<P>
Iran is among the first 10 countries in the world which enjoy
rich historical sites, President Khatami told the audience, but
unfortunately Iran's tourism has not gained an appropriate
position in the world.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the world's revenue from tourism reached 440
billion U.S. dollars, while Iran's tourism only fetched 350
million dollars, head of Iran's Tourism Organization Mohammad
Moezeddin said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism will enhance understanding among different nations,
thus expanding peaceful international relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran should remove obstacles on the way of
development of tourism in Iran, but he did not name them.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here hope that developing tourism will bring fresh air
to the society and lead to relaxation of some of the strict
rules. To request every woman entering the country to wear scarf,
for one, is daunting away a large portion of tourists, they said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns U.S. Delivery of Jet-fighters to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday condemned
the U.S. decision to provide Israel with more jet-fighters and
sophisticated arms, saying that the move indicated Washington's
double-standard policies.
</P>
<P>
Such "irresponsible" support of the U.S. for Israel's military
build-up ran counter to all global efforts to protect
international peace and security, Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel, backed by the U.S. and certain
western countries, has turned the occupied lands into a depot
of modern arms posing serious threat to the stability and
security of the region and the world, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Washington continues providing Israel
with sophisticated weapons and supports the entity's nuclear
activities and terrorist acts on the one hand, and speaks of
the Middle East peace talks on the other.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. knows well that such support would
bear no fruit but it would rather further endanger regional
peace and stability, encourage Israel to continue with its
aggressive and expansionist policies in Palestine and the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move is an attempt to divert public opinion from
the dangerous facts in the region, he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Export 500 Tons of Cashew Nuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has
ordered 500 tons of cashew nuts from east Tanzania's Coast Region
this farming season.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Commissioner, Nicodemus Banduka, said in Kibaha

</P>
<P>
Banduka said the region has launched a special drive to boost
the production of the main cash crop through enactment of laws.
Meanwhile, farmers in the region have established 65 cashew nut
processing centers to increment the value of the crop.
</P>
<P>
The region, he said, is serious about reviving the production
of the crop whose production has been dwindling these years due
to lack of proper care.
</P>
<P>
Last farming season, the region produced 8,000 tons of cashew
nuts, compared with 34,252 tons in the 1993/94 fiscal year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cashew nut is a major foreign exchange earner of Tanzania.
Statistics show that cashew nut output in the east African
country hit 90,000 tons last season.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Schroeder, the winner of

major priorities: "economic stability, inner security and above
all also continuity in foreign policy."

<P>
He also stressed that his most important goal is the combat
against mass unemployment in the country.
</P>

Center," under which he pledges to combine modernity with social
justice in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hails Turkey's Decision to Restore Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi embassy in Ankara
Sunday welcomed Turkey's decision to restore full diplomatic
relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi embassy sources, who asked not to be named, said that
T. Hamandi, charge d'affaires of the embassy, called Turkey's
decision "a step in the right direction." without saying whether
the Iraqi government would send its own ambassador to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced on
Saturday that his country is ready to send an ambassador soon to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Hamandi did not say whether Iraq would dispatch an ambassador
back to Turkey. Iraq's ambassador returned home last year for, what
Hamandi said, administrative reasons.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has not had an ambassador in Baghdad since the 1991 Gulf
War, which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries soured due to disputes
over Ankara's close ties with the United States, which led the
multi-national forces in the Gulf War, sharing of water resources
and Turkey's repeated military actions in northern Iraq against
Turkey's Kurdish separatists.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the unexpected warm-up of relations
between the two neighbors was prompted by a U.S.-brokered
agreement between two Kurdish groups, which have been fighting for
controlling northern Iraq under a safe heaven set up by western
allies after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan signed a peace accord in Washington last week to pave
the way for an elected Kurdish government in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Both Ankara and Baghdad are worried that the move would
destabilize the region and constitute threats to the security of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey fears that the establishment of a Kurdish administration
in northern Iraq would encourage Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party to intensify the war in its southeast for an
independent Kurdish state, which it has been fighting for since
1984.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 200 in Central Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Two hundred people
died of cholera in central region of Tanzania during the first
eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Health officials of the Morogoro Region in central Tanzania
have blamed street vendors for selling unclean food, which has
made more than 9,000 people contract cholera.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Health Officer Nicolas Masaoe said at a seminar
for street vendors in Morogoro Friday that most of the cases
occurred after people ate food prepared or preserved in
non-hygienic conditions, according to reports reaching here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, the Registrar of the National Food Control
Program, Fabian Magoma, directed local government at various
levels to make the vendors comply with sanitary standards.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 90 percent of urban citizens eat food sold
by vendors and therefore it is important for the authorities to
ensure the safety of food.
</P>
<P>
The program, jointly run by the Ministry of Health and the
World Health Organization (WHO), was launched in 1978 in a bid to
safeguard cleanness of food sold in streets.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is a leading killer in Tanzania. Statistics show that
more than 36,000 people contracted the epidemic disease in the
east African country last year, with a death toll of 2,124.

<HEADLINE> Zadornov: Russian Gov't to Correct Decisions on GKO-OFZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed Russian
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Sunday that the government
is drafting a scheme for converting the August 17 decisions on
State Short-Term Bonds (GKO) and Federal Loan Bonds with Fixed
Income (OFZ).
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency cited Zadornov as reporting that the
steps taken by the government and the Central Bank of Russia on
GKO and OFZ were dictated by the aggravated financial situation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov said "a collapse began in several directions:" notably
the banking system lapsed, some banks suspended payments to the
budget, investors started to withdraw money and the reserves of
the CBR became insufficient to maintain the ruble foreign exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
During the 40 days since August 17, no decisions of principal
importance were worked out, said Zadornov. The situation remains
undetermined, which is the worst thing, while banks continue to
die, economic agents don't work and many people transfer money
abroad, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to former deputy head of the Presidential
Administration Alexander Livshits, President Boris Yeltsin "was
probably briefed on the August 17 decisions, but he was unlikely
to be briefed on all the possible options in the situation in
mid-August."
</P>
<P>
Those decisions were unavoidable, Livshits said. However, he
said, their organization and technological form was a flight from
the positions instead of a withdrawal arranged to accommodate the
consequences.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Calls for Reformation of Lesotho Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Botswana Foreign
Minister Mompati Merafhe said in Maseru, Lesotho, Sunday that
Lesotho Defense Force (LDF) should be reformed and its solders be
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
Addressing mass media, Merafhe said the need for the
transformation of the LDF was fueled by the fact that Lesotho and
its nationals had for many years been held to ransom by
"indisciplined young gun-totting soldiers".
</P>
<P>
He said that the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
intervention force would remain in Lesotho as long as it took to
bring back law, order and stability.
</P>
<P>
"We together with South Africa and Zimbabwe, are the
guarantors of peace and stability in Lesotho and our troops will,
therefore, have to stay there until this mission is achieved," he
said.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, the sixth day since South Africa and Botswana
started military intervention in the mountain kingdom, there were
mixed feelings toward the presence of the SADC troops, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Lesotho people, believed to be supporters of the
government, converged on the capital of Maseru to begin a
clean-up campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those who supported the opposition parties hurled
abusive words at the SADC soldiers. They accused the soldiers of
aggression, blaming South African President Nelson Mandela for
the mess in their country.
</P>
<P>
"Withdraw these troops immediately from Lesotho and tell
Pakalitha Mosisili and his government to sit down with our
leaders and resolve the problem stemmed from the May 23 election
rigging," an elderly supporter for opposition party was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Politicians Say Deal in Lewinsky Matter Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Three veteran politicians
mentioned as possible mediators between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress over the Lewinsky
affair say there won't be a deal before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
"Probably not much can happen until maybe next year," said
former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, instead of a race to judgment, you are looking at a
race to the election," said former White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, who appeared Sunday with Dole and former Senate
Republican leader Howard Baker on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
The White House and some Democrats are looking at some sort of
settlement, likely to involve censure or reprimand of the
president by Congress, that would avoid months of impeachment
hearings culminating in a Senate vote on whether to remove Clinton
from office for the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, on the whole, have insisted that the House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee must go ahead with an
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"I don't read about a deal anywhere in the Constitution,"
Judiciary Committee member Representative Asa Hutchinson, a
Republican, said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "I don't think we
ought to rush in that direction."
</P>
<P>
On "Fox News Sunday," a leading Clinton critic, Senator John
Ashcroft, a Republican, criticized Democrats, saying the Democrats
"want us to have a congressional cover-up."
</P>
<P>
Dole, Panetta and Baker all said it was too early for that.
</P>
<P>
"It's a nonstarter now," Dole said.
</P>
<P>
"Impeachment hearings are necessary," Baker said. "If it goes
over to the Senate, then maybe there is time to talk about a plea
bargain, but it is way too soon for that."
</P>
<P>
Panetta, a Democrat who has both advised and criticized
Clinton, said that at this point the election is more important
than the impeachment process to Clinton's future. If the
Republicans win more seats in November, he said, "I think that's
trouble for the president" both in terms of having more
Republicans sit in judgment of him and undermining his support
among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
If the Democrats hold their own, "I think there is a much
better chance that this issue will be settled sooner rather than
later."
</P>
<P>
There were Democrats who said the president did not commit an
impeachable offense and that, for the good of the nation, the
crisis should be dealt with quickly.
</P>
<P>
Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, said on NBC that the
partisan nature of the process so far was "plain wrong" and that
if the case came to the Senate, "there will be no impeachment."
</P>
<P>
"I think the American public understands what's going on and I
think the American public is saying very clearly we've had enough
of this," he added.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator John Kerry also urged Congress to move
quickly on the Clinton affair. On "Fox News Sunday," Kerry said
that Republican focus on the matter was disrupting consideration
of crucial legislative matters. But Kerry also took issue with the
president's recent tactic of going on the offensive against
Republicans. "I think it was a mistake," the senator said.

<HEADLINE> News Profile: Gerhard Schroeder, Winner of Germany's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Schroeder, who not long
ago was largely unknown to the outside world, has emerged as the
first German Social Democrat who managed to stop the winning steak
of Germany's veteran chancellor Helmut Kohl during the past 16
years.
</P>
<P>
In Germany's general elections Sunday, he led his Social
Democratic Party (SPD) to a comfortable lead over Kohl's
conservative alliance, a success that will enable him to lead
Europe's most populous nation into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Born on April 4, 1944 in the small northern German town of
Mossenberg, he never saw his father, who was killed in the same
year while serving in the Nazi army in Romania.
</P>
<P>
As one of five children raised by a war widow who eked out a
living as a cleaning lady, Schroeder's childhood memories include
stealing food to help feed the family and fending off debt
collectors.
</P>
<P>
He studied law and graduated from Goettingen University in
1976. He first became a local parliamentary member of his Lower
Saxony state in 1980 and has been the state premier since 1990.
</P>
<P>
After winning a landslide victory in the state legislature
election at the end of March this year, he finally won his party's
trust and was picked as its chief candidate to challenge Kohl, who
has defeated three SPD contenders since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as a pro-business pragmatist, Schroeder says
he understands the challenges faced by German businesses in coping
with the global economy and pledges innovations to improve the
country's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
And based on his miserable childhood experiences, Schroeder
also pledges to restore social justice at a time when Germany's
unemployment is hovering at the near post-war record high of 4
million.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning on a program he called a political "New Center,"
Schroeder's appeal to the large pool of centrist voters has
invited comparisons with U.S. President Bill Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
But above all, many commentators say that Schroeder has
successfully courted a voters' desire for a political fresh face
after 16 years of Kohl's reign.

The Taiwan issue and trade imbalance might be among the
subjects to be discussed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton announced during his visit to China in late
June that the United States would not back Taiwan's independence,
its membership in international organizations of sovereign
countries and "Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan" policy.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pentagon recently announced a 350-million U.S.
dollar arms sale to Taiwan, a move which triggered protest from
China. In addition, the House of Representative last week voted to
approve the provision of theater anti-missile systems to the
island.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the Chinese foreign minister would express
China's concerns and urge Washington to adhere to the three joint
communiques signed between the two countries in the 1970s and
1980s. Washington cites the Taiwan Act to justify its arms sales
to the island.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral trade, the U.S. complains about the growing trade
deficit with China and the slow paced negotiations over China's
membership in the World Trade Organization, while China urges the
U.S. to loose control over high-tech exports to China and soften
its terms for China's entry to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
With these problems to be resolved through joint efforts, the
two sides have agreed to cooperate in vital issues like security,
non-proliferation and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
To materialize the constructive strategic partnership between
China and the United States calls for unremitting efforts from
both sides, Tang told the National Committee on U.S.-China
Relations and the Asia Society in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Tang visits the U.S. since he became
foreign minister early this year. He is expected to leave here for
Canada Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> New Type of Residence Planned for Aging Society (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- More residential housing
providing independent living for the elderly will be built across
China by the year 2010 to meet the needs of an aging society, a
Chinese expert said today.
</P>
<P>
The apartments with bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens and
bathrooms -- will be built for citizens between the age of 60 and
80 in peaceful places in urban and suburban areas, Zhang
Wenfan, chairman of the Chinese Old Citizens Association told a
national conference on elderly housing in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Old people can live a private family life while enjoying daily
services such as maids, laundry and shopping and cooking in such
apartments, Zhang said, adding that health care, entertainment
and educational facilities will also be available.
</P>
<P>
China will become an aged country by the year 2000 with 130
million, over one tenth of the population, over the age of
60. This aged population will continue to grow to 25 percent
of the Chinese population by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
The old-folks homes and welfare institutes built in the 1950s
for old people without children and parents of martyrs
have already become obsolete with underdeveloped facilities,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said that many old-folks homes built in the 1980s are
also suffering from a lack of family atmosphere and isolation from
the rest of society.

<P>
More than 600 residential facilities which can provide independent
living for the elderly have been built across China since the
first was established in Anqing City in east China's Anhui
Province in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"We need not worry about our food and clothing here, and we can
attend all kinds of entertaining activities and talk with friends
who have common interests with us," said Zhang Huizhen, who has
been living with her husband in an apartment for the elderly in
Daqing in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province for two years.
</P>
<P>
The cost of living in such residences is usually moderate and
apt to be covered by pensions and other income often available to
the elderly. They can decide how long they will live in such
places according to their own desires.
</P>
<P>
"I feel more comfortable living here than living with my son,"
said Yu Hongguang, another resident in the Daqing apartment,
"because we have too many differences in life styles."
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that more elderly citizens in China now tend
to live separately from their children, either to reduce conflict
between the generations or to ease the burden on their children.
</P>
<P>
They said the one-child-family policy and longer
life expectancy also intensify the problem of taking care of
the elderly. In some extreme cases, young couples must take
care of the parents of both sides, and grandparents as well.
</P>
<P>
Residential housing which can provide independent living
for the elderly may help resolve the problems, many experts
believe.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Right-wingers Threaten to Topple Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli right-wing parties
threatened Monday to topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government if he agrees to withdraw Israeli troops from a further
13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Knesset (Parliament) members of the National Religious Party, a
coalition partner, Hanan Porat and Zvi Handel, have made it clear
that if Netanyahu reaches agreement with the Palestinians on the
pullback, they would rise up against him, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
They said they would side with the opposition in a possible
no-confidence vote to bring down the government, paving the way
for the dissolution of the Knesset and early elections.
</P>
<P>
The Likud-led coalition has a slim majority of 61 members in
the 120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the hard-line opposition Moledet Party Rahavam Zeevi
said that his party, which has two seats in the Knesset, would
vote for the dissolution of the parliament if the government goes
ahead with the further withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The threats of the right-wingers came as hopes emerged that the
protracted stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations can
be broken.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat held a three-way meeting late Sunday night with the United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton also has invited Netanyahu and
Arafat to hold separate talks with him on Monday, which are viewed
to be opportunities to advance the peace process. The latest news
was that the talks may turn out to be a three-way summit to
enhance prospects for settling difference between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly called on Israel to pull back from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in return for Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants. The Palestinians have accepted the
proposal, but Israel has not, citing security concerns.

<HEADLINE> German Voters Opt for Change After 16 Years of Kohl Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's veteran chancellor
Helmut Kohl has to swallow a bitter pill on Sunday when he became
the first incumbent chancellor who was voted out of office in the
country's post-war history.
</P>
<P>
Above all explanations, many German commentators agreed that
with 16 successive years in power, Kohl has apparently overstayed
voters' welcome.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, more than two-thirds of Germans
want to see another person at the helm in Bonn. Meanwhile, polls
also showed that there is not much passion behind the demand, no
hatred of Kohl, no anger, just weariness and fatigue, just a
growing yearning for change.
</P>
<P>
At age of 68, Kohl is Germany's longest-serving chancellor and
the most durable Western leader in the post-war era, a statesman
who has secured a place in history as the architect of the German
reunification in 1990 and has been viewed as a leading champion of
European unity.
</P>
<P>
When he announced his intention to run for an unprecedented
fifth term in office in April last year, Kohl said he felt a
personal duty to run again while his country was facing challenges
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
As a seasoned politician, Kohl is for the first time clearly
having difficulty addressing the mood of the nation, a German
commentator said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Schroeder has shrewdly played to the voters'
sentiment by repeatedly underscoring the notion of generational
change during his election race.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning on a concept what he calls the political "New
Center," under which he pledges to combine modernity with social
justice, Schroeder has strong appeals to middle-of-the-road
voters, the ordinary wage-earners, who want some sort of change
but fear too much sacrifice at a time when Germany's unemployment
hovers at near-record high of four million.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kohl has also seen his popularity slumping in the
eastern half of the country.
</P>
<P>
Once Eastern Germans were so enthusiastic about the
reunification achieved by Kohl, now many blame him for not
creating the "flourishing landscapes" he predicted afterward.
</P>
<P>
Without giving concrete numbers, German pollsters said that
initial examination of the election outcome on Sunday has pointed
to the worst loss for Kohl's party in eastern Germany so far, down
from 39 percent in the 1994 election and 42 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's plunging popularity is in many ways a reflection of the
growing frustration in eastern Germany toward the Western style of
capitalism and a persistently high unemployment rate of about 17
percent, nearly twice that in the west part of the country.
</P>
<P>
As another reflection of the frustration, the Party of
Democratic Socialism, which grew out of the former East Germany's
communist party, broke the five-percent mark for the first time
since 1990 by scoring 5.1 percent of the vote on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Germans comprises about one-fifth of the country's
electorate and were crucial to Kohl's re-election in 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
What change will Schroeder bring to Germany?
</P>
<P>
In his first policy declaration made Sunday evening, Schroeder
pledged to make it his top priority to combat mass
unemployment. He also vowed continuity in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
During election campaign Schroeder also pledges moderate tax
cuts and more public funding for education and innovations to
improve Germany's competitiveness in a globalized world.
</P>
<P>
But he also vows to reverse some social cutbacks made by Kohl's
government that were designed to shrink the chronic budget deficit
stretched by the German reunification and the country's endeavor
to meet the fiscal conditions for joining the single European
currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
His opponents have accused him of being vague on policy issues.
</P>
<P>
And if Schroeder does hope to pursue his centrist and
pragmatist policies, he still has to persuade his party, which is
still dominated by traditional left-wingers, to come along with
him.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Schroeder also faces tough negotiations with his
potential coalition partner, the ecologist Greens, which has made
a series of radical demands earlier this year, including a call to
triple gasoline prices within ten years and rejection of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's eastward expansion.

<HEADLINE> No Financial Problem for Short-course Swimming Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- There will be neither
financial nor technical problems when Hong Kong hosts the Fourth
International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA) World
Short-course (25-meter pool) Championships next Spring,
organizers said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The world championships organized by the Hong Kong Amateur
Swimming Association (HKASA) are slated from April 1-4 here.
</P>
<P>
The championships are to be held in four days, with almost
same format as three previous championships. The only exception
is the introduction of semi-finals for the 50-meter and 100-meter
events.
</P>
<P>
The event's organizing committee had so far received entries
of 460 swimmers from 39 countries and regions including the
United States, Australia, Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
And the organizers expect the field to expand to some 1,000
swimmers from 80 to 100 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The organizers had been discussing details with several
sponsors, and the hosts were confident that enough funding will
be available.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility of constructing a portable pool inside the
Hong Kong Coliseum in Kowloon is under full investigation,
organizers said. The pool resembles those at the last world
championships in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no technical difficulties in constructing such a
 pool," said an organizing committee spokesman.
</P>
<P>
During the championships, FINA will hold 13th World Sports
Medicine Congress and FINA General Congress.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the world championships, the HKASA has
decided to hold Hong Kong's first ever open water swimming
competitions, on October 1 at the Repulse Bay Beach.
</P>
<P>
The local association expects to attract some 3,000
participants to four categories -- Junior, Family, Master and
Open. There are two courses -- 625 meters and 500 meters.

of August 1997 despite a 26.5 percent increase in the monthly
output of pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
In the accumulative output for the first eight months of this
year, the electronics cluster registered a 3.4 percent decline
than a year ago while chemicals and engineering clusters enjoyed

ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban
militia are pushing the rival Hezb-e-Wahdat faction further
backwards in the central Bamyan province after making a major gain
over the weekend, reports monitored here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban captured the Punjab district at the weekend with
heavy casualties from the Hezb-e-Wahdat led by Kharim Khalili, the
reports quoted Taliban-controlled Radio Shariat as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no immediate independent confirmation of the
reports.
</P>
<P>
"Despite consolidating the already seized areas, the Taliban
are advancing towards other areas still under the control of the
Khalili militia," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Punjab district includes strategic supply routes for the
Hezb-e-Wahdat, which has suffered heavy losses in Bamyan province
since the capital, Bamyan City, fell to the Taliban forces on
September 13.
</P>
<P>
Khalili's group is one of the main factions in the anti-Taliban
Northern Alliance, along with those of Afghan ex-defense minister

<HEADLINE> EU to Sue Italy for Discrimination Against Foreign Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
decided to warn Italy of its discriminatory policies against
foreign drivers before threatening to bring the country to court.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union (EU), plans to advise the Italian government that it is
discriminating against drivers from other EU member states when
they violate the country's highway rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it would take Italy to the European Court
of Justice if the Italian authorities failed to make a
satisfactory reply within two months.
</P>
<P>
The Italian highway code provides that an offender, whose car
is registered outside Italy, must either pay the police officer a
fine with no chances of appeal or have his/her driving license
confiscated should the driver fail to pay half the maximum penalty
for the offense as a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials cited a German driver to support their
argument. The driver, they said, was caught talking over a
cellular phone while driving. He was asked to pay 50,000 lire
(about 27.7 U.S. dollars) to the police officer or 100,000 lire
(55.45 U.S. dollars) as a guarantee for the penalty.
</P>
<P>
When he refused to pay either amount, his driving license was
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
An Italian motorist caught committing the same offense,
however, can either pay 50,000 lire at a police station or by bank
transfer, or appeal within 60 days of receipt of the ticket.
</P>
<P>
The European Court of Justice holds that a European Union
member state may require non-residents to pay a penalty in the way
they opt for in case of infringement rather than paying the fine
immediately.

<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) of
the United Nations will offer emergency assistance of food valued at
87.67 million U.S. dollars to China's flood-ravaged provinces
including Anhui, Hubei and Jiangxi, a WFP official announced here

victory of the just-concluded national anti-flood and rescue
operation and commending those who made outstanding contributions
to the flood-fighting campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
Titled "Studying Flood-fighting Models and Promoting
Flood-fighting Spirit," the editorial sends a lofty salute to
those who made prominent contributions in the campaign and
expresses thanks to those who made donations for flood relief.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the grand national conference on review and
commendation of the flood-fighting and disaster-relief endeavor
held in Beijing on Monday, the editorial terms the victory, in the
final analysis, a victory of the people, and says the people are
the mainstay and motive power pushing ahead the development of
history.
</P>
<P>
However, those leading the people forward and influencing them
spiritually are heroes and models among them, the editorial points
out, saying that they are all the glory of the Party, the pride of
the people, and the deserving national heroes.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that learning from these heroes and models
requires learning their unselfish dedication, their perseverance
in times of emergency, and their patriotic and collective spirit
centering on the national interests and the people's interests.
</P>
<P>
The flood-fighting spirit is a reflection of the strength to
fight against difficulty and strive for success in the new
circumstance, it says.
</P>
<P>
In reality, the editorial says, in order to learn from the
flood-fighting heroes and models, the people should unite closely
around the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core,
hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and forge
ahead along the route of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics to realize the great goal in the next century.

<HEADLINE> Di Canio Charged with Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- England's Football
Association (FA) decided on Monday to charge Paolo Di Canio with
misconduct for his push on referee Paul Alcock.
</P>
<P>
The Sheffield Wednesday striker shoved the official to the
ground during Saturday's match against Arsenal at Hillsborough.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio, who received a red card for the incident, was
initially expected to make an apology but has since accused
Alcock of over-reacting.
</P>
<P>
The Italian now has 14 days to request a personal hearing but,
depending on his response, the FA could bring forward a
disciplinary hearing.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the FA said: "Paolo Di Canio of Sheffield
Wednesday has been charged with misconduct for his reported
assault on referee Paul Alcock."
</P>
<P>
Di Canio, who has been suspended by Sheffield Wednesday and
has flown to Italy with the club's permission, is reported to
have said:
</P>
<P>
"I gave him a shove, but it was hardly done with much force.
</P>
<P>
"He took three or four sideways steps before falling over in
rather a strange way - like someone diving to win a penalty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Di Canio said that he would wait to see what
punishment was meted out but could be willing to fight it all the
way.
</P>
<P>
"I believe I was the subject of the most intense provocation.
Personally I believe there were several mitigating
circumstances," he told reporters at Heathrow before leaving for
Rome.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio's agent Matteo Roggi said the star was "deeply upset"
over what happened and was prepared to say he is sorry for his
actions.
</P>
<P>
"I feel sure Paolo will decide to issue an apology shortly and
we will then have to see what happens after that. We are also
waiting to hear from Sheffield Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
Premier League referees' officer Philip Don said Alcock "felt
he was pushed very aggressively".
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the BBC's Breakfast News, he said: "The FA could
ban Di Canio for 180 days, given the nature of the offence. That
ban would be effective across the world."
</P>
<P>
The incident at Hillsborough made Alcock, a 45-year-old
shopping center manager, briefly consider quitting as a referee.
</P>
<P>
"I had to think very seriously about what to do with the rest
of my career after what happened," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I was absolutely dumbstruck that something like that could
happen in the Premier League. It's incredible. I couldn't believe
what had taken place, it is totally unacceptable," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines May Reopen on Oct. 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced Monday that Philippine Airlines (PAL) may resume
operations on October 7 after its labor leaders finally accepted
an ownership-sharing deal offered by the management.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Estrada said while it will take up to
Wednesday next week to finalize and ratify the agreement being
formalized between the PAL management and its workers, the
operating of PAL "is almost a done deal."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the PAL Employees Association (PALEA) wrote him
that it was accepting the management's package of benefits in
exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement (CBA).
</P>
<P>
"We need a week before PAL can get back to normal, but I asked
PAL management to do it within three days and they told me they'll
try their best," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there won't be any need for a referendum among PAL
employees to ratify the agreement, noting that "a great majority
of PALEA officials have agreed to save PAL by accepting
management's package of benefits."
</P>
<P>
"Finally, there's an agreement. This could be the start of good
labor-management relations," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said both PAL management and
the labor unions had agreed that after the ratification of the
management-labor accord this week, PAL would likely resume its
flights by October 7.
</P>
<P>
The debt-ridden and strike-crippled PAL ceased operations at
midnight last Wednesday after the labor unions rejected the
co-ownership scheme offered by the management.
</P>
<P>
According to Zamora, the management-labor accord calls for an
ownership-sharing scheme that will give each employee 60,000
shares in the airline, and the retention of their medical benefits
that would include their families and relatives.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the agreement also calls for the retention of the
majority of PAL's employees without any salary cuts, with a
special voluntary retirement package being offered by the
management for those who will not be re-hired.
</P>
<P>
Zamora, who met earlier with PAL Chairman Lucio Tan and
representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said
PAL will fly 22 planes for its domestic and international routes.

<HEADLINE> NZ Governor General Meets Chinese Senior Party Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Governor
General Michael Hardie Boys met here Monday with Wei Jianxing, one
of the top officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Wei, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee, said that although China and New
Zealand are far apart geographically, the friendly exchange
between the two peoples goes back to ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who also is a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, is here on an official good-will visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
The late Rewi Alley, a great son of the New Zealand people,
made an important contribution to the cause of revolution and
construction of the Chinese people and to the cause of world
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that since the two countries established diplomatic
ties 26 years ago, their bilateral relations have developed
remarkably thanks to joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side hopes that the two countries will bring a
healthy and steadily-growing Sino-New Zealand relationship into
the next century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei briefed Boys on China's policy of reform and opening up,
the current economic situation in China and the recent anti-flood
struggle of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Boys said Rewi Alley has become a bridge of Sino-New Zealand
friendship.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the people of Chinese origin in New Zealand for
their important contributions to the social development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand values friendly relations of cooperation with
China," Boys stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the past four days in New Zealand, Wei had extensive
contacts with personages of various circles, briefing them about
China's foreign policy and domestic construction, and exchanging
views with them on the Sino-New Zealand relations, China's
construction of democracy and the legal system, and its
anti-corruption struggle.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs and
Trade Don Mckinnon, Wei said China is a steadfast force for
safeguarding peace and stability in the region and in the world as
well.
</P>
<P>
"China concentrates its efforts on economic construction. It
needs a long-term international environment of peace," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Douglas Graham, New Zealand minister of
justice and attorney-general, Wei said the exchange and
cooperation between the judicial and supervisory departments of
the two countries had yielded positive results. He said China
would like to develop and strengthen such friendly exchange and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with Helen Clark, leader of the New Zealand
Labor Party, Wei expressed appreciation for the contribution her
party has made to the promotion of Sino-New Zealand relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC desires to increase contacts with all of New
Zealand's political parties, including the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Wei and his entourage arrived in Wellington Sunday after
visiting Auckland and Rotorua.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia's Ruling Party Loses Majority in General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's Movement for Democratic Slovakia lost its parliamentary
majority in Saturday's election, giving a four-party opposition
coalition a chance to take power, preliminary results on Sunday
showed.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results announced by the central electoral
commission showed Meciar's ruling HZDS collected 27 percent of the
votes. Combined with another ruling party, the Slovak National
Party, which got 9.07 percent of the vote, Meciar will get only 57
seats in the 150-seat new parliament, 19 short of a parliamentary
majority.
</P>
<P>
The four opposition parties will occupy the remaining 93
seats. Of that, the Slovak Democratics' Alliance won 42 seats with
26.33 percent of the poll, the Party of Democratic Left of
Slovakia won 23 seats with 14.66 percent of the vote, the
Hungarian Coalition Party, and the Party of Civic Understanding
won 15 and 13 seats with 9.12 and 8.01 percent of the vote
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the four parties met hours after the announcement of
the results, signaling a willingness to form a new
administration. They made it clear that none of them will form a
coalition with Meciar's HZDS.
</P>
<P>
Under Slovakia's Constitution, the parliament with a term of
four years is the sole and top legislative body of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election was the second after Slovakia declared its
independence in 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges S. African States to Wipe Out Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) Monday called on Southern African
countries to learn from each other in their endeavor to eradicate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, ECA Director Robert Okello
said the region's capacity to achieve sustainable development
will increase if poverty is eradicated.
</P>
<P>
he said development efforts should not be left to the
government alone, and urged the private sector to join to promote
development of their countries.
</P>
<P>
Globalization will never be achieved if the developed nations
continue to marginalize Africa, Okello noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa has lagged behind in development because it is
usually left out of the development programs by the Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, South African High Commissioner to Zambia Themba
Thabethe said Africa has failed to develop because of people's
attitude.
</P>
<P>
Although Africa has enough resources, Africans fail to plan
for the future development of their continent, Thabethe said.
</P>
<P>
The ECA will host the fifth meeting of inter-governmental
committee of experts for Southern Africa development in Lusaka
here next Monday.

WARSAW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek said on Monday the results of Germany's election will not
lead to great changes in Polish-German relations.

He promised to make efforts in improving relations with the new

<P>
HONG KONG, September (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Manufacturer's
Association (CMA) of Hong Kong held a reception here Monday to
celebrate the 49th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, acting administrative secretary of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), and other SAR government
officials attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
Among others present at the reception were officials of
institutions of the Central Government in Hong Kong, foreign
consuls in Hong Kong, members of the Legislative Council of the
SAR, Hong Kong deputies of the National People's Congress and Hong
Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference and leading local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the gathering, CMA President Herbert Liang said that
China had laid a new milestone in the course of economic reform
this year by formulating and implementing various economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, positive and pragmatic attitude continued to be
adopted and clear objectives for the economic reform had been
established to equip the country for future challenges.
</P>
<P>
Liang said he strongly believed that with those far-reaching
and conductive objectives as well as policies, a strong foundation
for China could be built up and the economy of China would then
continue to prosper in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that Hong Kong's role as the important gateway for
China's mainland to international markets had to be better
capitalized to enhance the economic cooperation between Hong Kong,
the mainland and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland is
already growing closer and closer and the new developments of the
mainland would be effective in keeping the stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong, Liang noted.
</P>
<P>
The CMA was established in 1934. With over 3,700 member
companies from various sectors of industry and trade, it is one of
the oldest and most representative industrial associations in Hong
Kong.

It is the first time Labor has taken the lead in the Bulletin
poll, and it means that Labor is ahead of the coalition in
Australia's four major polls.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 2,000 voters found the coalition's
primary vote had dropped by three points over the past week, down
to 40 percent, while Labor's had risen by two points to 39
percent.
</P>
<P>
One Nation was polling at 7 percent, the Australian Democrats
at 8 percent, the Greens at 3 percent and only 2 percent of voters
were still undecided.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the poll results, the Labor national secretary,
the party's most senior strategist, Gray Gray said Labor would
have to pull off the biggest political comeback in the country's
history to win Saturday's election.
</P>
<P>
According to Gray, Labor needs to win 27 more seats to win the
federal election, "it is a difficult task, and it's never been
done before... the task before us is the biggest campaign task
ever put before an opposition."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister John Howard also said he had
contemplated the risk of losing the election because of his push
for tax reform including the goods and services tax (GST).
</P>
<P>
He said the GST is a big political gamble, and he has no idea
if the Liberals would forgive him if he lost power this weekend,
he told ABC-TV.

<HEADLINE> Demining Virtually Comes to Halt in Angola: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- As a renewal of war looms up
in Angola, the work of removing land mines has virtually stopped
in the country, an Angolan minister said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Assistance and Social Reintegration Albino Malungo
noted that because of the frequent military activities of the
opposition National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), only eight out of nineteen demining teams are now in
operation across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government had set up 18 resident demining teams
plus a mobile one under the active support of the international
organizations, the minister disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Malungo said, UNITA fighters have been planting new
mines in many areas, for this the European Union has threatened
to cut off its assistance to Angola in the field of demining.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the situation, Malungo said, "things remain more or
less the same as every month, seven or eight people are injured
by mines."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the United States, Norway and Sweden are the major
providers of assistance, the Angolan minister said, adding that
they either directly help the Angolan government in removing land
mines and training technicians or through their non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the U.N. indicated that over 10 million mines
were planted throughout Angola during the 30 years of civil war,
mainly in the agricultural provinces.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the situation, Malungo urged the international
community to take effective measures to force UNITA President
Jonas Savimbi "to demilitarize his forces and renounce his stand
for war."

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Will Not Suffer Fresh Currency Crisis, Says Kim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung said here Monday that it is impossible for his nation to
suffer another foreign exchange currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kim told a press conference his government will take measures
to boost the economy at the expense of expanding the money supply
and widening the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
"While continuing to pursue fast and effective reforms, the
government will try to overcome the recession by taking
economy-boosting measures," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
The government will expand the money supply and fiscal spending
at the expense of incurring a wider budget deficit, and at the
same time, prop-up domestic consumption and lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government has decided to supply 8.5 trillion
won (some 6.3 billion U.S. dollars) in housing loans and another
six trillion won (about 4.4 billion U.S. dollars) to boost
consumption of durable goods.
</P>
<P>
The economy-boosting programs are supported by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), from which South Korea borrowed
58 billion U.S. dollars after it was gripped by a financial crisis
spurred by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed with the IMF to increase the budget deficit to
five percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Facing increasingly stronger challenges due to the growing
economic woes and the political standoff between the ruling and
opposition parties, Kim expressed strong confidence in the
strength of the South Korean economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the restructuring and economy-boosting measures will
begin to take effect in reviving the economy as of next year.
</P>
<P>
"The economy will never shrink any further, but will only pick
up from now on," a confident Kim said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean foreign exchange reserves reached a record-high 44
billion U.S. dollars last month while the current account surplus
grew. Interest rates, foreign exchange rates and inflation were
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell, there is no possibility that we could face
another foreign currency crisis," the president said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kim pressed the nation's family-owned conglomerates,
or chaebols, to speed up their restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
The chaebols must abide by their promise, he said, in an
apparent reference to the chaebols' agreement with the government
to save money by merging their redundant subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
"If not, the government will advise lenders to stop providing
new loans and withdraw those which have already been extended,"
Kim added.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the IMF last December for a 58
billion U.S. dollar bailout package, South Korea, once the 11th
economy in the world, has to restructure its economy and open
markets this year.

<P>
CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- There has been gradual revival of tourism in
Israel since this spring, local newspaper Haaretz quoted Israeli
Central Bureau of Statistics as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists entering Israel has increased by 2
percent a month for the past five months. Some 184,700 tourists
arrived in August.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Last week's decision by the U.S. Congress to
sharply increase the number of foreigners given visas for work in
America's high-tech industry will not cause a brain drain from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper The Jerusalem Post on Monday quoted leaders of
Israeli high-tech industry as saying that there are plenty of
high-tech jobs in Israel, and wages in this field are not
significantly different from those in the U.S.. Therefore, there
is no reason to believe a brain drain will occur.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The privatization of Israel Discount Bank may
have to be postponed due to the international financial crisis
and the damage it has caused to several of the bidders.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Haaretz Monday quoted banking sources as saying
that another issue, which may lead some of the bidders to
withdraw, is their unhappiness with the conditions the Israeli
Central Bank has placed on the sale. These include forbidding the
new owners to distribute dividends from the sale of Discount's
assets.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Total Egyptian exports of cotton during the fourth
successive week has amounted to 34,630 tonnes, the equivalent of
693,000 Kantars, valued at 260.2 million Egyptian pounds (76.5
million U.S. dollars), Monday's Egyptian daily "Al Akhbar"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Cotton was exported to 28 different countries of the world. The
first ranks were occupied by Switzerland, Italy, Germany,
Australia, Turkey, the U.S. and India.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Algeria have reached an agreement under
which the Egyptian Aluminum Company will export 5000 metric tonnes
of aluminum ingots and bars to an Algerian enterprise, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be effected on five installments, starting from
next February and ending December 1999 at a total value of 9
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia's tourist revenues during the first nine
months of this year reached 1.1 billion dinars (1 billion
U.S. dollars), an increase of 7.4 percent as compared to the
corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The growing revenue was attributed to the increase in touristic
nights in hotels during the period, a rise of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Minister of Energy Habibollah Bitaraf said
that his ministry will sell bonds and obtain loans from abroad to
balance the deficit in this year's budget, the official news
Agency IRNA reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It added that the ministry plans to get 300 million dollars in
loans this year to cover much of its needs of foreign exchange. He
said that the bonds would be offered for public contribution as
from mid-October, but failed to reveal the issuing value.

<HEADLINE> Security Situation Worsening in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The security situation in
Mogadishu and its surrounding areas is worsening as a new wave of
killing, robbing, looting and kidnaping began in recent days,
despite efforts to restore law and order in the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
At least five people were killed and more than seven others
were wounded in separate armed clashes in Mogadishu Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
One of those clashes took place between armed militiamen
supporting Hussein Mohamed Aidid based in Hosh camp of the former
Hunter Base and those belonging to the militia leader Muse Sudi
Yalahow in Medina district.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, three people including one of the
militiamen were killed and a stray mortar round exploded,
wounding three others including two children.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen from both sides have pit stiff resistance
against each other and each side had retreated to its former
defensive position although at least six battle wagons from both
sides were involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the fighting was touched off after the
militiamen of Mise Sudi launched an attack on Aidid's men in an
attempt to dislodge them from the area.
</P>
<P>
But other reports had it that Aidid's men provoked the attack
by "tryi6@Q="B-
-"!:#+$\+3+$.]X:ion" to deploy a
new police force supporting Mogadishu's disputed administration,
a charge denied by commander of the police force, Colonel Abdi
Hassan Awale Qeybdid.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, two people were killed and two others
were wounded when armed clashes had erupted between rival
militiamen in Bermuda area at the heart of the city, resulting
from the abduction of a lady there.
</P>
<P>
The lady was riding on a Volkswagen in Bermuda when her car
was intercepted and she was taken away to an unknown place in the
vicinity.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic courts and the recently-announced administration
have been doing their best to demobilize hundreds of militiamen.
</P>
<P>
However, the threat for further clashes is still eminent
unless it is defused and intervened by the clan elders of the
area, observers here say.

<HEADLINE> Brown Vows No Change in Britain's Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, Britain, September 28 (Xinhua) -- British finance
minister Gordon Brown vowed on Monday that he will keep his
economic policies unchanged so as to avoid boom and bust
instability caused by short-term spending.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the annual Labor Party Conference in Blackpool,
a coastal city in northwestern England, Brown said he will try to
keep inflation low and prevent short-term economic growth that
will lead to long-term reduction in investment.
</P>
<P>
"It is because of our commitment to long-term stability, even
more essential at a time of world instability, that from this
government there will be no U-turns," the chancellor of the
exchequer said.
</P>
<P>
Brown has been under pressure from domestic manufacturers to
boost short-term spending and growth since a strong pound is
threatening their business.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Brown warned that his first task had to be to
set a credible long-term platform in pace because they had learned
from the Conservative government's mistakes that every time the
British economy started to grow, it quickly overheated and ran
into inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example the former Conservative government's
short-sighted economic policies in the late 1980s that led to boom
and bust and finally to recession.
</P>
<P>
"It was short-termism and the betrayal of the country's
long-term needs that -- in spite of their talk of long-term
resolution -- led Mrs. Thatcher 10 years ago to inflate the
economy, cut taxes, go for short-term growth, and brought in 15
percent interest rates, and the loss of one million manufacturing
jobs in 1990," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Labor's economic competence, its iron
resolution and its prudence for a purpose, was hard earned and
hard won, "and we will not sacrifice it for today's standing
ovations, tomorrow's headlines, next week's easy slogans, or next
month's false solution."

<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen met here today with presidents of associations of
Taiwan-funded enterprises in the mainland and expressed greetings
for the upcoming Moon Festival.
</P>
<P>
Qian said Taiwan-funded enterprises in the mainland have
scored remarkable achievements in the past decade, and the
mainland now has more than 30,000 Taiwan-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He noted that economic cooperation between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits complies with the long-term interests of
compatriots on both sides, and that cooperation will be for mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Asian financial turmoil and the enormous
floods this year, Qian said the mainland maintained a rapid
economic growth because of the effective measures taken by the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Chinese mainland remains the second hottest
country for investment in the world, and cross-straits economic
exchanges have also brought good opportunities for the Taiwan
investors, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian emphasized that the central government will not change its
policy of encouraging Taiwanese investment in the mainland and
will protect all legitimate rights and interests of Taiwanese
investors.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the associations of Taiwan-funded
enterprises in various places of the mainland will frankly
exchange views with concerned local departments on problems
encountered by Taiwanese investors in order to solve them
properly.

<HEADLINE> Citroen Joint Venture Launches New Car in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Dongfeng-Citroen
Automobile Co. Ltd, one of the largest automotive manufacturers in
China, launched a new model car in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The new sedan is the third generation of the "Fukang" model
that Dongfeng-Citroen has developed in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Dongfeng-Citroen said that the new "Fukang 988"
car is designed specially for the taxi and company-car market. It
changed the look of the earlier model by adding a luggage
compartment to the back, installing a more powerful engine
and utilizing an Italian-designed chassis.
</P>
<P>
According to local automotive experts, the new model
demonstrates that the largest Sino-French joint venture is
stepping up its competitiveness in the car market of China.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture in central China has the annual capacity of
150,000 Citroen cars, a make originally designed for family use in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
For the first time ever in China, individuals are expected to
buy more cars than organizations this year.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say that the supply and variety of family-use
cars are so limited that the market remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, major car manufacturers in China are increasing
their presence in the business-car market, where there is a lower
risk than the family-car market.
</P>
<P>
The First Automobile Works Group (FAW), one of the top three
automotive manufactures in China, is increasing the output of its
"Red Flag" business car, and the Shanghai Volkswagen
Corp. launched the Santana 2000 GSi luxury car earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
One buyer of the new Citroen 988 car said that at the same price
level, he would prefer better performance of brand names.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet customer demand for better performance,
Chinese automotive manufacturers are applying new technologies
such as air bags and power-steering in their products.
</P>
<P>
Dongfeng-Citroen conducted the first car-crash tests in the
history of the country's automotive industry in June.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, deputy director of the State Bureau of Machinery
Industry, said at the launching ceremony for the new model
today that market competition will push Dongfeng-Citroen and other
Chinese automotive manufacturers to create more new products.

<HEADLINE> Russia Looks Forward to Continued Cooperation With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia hopes the new German
government under Gerhard Shroeder "will continue to strengthen
relations and pursue a policy of neighborliness, partnership and
mutual trust" with Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the interests of our peoples and the goal of
international peace, European security and stability," the
Interfax news agency quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the two neighbors should try to "avoid pauses in
Russian-German cooperation despite the current effort shape
governments in both countries."
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who took office more
than two weeks ago, is still struggling to form a broad-based
cabinet.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The 26th session of the
Asia-Pacific Fishery Commission (APFIC) opened here today,
with representatives from 20 member countries and two
international organizations attending the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus its discussions on current problems
facing the fishery industry in the Asia-Pacific region, the
achievements made by the APFIC and its future direction.
</P>
<P>
Fish has long been a traditional part of the Asian diet and the
fishing industry there has developed rapidly.

China also has rapidly developed in this field, said Zhuo
Youzhan, director of the Fishery Bureau of the Ministry of
Agriculture. In 1997, the country's aquatic-products output

<P>
Zhuo, also president of the current session, acknowledged that
China's fishing industry still faces some problems, such as
declining resources in offshore areas and worsening sea pollution.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this session may offer an opportunity for China
to cooperate with other Asia-Pacific countries in the fishing
industry.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the APFIC hosted two other Beijing

<HEADLINE> Baoshan Iron, Steel Group Buys Into Two Smaller Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Baoshan
Iron and Steel Group will now control 60 percent of Yichang Light
Gauge Sheet Co. Ltd. and its subsidiary Yichang Tin-Coating Sheet
Co. Ltd., said a spokesman from the Baoshan Group today.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the group will also help reorganize
the two companies in a move that is a prelude to a major alliance
the Group will forge with local iron and steel companies.
</P>
<P>
Yichang Light Gauge Sheet Co. Ltd., an important Shanghai
industrial project, has produced and sold 1.33 million tons of
cold-rolled light gauge sheets since May of 1991, when the company
began production, to late 1997. The company has also paid 648
million yuan in taxes during that period.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the company created a new firm with imported
production lines to produce electrolytic tin coating sheet widely
used in food and other can-making industries. The subsidiary
company has a designed annual production capacity of 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
After the assets reshuffle, Yichang Light Gauge Sheet
Co. Ltd. and its subsidiary, Yichang Tin Coating Sheet Co. Ltd
will be jointly operated by Baoshan Iron and Steel Group and five
other companies.
</P>
<P>
The corporate spokesman added that Baoshan will make good use
of its advantages in qualified personnel, management expertise,
technologies and capital to improve Yichang's asset-debt
structure, upgrade equipment, improve product quality of Yichang
companies, realize an optimized distribution of resources and
eventually improve economic benefits.

<HEADLINE> Search for U.S. Bomber Wreckage in Guangxi Progresses Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of military experts
from the United States set off early this morning for Mao'er Hill
in Xing'an County near this tourist resort in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to take part in the third attempt
to find the wreckage of a U.S. B-24 bomber that crashed in 1944.
</P>
<P>
This search has so far produced a pistol case, two bone
fragments and a number of bullets, buttons and coins believed to
belong to the B-24 bomber which went down in action against the
Japanese fleet during World War ll.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the search party Captain Todd Goeheler said that the
search has been progressing "very smoothly" and the close
cooperation between the two sides will have a positive influence
on Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member team composed of mountain climbers,
anthropologists, and demolition and medical experts arrived at
Mao-er Hill on September 8 and began their search on September 15
after a few days of preparation including the clearing of paths at
the venue.
</P>
<P>
Four platforms have been built on the mountain side and the
team began at the bottom by marking key areas with small blue
flags and white cloth ribbons after careful inspection.
</P>
<P>
Each morning at half past seven, the team headed out of their
camps for the search site and returned at four in the afternoon
after a brief lunch at the site.
</P>
<P>
By September 26, the team has finished searching at the fourth
platform and most of the third platform.
</P>
<P>
Goeheler said that people in the U.S. are very much concerned
with this search and the team reports to the departments
responsible in the U.S. everyday, and will eventually report to
the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Congress is satisfied with the team's efforts, said
Goeheler, who also expressed his appreciation for the facilities
provided by the Chinese government, local governments at various
levels and Chinese workers.
</P>
<P>
He said that to avoid bad weather the team selected the best
time to search here as September and October. Unfortunately, the
drought in the northern part of Guangxi resulted in a shortage of
drinking water on the mountain, and the Chinese have helped
take water up to the camps and organized workers, and medical,
safety and other supporting services for the team.
</P>
<P>
The first search began on January 13, 1997, and the second was
conducted between October and November last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An award was launched here
Monday by the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) and the Hong
Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) to recognize the
achievements by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SME Award is funded by the Services Support Fund

(SAR) and is also supported by 14 organizations and trade
associations.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the launch of the award at a press conference,
Thomas Tang, executive director of HKPC, said that SMEs account
for 98 percent of Hong Kong's business establishments and employ
67 percent of the local working population.
</P>
<P>
"Their development and performance are therefore crucial to the
well-being of the Hong Kong company," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the Asian financial turmoil, Hong Kong's businesses
are facing some difficulties at present, Tang said. However,
some SMEs still have achieved good results.
</P>
<P>
They will be singled out as examples for other SMEs and through
the SME Award, their experience for success will be shared among
other SMEs, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Companies employing less than 100 people in manufacturing and
firms employing less than 50 people in service are considered as
SMEs and there are now some 300,000 SMEs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SME Award is the first award tailor-made for
local SMEs to identify success models to spearhead Hong Kong's
continued growth and competitiveness, said Vincent Li, general
manager of the Business Enhancement Services Division of HKPC and
member of the SME Award Working Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the SME Award consists of two categories: The
New SME Award for SMEs of less than 3 years in operation and the
Best Managed SME Award for SMEs of over 3 years in operation.
</P>
<P>
Winners will have an opportunity to build up their business
networking and increase their credit facilities by up to 20
million HK dollars (2.56 million U.S. dollars) with most
preferential interest from East Asia Heller Limited, the sole
sponsor for the award, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Award winners will be invited to take part in a
study mission as Award Ambassadors to share their success stories
with SMEs in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, HKPC has given recognition to the outstanding
achievements of Hong Kong businesses with the Hong Kong Award for
Industry. The Hong Kong Award for Services was subsequently
introduced in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Chancellor Favors Joining Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, Britain, September 28 (Xinhua) -- British finance
minister Gordon Brown said here on Monday that Britain will not
rule out joining the single currency as its economic interests
lies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Labor Party Conference at this northwestern
coastal city, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at a time
when the balance of risks in the world economy is shifting, "a
Britain facing up to the challenges must work with other countries
and implement a reform agenda for global stability and growth."
</P>
<P>
"A Britain which sees that our national economic interest lies
in Europe, that is a zone of stability and growth will reject the
isolationism of the Conservative Party, and refuse to rule out
constructive engagement, particularly on the single currency, on
the basis of ideological dogma."
</P>
<P>
So far Britain has stated it would not join the first wave of
the single currency in the current parliament that ends in 2001
under strong domestic pressure.
</P>
<P>
The European Monetary Union will be launched on January 1, 1999
and 11 out of the 15 EU members have qualified to join the single
currency at the first wave.
</P>
<P>
He said the task of the British government was to make the
country equipped for every challenge of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Brown also said that to ensure global coordination and a better
equipped IMF and World Bank, the British government will put
forward a proposal at next week's IMF meeting in Washington on a
new and pioneering global code of conduct for social policy.
</P>
<P>
He would travel to the IMF on Tuesday personally to argue for
policies for stability, growth and fairness to ensure that our
obligations to the unemployed and the vulnerable are met in every
part of the world.

<HEADLINE> Spain-Hong Kong Trade Remains Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Total trade volume between
Hong Kong and Spain for the first half of this year came to 1.1
billion U.S. dollars, according to an announcement of the Spanish
Trade Commission in Hong Kong Monday.
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that Spain should still see increases in
trade in some segments this year even amid Asian economic
downturn, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The overall figure for Spain's exports to Hong Kong soared by
about 70 percent during the first half of 1998 to hit 478 million
U.S. dollars (about 3.6 million HK dollars), the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said Spanish manufacturers are maintaining
investment and confidence in the important Asian market.
</P>
<P>
Next week Spain will show its strong presence at two large
scale exhibitions, the Asia Pacific Leather Fair (October 5-7) and
the Cosmoprof Asia (October 6-8), at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Tejedor, Spain's trade commissioner in Hong Kong, said
Spain is continuing its investment in the very important Asian
market.
</P>
<P>
"Overall trade results are pleasing and we are seeing a
long-term approach bringing rewards in this vast marketplace," he
said.

<HEADLINE> HK's External Trade Declines in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
re-exports, domestic exports and imports declined in August over a
year earlier. But the overall pace of decline was less severe than
that of July.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed in the external trade figures for August 1998
released Monday by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) decreased by 8.0 percent in August 1998 over a year
earlier to 119.1 billion HK dollars (15.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within this total, the value of re-exports decreased by 7.6
percent to 101.6 billion HK dollars (13.0 billion U.S. dollars),
while the value of domestic exports fell by 10.3 percent to 17.5
billion HK dollars (2.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports decreased by 14.2 percent in August 1998
over a year earlier to 119.9 billion HK dollars (15.4 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of only 0.7 billion HK dollars (89.7
million U.S. dollars), equivalent to 0.6 percent of the value of
imports, was recorded in August 1998. This was distinctly smaller
than the corresponding value recorded in the same month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest trade statistics, a Government
Secretariat spokesman said that the disruption in air cargo
handling services at the new airport in the early part of August
could have exacerbated the rate of decline in the trade aggregates
last month, though perhaps rather less significantly than in July.
</P>
<P>
But in large part, the weak performance of merchandise exports
in August was due to the continued plunge in import demand in the
Asian markets, as well as the ongoing shift in the structure of
external trade towards offshore trading, the spokesman noted.

<HEADLINE> Shots Fired at Israeli Students in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Shots were fired on Monday
at a group of Israeli students in the West Bank city of Hebron,
injuring one girl student, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli students were headed toward the Jewish enclave of
Tel Rumeida in the center of the city when shots were fired at
them from the Palestinian-controlled part of the city and the
female student was wounded in the leg, the Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the Palestinian controlled city in the southern part
of the West Bank with a population of about 130,000. But in the
city, about 450 Jewish settlers are living at Tel Rumeida and
other areas with the protection of the Israeli Defense Force
(IDF).
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the Jewish settlers and local Palestinians in
the city rose considerably last month after 63-year-old Jewish
settler Rabbi Shlmon Ra'anan was stabbed to death at his home in
Tei Rumeida.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the IDF imposed a curfew around the
areas inhabited by the Jewish settlers and a closure of the city,
bringing the shortage of water and food and other hardships to the
Palestinians in the city
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Israeli security forces raided the house of two
Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) members Adel Awadallah
brothers near Hebron, killing all of them.
</P>
<P>
Following this incident, Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Yassin
ordered the Hamas' military wing Izzadin-Kassam to hit Israeli
targets at appropriate times.

<HEADLINE> China's Agricultural Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- In the past two decades,
China's agriculture has grown rapidly, contributing a great
deal to the development of the national economy, according to the
State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms in rural areas have brought more growth in
agriculture, a better industry and employment structure, and a
better standard of living for farmers, the SSB says.
</P>
<P>
In that period, annual average growth has stayed at 6.7 percent
and annual grain output growth at 2.7 percent, well ahead of
population growth for the period.
</P>
<P>
The forest industry output has grown 1.9-fold, animal husbandry
5-fold, and the fishery business 8.2-fold.
</P>
<P>
There has also been an improvement in the rural industrial mix,
with the proportion of farming in the rural economy down 44.2
percentage points since 1978, and the proportion of industry and
services up. In 1997, the industrial sector had the dominant role
in the rural economy, accounting for 62.9 percent of output value.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers now have a better life, thanks to the reform
policies since 1978, with average per capita income in rural areas
going to 2,090 yuan in 1997 from 134 yuan in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The SSB says that the government's policies have been correct,
giving agriculture, especially grain production, top priority,
protecting farmers' interests and implementing the household
contract responsibility system.
</P>
<P>
The problems in agriculture are the low technology level,
vulnerability to natural disasters, the unreasonable employment
structure and resource distribution, and low incomes for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Israel Was Key in Unmasking Iraqi Arms: Inspector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel was quietly
instrumental over the last four years in helping U.N. arms
inspectors uncover how Iraq conceals its weapons of mass
destruction, local daily Haaretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the paper, Scott Ritter, who had
been member of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
disarmament in Iraq, said he made many trips to Israel during his
tenure as arms inspector. "From 1994 to 1998, I was there a lot,"
Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
Ritter quit his post last month in protest against what he felt
was U.S. government's inaction in carrying out the Iraqi arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
He told Haaretz that he had the idea of soliciting Israel's
assistance with the inspections because the UNSCOM was not getting
adequate assistance from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
and other U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
Ritter praised the professionalism Israel showed in working
with the UNSCOM over the last several years. He said that Israel
was taking seriously a U.N. resolution passed after the 1991 Gulf
War calling on all member countries to work closely with the
UNSCOM to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort," Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
"It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by these missiles and not New
York city, and we were actually, frankly speaking, a little
dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of enthusiasm that
emanated from Washington, D.C. on this issue. The (U.S.) treated
(concealment) more as an academic exercise, and I thought Israel
treated it as it is -- a matter of life and death," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ritter also blamed the CIA for instigating the current
investigation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into
whether he engaged in espionage by providing sensitive
information to Israel. Ritter ridiculed the investigation as
"outrageous."
</P>
<P>
First, he indicated that the idea to cooperate with Israel was
authorized by former UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus and each trip was
approved by his superiors.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, he informed the U.S. government of "every
step." Thirdly, being a U.N. official, he had no CIA security
clearance, and therefore even if he wanted to, he would have no
access to top-secret U.S. documents, a point which he says the CIA
recognizes.
</P>
<P>
Ritter insisted that the CIA was motivated more by jealousy
since the UNSCOM had a better working relationship with Israeli
officials than American officials.
</P>
<P>
Since leaving his post last month, Ritter has appeared before
Congressional panels to complain about how the U.S. government
told the UNSCOM not to conduct arms inspection in the last couple
of months in order to avoid confrontation with Iraq. The
U.S. government sharply denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
The interview with Haaretz, which will be published in full
details on Tuesday, is the first time that Ritter addressed in
depth UNSCOM's ties with Israel and its link to the FBI
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The former arms inspector stressed that it was the UNSCOM
tapping Israeli expertise in dealing with cells of militant
groups, not the UNSCOM being used by Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Israel was a fair player on all of this. It was extremely
responsible," Ritter said, adding that "I didn't receive any money
from Israel... I got a shake of the hand, a pat on the back."

<HEADLINE> C'wealth Tax Conf Opens in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The 19th technical
conference of the Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrators
(CATA) opens here Monday morning with improvement of tax
administration as its key theme.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference, which drew hundreds of delegates from
32 of the 45 CATA members, was officially opened by Ugandan Prime
Minister Kintu Musoke.
</P>
<P>
Musoke extended a warm welcome to the delegates and pledged
full support from the Ugandan government for the CATA work so
that its resolutions can be implemented as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over the past 10 years, Uganda has focused on
stabilizing and liberalizing its macro-economy, benefiting much
from the forum CATA provides for exchange of ideas and
information.
</P>
<P>
CATA was formed by the Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting
held in Barbados in 1977. Its aim is to promote and encourage
excellency in tax administration by providing technical support
through training and manpower development, enabling closer
cooperation in this field, harmonizing and modernizing tax
systems.
</P>
<P>
It organizes seminars and workshops for senior tax officers,
collecting, analyzing and disseminating information on tax
administrators as well as carrying out functions related to the
overall improvement of their capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the fourth African country to host CATA after
Nigeria (1992), Tanzania (1994) and Zimbabwe (1996).

<HEADLINE> Hoddle to Sign New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle
announced Monday that he hopes to sign a new contract by the end
of the week - ahead of England's Euro 2000 clashes against
Bulgaria and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
"I have a clause in my four-year contract that we would review
the situation after two years," Hoddle is reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It has not been resolved 100% but I am continuing to talk
with FA chief executive Graham Kelly along the lines of what I
want for the remaining two years.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, it will all be tied up by Friday and then we can
get focused on the two games."
</P>
<P>
The England boss also angrily denied that he forced players to
take "drugs" at the World Cup claiming he informed clubs before
France 98 that players could be blood-tested and given vitamins.
</P>
<P>
Every player in his squad was given vitamin and mineral
supplements and two were prescribed and given boosters by
injection.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson has since questioned the
practice.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid some people must have their heads in the sand,"
Hoddle said, emphasizing all the pills and injections were legal
and prescribed by Dr. Yann Rougier, a biochemist who helped
Arsenal last season.
</P>
<P>
"To suggest there is anything wrong or that the players are on
drugs is outrageous," Hoddle said.
</P>
<P>
"It is so far from the truth. Dr. Rougier has worked with the
best in the world in the last 15 years, with AC Milan and Monaco
and individual athletes."

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Partisan Contention Escalates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The political contention in
South Korea has escalated over the nomination of prime minister
and the issue of corruption at a time when the nation is in
desperate need of concerted efforts to overcome economic woes.
</P>
<P>
Confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties
overwhelmed ever since President Kim Dae-jung was sworn in on
February 25 this year, when the opposition began boycotting the
National Assembly (parliament) to reject President Kim's
nomination of Kim Jong-pil as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The political confrontation has worsened when the opposition
Grand National Party (GNP) took to the streets since last week in
protest at what it called the ruling camp's "politically-
motivated scheme to weaken and break up the opposition" by use of
the prosecutors' investigation of corrupt politicians, mostly in
the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
After the GNP's rejection of the nomination, the ruling camp
stepped up its regrouping by recruiting legislators from the
opposition in a bid to dominate the 299-member parliament, in
which the GNP had 161 seats at that time.
</P>
<P>
The opposition lost its majority in parliament last month after
12 lawmakers defected to the ruling coalition of the National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and the United Liberal Democrats
(ULD).
</P>
<P>
The GNP, which has been boycotting the 100-day regular session
of the parliament due to open on September 10, once threatened to
make its 113 lawmakers resign in protest against the anti-
corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
GNP leader Lee Hoi-chang said "I will fight strongly to end the
politically motivated scheme to destroy the opposition. I am
determined to fight to my end."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Kim and his ruling camp have reiterated
their commitment to pushing ahead with the drive against
corruption, saying that there will be neither democracy nor
economic progress wherever there is corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The government is conducting the work of eradicating
corruption and injustice with a firm determination, and I will set
an example for the nation," said President Kim, who is NCNP's top
leader.
</P>
<P>
The rival political parties are fundamentally at odds over
whether state prosecutors are now conducting the probe of corrupt
politicians and others impartially irrespective of their different
party affiliations.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are probing into the behaviors of some 200 people,
including politicians and ranking public servants, as well as
executives of banking institutions and industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
It is seen as a telling blow to the opposition that the
prosecution found that the GNP had used leading figures of the
Office of National Tax Administration to collect huge sums of
money in donations to support its presidential candidate Lee
Hoi-chang during last year's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling camp has reaffirmed its determination not to engage
in any dialogue or negotiations with the GNP unless the opposition
party apologizes unconditionally for illegal fund-raising through
the National Tax Administration during the presidential
campaigning.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Capacity Utilization Drops in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Manufacturers Association
of Nigeria (MAN) has said that the average industrial capacity
utilization of the country dropped to 27.8 percent in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Punch newspaper Monday quoted MAN as saying in its
half-year economic review that the capacity utilization recorded
29.4 percent and 34 percent in the first and last half of last
year respectively. The review covered the period from January to
June this year.
</P>
<P>
MAN noted that virtually all manufacturing sub-sectors
registered a decline, including the food, beverages and tobacco
sub-sectors, where expectations of better performance were high
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Nominal manufacturing output declined from 40.05 billion Naira
(about 445 million U.S. Dollars) in the first half of last year
to 30.65 billion Naira (about 340 million Dollars), a substantial
drop of 23.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total manufacturing investment amounted to 1.47 billion Naira
(about 16 million Dollars) in the period under review, compared
to 2.26 billion and 2.74 billion Naira in the first and second
half of last year respectively.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the unimpressive industrial
performance during the period to the energy crisis which has
persisted since last February.
</P>
<P>
The protracted scarcity of diesel, fuel and kerosene
interrupted the operations of some factories and forced some
others out of business, MAN added.

LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- There are growing fears in
the United National Independence Party (UNIP) that former
president Kenneth Kaunda may not retire as he intends to continue
with his political crusade, a Zambian national daily said Monday.
</P>

Government-owned Times of Zambia quoted some senior members of
the country's largest opposition party as saying at the weekend
that the party leader Kaunda is planning to ignore the October 4
deadline to honor a retirement deal with the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the state withdrew its charges of imprisonment of
treason against him in early June this year, Kaunda, who ruled
the country for 27 years and was defeated by incumbent President
Frederick Chiluba in 1991, declared that he would retire from
active party politics.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year old veteran politician was arrested last December
for alleged involvement in the country's foiled military coup in
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sources claimed that Kaunda may not take up the house the
government allocated to him last month as part of his retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Kaunda and the government has concluded an
agreement under which he will get all his retirement benefits as
a former president on condition that he retires from active
politics.
</P>
<P>
However, he has not handed a letter of resignation to the
party secretary general as required by the party constitution if
he wants to retire before his term of office expires by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to force Kaunda to retire, the Zambian parliament
recently endorsed the Benefits of Former Presidents Amendment
Bill which states that a former president would lose his benefits
if he participates in active politics and the bill is now only
awaiting presidential assent to become law.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Manpower Outflow Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The outflow of manpower in
Hong Kong slowed down to a decade-low rate in 1997 as the
successful transition has dispersed people's worries about
political uncertainty, according to a survey released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which tracks the latest development of manpower
movement in Hong Kong, shows that 0.54 percent of the total
workforce chose to emigrate in 1997, representing a significant
decrease from 0.82 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The figure is the lowest since 1988, according to the Hong Kong
Institute of Human Resource Management (IHRM), a non-profit
organization which conducts the survey annually.
</P>
<P>
Sara Cheung, research director of IHRM, said Monday: "Before
1997, people emigrated because they were uncertain about Hong
Kong's future. But after a smooth transition on July 1, fewer
people chose to leave."
</P>
<P>
More than 140 companies in a variety of industries participate
in the survey.

<P>
TOKYO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in
Tokyo on Monday despite the collapse of Japan Leasing Corp., a
nonbank affiliate of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
(LTCB).
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 185.53 points, or 1.35
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 13,909.37. The index
temporarily jumped nearly 400 points during the day.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 13.59 points or 1.29 percent to
1,063.52.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section was light at an estimated 370
million shares, almost unchanged from Friday.
</P>
<P>
LTCB was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Japan Leasing Corp. filed for court protection Sunday night
from its creditors, with debts totaling 2.18 trillion yen (about
16.1 billion U.S. dollars), the largest-ever amount seen in Japan
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Traders suspect the Japanese government waged another round of
"price-keeping operations" by snapping up large amounts of Nikkei
index futures. This helped buoy shares across the board on the
cash market as investors filled their arbitrage positions.

Of the 1,342 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 778 to 370, with 143 issues remaining

<HEADLINE> Premier Urges Fulfilment of New Tasks, Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Zhu Rongji
has urged governments in flood-stricken regions to do their best
in helping flood victims put their life on track and ensure they
survive the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
Following president Jiang Zemin's keynote speech at the
national meeting on reviewing the anti-flood efforts and
commendation of anti-flood heros, the premier said the tasks and
goals in the immediate future illustrated in the president's
speech represent another major strategy of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and must be carried out in an earnest
manner.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said one of the concrete steps to carry on the heroic spirit
demonstrated in the anti-flood and rescue efforts is to do a good
job in disaster relief work.
</P>
<P>
Apart from meeting the daily needs of the flood victims,
efforts must be made to repair damaged farmland, water conservancy
facilities and infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
In resuming industrial production, priorities should be given to
optimize structures and improve quality; and in rebuilding
flood-devastated areas, attention should be paid to work out
overall and long-term development plan, with a view to building up
effective flood-control facilities, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the whole country to work diligently in the remaining
three months of the year to strive for the realization of economic
goals projected for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhu presided over today's meeting which was held by the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council. Top Party and state
leaders attended the meeting at the Great Hall of the People along
with some 10,000 people.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Helping Ease North China Province's Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Poverty alleviation project
of north China's Shanxi Province has been funded by the World Bank
since 1995, and local farmers have begun to benefit from 1.74
billion yuan (210 million US dollars) in spending, with 100
million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The project covers 5.55 million local people in some 5,770
villages, according to Zhang Qiuming, deputy director of the
Shanxi Provincial Finance Deparment, who is in charge of the
project.
</P>
<P>
He said the project includes rebuilding irrigation systems,
improving rural roads, and improving village water supplies, land
development, livestock raising and horticulture, and agricultural
processing.
</P>
<P>
So far, 850 million yuan (102 million US dollars) has been put
in, making up 47.8 percent of the planned total, 373 million yuan
(45 million US dollars) of which came from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the money has been used to develop
7,200 ha. of Yellow River banks, terrace 11,300 ha. of hillsides,
and add 62,700 ha. of trees, and to raise more than 30,000 head of
livestock, build five township or village roads and provide
drinking water for 300,000 local people and more than 40,000
animals.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhang said, the development of low-yield land has
raised grain output and forestry and livestock projects have
helped change agricultural structure and increase farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
In the project areas the number of people in need has gone from
1.26 million in 1995 to 780,000.
</P>
<P>
The project has also helped improve local environment and
reduce soil erosion, demonstrating the need for the continued
development of the environment and agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> Japan Leasing Corp. Goes Under With Huge Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan Leasing Corp., one of
three nonbank affiliates of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan (LTCB), said Monday it has filed for court protection from
its creditors under the Corporate Rehabilitation Law.
</P>
<P>
Japan Leasing, the country's second largest nonbank financial
firm, effectively went bankrupt with debts of 2,180.3 billion yen
(about 16.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy is the largest in terms of debts in Japan since
the end of World War II, surpassing the previous biggest failure
of Crown Leasing Corp. in April last year with debts of 1,187.4
billion yen (about 8.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We had sought restructuring of our own, but some of our
creditors have moved to keep intact their claims on loans to us,
making it impossible for us to go through rehabilitation," Hiroaki
Okamoto, president of the company, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
All of the board directors of the company will resign soon to
take responsibility for the collapse, he added.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters earlier in
the day that he wants the Japanese people, particularly those in
the financial markets and industry, to take the leasing company's
failure calmly.
</P>
<P>
"The government will ensure all measures to stabilize the
financial market. I would like to ask people to act in an orderly
manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers, however, said the failure will inevitably deal
a telling blow to the already shaky financial industry.
</P>
<P>
The leasing company has about 165 creditors, including banks,
life insurance firms and financial institutions of the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Japan Leasing, established in 1963 and with 20.2 billion yen
(about 14.8 million dollars) in capital, borrowed from financial
institutions and invested heavily in real estate during the
"bubble" economy of the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The burst of the bubble economy in the early 1990s left it with
a huge burden of accumulated debts.

<HEADLINE> Construction Starts on China's Fast Neutron Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China began construction
today on its first fast neutron reactor power station, which is
scheduled to be completed by 2003, according to Li Zhongping,
deputy director of the China Fast Reactor Engineering Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Located in Fangshan County in southwestern Beijing, the Chinese
capital, the first pilot fast neutron reactor will generate a
thermal power of 65 MWt and an electric power of 20 MWe and will
be used as the base for building China's first commercial fast
neutron reactor power station in the early 21st century, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The reactor is believed to be more efficient, safer, and has a
higher utilization rate of uranium and is significant for China's
energy development in the next century, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will raise the utilization rate of uranium from
around 1 percent in the existing pressurized water reactors to 60
to 70 percent in the new reactors.
</P>
<P>
China's Daya Bay and Qinshan nuclear power plants both use
pressurized water reactors and will continue to play a role in
meeting the country's energy needs, but large-scale development of
pressurized water reactors is difficult in China because of the
country's limited uranium reserves.
</P>
<P>
The main part of this reactor is scheduled to be completed by
December of next year and it will start trial power generating by
the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
China will need an equivalent of 1 billion tons of standard
coal by the middle of the next century, according to a report by
the Ministry of Science and Technology and the State Development
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
China needs to develop its nuclear power generating capacity to
240 million kw by 2050, or 20 percent of its then national
electric power generating capacity, compared with the current one
percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Boosted by Better Asian Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A rise in Asian markets and
a strong performance from key stocks helped the Australian share
market to a one percent gain after a day of modest trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 28.2 points firmer at 2,591.6,
the all industrials climbed 49.2 points to 4,542.0 and the all
resources put on 11.3 points to 1,020.3.
</P>
<P>
The rise followed gains in both Japan's Nikkei, up 185.0 points
to 13,909.0, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng, 244.4 firmer at 7,946.0,
over the day.
</P>
<P>
But brokers noted that local volume for the day was only a
modest 245.7 million shares worth 862.7 million Australian dollars
(500.7 million U.S. dollars) with 464 rising stocks shading 462
falling and 338 steady.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said interest in the broad market was relatively flat
with trade in a few majors accounting for much of the gain in the
all ordinaries index.
</P>
<P>
But while National Australia Bank's volume was strong it was a
weaker performer in the banking sector as it managed to rise just
0.1 percent, or 2.2 Australian cents, to 21.03 Australian dollars,
the lowest rise of the major four Australian banks.
</P>
<P>
The banking index was firmer. It closed 45.2 higher at 5,566.5
points, as Commonwealth Bank of Australia climbed 24 cents to
19.89 Australian dollars, ANZ bank added 12.3 cents to 9.017
Australian dollars and Westpac bank moved up nine cents to 9.58
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The recent strength of the U.S. dollar gold price has
reportedly encouraged a surge in interest in the gold sector by
some funds, almost all of which are considerably underweight in
the sector after months of underperformance.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Firmer on Back of Rate Cut Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
closed stronger Monday, continuing to be influenced by speculation
of an interest rate cut in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, foreign exchange dealer at Australia's
Colonial State Bank, said the local currency shrugged off a
weakening in the Japanese yen and a fall in commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 58.85 U.S. cents from 58.73
U.S. cents in Sydney at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
It traded between 58.58 and 58.97 U.S. cents Monday and was
expected to trade above 59.00 U.S. cents overnight.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment on the market was slightly more positive, although
still uncertain of the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open
Market Committee meeting (early Wednesday morning Australian
Eastern Standard Time).
</P>
<P>
Japan's banking crisis would continue to be a focus for the
market, especially after news that Japan Leasing Corp., an
affiliate of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., had
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said nervousness in the currency market surrounding
the Australian federal election on October 3 was due more to the
possibility of no clear mandate for the party elected, rather than
who wins.
</P>
<P>
"Someone like (Pauline Hanson's) One Nation (Party) getting the
balance of power or the (ruling) Liberals getting in with a small
margin and having difficulty getting its reforms through, would be
a negative," he said.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was buying 79.92 Japanese yen from 79.52 yen
last Friday and 0.9916 German marks from 0.9826 marks.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Edge Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices edged up
Monday as the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) gained 6.61
points to end at 930.53 points.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover was 121.97 million units worth 153.11 million
Singapore dollars (90.36 million U.S. dollars). There were 99
decliners against 89 advancers with 232 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
KepLand was the most active stock of the day as it had a
turnover of 12.30 million stocks traded. It was followed by ERL
w01 that had 11.11 million units done. Heshe was next with 7.08
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Venture led the increase of the day as it gained 32 cents to
close at 5.30 Singapore dollar. UOB F went up 28 cents to finish
at 4.70 Singapore dollars. Venture w99 edged up 28 cents as well
and ended at 4.06 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Auric Pac was the biggest loser of the day as
it lost 25 cents to close at 0.75 Singapore dollars. Transmarco
slid by 14.5 cents to finish at 0.715 Singapore dollars. DelGro
500 shed off nine cents to end at 1.25 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that Monday's marginal rally was encouraged by
expectation of a U.S. interest cut which would prompt local banks
to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The climbing of regional markets also contributed to the
slightly firmer tone in the market, they said.
</P>
<P>
They also said growing market consensus has pegged an expected
rate cut at 50 basis points since anything smaller would be viewed
as ineffective.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Interference to Weaken Malaysian Govt Proved: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Information
Minister Mohamed Rahmat said Monday there was proof of foreign
interference to weaken the Malaysian government following the
sacking of its deputy prime minister and finance minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked on September 2 and was expelled from the
ruling United Malays National Organization (UMNO) a day later for
"low morals".
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said what was being faced now was an internal matter
and Malaysians had the right to solve the problem themselves
without outside interference.
</P>
<P>
Several divisions of the UMNO have been used for the purpose of
toppling Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as the party president,
he told reporters Monday in Johor Baharu, about 370 kilometers
south from here, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that leaders at divisional levels had been paid monthly
allowances of between 5,000 ringgit (1,315 U.S. dollars) and
10,000 ringgit (2,631 U.S. dollars) and some divisions had been
allocated with 1 million ringgit (263,157 U.S. dollars) to 2
million ringgit (526,315 U.S. dollars) to carry out subversive
activities in the UMNO.
</P>
<P>
"We can identify the divisions involved. There is talk that 90
divisions had been used in this way," Mohamed, who is also a
member of the UMNO Supreme Council, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The money they received is to implement programs to topple the
leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the leaders of these divisions to repent and return to
the party's struggle.
</P>
<P>
He said the integrity of the UMNO had been challenged and hence
every member should show loyalty to the party and accept with an
open mind the prime minister's decision to sack Anwar Ibrahim from
the government.
</P>
<P>
They (party members) should also accept the UMNO Supreme
Council's decision to expel Anwar from the party as the move was
to preserve the UMNO's cleanliness, Mohamed added.

At the critical juncture, leading officials at all levels
hurried to the flood sites and fought tenaciously alongside with
soldiers and civilians. Party organizations at grassroots levels
gave full play to the role of the party branch as the political
core and the fighting bastion. Jiang also praised CPC and Youth
League members for their roles as the vanguards and model flood
fighters, saying that they set a very good example for the general
public by being the first to charge ahead and the last to retreat.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the PLA and the armed police, responding to the
call of the Party and the people resolutely, sent over 300,000
officers and soldiers to plunge into the fight against the
floods. They carried on the revolutionary spirit of fearing
neither hardship nor death and kept up the style of fighting
tirelessly and continuously, and played the role of the backbone.
</P>
<P>
He also praised policemen for their active participation in the
battle against the floods, and contributed a great deal to
safeguarding the social order in flood areas.
</P>
<P>
The president said that in all the areas threatened and hit by
the floods, people did not panic over the surging waves, nor did
they become pessimistic or disheartened over the loss of their
homes and their beloved. Despite their sorrow they braced
themselves up to fight the floods. They preferred to save the
major interests of their homeland at the expense of family
interests and to give up local interests to safeguard the overall
interests of the country, exhibiting a very high level of moral
standard and lofty values.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that people engaged in water conservancy,
meteorology, hydrology and other scientific-technological fields
worked day and night and played an important role in offering
technical guidance.
</P>
<P>
Medical and health workers coming from all parts of the country
went right to the front lines to prevent epidemics and cure
diseases, thus ensuring good health of flood-fighters.
</P>
<P>
The media people gave timely coverage of the directives of the
CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and went right to the
flood-fighting forefront, despite hardships and dangers, to
popularize the heroic deeds of flood-fighting soldiers and
civilians, promoting what is right and uplifting the fighting will.
</P>
<P>
The president also praised comrades from the
telecommunications, transportation and other sectors who all gave
top priority to supporting flood control, worked in close
coordination and made important contribution in their respective
capacities.

heros in winning the battle against this year's serious floods in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the

convened in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The president said that throughout the fight, the CPC Central
Committee, paying close attention to the personal safety and vital
interests of the people in the disaster areas, took direct command
of the battle and always pulled together the flood-fighting
soldiers and civilians with one heart and one mind.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, since the beginning of flood season, the central
leadership followed closely the climatic changes and the flooding
situation along the rivers and made timely and thoughtful
arrangements for the nationwide flood-fight.
</P>
<P>
In light of the realities in areas under the threat of the
floods, the central government clearly set forth the strategic
policy of taking strict precautions and defending the dykes to the
last to ensure the safety of the Yangtze embankment, the major
cities and people's lives, and made the important policy decision
of deploying large number of PLA men in a concerted fights along
with civilians to conquer the floods, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
At the most critical moment, the central government, judging
the hour and sizing up the situation and making the right
judgment, issued a general mobilization order, calling on all the
soldiers and civilians to have full confidence and hold their
position steadfastly till the final victory.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters,
unswervingly implementing the policy decision of the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council, made full preparations, overall
arrangements and scientific deployment, gave resolute command and
thus gained the initiative in the flood-fight. These major policy
decisions and their implementation served to guide and ensure the
smooth progress of the flood-fighting and disaster relief work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that party committees and governments at all levels
in the flood-stricken provinces and regions, in an earnest
effort to enforce the policies and decisions of the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council, strengthened the leadership over
the flood control effort and went all out to make a success of
the work of mobilization and organization.

President Jiang said that people across the country offered
heartfelt support to victims of the flooding. Carrying forward the
Chinese nation's fine tradition of fraternity and mutual help,
they selflessly supported the soldiers and civilians on the front
lines of flood-fighting in an all-round way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that during the flood-fighting, 1.2 billion people
in China were united as one, from white-haired senior citizens to
children wearing Young Pioneer's red scarves, from workers,
farmers, intellectuals to cadres at all levels.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Party members and cadres have proved with
deeds that they have deserved the title of honor as members of the
Communist Party and as public servants of the people.
</P>

The president said that our army have also proved with deeds to
be a revolutionary force that deserves the complete trust of the
Party and the people, and a great wall of steel that safeguards
our national security and the people's interests, and defends our
reform, opening-up and modernization drive. PLA officers and men
are the most beloved people of our times, he said.

deeds that the Chinese people have a glorious tradition of unity
and solidarity, fortitude and hard struggle and that the Chinese
nation has an extraordinary cohesive power.

whether the Chinese people would lose their strong cohesion, and
whether the CPC and the PLA would change their nature and purposes
under the new historical circumstances and with diversified
interests of various social sectors.

The great victory in the fight against the floods is another
most telling answer to their question, Jiang said, adding that the

Jiang said that the Party remains committed to serving the
people heart and soul; the political nature of the PLA has not
changed, the PLA is still a revolutionary army under the absolute
leadership of the Party; the Chinese people's adherence to their
fine traditions has not changed. These have not, will not and
shall never be changed.
</P>
<P>
"With such a Party, such an army and such a people, we can
create miracles in the world," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The extremely hard and bitter struggle against the floods, the
severe test of life and death, and the experience of braving the
wind and storm together have strengthened the flesh-and-blood
ties between the Party and the masses, and the fish-and-water
relationship between the army and the people, and reinforced the
solidarity of all our ethnic groups to an unprecedented level,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We should all the more cherish and always carry on such
extremely valuable ideological and political assets," he said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-flood Victory Testifies To Party Leadership Effectiveness: President  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Party General Secretary and
President Jiang Zemin has urged to uphold the leadership of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) which has been proved effective and
decisive in achieving the anti-flood efforts in summer this year.
</P>
<P>
"The victory of our fight against the floods once again proves
that the leadership by the CPC is essential if we are to overcome
difficulties and risks on the road ahead, achieve prosperity and
rejuvenation of our nation and bring well-being to our people,"
Jiang told some 10,000 people attending the grand meeting held in
Beijing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the CPC has the whole-hearted support of the people
and enjoys a high prestige among them and has a strong rallying
power.
</P>
<P>
With the CPC as the leading core of the country, the Chinese
people have been organized to an unprecedentedly high extent and
their extraordinary creativity to transform the society and
exploit the nature has also been greatly enhanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Party has united with and led the entire
Chinese people to overcome one difficulty after another and
achieve success after success, he noted. In the late 1980s and
early 1990s, China stood up to the international and domestic
political disturbances to defend the great undertaking of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and successfully withstood
a severe test of a political risk.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, China has taken effective measures to deal
with the impact of the East Asian financial crisis with composure,
pressed ahead with our reform, opening-up and modernization drive,
and successfully withstood a severe test of economic risks.
</P>
<P>
This time the country conquered the assaults of the
extraordinarily serious flooding, maintained the overall social
stability and economic growth of the whole country, and withstood
a severe test of natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Working side by side and adhering to the leadership of the
CPC, we will surely be able to address all possible complex
situations calmly and overcome all the difficulties or hardships
that might crop up on the way ahead," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Western Nations to Lift Sanctions Against Us: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar has said that the sanctions imposed on
Nigeria would be lifted soon following his discussions with top
leaders of Britain, the United States of America and France.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in capital Abuja Sunday from his six-day
visit to the three countries, the head of state said that "I am
happy we have achieved a lot," according to press reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that Nigeria may soon get debt relief
from its Western creditors, saying that "we went to look for our
relief from the debt burden through the IMF, World Bank, Paris
and London clubs, and the feelers that we got were very positive
and a lot of groundwork has been done."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar told reporters that "first, I was in London where I
had meetings with the Prime Minister, who gave me all the support
to assist us in talking to all these bodies."
</P>
<P>
Then, he added, "I met Bill Clinton who also promised to do
all he can to assist us to resolve some of those problems, and
lastly yesterday (Friday), I met Chirac, who also promised to
continue what he was doing."
</P>
<P>
The French president assured the Nigerian leader that France
was backing the re-admission of Nigeria into the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Britain has already lifted the flight restrictions imposed on
Nigeria and the British Airways has commenced scheduled flights
to Lagos while Nigeria Airways has also announced plans to reopen
flights between Lagos and London.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military delegation led by Assistant Secretary of
Defense for International Affairs Franklin Kramer arrived in
Abuja Sunday to discuss bilateral relations with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The senior military officer said that his visit to Nigeria was
a follow-up of the recent discussions between President Clinton
and his counterpart Gen. Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "we also see an opportunity for extensive dialog
and for consideration of what might be possible in a variety of
areas, including once the transition is completed, in bilateral
military era."

<HEADLINE> Anti-Flood Victory Testifies to Party Leadership Effectiveness: President (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president said the victory shows that China's socialist
system has tremendous advantages. Under the socialist system, he
added, efforts and resources can be mobilized to concentrate on
one major undertaking at a time and the people mobilized and
organized to score significant achievements one after another.
</P>
<P>
During the fight against the floods, all localities and all
departments across China brought into play the spirit of great
unity and close cooperation, as evidenced by the fact that when
one place was in difficulty, help came from all other places and
that all activities of the country were well coordinated just like
moves in a game of chess.
</P>
<P>
They all had their own local and immediate interests
subordinated to the overall and long-term interests, thus
unleashing an enormous and unparalleled force, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The victory tells us once again that the people, and the people
alone are the genuine driving force in the making of history. The
people are the inexhaustible source of strength of all our
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
"Like all the previous historic victories, the victory in the
fight against the floods is, in the final analysis, a victory of
the people," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, the Chinese people have demonstrated the valuable
spirit of helping each other through thick and thin. Once again,
the Chinese nation has demonstrated the heroic courage to work
unremittingly through self-reliance. All the descendants of the
Yan and Huang emperors feel the greatest pride and highest honor
in having such spirit and courage."
</P>
<P>
The victory in the fight against the floods is a great victory
in our persistent endeavor of the reform, opening-up and
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the only path towards accelerated socialist
modernization in China is to adhere to reforms and opening-up, to
constantly expand overseas exchanges and cooperation, and to
earnestly learn from and draw upon all the fine fruits of human
civilization as well as any useful experience that is beneficial
to our economic growth and social progress, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Reinforce 640,000 Troops If DPRK Attacks S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
reinforce 640,000 troops to South Korea if the country is attacked
by forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
according to the Defense White Paper 1998 issued by the South
Korean government Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. enforcement, including Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine forces under the Pacific Command, carrier battle groups and
an amphibious ready group, will join the 690,000 South Korean
troops and the 37,000 U.S. military personnel in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The annual white paper alleged that the DPRK has been further
developing its surprise attack capability on South Korea, posing a
major threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang test-fired a rocket to place a satellite in orbit
last month, surprising the world.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the DPRK, with a 100,000-strong special
forces, now has 1.16-million-strong troops, up 13,000 from last
year and it is producing more Shark-class spy submarines, An-2
infiltration aircraft and amphibious hovercraft for infiltration.
</P>
<P>
One of the arguments the white paper presented to back up its
allegation was that Kim Jong-il's assumption of the DPRK's
National Defense Commission early this month means an increase in
military strength.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK is believed to be capable of producing one to two
nuclear bombs, judging from its capability to extract weapons-
grade plutonium but it is not certain whether the country has
actually produced a nuclear bomb. It seems the DPRK has developed
much of the technology needed to produce one, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Seoul came up with the conclusion as Pyongyang threatened in
April this year to stop sealing nuclear fuel rods in its
facilities, a direct violation of its 1994 agreement to drop its
nuclear program, according to the white paper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPRK maintains eight facilities capable of mass
producing chemical agents and several other facilities to produce
biological agents and weapons, and it has developed various
systems to deliver chemical weapons, including Scud-type missiles,
Rodong and Frog missiles, multiple-rocket launchers, field
artillery, fighters and bombers, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin On Overall National Strength (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A national spirit is an
important measurement of a country's overall national strength,
the Chinese president Jiang Zemin stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
A nation or a country would lose its soul, cohesion and
vitality without a spirit to sustain it, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The overall national strength is embodied mainly in its
economic and technical level. This material strength is the basis
while the spiritual strength, such as the national spirit and
cohesion, is also an important part of the overall national
strength, and is indispensable as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this remark at today's National Conference on Review
and Commendation of Flood Fighting and Disaster Relief Endeavor.
</P>
<P>
He said, in the battle against the floods, our nation and our
people demonstrated a lofty spirit: the spirit of unity and
solidarity, working with one mind and one will; the spirit of
tenacity and fortitude, fearing no difficulties and daring to win
victory. This spirit prevailed in the fight against the floods,
and that is the great flood-fighting spirit.
</P>
<P>
He said, the great unity of will displayed in fighting the
floods gave full expression to the strong cohesion of the Chinese
people. From the thousand-li-long dykes to the capital Beijing,
from the Yangtze River to the Great Wall, from the coastal cities
and provinces to the border and ethnic minorities inhabited
areas, the people of the whole country, both at the flood
fighting forefront and in the rear areas, worked in close
coordination in a concerted effort. Our men and women, old and
young, pooled their strength together.
</P>
<P>
He said, the more critical the juncture of revolution,
construction and reform is, the more clearly the Chinese people
would display such extraordinary spirit of cohesion. With such
cohesion, we will be forever invincible.
</P>
<P>
Putting up a tenacious struggle in defiance of difficulties
embodies the revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people. In this
great struggle, many heroes who charged ahead regardless of their
personal safety or even sacrificed their lives emerged. With the
inspiration of this revolutionary heroism, the Chinese people will
forever stand firm in the family of nations.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin On Overall National Strength (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said, persistence and daring to win reflect the strong will
and confidence of the Chinese people. The more dangerous the
situations grew, the more indomitable the soldiers and civilians
became with their extraordinary courage and will. With this
spirit, no difficulty was insurmountable for them.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin pointed out that according to the Marxist
materialist dialectics, under certain conditions, the spiritual
strength may be transformed into material strength. Powerful
spiritual strength may not only promote the development of
material and technical strength, but also enable certain material
and technical strength to play a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Chinese nation has a great national spirit of its
own. This spirit, which has evolved in the course of several
thousand years, is broad, profound and deeply-rooted. It is an
important part and parcel of the life of the Chinese nation.
Over the past five thousand years, the Chinese nation has
stiffened its belief and will through untold sufferings and
difficulties, opened up the land, built up this beautiful country
and created a splendid Chinese civilization, thus making an
indelible contribution to the progress of human civilization.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, the flood-fighting spirit is a crystallization of
patriotism, collectivism, the socialist spirit, the socialist
moral standards and the glorious tradition and fine working style
of our Party and army. It represents a new development of the
national spirit of the Chinese nation in modern time.
</P>
<P>
He said, like the revolutionary spirit consistently promoted by
the Party and the pioneering spirit of the new era, the
flood-fighting spirit is a valuable spiritual asset of our
people, which should be inherited and upheld by our future
generations and should serve to inspire our cadres and people to
forge ahead from one victory to another.

BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called on the Party and the entire nation to develop the
great flood-fighting spirit and work hard with an enterprising
style to resolve problems that may arise on the way ahead and
complete this year's tasks of reform and development with full
confidence.
</P>
<P>
At the National Conference on Review and Commendation of Flood
Fighting and Disaster Relief Endeavor held here today, Jiang urged
the people in the flood-stricken areas to do a good job of
providing disaster relief, rehabilitating production and
rebuilding their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and
chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that the Party
committees and governments at all levels in these areas should
give top priority to these tasks.
</P>
<P>
He said that they should work out a practical comprehensive
plan on the basis of rational assessment.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to carry out the disaster relief work in an
all-round way and to accomplish the tasks of production
resumption and homeland reconstruction on the principle of taking
care of both production and the basic needs of life, removing both
the immediate and root causes of the floods and considering both
the short-term and long-term interests, he said.

<HEADLINE> Never Slacken Vigilance against Floods: President Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Floods have always been a
serious hidden threat to the Chinese nation. The whole Party and
the nation should never slacken their vigilance against them,
Chinese president Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Conference on Review and Commendation
of Flood Fighting and Disaster Relief Endeavor here this
afternoon, Jiang said that this year's floods have inflicted great
losses and we have paid a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
Natural disaster itself is a bad thing, but it can help people
deepen their understanding of the law of nature in their fight
against it and draw useful conclusions from it. When this is done,
they will be able to make the nature serve their life and social
progress, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We should seriously sum up the experience in the recent flood
fighting efforts. We should deepen our understanding of the
importance of further improving our ability to ward off natural
disasters, more vigorously pursuing economic development and
social progress, and making more scientific and rational planning
and arrangements," he noted.
</P>
<P>
This is a very important job and the Party and the nation must
seize time to accomplish it, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred years ago, Frederick Engels pointed out
that mankind could make the nature serve its purpose and control
the nature by changing it, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"But in every step we take, we should bear in mind that
mankind can not govern the nature outside the nature. All our
ability to control the nature lies in our understanding and
correct application of the law of nature," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people can not have an instant comprehensive
understanding of the law of nature. All laws can be clearly
recognized and cognized by people only after a certain phenomenon
repeats itself numerous times.
</P>
<P>
What was not cognized by people in the past can be understood
today, he said, adding that what we do not understand today will
be understood in the future, and what is important is that we must
try to understand the law of nature, correctly manage it and
learn to follow it to facilitate our economic development and
other social undertakings and obtain a coordinated development of
the economy and ecological environment.

<HEADLINE> Never Slacken Vigilance against Floods: President Jiang (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that since the founding of New China, the
Party and the country have all along attached importance to the
prevention of and fight against natural disasters. They have led
and organized people in water-conservancy work to harness rivers
and lakes, in large-scale afforestation and water and soil
conservation programs and in the building of flood-control
facilities.
</P>
<P>
All this work which we had done over a long period of time
played an important role in our fight against the floods this
year, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
"But generally speaking, our ability to prevent and fight
floods is still inadequate and there are still many problems in
water-conservancy work and comprehensive harnessing program. All
these problems call for urgent solution," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that this year's big floods were mainly due to the
unusual climate and a high concentration of rainfall. That is to
say, it was primarily a natural disaster. Needless to say, we
should face squarely such problems as severe ecological
deterioration, the silting up of rivers and lakes and inadequate
water-conservancy facilities, earnestly sum up experience and
lessons and work out practical and effective measures to better
prepare ourselves against natural disasters and more effectively
mitigate possible damages done by such disasters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Central Government has outlined the general
objectives for improving ecological environment and
water-conservancy construction, and the State Council has already
drawn up a detailed plan for that. All localities and departments
should, according to their own conditions, make prompt arrangements
for achieving these objectives with priority given to effectively
improving the ecological environment, harnessing lakes and rivers
and building flood-control and water-conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
"In a word, the basic purpose is to develop our capacity for
flood control fundamentally through a comprehensive harnessing
program," he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) with Jiang Zemin at the core were
credited by several representatives of people from all over China
with the "great victory" in the fight against the two months of
flooding in China this year.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of five flooded provinces along the Yangtze
River and two provinces and one autonomous region in the North,
military officers and enlisted personnel who participated in the
disaster-relief efforts, and representatives of various political
and social organizations spoke at a grand gathering today to
celebrate the victory.
</P>
<P>
They were: Party chief of Hubei Province Jia Zhijie, Party
chief of Heilongjiang Province Xu Youfang, Commander of the
Guangzhou Military Area Command of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) Tao Bojun, Chairman of the Central Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang He Luli, and First Secretary of
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Secretariat Zhang Dinghua.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee and Jiang Zemin have shown their
outstanding leadership ability by making the correct decisions and
giving prompt orders, these representatives said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang was credited with the fundmental guidelines for
the military and civilians along the Yangtze River and the "do or
die" command at the beginning of the flood fight.
</P>
<P>
At crucial moments, Jiang went to dykes along the river himself
to inspect the situation and offer further guidance.
</P>
<P>
The fight against the floods also reflects the unity of the
military and the people, He Luli said, pointing to officers and
men alike who gave no thought to their own safety when rescuing
others, to flood victims who were willing to sacrifice their own
interests for the interest of the whole, and people in other areas
who made generous donations to the victims.

Tao Bojun said the PLA is under the absolute leadership of the
Party and that serving the people is its sole purpose, and that it
will actively help people in flood-ravaged areas rebuild homes and
rehabilitate production in accordance with directives of the Party
Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
He Luli said this victory demonstrated once again that with the
CPC leadership, the socialist system, the economic power and
national strength, and creativity of the people, the Chinese can
be an unbeatable power producing miracles to confront all
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dinghua said that social organizations act as a bridge
between the Party and the people and will find various ways to
help the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Jia and Xu, both representing the provinces and autonomous
regions, expressed their gratitude to the Party Central Committee,
the State Council, the Central Military Commission, the military
and the armed police, and people from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Jia said he is confident that people in flooded areas along the
Yangtze River will carry forward their new spirit in their
rebuilding efforts and strive for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the frost season has almost come to the Northeast and
the temperature will be down to freezing in October so the local
government will have little time to see to it that the homeless
have a safe winter but he said that people in the flood-hit areas
will mainly rely on themselves and recover all losses in one year.

<HEADLINE> Religious Leader: Khomeini's Fatwa Must Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A top Iranian religious
leader reaffirmed that the fatwa or religious decree on the
British writer Salman Rushdie was irrevocable and must be
implemented, local daily Tehran Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to announce that the fatwa is neither
revocable, not alterable and now its implementation is obligatory
on all Muslims throughout the world," the paper quoted a statement
issued by Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel Lankarani on Sunday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Lankarani is one of the seven Marja' Taghlid (Imitation
Source) announced by the Qom Seminary for the Shiite Muslims and
has the authority to issue fatwa.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Lankarani said that Britain imagined the
fatwa issued by the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini has been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Islamic seminaries and the revolutionary
people of Iran and the Islamic system would never allow the fatwa
to be overshadowed by day-to-day foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
So far, Lankarani has been the highest Iranian religious figure
who made comments on the recent agreement between Iran and Britain
over the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Britain on Thursday agreed to upgrade their diplomatic
relations to ambassadorial level after Tehran assured that the
Iranian government would not take action or assist anyone to
threaten Rushdie's life.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion in Iran noted that the Iranian government
did not make any change in its policy toward Rushdie and his
book the Satanic Verses, which was believed to have insulted the
Islamic Prophet Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
Lankarani blamed the Iranian government for giving the
assurance to London, saying that "if the government of the
Islamic Republic of Iran does not intend to assist the
implementation of this fatwa, it must be among the prime
supporters."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that Rushdie's book was indeed prepared by the
British government and the author confessed the book was written
under the supervision of the British government.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Bombs Ugandan Village: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Congolese (K) planes have
bombed Bukaka village of western Bundibgyo District, about five
kilometers inside Uganda, a Ugandan military officer claimed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's official newspaper The New Vision Monday quoted an
unidentified officer as saying that the war planes made a snap
attack at Bukaka before the Ugandan armed forces responded with
fire. He did not say when.
</P>
<P>
"After dropping the bombs, the planes retreated to Congo (K).
I think such attacks are intended to provoke us into action, but
we have first to study the situation," said the officer.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bombing of the Uganda territory was the
second time in about two months by Congolese war planes. The
first time took place also in Bundibugyo in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebellion erupted at Goma in eastern Congo on
August 2 and quickly spread to other areas of the country.
Congolese President Laurent Kabila has accused Uganda of backing
the rebels, but Kampala immediately denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni recently admitted the
military presence of Ugandan troops in the vast central African
country for safeguarding the national security of his own
country. He also reaffirmed that Uganda may get involved in the
war only for its own security.
</P>
<P>
The eight-week long conflict in Congo drew regional and global
attention. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the
international community are making fresh efforts in a bid to
solve the problem through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arab Villagers Launch Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- All Israeli Arab villagers
around the Arab town of Umm Al-Fahem joined a general strike on
Monday to protest against police's crackdown on protesters on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The general strike decision was made Sunday night by the
Israeli Arab Leadership Monitoring Committee following violent
clashes between Israeli police and local Arab residents in which
over 90 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's clashes erupted near Umm Al-Fahem, 30 kilometers
southeast of the port city of Haifa, when police moved in in the
morning to tear down a tent erected by Arab protesters who claimed
about 50 hectares of their land were unfairly confiscated by the
Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The Arab protesters threw rocks and firebombs at the police,
who responded with tear gas and rubber-coated metal bullets. The
clashes lasted till midnight.
</P>
<P>
Most of the injured were brought to hospitals with light or
moderate injuries.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured was Umm Al-Fahem Mayor Sheikh Raad Saleh,
who was hurt in his shoulder and back.
</P>
<P>
At least nine policemen were injured during the clashes by
rocks and Molotov cocktails hurled by protesters.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army said that the disputed area, near the northern
edge of the West Bank, is an army's firing range. The army also
said that an agreement was reached with the residents to
nationalize about 50 hectares of land in exchange for about six
times as much land elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
But Saleh, before he was injured, charged that there was a
hidden agenda behind the expropriation of the land -- to build a
new Jewish city of Irron with 30,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Saleh's injury fueled the flames and the protesters increased
the rain of stones, bottles and other objects. As many as 800
policemen and border policemen became involved.
</P>
<P>
Close to midnight, the police announced that it was pulling
out of Umm Al-Fahem after an agreement was reached with local
leaders. Under the deal, the land will remain in the hands of
local residents until December, while officials from both sides
try to reach a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Laws Affects Kenya's Bid to Nab Faulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Efforts by Kenya's maritime
administrators to nab ships flouting the recently introduced
International Safety Management (ISM) Code are being hampered by
lack of appropriate laws, the East African Weekly said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shipping sources have expressed fears that Kenya's Indian
Ocean port of Mombasa could still be a safe haven for unseaworthy
vessels as other maritime states clamp down on ships that fail to
comply with the ISM Code.
</P>
<P>
Captain Fred Wahutu, Kenya's Assistant Merchant Shipping
Superintendent, said although Kenya had ratified most of the
conventions required for effective port control by the state, it
had yet to enact appropriate local laws.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful what we detain a ship for... lest
a principal (ship owner) dig deeper into our books," he was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the powers to implement effective port state
control could only come from parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Merchant Shipping Act was reviewed in 1994 by
International Maritime Organization lawyers and local maritime
experts who called for its immediate legislation. But so far the
revised Act has yet to be tabled in parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, industry sources have asked parliament to treat the
matter urgently, saying Kenya stood to lose a lot in the absence
of up-to-date maritime laws, said the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is among 19 maritime states that signed the Indian Ocean
Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, which is aimed
at barring all unseaworthy ships from the region by January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The document also aims to establish cooperation in port state
control, harmonizing inspection and fostering information
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Other signatories were Australia, Bangladesh, Ethiopia,
Eritrea, India, Djibouti, the Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Myanmar, Oman, Seychelles, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan,
Tanzania and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The International Maritime Organization extended the initial
July 1 deadline for the implementation of the first phase of the
ISM code by two months. The initial phase of the program applies
to passenger ships, tankers, and bulk carriers.
</P>
<P>
Other non-bulk cargo vessels and mobile offshore drilling
units of more than 500 gross weight tonnage (gwt) have to comply
by July 1, 2002.

ANKARA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zaman (Time)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has said that
Turkey is firmly opposed to any plan to establish a Kurdish state
in northern Iraq and the territorial integrity of Iraq should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
The recent peace accord signed by two warring Iraqi factions,
the Kurdistan Democratic Party and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan,
promoted Turkey's worries over the formation of a Kurdish
administration in northern Iraq which has turned into a power
vacuum since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish government and military leaders are expected to
bring up the Turco-Syrian relationship at the National Security
Council meeting which will convene Wednesday. The alleged Syrian
support for Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) will
be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of backing and shielding the PKK
militants, but Damascus has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- After attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York,
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz arrived in Mexico City on
Sunday for an official visit to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
This is part of Turkey's efforts to expand its ties with the
American countries. Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem is also
to kick off a South America tour later this year.

He pointed out at this very moment, we should express our deep
longing for and profound condolences to the martyrs who sacrificed
their lives in the battle against the floods and to our fellow
countrymen who died in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the flood season this year started with
abnormal weather, which obviously brought about too much rain to
most regions in China and continuous heavy rain to some regions,
thus doubling and redoubling the volume of rainfall which lead to
serious floods in some areas.
</P>
<P>
He continued, the whole Yangtze River valley was hit by another
serious flood this year following the one that happened in 1954,
with eight flood crests appearing successively. For a long period
of time, the water levels exceeded historical records along the
360-km-long Yangtze River section starting downward from Yichang
city and in the Dongting and Boyang lakes, and the water in the
Shashi city section of the Yangtze River once reached a high level
of 45.22 meters.
</P>
<P>
Record-breaking serious floods also hit the Nenjiang River and
Songhua River valley, with three flood crests appearing
successively. For some time, the Xijiang River, a tributary in
the Pearl River valley, and the Minjiang River in east China's
Fujian Province also experienced serious floods.
</P>
<P>
In numerous cities and vast stretches of the rural areas along
the rivers or around the lakes in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui,
Jiangsu, Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, the economic and social development and the
safety of people's lives and property all came under the threats
from serious floods, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls Victory over Floods Great Achievement of Chinese People (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that to conquer the floods resolutely was a
major struggle aimed at protecting the safety of people's lives
and property and defending the achievements of China's reform,
opening-up and modernization drive. It was also a rigorous test on
the courage, confidence and strength of the Chinese people in
combating natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that under the leadership of the CPC Central
Committee, the entire Party, army and the people took swift and
urgent action against the flood. He said that the vast numbers of
cadres and the broad masses of people in the flood-stricken
provinces and regions, in particular, joined forces with the
officers and men of the PLA and the armed police, who came to
their assistance, in a vigorous, stirring, life-and-death battle
to repel the floods and turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
Eventually they succeeded in ensuring the safety of the main
embankments along the major rivers and lakes, the key cities, the
transport trunk lines, and people's lives and property, thereby
bringing down to the minimum the losses caused by this
extraordinary natural disaster. Jiang called it a remarkable great
achievement.
</P>
<P>
The president said that our people, our people's armed forces,
and the vast numbers of our Party and cadres added a new and
splendid chapter to the annals of progress of the Chinese nation
with their heroic action. It will go down in history as a
magnificent feat in mankind's fight against natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the courage and strength exhibited today by the
Chinese people in conquering natural disasters and all kinds of
difficulties and obstacles are seldom seen in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the victory in the fight against the
floods, with its tremendous impact, is encouraging and impelling
the people in the disaster areas to overcome all difficulties in
their endeavor to resume production and rebuild their homes, and
is inspiring and encouraging the entire Chinese people to go all
out to fulfill their strategic tasks for trans-century development.
</P>
<P>
He said its great significance and far-reaching influence will
be felt in the whole historical process of our cause to build
socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Telex service will be phased

<HEADLINE> Nairobi, Dar Listed As Big Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Capitals of Kenya and
Tanzania have become major drug trafficking conduits, a report by
the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) says.
</P>
<P>
Four Nigerians and one Kenyan were arrested at Nairobi's Jomo
Kenyatta International Airport at the weekend while attempting to
smuggle into Kenya cocaine worth four million Shillings (67,000
U.S. Dollars) by registered mail.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said Monday that the drug initially posted from
Colombia, was intercepted by U.S. customs officials in Miami,
Florida. The U.S. authorities then alerted Kenya after the drug
was re-posted to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interpol report, nationals of Kenya and
Tanzania are increasingly engaging in trafficking drugs from the
Far East to western Europe. Their main source of heroin is
believed to be Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Large consignments of drugs were unknowingly taken to Europe
from Asia via Africa by some of the major European airlines, as
did a number of African airlines, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of heroin seizures has identified the main African
transit areas as airports at eastern and southern African
capitals.
</P>
<P>
To combat this wave, Interpol had invested 20 million French
Francs in modernizing telecommunications in African national
central bureaux and regional stations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Interpol help, officials from the police,
immigration and customs departments of eastern and southern
African states attended a training seminar on drug law
enforcement in Arusha, northern Tanzania in mid September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Company Eager to Modernize Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. defense giant General
Dynamics is trying hard to win over the deal to upgrade Turkey's
M-80 A1 and A3 tanks from the Israeli hands, local newspaper Daily
News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Turkish defense officials as saying that
Turkey and Israel had agreed in principle that the 600 aged
American-made tanks would be modernized by the Israeli Military
Industries and the charge for each tank is 1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said that it would not take a long time to
finish the modernization.
</P>
<P>
But General Dynamics has asked Israel to give up this deal with
Turkey, Turkish officials said, but without giving further details
of the behind-scene U.S.-Israel bargain. The U.S. company charges
6 million dollars for the modernization of each tank.
</P>
<P>
They said that both Turkish and Israeli sides are aware of this
situation and it is now up to the Israeli government to decide
whether or not to go ahead with the deal.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have cooperated very closely in the defense
industry field during the last few years in an effort to ensure
their own state security in the unstable Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
This relationship has triggered harsh criticism from Iran and
some Arab countries which accuse Ankara of betraying the
interests of the Muslim world by forming a military alliance with
the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Defends Entry of Cathay Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Monday defended his administration's decision of allowing
Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways to ply domestic routes
following the closure of the national carrier Philippine Airlines
(PAL).
</P>
<P>
He said the entry of Cathay Pacific Airways was merely a
temporary measure to fill in the vacuum left by PAL's closure on
September 23.
</P>
<P>
"I am here just for the interests and welfare of the country.
This is an emergency, so we have to do our best so we will not
disrupt the flow of passengers and business," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the government favored Cathay Pacific Airways
over local airlines in coming up with this decision, the president
said his administration will maintain its policy of fair play in
the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific can not continue running PAL's domestic routes
should PAL reopen. In addition, it also can not get more shares in
PAL than that allowed by law, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific is one of several foreign airlines negotiating
with a government-appointed management committee to take control
of PAL which owed its creditors over two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We can not violate the law, maybe they can just take the
management," Estrada said, referring to a constitutional provision
limiting foreign shares in Philippine business to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific planes began flying the major domestic routes
Monday morning.

BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and the State Council are holding a grand
meeting here at 3:00 p.m. today to review the recent nationwide
flood-fighting efforts and to commend those who contributed
tremendously to the victory over the disaster.
</P>

which is being attended by approximately 10,000 people across the
country.
</P>

<P>
WELLINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- DNA from toads and
silkworms would be added to New Zealand potatoes in an official
genetic engineering experiment in Canterbury Plain in New
Zealand's South Island, the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Institute for Crop and Food Research of New Zealand is
planning to start two five-year projects trying to make "potatoes
resistant to soft rot bacteria and tuber moth larvae", researcher
Jeanette Fitzsimons was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
As part of field trials, DNA sequences derived from toads,
silkworms and various plants and bacteria would be tested in
potatoes, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Very few people know of this idea to add animal and insect
genes to one of our staple foods and I would urge them to give
their opinions of this plan," Fitzsimons said.
</P>
<P>
"If we did that, we would have a huge marketing opportunity as
producers of clean, healthy food," she said.

<P>
In his opening speech, Premier Zhu said the Chinese people,

arduous struggle against the worst flooding of the country this
summer.
</P>
<P>
"Heart-stirring deeds and anti-flood heros emerged in large
numbers during the flood-fighting and rescue operation, and they
fully demonstrated the close ties between the Party and the
people, between officials and the rank and file, and between the
people's army and the civilians," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
While summing up the experience of the anti-flood efforts and
commending the outstanding figures, the meeting will encourage
people of the whole country to carry out the heroic spirit
demonstrated in the anti-flood efforts, mobilize people in the
disastrous areas to work diligently in rehabilitating production
and rebuilding their homeland, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
The premier called on the whole country to rally around the
Central Party Committee headed by Jiang Zemin, further advance
the causes of reform and opening-up and do a good job in all
fronts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Georges Strikes U.S. Southern Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Georges struck
the coast areas of the Gulf of Mexico Sunday, bringing high wind
and heavy rain that drove thousands of people in southern Alabama,
Mississippi and Luisiana into shelters, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane stirred up seven-meter-high waves that clipped
off fishing piers along Alabama's coast, smashing over concrete
walls to demolish a fishing pier.
</P>
<P>
In the coast areas of Alabama, several roads were closed
because of flooding, downed trees and toppled utility poles.
Thousands were without power and shelters filled up as the storm
intensified.
</P>
<P>
In Mississippi, widespread power outages were reported as the
storm advanced with wind gusts up to 88 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, high winds knocked out power to at least 38,000
customers in the southeastern part of the state. Tens of thousands
flocked to the city's nine shelters.
</P>
<P>
Thousands fled New Orleans and more than 1.5 million people
were ordered or urged to vacate the city and coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
All flights in and out were canceled. A curfew was in place for
New Orleans and surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Along the Gulf Coast in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, many
schools were closed at least through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By 11 p.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was about 110 kilometers
south-southeast of Biloxi, Mississippi, and about 170 kilometers
east-southeast of New Orleans. Wind blew at about 170 kph, and
forecasters said that might increase to 190 kph.
</P>
<P>
Georges was moving north-northwest. The National Hurricane
Center said that the hurricane's center was expected to reach the
Gulf Coast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Georges was viewed as the most serious storm to threaten New
Orleans since 1969, when Camille slammed into the coast of
Mississippi and Louisiana, causing flooding as far north as
Virginia and West Virginia and killing 259 people.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 deaths had been blamed on the hurricane in the
Caribbean. No lives have been reported lost in the United States
since the storm struck the nation's southern coast on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Seek Emergency Aid From WB, IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
negotiate with the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for emergency assistance, particularly for balance of
payment support to meet import needs, The Financial Express daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Finance Minister S.A.M.S Kabria while
talking to an independent news agency in Dhaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The minister is scheduled to leave here for Ottawa, Canada, on
Sunday to attend the Commonwealth finance ministers conference,
and then he will go to Washington to participate in the annual
conference of the WB and IMF to be held there early next month.
</P>
<P>
He would seek a total of 335 million U.S. dollars -- 200
million from the WB and 135 million from the IMF -- as emergency
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will be held during the two financial
agencies' conference.
</P>
<P>
"There are matters to be negotiated, and they might ask us to
meet certain conditions, to meet certain reforms which are usually
tough to meet," Kabria predicted.
</P>
<P>
He added that during his address to the conference he would
appeal for assistance to rebuild the flood-ravaged Bangladesh.
"I'll tell them about the trail of devastation left by the longest
ever flooding."
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to us that donors are responding with
additional funds to repair the infrastructure," he said. "All the
donors whom I met told me that they will provide assistance to
repair and reconstruct the damaged infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
This is the main reason for the country's appeal for emergency
assistance from the WB and the IMF, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Huge food import, necessitated by a staggering crop loss of at
least two million tons of grain due to flooding, would put a heavy
burden on the country's foreign exchange reserve if the import
bills are not met by additional foreign exchange funds.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to import one million tons of
foodgrains, of which tender for only one-third has been floated.
</P>
<P>
The worst-ever flooding in a century in Bangladesh had gripped
as much as two-thirds of the country for ten weeks and affected
about half its 127 million people, with nearly 30 million of them
hit seriously, leaving over 1,000 dead and inflicting a
preliminary estimated loss of about 3.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Arena's Coach Status Is Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- D.C. United president
Kevin Payne has informed U.S. Soccer Federation officials that he
will not release coach Bruce Arena from his contract to be the
head coach of the U.S. national soccer team here today.
</P>
<P>
Payne said if Arena were allowed to coach both teams for a
short period, it would be possible.
</P>
<P>
Arena, the leading candidate to become the U.S. national team
coach, in in the third year of a four-year deal with the D.C.
United team, which closed its regular season today.
</P>
<P>
USSF officials had planned to name a new coach before the
U.S.team's next game on November 6 against Australia in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
United's Major League Soccer season cuold last until October
25, when the league's championship game is scheduled to be
played. But United also is finalizing plans to play Brazilian
power Vasco da Gama in the Interamerican Cup in consecutive
weekends in November, and Payne said he wants Arena to guide the
club in those games.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the Inteamerican Cup to be extremely important
for us, the league and for soccer in the United States," Payne
said of the event, which matches the North American club champion
against the South American titlist. "We want Bruce coaching us in
that."
</P>
<P>
Concerning a possible offer from the USSF, Arena said:"I'm not
worried about it now." Arena said. Asked if he had been in
contact with any USSF officials in the past week, Arena did not
respond.
</P>
<P>
USSF President Bob Contiguglia did not return phone messages
Two USSF sources said Arena - the only American among the four
finalists - remains the front-runner, but Contiguglia still wants
to talk to Carlos Queiroz, a former Portugal national team coach
who has worked as a USSF consultant.
</P>
<P>
Both sources also said Bora Milutinovic, the U.S. World Cup
coach in 1994 who took over the MLS's New York/New Jersey
MetroStars last week, and former Brazil coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira have fallen behind the other two candidates.
</P>
<P>
As the national coaching saga continues, Arena is concerned
about getting United ready for its playoff opener Wednesday.

To the Nepalese, the Hindus in particular, Dashain means
happiness, joy, fun and family reunion as well as victory by the
good over the evil.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, all the people set up a sacred chamber at home, where
they worship Goddess Durga every morning and evening and grow
jamara, barley seeds planted in the sandy soil brought from the
holy river.
</P>
<P>
Durga temples in different places are thronged with devotees as
well at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
People receive from the elders Tika, a red mark of combination
of rice, vermilion powder, curd and jamara as a symbol of
happiness, longevity, progress and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, ministers and other personalities gather at
the royal palace to receive Tika, jamara and blessings from the
king, just as the ordinary people do.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, Dashain is also a moment for family reunion.
</P>
<P>
Wherever they may be, people try to join their families at this
time of the year.
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, the usually overcrowded and noisy Kathmandu
experiences a tranquillity hard to come by as more than half of
its population is said to desert it for hometowns.
</P>
<P>
New clothes, delicious food and merrymaking are desires of all
the families on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
For children living in the urban areas, playing colorful kites
under the sunny and blue sky is truly a great treat as the monsoon
season has gone.

<HEADLINE> Preliminary Official Results Confirm Schroeder's Triumph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The preliminary official vote
statistics have confirmed a landmark victory for Germany's Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and its chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder in the country's general elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary official results released early
Monday morning, the SPD scored 40.9 percent of the vote against
35.2 percent for Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
(CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) conservative alliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ecologist Greens, the potential junior partner
in a SPD-led ruling coalition, scored 6.7 percent against 6.2
percent won by the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the junior partner
in Kohl's current ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which grew out of the
former East Germany's communist party, also broke the 5-percent
mark for the first time since the German reunification in 1990 by
winning 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SPD is eligible for 298 seats in the Bundestag (lower house
of parliament) compared with 245 seats for Kohl's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The Greens would get 47 seats, the FDP 44 and the PDS 35.
</P>
<P>
It means that if the SPD and the Greens could negotiate a
so-called "Red-Green" coalition, they would have a relatively
comfortable majority of 21 seats in parliament.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Expected to Recover Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Good progress in structural
and financial reforms in Thailand will help lead to economic
recovery by mid-1999, Merrill Phatra Securities said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-U.S. joint venture said in a statement available here
Monday that Thailand is close to a return to international capital
markets as indicated by economic factors.
</P>
<P>
While Thailand's financial markets held a minute share of
global market capital -- about 0.11 percent, opportunities had
opened as the economy was expected to recover.
</P>
<P>
Mexico took about 18 months to recover from its currency and
economic crash in late 1994. Similar parallels between Thailand
and Mexico could be drawn, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the first step on the road to recovery was to correct
imbalances in exchange rates, trade and current accounts.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the baht has stabilized at 41-42
to the U.S. dollar. On Friday it jumped to 38-39, aided by
portfolio investment flows and a weaker dollar in anticipation of
U.S. interest rate cuts this week.
</P>
<P>
Short-term interest rates have also fallen sharply in recent
months, causing growth in bank deposits to slow down and
investment flows to increase, in anticipation of higher returns.
</P>
<P>
Continued moderate inflation would help strengthen confidence,
leading to economic growth and a pickup in real wages and
employment.
</P>
<P>
Increased equity in investments, particularly from abroad,
means that equity would begin to replace past reliance on bank
loans as the foundation for the country's investment base.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debt stands at just under 90 billion U.S. dollars, with
up to 40 percent short-term. While most companies have been able
to restructure and roll over loans, the heavy dependence on debt
for operating and investment capital has placed many companies in
a squeeze for cash.
</P>
<P>
Among the most attractive investment choices for foreign
investors are state enterprises, particularly in energy, transport
and telecommunications, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Export 380,000 Tons of Coffee Bean in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will export 380,000
tons of coffee bean in the 1997-98 fiscal year ending October,
which is expected to earn more than 500 million U.S. dollars,
according to latest official reports.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now ranks second in Asia in terms of coffee production
and first in Asia for coffee export volume. Most of its coffee is
of the robusta variety.
</P>
<P>
More than 82 percent of Vietnam's coffee was bought by the
United States, Germany, Spain, Britain, Italy, Poland, France,
Austria, the Republic of Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged drought this year is estimated to cause losses of
between 80,000-100,000 tons of coffee bean to the coming 1998-99
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, coffee growers still cherish a hope to harvest between
380,000 to 400,000 tons of bean and attain an export earning of
560 million dollars next year, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country has about 300,000 hectares of coffee
land and plans to expand the acreage to 350,000 hectares by the
year 2005, aiming to bring national coffee output to
420,000-450,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also being made to cultivate the arabica variety of
coffee, which has a higher economic value, and to improve coffee
processing technology, the reports added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Union leaders in other
sports said it doesn't look like the NBA's current stalemate will
have a happier ending.
</P>
<P>
"Management is taking a very hard-line stance in a belief that
the players will buckle," said Don FEhr, executive director of
the U.S. Major League Baseball Players Association. "If they
don't, then the league is in the soup."
</P>
<P>
The NBA lockout is approaching its third month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. national hockey league owners in 1994 locked out
players, resulting in the cancellation of 34 games at the start
of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
The national football league's 1987 player strike forced the
cancellation of one week's games, and three other week's games
were played with replacement players.
</P>
<P>
Bob Goodenow, head of the NHL Players' Association, blames NBA
Commissioner David Stern for the league's labor predicament.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think David has a respect for his players and his
product," said Goodenow, who negotiated his labor agreement with
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, a former NBA official. "His
inability to put a program together without resorting to this
attack on the players - which is what this is - makes me wonder
what his true intentions are."

<HEADLINE> US Warns Yugoslavia of Possible NATO Actions in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said Sunday that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will be forced to take action in Kosovo if
Yugoslavia does not take the U.N. warning.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who traveled to Bosnia-Herzegovina from Macedonia, told
reporters in Sarajevo that NATO is drawing up plans for actions by
air.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the progress achieved in stabilizing the
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be at stake if the
current situation in Kosovo continued.
</P>
<P>
According to Cohen, the international community wished to see
an early end to the Kosovo conflicts, which would enable the
return of a large number of refugees, and called for negotiations
between the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovo Liberation Army
which fights for the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has been urged by many other countries including the
United States to stop military actions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During his Bosnian trip, Cohen held talks with the
International High Representative, Carlos Westendorp, and the
chief of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Robert Barry.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the general elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Cohen said that the United States will cooperate with all Bosnian
political leaders who have received the people's vote of
confidence but only under the condition that they support the
Dayton Agreement, not by words, but with deeds.

<HEADLINE> Price System Plays Active Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China's current price system
is playing a bigger role in the country's two-decade-old
market-driven economy than that during the era of command economy.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily" reported today that in China now, prices of about
93 percent of products at the retail level are set by the
market. Those decided by authorities account for only six percent
and the prices allowed to move inside a government-set range
account for the remaining one percent.
</P>
<P>
"The price system reform has played an active part in fueling
the country's economic growth," the newspaper quoted a report from
the State Statistics Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
The price reform, initiated in 1979, also brought a new
challenge for the government -- the taming of of inflation, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Without the government's direct restrictive measures, the
growth rate of prices would have soared to unfavorable heights at
a time when the economy overheated.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, China dealt with two rounds of serious
price inflation, peaking in 1988 and 1994 respectively. Retail
prices surged 18.5 percent in 1988 and 21.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Tightened fiscal and monetary policies, along with strict
control on expansion of investment and consumption, enabled the
government to suppress the two rounds of inflation.
</P>
<P>
In the process, the government also accumulated useful
experiences regarding how to exert macroeconomic control in a
market economy, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Excessive austerity measures imposed during the 1986-90 economic
cycle curbed inflation, but it also resulted in a sluggish
economic performance. The growth rate of the gross domestic
product (GDP) dropped from 13.5 in 1985 to 4.1 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
More mild and sophisticated measures taken by the government to
deal with the second round of inflation resulted in a "soft
landing" last year, with inflation effectively curtailed while
economic growth rate not dampened.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP grew by 8.8 percent last year, while retail prices
growth rate stood at a slight 0.8 percent, said the State
Statistics Bureau.

<HEADLINE> China to Update Fish Product Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China will further update its
fish processing technology and equipment and learn from foreign
advanced expertise to meet a growing market demand, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at the Fish Utilization Symposium of the
Asia-Pacific Region, which ended on Saturday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the region reviewed technical and policy measures
regarding efficient use of aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
China's fisheries sector has expanded on a steady and fast
track, with a production ranking first in the world for eight
years, said Chen Delong, an official with the Fisheries Bureau
under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of the year, China's output in
the sector totalled 16.73 million tons, an increase of 11 percent
from the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
However, only 27.8 percent of annual aquatic products are
processed to add value. This is less than in developed countries,
noted Chen.
</P>
<P>
China's fledging aquatic processing industry has played an
increasingly important role in ensuring food supply and improving
people's diet, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
In China, aquatic products averaged 29 kilograms per person in
1997, above the world's average.
</P>
<P>
The country has more than 5,860 enterprises engaged in
refrigerating and processing aquatic products.

SOFIA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria expressed satisfaction
Sunday with the peaceful and democratic elections held in
Bosnia-Herzegovina on September 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov said that

The union also expressed gratitude to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe for its professional
preparation and organization of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The United States on Friday said the overall results of the
Bosnian elections were a victory for the Dayton accord, which was
signed in December 1995 in the U.S. and ended the 3.5-year-long
war in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Drug Dealers Hit Hard in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's anti-drug
campaign this summer has yielded remarkable achievements,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Shanghai police cracked one of the biggest drug
cases in the country with a 24-member drug ring smashed, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
On August 31, 29.7 kilograms of heroin in the form of 58
cylinders and more than 80,000 yuan (9,660 US dollars) of drug
money were confiscated by the police when the head of the ring,
known as Ah Jiu, was caught in a hotel in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Eight members of the ring were captured along with Ah
Jiu. Police had caught all the others since the investigation of
the case began in mid-July, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, nine people involved in four drug
trafficking cases were sentenced to death, life imprisonment and
term imprisonment, respectively, by the First Intermediate
People's Court of Shanghai on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the four cases, a total of 6,541 kilograms of heroin were
confiscated by the police. Ma Yongfu, 28, was given a death
penalty for transporting 800,000 yuan (96,600 US dollars) of drug
money from Shanghai to the northwestern province of Gansu,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Various government departments, mainly police and customs, have
placed anti-smuggling high on their agendas in response to a
national meeting on smuggling held by the State Council in July.
</P>
<P>
In July and August, police across the country investigated
hundreds of smuggling cases involving hundreds of millions of
yuan, according to figures released at a national telephone
conference on combating smuggling held by the Ministry of Public
Security earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Also in the aforementioned two months, frontier defence police
troops smashed a total of 77 drug trafficking cases, an official
with the Frontier Defence Bureau under the Ministry of Public
Security said.
</P>
<P>
Eightythree suspects were captured, and 219 kg of heroin, 66.65
kg of methamphetamine, and 10 tons of pharmaceutical preparations
for making drugs were confiscated, the official said.

<HEADLINE> 500,000 Italians Clean up Public Places Over Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 27 (Xinhua) -- An estimated half-a-million
volunteers fanned out around Italy over the weekend, in squares,
streets, public gardens and parks in 1,300 municipalities to clean
up 3,500 designated trash-strewn areas, the environmental
association Legambiente reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Among those taking part in the Let's Clean the World initiative
were individuals and groups ranging from neighborhood committees,
Boy and Girl Scouts, to police units.
</P>
<P>
Legambiente President Ermete Realacci said the clean-up was "a
triumph for the commitment of people who love Italy."
</P>
<P>
In spite of cloudy skies over the country and bouts of heavy
rain, Realacci said a "sea of people" were mobilized, showing
their support for environmentalists' demand for a clean, welcoming
and modern Italy.
</P>
<P>
"The huge quantity of trash collected today," he said, "shows
that the services for the collection and management of wastes have
to be strengthened and that municipal administrations must move,
once and for all, from words to facts."

<HEADLINE> German Poll Results Highlights Policy Continuity: Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Prime Minister Paavo
Lipponen said Sunday that in the view of Finland the most
important thing from the election returns in Germany is its policy
continuity.
</P>
<P>
In his brief comment on Germany's election, Lipponen said
Germany has a significant influence in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Social Democratic Party has become the biggest party
in the Federal Assembly, which will contribute to the decision
making of the state, said Lipponen. A very strong cabinet is
needed in Germany, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet formation in Germany would be easier than expected,
Lipponen said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that at the beginning of 1999 when Germany starts the
rotating presidency of the European Union (EU), the organization's
agenda for the year 2000 would be ready. This is important for
Finland which would serve as the EU's rotating presidency at the
latter half of the year, Lipponen said.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish prime minister also thanked his German counterpart
Helmut Kohl for his contributions to the EU's member countries,
saying that under Kohl's influence, Finland became a member of the
organization and found it's place in the EU.

BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Dali County People's
Court in north China's Shaanxi Province has accepted the legal
indictment of a woman suing her former boss for sex harassment
over telephone. This is the first lawsuit over telephone harassing
in China.
</P>
<P>

against He Kaiyou, director of Dali County Agricultural Bureau,
for allegedly harassing her for 20 days in August, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Ji claimed that she would be waken up by telephons almost every
midnight and a man would harass her with the language such as "I
want to make love with you" and "How about your body?" The
telephone calls came again and again and would last about two
hours every night.
</P>
<P>
According to Ji, the harassment not only disturbed her, but
also wrecked her family. Her husband misunderstood her and they
lived apart.

and was told that they came from mobile phone and a family phone
alleged to belong to He Kaiyou.
</P>

between them at work.

<HEADLINE> Release of Clinton Testimony Tape May Have Backfired: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The decision of the U.S.
House of Representatives to release the videotape of President
Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony may have hurt Congress rather
than the president, a poll released on Sunday showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll commissioned by Time magazine and CNN television found
that the Republican-led Congress' approval rating dropped to 54
percent from 63 percent since the tape ran on national television
last Monday, while the Democratic president's approval rating
remained at more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,019 adults was conducted in the three days
after the airing of the four-hour tape on Monday. The survey had a
margin of error of 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the respondents said they believed Republicans
were acting "too partisan" in their investigation of the
president. They were split on whether they thought the president's
fellow Democrats in Congress were acting fairly.
</P>
<P>
In the new poll, 61 percent approved of Clinton's job
performance, compared to 63 percent in a September 16-17 survey.
In each poll, one-third disapproved.
</P>
<P>
By a 53-41 margin, respondents in the latest poll said they
wanted their members of Congress to vote against beginning a formal
impeachment investigation against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The House Judiciary Committee is to make a recommendation next
week to the full House on whether to start such a proceeding.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that most Americans believe Clinton should
remain in office, though many contend he deserves some form of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Just 12 percent said they favored impeachment, while 23 percent
said they thought he should resign. Twenty-nine percent favor
censure while 34 percent said no action should be taken against
him.

exhausting quest to find shoes that fit him.
</P>
<P>
Scarlet Light's son, Richard, is a 1.95 meter freshman, and
finding affordable size 16 shoes in California, has been an
almost impossible task for her.

After calling several NBA teams, Scarlet reached the Clippers,
who were willing to part with a pair of sneakers. A new pair of
red and white, size 16 Reeboks showed up at the Light's door
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"They fit good and feed good," said Richard, who plays
basketball only for recreation.
</P>
<P>
Unitl the shoes arrived, Light had to squeeze into a pair of
size 14 basketball shoes, which he has been wearing for several
months.
</P>
<P>
"He is huge, and I want him to feel halfway comfortable at
school," Scarlet Light said.

STOCKHOLM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- defending champion Sweden
overwhelmed Spain 4-1 in its Davis Cup world group semi-final tie
after splitting the reverse singles matches on Sunday and
advanced to the final against Italy in December.
</P>
<P>
Jonas Bjorkman, who took three points for the second
consecutive tie, rolled over Carlos Moya 6-2, 7-5 in the first
match on Sunday before Julian Alonso, a late replacement for
Spanish number two Alex Corretja, salvaged some pride for his
country by defeating Thomas Johansson 6-1, 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards, favoured on the strength of Moya's fifth place
and Corretja's seventh in the world rankings, managed to take
only one set in the weekend's first three matches as Sweden took
a 3-0 lead, reducing Sunday's dead reverse singles to
best-of-three-set contests.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman, ranked 13th in the world, said: "I enjoyed playing
today. My play is fine at the moment so I am satisfied and
looking forward to the final."
</P>
<P>
Sweden will take on Italy looking for its seventh Davis Cup
triumph. Italy beat the United States 4-1 in the another
semi-final on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines May Re-Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- After four days of being
closed, the national flag carrier Philippine Airlines (PAL) may
re-open after its ground crew union accepted the management's
offer.
</P>
<P>
During last-ditch talks with labor officials at President
Joseph Estrada's residence in Manila, the union finally agreed to
suspend its collective bargaining agreement for 10 years as
demanded by the management, Business World reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the management will give 20 percent of the
airlines ownership and three seats in the board of directors to
the employees, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that President Estrada has announced that the crisis
caused by the sudden closure of PAL Wednesday is over. However, it
was yet unclear if the management will accept the union's
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a PAL official said that even if the two sides reach
an agreement, the airlines should also be downsized and may run
domestic routes only.
</P>
<P>
PAL had suffered a heavy loss of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars as of
June this year. The strike staged by the labor union exacerbated
the crisis and finally forced the 57-year-old airlines to close
shop.
</P>
<P>
Starting Monday, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific begins flying
the major domestic routes abandoned by Philippine Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Learning About China In Poor Mountain Villages (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An international youth
expedition organized by the British charity group Raleigh
International has spent the past three months camping and working
in outlying mountain villages in east China's Shandong and Jiangsu
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The 90 young people from 10 different countries have braved the
summer heat to help farmers build small dams and village
schools. They have cooked meals and washed clothes by themselves
and slept in tents they carried in.
</P>
<P>
One British member of the team said that if he had only visited
Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, he would never have seen what
the real China is.
</P>
<P>
At Haotan, a village of 200 people at the foot of Taishan, the
highest mountain in Shandong, the team helped villagers, whose
average income is less than 2,000 yuan (240 U.S. dollars) a year,
build several small dams for water and soil conservation.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuantai, a 73-year-old villager, said, "These foreign kids
are quite good. They work hard and can stand the harsh living
conditions, and even some of our villagers are no match to them."
But, he said with a smile, "these kids have no idea about
frugality. They used more than 50 bags of cement on the dam,
something that would normally need a dozen bags at most."
</P>
<P>
The only foreigners Li had seen before were Japanese troops who
intruded into China in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Li was only
18 then and was forced to build watchtowers for the Japanese.

Raleigh recruits more than 100 people aged from 17 to 25 years
worldwide every year to go to developing countries to do various
challenging community and environmental projects and to give them
experience and an understanding of their potential.
</P>
<P>
The team also helped build a room for a watchman and a canteen
at a new elementary school in Xiagang, another village several
miles from Haotan and became English teachers for the
approximately 100 pupils in the school, who had never heard the
language before.
</P>
<P>
One fourth-grade girl said that their class was very funny and
interesting that the pupils loved it, and a team member from Chile
said that villagers were "very curious" toward them and often
visited their campsite. Sometimes the villagers tried hard to
communicate with the team members through sign language or by
drawing pictures, but more often just sat there quietly watching
the team working.
</P>
<P>
And they were often invited to the villagers' homes to eat and
whenever they walked through the village, their pockets would be
filled with dates, nuts and other small gifts.
</P>
<P>
The village folks, when compared with those in the West, one
member who was suntanned after weeks of work outdoors said, were
not affluent by the Western standards, but incredibly generous and
welcoming. They're are also happy, contented and hard-working, and
materialistic things are not so important to them, he said.

This year was Raleigh's first expedition to China. Most of the
team members had never come to visit China and had little idea
about what it was like.
</P>
<P>
But, a Japanese member, Kumi Tanaka, said, "China is such a
nice and beautiful country, and there are so many people and so
many life styles here," and a British team member, Andy Bell,
pitched in by acknowledging that he saw a very wide diversity
between life in China's modern cities and its remote villages, but
that he felt "very privileged to be able to come to such remote
places in China which most Westerners have never been to." One
could probably acquaint himself more with the Chinese culture in
the country's rural areas than urbanites who are confined only to
cities and towns can, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A China Youth Development Foundation official says that this
year's Raleigh Expedition was unprecedented. "In the past, young
foreign visitors only had an opportunity to see major cities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Raymond K.F. Ch'ien, chairman of Hong Kong's Inchcape Pacific
Ltd., sponsor of the expedition, said that before China adopted
its policy of opening to the outside world, such an expedition
would have been "unthinkable", and the fact that this large
international cross-cultural group of young people was allowed to
spend three months living and working in China's interior areas
epitomizes the remarkable progress that has been scored and
China's commitment to the reform and opening-up.

pumped into the railway sector alone from now through 2003. The
project to build a 1,300-km-long high-speed railway from Beijing
to Shanghai will begin in 2000.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say if domestic manufacturers don't step up
efforts to upgrade products, stress quality and enhance services,
they will lose a huge market share to their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Qi Zihong, director of equipment supply department of the China
Railway Engineering Corp, said, "The quality of domestically made
engineering machinery has improved significantly during the past
few years, but still lags far behind those imported from advanced
nations."
</P>
<P>
Poor reliability, few varieties, short life-span, lack of
after-sales services and customer training have become the principal
drawbacks for the domestic machinery and equipment suppliers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
When there is a problem with imported equipment, following
identification of responsibilities, the foreign maker will usually
send the related components to the work spot soon so that the
equipment can start operation again, Qi said.
</P>
<P>
If the same case happened to locally made product, its
manufacturers would pass the buck to each other and cause losses
to the customer, which would thereby certainly bring about an
adverse effect to its future sales, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Schroeder Declares End of Kohl Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Schroeder on Sunday
brought Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) back to power in
Bonn after 16 years in opposition in the German political arena
dominated by veteran chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
According to German television projections released late Sunday
evening, the center-left SPD scored over 41 percent of the vote in
the general elections, some five points ahead of Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) conservative
alliance.
</P>
<P>
"After 16 years, the era of Kohl has ended today... The voters
have chosen in this election a change of generations," Schroeder
told a cheering crowd of supporters at the SPD headquarters in
Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, already Germany's longest-serving chancellor and the most
durable Western leader in the post-war era, swiftly conceded
defeat -- the worst one for his party since 1949.
</P>
<P>
"The election result is clear, the Social Democrats won. The
voters have clearly opted for Red-Green," Kohl said, referring to
the SPD and its potential junior coalition partners, the Greens.
</P>
<P>
He also declared his intention to step down as the chairman of
the CDU, a post he held since 1973.
</P>
<P>
"I will discuss with the CDU board tomorrow and ask them not to
nominate me again for the chair of the party at the next party
congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to his past, Kohl said, "I'm thankful to all
those who helped us in the last 16 years, also to those many
abroad who helped pave our way as friends and partners. Many of
our triumphs were made possible by our partners and friends. It
was a great time. We achieved a lot but as democrats, we accept
the decision of the voters.... Life goes on."
</P>
<P>
Despite his defeat, Kohl has secured a place in history as the
architect of Germany's reunification in 1990 and a leading
champion for European unity.
</P>
<P>
But with unemployment hovering at a near post-war record high
of over 4 million and widespread disillusionment among eastern
Germans with his broken promises of "flourish landscapes" after
reunification, Kohl has to face a growing desire for a change in
German politics.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, campaigning on a concept which he called the "New
Center," has won strong support from the middle-of-the-road voters
by pledging to combine modernity and reforms with more social
justice.
</P>
<P>
"Our concept has been to aim for the New Center. It's apparent
that this concept was the right way," Schroeder said on Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed continuity in foreign policy and pledged to
strive for economic stability and more security in social order.
</P>
<P>
But first of all, he said, "My most important goal is the fight
against the plague of mass unemployment."
</P>
<P>
It was still not clear whether the SPD would be able to
negotiate a deal with the ecologist Greens to form a coalition.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder did not rule out any coalition possibilities. As the
strongest party in parliament, the SPD could now choose to rule
with the Greens, or the CDU, or even with the current junior
partner in Kohl's government, the Free Democratic Party (FDP).
</P>
<P>
Latest election projections put the Greens at 6.7 percent and
the FDP at 6.2 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he would wait for the final results and would
decide in the next few days on which party the SPD would negotiate
for a ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
"I want a government with a stable majority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Kohl and leader of his Bavarian sister party CSU, Theo
Waigel, have spoken against an alliance with the SPD. FDP leader
Wolfgang Gerhardt also made it clear that his party would go into
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary projections, the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS), which grew out of the former East German
communist party, also achieved a big victory on Sunday by winning
over 5 percent of the vote, its best since the 1990 reunification.
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder had said earlier that he did not want to rely on
the support of the PDS.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "China Will Become World's Largest Advertising Market" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- "In New York, I shocked the
U.S. investment community by telling them that China will become
the world's biggest advertising market in the next decade," noted
Kevin Roberts in his address to the first China International
Brand Strategy Conference in Beijing this year.
</P>
<P>
As the CEO of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, one of the top 10 advertising
agencies in the world, Kevin didn't exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
China's advertising industry has registered robust and rapid
development since 1979 when the country's first commercial was
broadcast on the Shanghai TV Station.
</P>
<P>
The business volume of the country's advertising industry
increased from 2.5 billion yuan in 1990 to 46.2 billion yuan in
1997, with the number of advertising agencies growing from 1,076
to 29,010 and professionals from 26,440 to 319,092 during the
period, according to figures from the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce, which is in charge of the nation's
advertising sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also indicate that the growth rate of China's
advertising sector has been, on the average, four to six times
higher than that of the GDP since 1978 when the country began
implementing its policy of reforming and opening up.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted in Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing
revealed that some 92.5 percent of the respondents were able to
tell one or two advertising slogans in two seconds.
</P>
<P>
This means that ads are playing an ever more important role in
China's daily life.
</P>
<P>
Just as one insider said, in today's China, it is getting hard
for consumers to accept goods which have not been advertised.
People even decide what movie to see by looking through
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this enormous market has also attracted world-famous
advertising agencies, following their clients. The world top 10
advertising giants, such as Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, Dentsu, Leo Burnett
and Grey have already established joint ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
"For multinational ad agencies, this is a market you have to
enter, you have no choice. If your clients have entered this
market, but you don't, how can you provide a global service for
them?" said Viveca Chan, Chairman and CEO of the Grey China
Advertising Co. Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Eastman Opens JV in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A new large Sino-US
petrochemicals manufacturing joint venture was officially signed
in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province on Friday,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Yangzi Petrochemical Industrial Corp
(YPIC) and Eastman Chemical Ltd inked a contract to form the
30-million-U.S. dollar joint venture to produce Eastotac
hydrocarbon tackifying resin for adhesive manufactures.
</P>
<P>
Eastman Chemical Ltd is a subsidiary of US-based Eastman
Chemical Co while YPIC is an affiliate of Yangzi Petrochemical
Corp.
</P>
<P>
Construction is expected to begin in mid-1999 and be completed
by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Eastman's Eastotac resin is used by adhesive manufacturers to
produce hot-melt adhesives for infant and feminine hygiene
products, packaging, glue sticks, tapes, labels, and other
adhesive applications.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Yangzi Eastman Chemical will be a 50-50 joint
venture. The plant will use C5 distillate, a by-product from the
manufacture of ethylene, to produce high quality hydrocarbon
tackifying resin.
</P>
<P>
The new plant will be Eastman's first one in China. Currently,
all Eastotac resin is manufactured by Eastman in the United
States, the paper said.

JERUSALEM -- Violent clashes broke out between Israeli Arabs
and Israeli police Sunday over a land dispute in north-central
Israel, injuring 38, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes took place near the Arab town of Umm Al-Fahem, 30
kilometers southeast of the port city of Haifa, when police moved
in to tear down a tent erected by Arab protesters three weeks
ago. The protesters claimed the land was unfairly confiscated by
the Israeli army. Israeli authorities have said that the disputed
area is within an Israeli army firing range. (Israel-Clash)

WASHINGTON -- Three veteran politicians mentioned as possible
mediators between U.S. President Bill Clinton and the
Republican-controlled Congress over the Lewinsky affair say there
won't be a deal before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
"Probably not much can happen until maybe next year," said
former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, instead of a race to judgment, you are looking at a
race to the election," said former White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, who appeared Sunday with Dole and former Senate
Republican leader Howard Baker on NBC's "Meet the Press."

MADRID, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Abraham Olano gave Spain
their first Tour of Spain cycle race triumph for seven years on

<P>
The Basque rider completed the 3,781 kilometers and 22 days of

Olano's team mate Jose Maria Jimenez was third, 2:12 in

<HEADLINE> McGwire Closes Season with 70 Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Mark McGwire hit his 69th
and 70th homers on the season's last day, setting an incredible
record in the U.S. baseball history.
</P>
<P>
"This is a season I will never, ever forget, and I hope
nobody in baseball ever forgets it," McGwire told the cheering
crowd after the game in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
The giant guy, who hit five homers on the final weekend, hit
his 69th in the third inning Sunday, then homered for the 70th in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Now, McGwire has dropped Sammy Sosa behind in the homer-fight
through the season, and his new record was nine better than the
37-year-old previous record set by Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
Sosa stands with 66 homers so far. McGwire, has 10 multihomer
games this year and 53 in his career, hit a go-ahead homer for
the 24th time this season.
</P>
<P>
He opened the year with a slam on March 31, then led the home
run race all season except when Sosa twice passed him briefly.
</P>
<P>
Sosa led for 65th on August 19 before McGwire regained lead on
Friday when he hit his 66th on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the Cardinals' final game of the season. Sosa's
Cubs, who played at Houston, did not know if their regular season
would end or if there would be a playoff game for the national
league wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
McGwire has 180 homers the last three season.

<HEADLINE> NBA Leagues' Proposal Isn't New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A NBA Players Association
official claimed today the league's latest contract proposal to
the players contains "nothing new on the core issues" of the
labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
the union was in the process of responding to the league.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing new on the core issues we've been fighting
over and some of which we want to talk about later in the week,"
the union official said. "We want to give our response first to
the NBA and then to the press."
</P>
<P>
The owners this spring exercised an option to re-open their
collective bargaining agreement with the players, which had three
years remaining.
</P>
<P>
There has been little progress in talks. The league is seeking
to institute an inflexible ceiling on team payrolls and eliminate
the so-called Larry Bird exception to the league's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
The Bird exception allows teams to re-sign their own players
without regard to the cap.
</P>
<P>
The league locked out the players on July 1, and there has
been only one formal bargaining session since. Last week, the
league undefinitely postponed the start of training camps, which
had been set for October 5, and cancelled 24 preseason games that
had been scheduled to be played from October 13 to 16.
</P>
<P>
That would mean a deal would have to be reached before the
October 18 deadline by which grievance arbitrator John Feerick
has to rule on the union's contention that the teams must pay
players who have guaranteed contracts even though there is a
lockout.
</P>
<P>
Legal observers which no allegiance to eigher side say
Feerick's ruling will be pivotal to the dispute because a ruling
in the union's favor will put financial pressure on the teams.
</P>
<P>
NBA commissioner David Stern said he wants to eliminate the
open-ended aspect of the Bird exception, which has been a
foundation of NBA labor agreements for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
But he also said teams should have "an edge" in the bidding
for their own players, and he suggested that teams give their own
players long-term contracts and higher rises than they do to free
agents they sign from other teams.
</P>
<P>
No such language was included in Friday's new offer, the union
official said.
</P>
<P>
League spokesman Chris Brienza said "We decided we do not want
to comment publicly on what the contents of our proposals are."

<HEADLINE> Di Canio to Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Sheffield Wednesday striker
Paolo Di Canio is set to issue an apology for his assault on
referee Paul Alcock - and then throw himself at the mercy of the
Football Association.
</P>
<P>
The FA has confirmed they are to slap a gross misconduct
charge on Di Canio, who has already been indefinitely suspended
by the club, once they receive Alcock's report on the game.
</P>
<P>
The Italian will be hauled before an FA disciplinary
commission which have wide-ranging powers of authority - he could
be banned for at least six months, or even be thrown out of the
English game altogether.
</P>
<P>
Agent Matteo Roggi admits the star is "deeply upset" over what
has happened and is prepared to say he is sorry for his actions.
</P>
<P>
Roggi said: "At the moment, (we) are deciding what to do. We
will first let the dust settle on what has happened over the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
"Paolo has said that he doesn't wish to speak to anybody with
regard to incident during the game. But he admits he is deeply
upset.
</P>
<P>
"I feel sure Paolo will decide to issue an apology shortly and
we will then have to see what happens after that. We are also
waiting to hear from Sheffield Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
The FA will certainly take any sort of public display of
remorse and regret into consideration before deciding what course
of disciplinary action Di Canio should face.
</P>
<P>
FA chief executive Graham Kelly has refused to reveal what
sanction is likely to be imposed, but it would be no surprise if
the punishment was similar to former Manchester United star Eric
Cantona's eight-month ban for his infamous kung-fu kick on a
supporter.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said: "The rules in the rulebook are fairly wide and
well-known but it is not for me to get involved in quoting
anything.
</P>
<P>
"It could be unfair for any commission that deals with a case
and for the player himself because whatever he has done he
deserves a fair hearing and we are always at pains to ensure that
is done.
</P>
<P>
Philip Don, the Premier League's referees' officer, has
revealed that Alcock is now thinking over his future in the game.
</P>
<P>
Don said: "I have spoken to Paul three times to give him
support as he was very shocked - it is something you don't expect
to happen.
</P>
<P>
"He's obviously going to think about his future - whether he
continues as a referee has entered his mind.
</P>
<P>
"When things like that happen you have to consider your place
in the game but I am sure I will see him refereeing in the
Premier League in a couple of weeks," he said.
