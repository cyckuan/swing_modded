<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Over 3,000 Zairean refugees
arrived in Mpulungu Port by four big boats in northern Zambia on
Thursday, the Zambia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Their arrival has brought to about 4,600 the total number of the
Zairean refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
Other two boats of refugees are still stranded at Mulilo area also
in northern Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The situation is getting worse each day as the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees is facing difficulties to transport
the new arrivals to the transit centre in Kasama about 200
kilometres from the port.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Program Assistant Musengo Kayombo said there is danger of
an outbreak of a disease if no quick action is taken to shift the
refugees to other places.
</P>
<P>
The large number of refugee boats on the harbor has also
adversely affected the operation of the port of Mpulungu.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Commission to Track Nazi Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 14 (Xinhua)-- The Swedish government set up
a commission on Thursday to investigate gold purchased by the
Swedish government from Nazi Germany during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also review bank accounts established by
persecuted European Jews prior to the beginning of the war.
</P>
<P>
These accounts now hold total deposits of about 59 million
Swedish kronor.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the commission is still unknown. The former
director general of the Swedish Export Credits Guarantee Board,
Ragnar Sohlman, was nominated as the chairman, but an appointment
had still to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Reports said he could be regarded as controversial because his
father worked at the Swedish Foreign Ministry during the war, and
was involved in discussions on Swedish-German gold deals.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said Thursday the
matter would be investigated very thoroughly. It was of the utmost
importance that the members of the commission were absolutely
impartial.

<HEADLINE> US Whole Sales Prices Declines in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. producer prices
dropped by 0.3 percent in January, the biggest decline in more
than two years, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drop of U.S. whole sales prices mainly resulted from
declines of prices in heating oil, food, meat and passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
Food prices decreased by 1 percent in the month, the steepest
in five and a half years, and energy prices declined by 0.2
percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the fluctuating food and energy prices, the so-called
core prices were unchanged last month after rising just 0.1
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The drop of producer prices in January was the biggest decline
since a drop of 0.4 percent in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department reported last month that producer
prices rose by 2.8 percent for all of last year, the biggest in
six years. But core prices increased only by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect an overall producer price rise of about 2.5
percent and a core increase of roughly 1.5 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Cases of Poliomyelitis Increase in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientists attending an
international conference in Athens said today that there had been
an upsurge in cases of poliomyelitis in the Balkans in 1996,
despite the fact that the incidence of the disease had declined
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, entitled "Mass Vaccination Campaign
Against Poliomyelitis," began here Wednesday. It has been
organized by the European regional bureau of the World Health
Organization (WHO) in cooperation with the Greek Health and
Welfare Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, 188 cases of poliomyelitis were
reported in 1996 in six countries -- Albania (133), Turkey (16),
Yugoslavia (24), Greece (5), Russia (3) and Ukraine (1).
</P>
<P>
Poliomyelitis is an acute viral infection which mainly affects
children and older persons. If the infection spreads to the
nervous system, varying degrees of paralysis ensue.
</P>
<P>
The conference is focusing on problems associated with the
vaccination of populations in regions such as the Balkans.
Scientists from Greece, Italy, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Unicef and other international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the conference was to find ways of eradicating
the disease by the year 2000 when it is hoped that it will no
longer be necessary to vaccinate children.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM May Resign if Asked: ANA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister
Aleksander Meksi today left open the possibility of resigning over
the government's handling of the collapse of pyramid investment
schemes which brought financial ruin to hundreds of thousands of
Albanians
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA) from Tirana, Meksi, speaking at a press conference for Greek
journalists in the Albanian capital, said he would resign only if
asked to do so by his ruling Democratic Party and not by the
opposition and demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Meksi's statement, seen also in light of remarks Thursday night
by Democratic Party President and Foreign Minister Tritan Sehu
that government responsibilities would be discussed at the party's
next national council and that changes were not ruled out,
reinforces the view in Tirana that the government will attempt to
reduce tension in the country by making internal changes.
</P>
<P>
Meksi however denied all responsibilities, both on his part and
the government, for the operation of the get-rich-quick pyramid
schemes.

<HEADLINE> French Troops to Be Replaced by African Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The 2,000 French troops deployed
in the Central African capital of Bangui since last December will
be replaced by an inter-African interposition force on February
20, the local daily Le Monde quoted a Defense Ministry official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for a purely inter-African force to
launch a peacekeeping operation in an African state, with a
three-month mandate given by a Franco-African summit held in
December in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The force, called the Inter-African Mission of Supervision of
the Accords of Bangui (MISAB), will comprise 450 African soldiers
from six French-speaking African countries, and will receive
logistic support from French troops deployed in Gabon and the
Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
The MISAB, to be led by a Gabonese general and a Senegalese
colonel, is charged with maintaining security in Bangui and
disarming the mutinous soldiers, who rose against President
Ange-Felix Patasse in November last year.
</P>
<P>
French troops will stay in some key positions of Bangui,
including the French embassy.
</P>
<P>
France normally maintains 2,000 troops in Central Africa, with
1,200 in Bangui and 600 in Bouar in the western part of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Poor Planning, Flight Procedures Blamed for Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Shortcomings in the planning
and flight procedures were blamed for last week's Israeli
helicopter collision, Israel Radio reported today, citing interim
findings by the top level inquiry committee's investigation.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three Israeli soldiers were killed last Tuesday when
two Yasur 2000 helicopters transporting forces to south Lebanon
collided over Moshav She'ar Yashuv in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Following the worst ever air disaster in the history of the
Israeli air force, an inquiry committee, headed by former air
force commander David Ivry, was established to determine the cause
of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
In its interim findings presented to Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai today, the committee does not
determine the exact cause of the crash, saying it still has
intensive work ahead of it before it could present a final
conclusion and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
However, several immediate recommendations were made and have
already been accepted by Mordechai, and Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army and Air Force Commander Eitan
Ben-Eliyahu.
</P>
<P>
The committee has spent days since the collision questioning
witnesses, going over radio transmissions and flying in a Yasur
helicopter to try to decide how the helicopters collided.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military sources have said that the helicopters, not
fitted with a "black box" to record flight information, were not
flying in formation but were waiting together for permission to
cross the border into Lebanon when the collision occurred.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Mordechai updated Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, who is currently visiting the United States, on the
contents of the interim report by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly said that the interim findings of the
inquiry committee "appeared to be logical and in order,"
expressing his hope that the findings would prevent such
tragedies in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here tonight with Japanese
Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and expressed his welcome to
Ikeda's forthcoming visit to China.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the trip will further boost mutual
understanding, expand common ground and promote the stable
development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that this year marks the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of relations between the two countries and this
calls for celebration.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides will jointly take
advantage of this opportunity to create an excellent environment
and good conditions for the healthy, stable and lasting
development of their ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister added that during the meetings of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation last November, President
Jiang Zemin held an important meeting with Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto in Manila and they reached consensus on a number of
questions of mutual concern, thus laying the foundation for the
restoration and continuous development of the two countries'
relations.
</P>
<P>
China noted that Prime Minister Hashimoto has on several
occasions made remarks about the importance Japan attaches to the
development of relations with China and the Chinese side welcomes
and appreciates these statements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian called for an appropriate and earliest possible solution
to the question of chemical weapons Japan had abandoned in China,
saying this is a major problem left by history between the two
countries and a delay in its solution is harmful.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ikeda said he was glad to have a chance to
visit China again this spring. He agreed with China that the 25th
anniversary of the normalization of ties between the two countries
 should be celebrated in a big way and that the fruitful meeting
between President Jiang and Prime Minister Hashimoto laid the
foundation for the restoration of the two countries' relations to
its previous level.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two countries will make joint
efforts on this basis for the further consolidation and
development of their ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on bilateral and
international questions of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers are here to
attend the First ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting to be held
tomorrow.

<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has denied speculations that the
U.N. favors a postponement of elections in Liberia scheduled for
May 1997 to give enough time for the preparations.
</P>
<P>
"I know there has been rumours that the elections may be
postponed, but we have not made any such announcements," Annan
said in New York on Thursday, quoted by the News Agency of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Only two days ago, the U.N. released a detail plan for
establishing a credible electoral framework for Liberia,
following a request from Liberia's ruling Council of State for
U.N. assistance.
</P>
<P>
Annan said it is hopeful that a meeting of members of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the major
peace broker in Liberia, and Liberia's warring factions would
endorse the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"It depends very much on what happens at the meeting this
weekend and the cooperation of the parties," the
secretary-general told a U.N. press conference.
</P>
<P>
"But we will want to go ahead with the elections and resolve
the Liberian issue as quickly as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretary-general hinted that the U.N. would be
willing to consider a postponement of the elections if there is
no agreement on the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"For elections to be credible, certain minimum conditions will
have to be fulfilled," he said.
</P>
<P>
The elections will be held after the implementation of the
Abuja peace agreement, which is aimed at ending the
seven-year-old civil war in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The war has so far claimed the lives of 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
To date, disarmament and demobilization of Liberia's estimated
35,000 former factional fighters have basically been completed
with at least 30,058, or some 90 percent of the soldiers, disarmed.
</P>
<P>
Some 14,156 pieces of arms, 1,650,732 rounds of ammunitions
and 4,369 bombs have been recovered by the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
However, some recalcitrant fighters, who refused to put down
their weapons in the voluntary disarmament period ending January
31 and the following week of grace, were forcefully disarmed by
ECOMOG during a recent military operation in southwest Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The success in the disarmament process will be crucial for
paving the way for the scheduled general elections in the west
African country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Announces New Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe today announced a new
set of tariffs aimed at underpinning recovery in the key
manufacturing sector while at the same time protecting local
companies from cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
According to the new tariff table, raw materials which used to
pay customs duty of up to 40 percent would have tariffs slashed
to five percent, tariffs on capital goods which ranged from zero
to 25 percent would be abolished, while tariffs on finished goods
would range from 40 to 85 percent from the current range of zero to
85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said tariffs higher than the
maximum would be applied on clothing and textiles, electronics,
batteries, luggage ware and selected agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
"The new tariff structure is expected to have a significant
positive impact on our industry. The lower duties to be charged
on raw materials and capital goods will reduce the cost of
production, thereby making local products more competitive," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the move was aimed at attracting more investment
and creating more jobs, but emphasised that tariff
rationalization alone cannot resolve problems faced by industry.

<HEADLINE> UK Benefit Fraud Amounts to 3 Bln Pounds a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Social security fraud in
Britain amounts to about 3 billion pounds (5 billion US dollars) a
year with large numbers of illegal payouts going on disability
benefits, according to latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the latest results of a long-running investigation
of illegal benefit claims, the Department of Social Security (DSS)
said that about 12 percent of payouts under the disability living
allowance were "known to be fraudulent or suspected of being so."
</P>
<P>
About 499 million pounds (808 million US dollars) of the total
3.7 billion pound (6 billion US dollar) budget for the disability
allowance for people under 65 with special needs was being paid to
fraudulent claimants.
</P>
<P>
Another recent DSS report showed 1 billion pounds (1.6 billion
US dollars) of the 10 billion pound (16.2 billion US dollar)
housing benefit budget going to fraudsters, and 1.4 billion pounds
(2.3 billion US dollars) of the 16 billion pounds (26 billion US
dollars) spent on income support fraudulently claimed.
</P>
<P>
The DSS said that apart from fraud, an additional 300 million
pounds (486 million US dollars) of the disability living allowance
was wrongly paid out to claimants last year by DSS staff because
of administrative errors.
</P>
<P>
The level of error in unemployment benefit awards last year
totaled about 6.9 percent of the 1.1 billion pound (1.8 billion US
dollar) unemployment benefit bill, admitted the DSS.
</P>
<P>
The government recently has stepped up its efforts to combat
benefit fraud, with the DSS sponsoring legislation that would
bring in new penalties for criminals.

<HEADLINE> Major Accuses Labor's Europe, Devolution Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, February 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major today attacked the opposition Labor Party's devolution
plans for Scotland and Wales and its willingness to hand more
power to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister used a speech to the Welsh Conservative
Conference to fight against Labor over Europe and their devolution
plans.
</P>
<P>
The combination, he warned, could set England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland against each other and reduce Parliament to a
"remnant of our democracy -- a mausoleum to the nation state."
</P>
<P>
Major criticized shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's plans
for a "Europe of the Regions," saying it exposed the true menace
of Labor.
</P>
<P>
Their proposals to scatter more power to Brussels, Edinburgh
and Cardiff would, he declared, "sap the strength of Britain" and
wreck the precious legacy of 1,000 years of history.
</P>
<P>
"As long as I am prime minister, I will not let it happen," the
prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Major said he was determined Labor should not inherit the
successful economy built by the Tories and laid into Labor's plans
for a Scottish parliament and a Welsh assembly.
</P>
<P>
"A thousand days of Labor government could ditch a thousand
years of British history. It's a poor bargain -- better to keep
the history and ditch Labor," Major declared.
</P>
<P>
Major's speech, in which he said the Conservatives could make
Britain "the best place in the world to live," came amid fevered
speculation he could call a snap election for March 20 or April
10.
</P>
<P>
However, in an interview on Sky TV on Thursday, Major said,
"People should not get over-excited about it at the moment."
</P>
<P>
"I have a date in my mind and in due course we will see how
events unroll, and I will make an announcement," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Urges Lifting of Farm Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler today urged EU countries to lift their farm subsides.
</P>
<P>
Fischler told the German Association for Agricultural and
Environmental Policies in Bonn that the farm support cannot ensure
the income of agricultural enterprises in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Would competition on the world market heat up, the subsidized
prices would go to a dead end, Fischler said.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Franz-Josef Feiter, state secretary of the German
Ministry for Agriculture, said that further cuts in farm subsidies
were only possible when compensations were introduced.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that such compensations were indispensible in order
to offset the competition disadvantage and ensure the income of
the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Feiter said Germany could not carry out "radical reform" in the
agricultural sector. In 1996, Germany spent 30 billion marks
(about 18 billion U.S. dollars) on farm subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Fischler said that EU countries should continue their
agricultural reforms beginning 1992. He noted that food exporting
nations such as the United States would surely press hard for
further farm liberalization when the World Trade
Organization-sponsored multilateral negotiations started no later
than the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Protest Against Turkish Cypriot Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will lodge a strong
protest with the United Nations against Turkish Cypriot threats to
settle the occupied ghost town of Varosha (Famagusta) in the
eastern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Spyros Kyprianou, who is also the President
of the House of Representatives, told the press today that
Cyprus' permanent representative to the U.N., Ambassador Nicos
Agathocleous, will hand over a letter containing the protest to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash stated Thursday that the
clean-up has started in Varosha in order to prepare it for
resettlement by Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the "social and economic integration of the
town into the rest of the occupied district," but did not
set a time frame.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Varosha, the Greek Cypriot sector of Famagusta, was the
island's main tourist resort before the Turkish invasion. After
the invasion, its 50,000 Greek Cypriot residents became refugees
and were forced to settle elsewhere on the island.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou recalled a specific provision in U.N. Security
Council Resolution 550 (1984) about Varosha.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "considers attempts to settle any part
of Varosha by people other than its inhabitants as inadmissible
and calls for the transfer of this area to the administration
of the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
The Acting President said he spoke earlier today with U.N. resident
representative Gustave Feissel, who was unaware of Denktash's
statement, but will look into the matter and inform the
Acting President accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou also contacted British High Commissioner in Nicosia
David Madden, who also had no information on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) has not found any changes to the status quo in Varosha,
after the Turkish Cypriot made the threats.
</P>
<P>
"We are permanently stationed in the fenced area of Varosha
with our observation posts and our mobile patrols. We have
made our investigation and we found not evidence of changes,"
UNFICYP spokesman Waldemar Rokoszewski said today.

<HEADLINE> Horticultural Industry Booms in Kenya by Wang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Horticultural industry in
Kenya has recorded an average growth rate of 25 percent in the
last five years and is expected to become the largest foreign
exchange earner in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
At present, the horticultural sector is the third largest
commodity foreign exchange earner after tea and coffee which
earned the East African country about 330 million and 250 million
U.S. Dollars in 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to projections on the industry, if the growth rate
in the past five years is maintained, earnings from the sector
which earned about 200 million Dollars in 1995 will exceed the
export revenue from traditional commodities of tea and coffee.
</P>
<P>
In terms of employment, the sector is an important component
of agriculture and provides two million job opportunities for the
country with a population of 28 million.
</P>
<P>
Richard Wood, Vice-Chairman of the Commercial Horticultural
Association, has said that Kenya's horticultural produce is among
the best quality agricultural commodities in the world.
</P>
<P>
Horticultural produce from Kenya is popular in the European
market because they conform to the desired standard, added Wood
who is a United Kingdom horticulturalist.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture, according to economic analysts, is one of the
fastest-growing sub-sector in Kenya's agriculture
</P>
<P>
Kenya is now the world's fourth largest supplier of cut
flowers to the European Union market and the second most
important developing countries after Colombia supplying cut
flowers to the market.
</P>
<P>
Cut flowers earned about 65 million Dollars last year,
accounting for a third of total horticultural exports.
</P>
<P>
The other important commodities of the sector are fresh
vegetables and fruits, which generated 36 million and 13 million
Dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the Middle East remain the main export
markets for Kenya's horticultural produce and the potential
markets include South Africa, Australia, the Far East and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The most interesting part of the fast-growing sector is that
the industry has succeeded without government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the sector is attributed to heavy private sector
investment in the industry and value-added processing supported
by economic reforms and extensive export development programs.
</P>
<P>
The sector has benefited from removal of exchange controls,
simplification of import procedures for vital agricultural inputs
and remission of duty and value added taxes on the inputs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a private voluntary organization of Fresh Produce
Exporters Association was established in 1975 to promote the
horticultural industry by assisting growers, exporters and buyers
of Kenya's fresh horticultural produce.
</P>
<P>
The association provides its members with services such as
market intelligence, collective negotiation of freight rates and
advisory services, creates an export development fund to assist
members to expand their businesses and support small-scale
horticultural producers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the area around the Lake Naivasha is the ideal
place growing cut-flowers and some 75 percent of Kenya's cut
flowers originate from there.
</P>
<P>
The climate in the Naivasha area is dry enough to prevent
plant diseases, radiation is intense, and the temperature on the
average is just right.
</P>
<P>
There is also sufficient supply of good quality water, even
better than that of Alsamere, the Netherlands, which is essential
for the growth of high quality horticultural plants.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior members of
Lesotho's ruling party and opposition groups today warned of an
impending civil war in the kingdom involving the police and the
army.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ruling Basutho National Congress and
opposition leaders are calling for talks with 400 mutinous police
officers who have seized control of Lesotho's police headquarters
in Maseru, capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
They are accusing the government of refusing to open dialogue
with the renegade policemen, putting the country into a dangerous
situation, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The political leaders said in a statement negotiations are the
only means to avoid bloodshed in the tiny Southern African
nation.
</P>
<P>
The mutinous policemen last week seized control of Lesotho's
police headquarters and dismissed six senior officers, including
Police Commissioner Bolutu Makoaba.
</P>
<P>
They have been resisting arrest for the 1995 murders of three
fellow policemen.

Africa to resolve the Lesotho crisis," a spokesman of the
ministry said.

business district as the mutiny entered its eight day, reported

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Defends Decision o Privatize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today defended the government's decision to
privatize the National Bank of Commerce (NBC), saying it had
reached a point of no return.
</P>
<P>
Addressing regional heads after the end of his tour of Kagera
in the regional capital town of Bukoba today, the president said
despite restructuring measures which were being undertaken since
1991, the NBC continued to make losses even after the government
agreed to take its securities worth about 330 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This would mean imposing more taxes on the people to enable
the government subsidize the bank's losses," he stressed,
pointing out that the government had reached the decision to
split the bank to reduce the tax payers' burden.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa dismissed claims that the government was privatizing the

<HEADLINE> Altered Gene Leads to Longer Life, Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Worms can live 50 percent
longer than normal if their genetic clocks are altered, a group of
researchers at the McGill University of Canada discovered.
</P>
<P>
A mutation in the "clock" gene, officially called clk-1, slows
the chemical activity in the cells of a type of nematode, worms
barely visible to the naked eyes.
</P>
<P>
These worms normally live 16 days. The mutation slows the speed
at which their cells age and die, and many live more than 24 days,
the study shows.
</P>
<P>
The finding, which may help develop ways to slow the aging
process in humans, is reported in today's issue of the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
Though life extension will not be that simple, the finding
proves that chemical changes in cells are the basis of aging, said
biologist Siegfried Hekimi, who led the group.
</P>
<P>
"The results indicate your age because your cells age," said Dr.
Hekimi. He suggested that preventing the chemical changes that
cause aging could extend the life span, though the best way to do
that remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
A direct genetic alteration isn't likely to work. "This same
gene exists in humans and it could be altered, but that doesn't
mean it is desirable," he said.
</P>
<P>
With a mutated form of the gene, the worms lived in slow
motion. It developed more slowly as an embryo. It swims slowly,
digests slowly and moves slowly.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hekimi said he doubts whether human beings could live if
their genes were so radically altered.
</P>
<P>
This was just the beginning of the research and many questions
remain. "What you need to know is the mechanism and how to ticker
with it," he was quoted as saying by reports today.

<HEADLINE> No Hurry to Arms Deal with Syria: S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government will not be in a hurry to finalize its arms deal with
Syria, a top official said in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Minister Joe Modise told a press
conference that Pretoria has not rushed into finalizing the sale
of arms to Syria because it is a problem of "sensitivity".
</P>
<P>
Modise said the criticism against South Africa for its
intentions to sell arms to Syria was unjustified, noting some of
the countries objecting to the deal are supplying Israel with
arms against the wishes of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Modise stressed that only the South African government is in a
position to make a final decision on the arms deal.
</P>
<P>
According to local press, Denel, a major corporation
specializing in arms export in South Africa has been authorized
to sell Syria an advanced tank-firing control system, which costs
about 638 million U.S. Dollars.

BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The economic reform in
Slovakia, as well as the exercise in relation to the approximation
of its legislation towards EU standards, should be further
pursued, an EU commissioner said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner in charge of external
relations with central and eastern European countries, made the
remarks in a meeting with visiting Slovak deputy prime minister
Mrs. Katarina Tothova Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The encounter enabled both parties to assess the state of the
reform process in Slovakia, with particular reference to the
pre-accession strategy which is now being implemented by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they paid special attention to the
political reforms needed in the country, where the commissioner
mentioned in particular legislation concerning minority languages.

The European Commission has started to prepare its opinion on
the applications for EU membership by Slovakia and nine other
central and eastern European countries, Mr. van den Broek said
during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Tothova, who is responsible for the Slovak government's

LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda said today that it will
welcome international monitors on its border with Zaire, as part
of the confidence-building measures to restore peace to the
troubled Great Lakes region of east Africa.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Ugandan High Commission released today in

perpetuating conflicts currently going on in Zaire," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement added that Uganda is prepared to use
its influence in support of non-violent solutions to the problems
in the area.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Uganda will continue to abide by its
international obligations to respect the sanctity of borders and
called on other governments in the region to adhere to the
Organization of African Unity charter on human rights.

<HEADLINE> Leading Chinese Scientist Speaks at US Science Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese scientist
said here Thursday that people, looking forward to the next
millennium, should not forget the price paid at this century when
enjoying the fruits brought about by the advancement of science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhou, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said population explosion, resource depletion and environmental
degradation arise as a close companion of industrial modernization
and the luxury life style of the rich in a consumer society.
</P>
<P>
Stressing environmental problems, he said they caused the
formation of ozone holes, destroyed a significant part of the
Amazon forest, put a serious threat to biodiversity, eroded
billions of tons of top soil per year, increased the production of
greenhouse gases by burning more coal and oil, released a huge
amount of poisonous waste and left hundreds of thousands of people
in poverty particularly in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the opening session of the annual meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS),
the world's largest general scientific organization. The
organization's 163rd national meeting, scheduled between Thursday
and February 18 and with the theme of "Engaging Science --
Sustaining Society," encompasses a diverse array of disciplines
and areas of leading-edge research. Some 1,100 scientists from
across the United States are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Introduced by John H. Gibbons, president assistant for science
and technology, Zhou and three other foreign speakers dealt with
challenges facing the scientific community now and in the future
from the prospective of their home countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, a renowned theoretical physicist and also president of
the China Association for Science and Technology, said that
advances in science and technology have significantly broadened
China's choices of strategies to build a sustainable modern
society. The immediate concern, he said, is how to educate the
society to understand the problem, that is, to develop
technologies adaptable to local conditions and save capital to
invest and transform into action at the national, regional and
local levels.
</P>
<P>
From today, seminars and symposiums at the AAAS meeting will
provide the opportunity for in-depth examination of very
different and important areas of science and technology.

JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of
Swaziland Sibusiso Dlamini today urged the Swaziland Federation
of Trade Unions (SFTU) to call off the ongoing strike.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists in the capital, Mbabane, on the strike,
he said the sugar industry in the country alone has lost more
than four million U.S. Dollars since the beginning of the

Dlamini said the government is still committed and prepared to
continue talks with the SFTU without pre-conditions to bring the
country's industrial relations back to normal.
</P>
<P>
He has defended the decision to arrest four top union leaders
on charges of organizing the strike, which is already weighing
heavily on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Tense situation began ever since the beginning of February
when the four union leaders were arrested on charges of stirring
up troubles in the public.
</P>
<P>
The arrest were made one day after the government issued an
ultimatum for SFTU leaders to call off a two-day national strike,
which was designed to force King Mswati III to lift a 1973 decree
banning activities of political parties and to agree to
multi-party system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the detained SFTU Secretary General Jan Sithole
said today that thier release will not end the indefinite
strike.

The court said the defendant has killed Major General Hayelom
waiting for an opportune moment with a loaded pistol.

ANKARA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today lodged a protest
with Lebanon requesting a ban on broadcasting a Syrian-made
television series containing scenes which are strongly opposing
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The series "Brothers of the Earth" is being advertised to
start broadcasting within next week on a private Lebanese
channel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources indicated the series contains scenes showing
Ottomans impaling Arabs on stakes.
</P>
<P>
The series covers events in the Middle East from 1912 to
1918, exaggerating incidents, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Instead of an Ottoman flag appearing in the series, the
Turkish flag was used, confusing the time period and suggesting
that little has changed since the days of the Ottoman era.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that the Syrian Army gave its support to
the film by providing figurines and costumes.
</P>
<P>
Both the director and screenwriter are Syrians. The series
contains 30 episodes, each 45 minutes long.
</P>
<P>
"Brothers of the Earth" was shown in Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Syria and Libya at the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the series was produced to encourage
Arab nationalism and hatred of the Turks.
</P>
<P>
Syria's ties with Turkey have been strained over
water rights to the Euphrates, and Turkey opposes Syria for
supporting the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which
started fighting for self-rule in southeastern Turkey since
1984.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan today expressed hope that Libya and the U.N. will
establish cooperation to settle outstanding issues involving the
country which is under comprehensive U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a telegram by the new U.N. secretary
general to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the U.N.-Libya cooperation in context of the
implementation of the U.N. charter. And the agency report did not
provide further information on the telegram.
</P>
<P>
Libya is under travel, diplomatic and economic sanctions for
failing to abide by U.N. resolution 731 to surrender two Libyans
suspected in the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland in 1988. The blast killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya has violated the air sanctions for at least three times,
including Gaddafi's flight to Cairo last June to attend a regional
summit.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Annan's call for cooperation comes as
an initiative and chance of a kind to break up the dilemma in
solving the prolonged crisis in Libya's relations with the
U.N. and Western countries in particular.

<HEADLINE> China Calls ASEM Reflection of Asia's Rapid Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the convocation
of ASEM meetings reflected the rapid economic growth in Asia and
revitalization of its ancient civilization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the First ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Qian
noted that Europe remains one of the leading regions in the world
in the economical and scientific and technological fields.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in history, Europe and Asia were not equal,
but now there exist great potential and prospects for the two
continents to establish a partnership based on equality and mutual
benefit and strengthen economic cooperation, political dialogue
and cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see that the process of Asia-Europe
cooperation has made certain progress in the past year and it has
largely maintained the momentum of the First ASEM Leaders'
Meeting," the Chinese vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
The First ASEM Leaders' Meeting was held in Bangkok, Thailand,
in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China has participated actively in the follow-up
activities of the First ASEM Leaders' Meeting by hosting the first
ASEM Customs DG/Commissioners' Meeting on June 21 and 22, 1996, in
Shenzhen, thus giving an impetus to the cooperation between Asian
and European countries in simplifying customs procedures and
combating drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country is to play host to an Asia-Europe
experts meeting on technological cooperation in Beijing on April
24 and 25 this year for discussion on Asia-Europe cooperation in
agriculture, environmental protection and enterprise renovation
and upgrading.
</P>
<P>
On political dialogue between the two continents, Qian said
China agrees that political dialogue should be carried out within
the ASEM framework, however the ASEM process should put its
emphasis on economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Asian and European countries should exchange views on
international and regional questions of mutual concern by treating
each other as equals, seeking common ground and reserving
differences, respecting each other's sovereignty, not interfering
in each other's internal affairs, proceeding on a gradual basis
and reaching consensus through consultations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the topics of the dialogue, Qian believed that
questions concerning bilateral relations are not appropriate for
multilateral discussions.
</P>
<P>
The First ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting, attended by the
foreign ministers of the seven countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and the 15 members of the European Union
plus China, Japan and South Korea and Vice-President Manuel Marin
Gonzalez of the European Commission, ended here this afternoon
after five hours of discussion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Naumann, Chairman of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military committee, said
today that NATO members should seek an understanding with Russia
on the expansion issue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Free Berlin Radio, Naumann said: "We
want secure European and transatlantic stability. We know that we
would rather find a way to being together with Russia than going
against it."
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that such a way could be found.
</P>
<P>
The organization had been trying to reach consensus with Russia
on the issue of its eastward expansion before the military
alliance's July summit in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
At the forthcoming summit, NATO will nominate the first group
of countries from the former eastern bloc as candidates for the
Western alliance's expansion.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana also vowed to set up a
strong, stable and sustained security partnership with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Naumann, the German four-star general, pointed out that the
biggest obstacle now came from the Cold War image of the West
remaining in Russia's memory as the enemy.

NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China today called on the
parliament in each country to shoulder its responsibilities to
ensure women's rights of equal participation in political life
with men, and build up an equal partnership between men and women
in politics.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the ongoing Specialized Inter-Parliamentary Union

People's Congress of China, said laws should be formulated in line
with each country's actual conditions to ensure a gradual increase
of women's participation in politics.
</P>

Meanwhile, plans on women's education and training should be
worked out to make them more capable of taking part in politics,
she added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing CPPCC Committee Active in Government Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) has become an important force in shaping the
capital's modernization construction, said Wang Daming, chairman
of the body, here today.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the Beijing CPPCC committee "made new
achievements in contributing to Beijing's reform and opening to
the outside world, social stability and development" last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he said, the committee, after conducting more than 500
surveys, investigations and seminars, raised 1,236 proposals to
the city government.
</P>
<P>
Of the many successful proposals, one to strengthen Beijing's
information infrastructure aroused the attention of Beijing's
Acting Mayor Jia Qingling, who urged the immediate startup of the
"Capital Information Project".
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhongyi, vice-chairman of the Beijing CPPCC committee,
noted that the municipal government has done "an enormous amount
of practical work for the local people, in accordance with the
Beijing CPPCC Committee's proposals and suggestions".
</P>
<P>
"The city government cleared over 40 markets which encroached
on public thoroughfares and dismantled more than 8,000 illegal
structures, which effectively improved Beijing's environment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Song Weiliang, secretary general of the committee, said that
the organization has strengthened its supervising role over the
government's routine work.
</P>
<P>
In January last year the committee set up a 14-member group to
study and supervise the government's financial and fiscal
work. The group is the first of its kind in China.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Intensifies Hunt for Church Attack Culprits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt tightened security in
southern provinces after suspected Moslem militants opened fire
Wednesday in a Coptic church, killing nine people and injuring six
others.
</P>
<P>
The police, who has resumed intensive manhunt for perpetrators,
suspect a link between the church incident and another crime in
which three Copts were killed, according to a security source.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the victims were found Friday in one of the sugar
cane plantations in Abu-Hereir village, 70 kilometers from the
church.
</P>
<P>
The police has imposed a siege on the inlets of Minya, about
240 kilometers south of Cairo, and tightened securities on nearby
provinces, especially at sugar cane plantations to hunt the
perpetrators, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Four unidentified gunmen opened fire indiscriminately on
Wednesday night at the Mary Girgis Church in al-Fikria village in
Abu Kurkas district, Minya. Nine Copts were killed.
</P>
<P>
Muslim extremists have from time to time targeted Coptic
Christians on grounds they are heretics.
</P>
<P>
The attack was among the worst attacks on Christians since
1992 when Muslim extremists killed 12 Christian villagers in
Assiut, about 320 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The militants have waged a violent campaign to establish a
strict Islamic state since 1992. Over 1,050 people have been
killed in the clashes, most of them civilians and police in the
south.
</P>
<P>
In a predominantly Muslim country, Copts make up about 10
percent of Egypt's 60 million population.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Commandar of Security Forces Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today appointed Hedayat Lotfian as the Commander of the
Security Forces to replace Reza Seifollahi, the state-run Tehran
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no any background about the new
commander of the Security Forces, only adding that he holds an
official rank of brigadier general.
</P>
<P>
On January 17, Khamenei hinted at his Friday prayer sermon
that he would remove those who are not qualified in the country.
</P>
<P>
But Khamenei said in his decree that the appointment of the
new commander was made at the recommendation of Interior
Minister Ali Besharati due to his "past revolutionary activities,
competence and commitment" in various posts in the past.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Lotfian served in the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps before the new appointment.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei instructed the new commander to work closely with
the interior minister by "exerting his vast talent."
</P>
<P>
He also urged the new commander to "get rid of corruption and
insecurity from the Islamic society by attracting the public's
trust and confidence."

<HEADLINE> Power Handover Said on Condition of No Chaos in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The pledge of Nigeria's
military regime to hand over power to an elected civilian
government on October 1, 1998 is still real unless there is
political turmoil in the country, a senior official has claimed.
</P>
<P>
"If the country is turned into a bloodbath, how can we keep
October 1, 1998? It is not possible", S. G. Ikoku, the Deputy
Chairman of the Transition Implementation Committee (TIC), was
quoted by today's Saturday Punch newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If people introduce a breach of law and order, they should
know that the consequence is that the promise cannot be kept,"
he said in an interview with the paper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ikoku, known for his frank comments on the transition program
which are usually seen as official thinking, said the "breach of
law and order" and intra- and inter-party squabbles could ruin the
promised handover date, the "Saturday Punch" reported.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here noted that Ikoku's words appear to
contradict the assurance of head of state General Sani Abacha
that the transition program would terminate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Abacha said in an interview with the
"Washington Times" that he has not put his mind to whether to run
for presidency or not.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is my own constituency's. It is not new in
Africa, neither is it new in the (west African) sub-region, where
military people have stepped into politics," Abacha said.
</P>
<P>
All his efforts are currently geared towards ensuring the success
of this administration's economic, social and political programs, he
added.
</P>
<P>
There have been wild speculations and heated debates on the issue
since former Chief of Justice, Justice Mohammed Bello, said last year
that Abacha has the constitutional freedom to participate in the
country's electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Ikuko's comment is expected to raise a fresh dimension to the
lingering debate on political succession in the country, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's three-year transition to civil rule program, announced by
the military authorities in October 1995, has been moving forward
basically in accordance with the timetable except for some amendments.
</P>
<P>
To date, five political parties have been officially
registered and voters registering is underway for the election of
local government councils on a party basis set for next month.

<HEADLINE> German Postal Workers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 8,000 postal workers
around Germany staged strikes today protesting over government
plans to allow private competition into mail services.
</P>
<P>
The strikers fear massive job losses if government plans go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
The action came before Bonn's ruling Christian-Liberal
coalition meeting on February 18 to draft a law shaping the future
of Germany's postal services.
</P>
<P>
The German Postal Workers Union (DPG) estimated the government
plans would endanger more than 10,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
It said that about 6,500 mail carriers, out of a total of
75,000 nationwide, took part in the strikes it organized. The
strikes involved 52 cities and were concentrated in Berlin,
Hamburg and Tuebingen.
</P>
<P>
Germany's state monopoly of mail services is to expire at the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Postal Minister Wolfgang Boetsch proposes to extend the state
monopoly on letters and packets up to 350 grams to the year 2002,
but his proposal is opposed by the Free Democrats, the ruling
coalition's junior partner.

CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today received a message from a personal envoy of his Ethiopian
counterpart Negasso Gidada dealing with means of enhancing
bilateral ties and the current events in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Transport and Communication Minister Abdulmejid
Husein, who arrived here on a few days' visit to Egypt Friday
night, conveyed the message during a meeting with Mubarak this
morning, said the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian minister has thanked Egypt for its stand on the
fighting in Sudan which blamed Ethiopia for sponsoring rebel
attacks against the government forces.
</P>
<P>
"We thank President Hosni Mubarak for his statements that have
calmed the situation especially after he said that Ethiopia did
not interfere in the conflict in Sudan," Husein told reporters
upon arrival at Cairo airport.
</P>
<P>
Sudan said that it has strong evidence that Eritrea and Uganda
together with Ethiopia are backing rebel attacks in its southern
and eastern border areas since early January. These countries
rejected the charges.
</P>
<P>
Khartoum recently appealed to Cairo for moral and political
support despite the cool relations between them amid frequent
exchanges of accusations that each has provided refuge for rebel
forces against the other.

KAMPALA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese warlpane Thursday
night dropped three bombs on northwestern Uganda, the New Vision

</P>
<P>
One woman was killed and six others were wounded in the raid.
Two of the wounded were admitted to local hospitals. Local

</P>
<P>
Colonel Wamala Katumba, the Operation Commander of the Uganda

<P>
Earlier reports said the attack was foiled by the Ugandan
army.
</P>
<P>
The warplane returned to its base in southern Sudan from

The raid was one of the three attacks on northwestern Uganda
Thursday by the Sudanese Air Force. Five planes took part in
the operation.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 40,300 Hong
Kong residents emigrated in 1996, bringing the exodus of the
talented to an eight-year low.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 figure of emigrants dropped by 6 percent from the
previous year, according to statistics provided by the Security
Branch. The outflow of Hong Kong residents has abated from the
record high of 66,200 in 1992, to a level even below that of 1989,
when 42,000 moved abroad.
</P>
<P>
For many emigrants, the economic situation in the most popular
destinations -- Canada, the United States and Australia -- does
not offer as many opportunities as Hong Kong does.
</P>
<P>
An influx of returning emigrants is forecast before the
handover since many Hong Kong Chinese will come back to secure

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Receives Message on Peace Process From Assad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today received an important message on the Mideast peace process
from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara who are heading a
high-ranking delegation for a lightning visit here, said the
Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian delegation will also hold talks with senior Egyptian
officials on the latest developments of the Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks, seen as the cornerstone to an overall
Middle East peace, have long been stuck over the fate of the
strategic Golan Heights since last March.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has said the Syrian-Israeli talks should start from the
last point reached between Syria and the former Labor party
government.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said in
Washington Friday he would not adhere to verbal pledges by
previous Labor government to withdraw from the strategic plateau
in return for a peace treaty with the Arab state.
</P>
<P>
In the first reaction to Thursday's talks between Netanyahu and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Damascus said that it is not
interested in the latest ideas put forward by the Israeli leader
to resume peace talks because they approve the Israeli concept
which aims at combining occupation with peace.
</P>
<P>
But it is ready to resume the talks immediately if Israel
accepted withdrawal from Golan, said the official daily Al-Baath
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Syria has warned the U.S., a key sponsor of the Mideast peace
process, not to lose credit in the Arab world by supporting the
Israeli proposals.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Friday denied that last year's Syrian-Israeli
talks had resulted in an unwritten deal on Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights despite Syrian confirmations that Washington was
a witness to the talks.

<HEADLINE> Leading Parliamentarians Call for Raising Women's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Leading parliamentarians in
the world today made an impassioned plea to give the rightful
status to women in political power-sharing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the plenary session of the five-day Specialized
Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, which opened here on Friday,
they called for a major shift in the thought process to ensure
effective partnership between men and women in politics.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said at the conference
that an effective partnership between men and women in politics
had to be evolved through a major shift in the thought process.
</P>
<P>
It was unfortunate that age-old traditions, social norms and
values economic dependence and illiteracy had contributed to the
marginal position of women in the realm of power and
decision-making at all levels, she said.
</P>
<P>
She called for a pragmatic action plan to ensure a more dynamic
and comprehensive role for women.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma in his speech demanded that all
laws passed by parliament should be scrutinized for any gender
bias.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Makes Efforts to Assist Flood-Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government on
Friday set up a coordination center in its central flood-hit area
and dispatched a helicopter to rescue people surrounded by water
from the Zambezi River.
</P>
<P>
To open the center, Mozambican Premier Pascoal Mocumbi arrived
at the eastern coastal town of Beira, the capital of Sofala
Province, one of the most afflicted areas.
</P>
<P>
The center would help homeless people and make preparations
for the restoration of production in the region, the Noticias
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi urged the center to keep close contact with Mozambique
Radio and provincial radios so as to get accurate information on
rainfalls and water levels.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the railway authorities to ensure the
transport of goods for daily use to the disaster-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The flooding of the Zambezi, Pungue and Buzi rivers has
destroyed a huge number of houses and a large tract of farmland,
leaving tens of thousands of people displaced in provinces such
as Tete and Safala.
</P>
<P>
Roads out of Beira and leading to Manica Province and Zimbabwe
have been cut off due to the floods, causing the shortage of some
daily necessities and the mounting prices in the city.
</P>
<P>
So far at least four people were killed and 12 disappeared due
to the floods in the counties of Mutarara and Moatize, located in
Tete Province.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Zimbabwe were reportedly to send planes over
the region for flood relief in these days. enditem

KUALA LUMPUR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is prepared to
provide additional facilities to security forces along its border
with Thailand to upgrade effectiveness in preventing the entry of
illegal immigrants, narcotic drugs and firearms, a senior Home
Ministry official said today.

105-kilometer border between Malaysia and Thailand, Secretary
General of the ministry Shamsuddin Othman said at the Police Field
Force Base at Rantau Panjang, Kelantan, over 400 kilometers north

He said a strict watch was also necessary on the 100 illegal
landing points along the border, which are now used by the local
people to cross the border as they could also be used by illegal

<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Over half of spectacles in
the Hong Kong market have inaccurately-made lenses, according to
the results of a survey conducted by the local Consumer Council.
</P>
<P>
The survey found people with the poorest sight were most likely
to find their glasses unsuitable.
</P>
<P>
The Council bought a total of 75 pairs of spectacles from 15
optical shops and found 55 percent were inaccurately made.
</P>
<P>
The sample spectacles were measured in accordance with a
"tolerance table" set by the optometry clinic at the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University to see how closely they matched the
prescription.
</P>
<P>
The survey found most faulty lenses were off by one unit and in
some extreme cases the lenses were off by more than two units. Of
the 75 pairs of spectacles prescribed for myopia and astigmatism,
41 failed the tolerance tests.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Private Banks' Accounts to Be Inspected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Revenue Authority
(ZRA) would be authorized to inspect private bank accounts on
suspicion of tax evasion after a controversial value added tax
(amendment) bill passed its second reading in parliament Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bill was almost rejected again after about four hours of
debate, during which the back-benchers attacked on the contents
of some draconian clauses in the proposed bill, the Times of
Zambia paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which seeks to give the ZRA the power to inspect the
bank accounts of those suspected tax evaders, was passed only
after Finance Minister Ronald Penza had assured the lawmakers
that some amendments will be made to the bill.
</P>
<P>
Several government ministers stood by the bill against the
backbenchers.
</P>
<P>
Robert Sichinga, a parliament member, warned the bill, if it
was passed as it was, would infringe on the rights of individuals

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Flock to Coastal Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Shishi, an economically booming
coastal city in east China's Fujian Province, attracted 160
million US dollars in contractual overseas investment last year,
up 15 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
A city official said that Shishi, the ancestral home of many
overseas Chinese, approved 153 overseas-funded projects in 1996,
raising to 1,249 the total number of such projects.
</P>
<P>
Contractual overseas investment in Shishi amounted to 1.87
billion US dollars by the end of last year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the overwhelming majority of the projects
approved last year were in the production sector.
</P>
<P>
He added that, apart from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, overseas
investment in Shishi also originated in the US and countries in
Southeast Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the effort to improve the investment
environment over the past eight years, such as the building of
power substations and waterworks, is accountable for the increased
inflow of overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
An increased possibility of direct links across the Taiwan
Straits has also helped attract overseas investment to Shishi,
which is located between Fuzhou and Xiamen, the observers added.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Swahili Settlement Discovered in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have dug up one
of the most ancient Swahili settlements on the east African
coast, according to a East African Standard report today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty archaeologists from the National Museums of Kenya and
American universities discovered the site of Mwana settlement,
submerged three meters in the Tana Delta, after a three-month
excavation.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan archaeologist A. Leli Omar was quoted as saying that
they had also excavated Shaka, the home of the ancient
king Eumo liongo of the east African region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "we discovered six mosque sites at Mwana, one of
them bigger than the Jamia Mosque in Lamu, which means that the
settlement had a population as big as that of Lamu today."
</P>
<P>
Lamu, a coast town of Kenya, has an estimated population of
70,000.
</P>
<P>
According to Omar, the settlement is believed to have been set
up far before the British arrived on the east Africa coast.
</P>
<P>
The excavation started on November 17 last year and is
expected to end in March this year.

MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific airlines will
acquire 3,800 new aircraft in 20 years and will overtake North
American carriers in terms of total seat capacity, according to an
Airbus Industries report published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, a market forecast for the region, said that based
on an annual passenger traffic increase rate of 6.5 percent, the
region will see the fleet rise from its current level of some
1,650 aircraft to 4,100 in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
It said that in addition to the 2,450 aircraft required to meet
traffic growth in the region, 1,350 of the aircraft currently in
service will also be replaced, creating the overall requirement
for 3,800 new units.
</P>
<P>
With 400 advance firm orders already placed by Asia-Pacific
carriers, this leaves a market for 3,400 new sales during the
period, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that a growing proportion of the Asia-Pacific fleet
will consist of wide-body aircraft, with 2,500 aircraft in the
above 200 seat category.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the overall growth, the report said, the number
of seats provided by Asia-Pacific carriers will rise from the
current level of over 400,000 to more than 1.3 million, and will
overtake North American airlines in terms of total seat capacity
in 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Get 51.8 Million Dollars Additional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved an additional credit of nearly 52 million
U.S. dollars to help Jordan's economic restructuring program,
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new credit will raise the IMF credit given to Jordan for
the 1996-98 period to nearly 340 million dollars, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has already received 123 million dollars from the
so-called extended fund facility (EFF).
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which has a foreign debt of about 6 million dollars,
has won high praise from the IMF for its successful implementation
of economic reforms prescribed by the world monetary watchdog.
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided under the title "augmentation of
resources." That means the credit is to be used to increase
Jordan's foreign currency reserves and achieve a better balance
of payments.
</P>
<P>
Jordan adopted the economic reform program in 1989 when it
found its foreign reserves completely depleted, forcing a
devaluation of the Jordanian dinar and unable to service foreign
debts which then stood at nearly 8.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since then it gradually brought down the debts to around 6
billion dollars and stabilized the currency, whose exchange rate
now stands at 1.41 dollars to one dinar as opposed to nearly three
dollars in 1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A large section of the Kyambura
Game Corridor in the Aueen Elizabeth National Park, southwestern
Uganda, has been set on fire since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily the New Vision today, the
pre-dawn fire has spreaded for several kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The affected area had earlier been infiltrated by Allied
Democratic Foree rebels and the residents there had
threatened to set the bushes on fire in order to deny the fleeing
rebels safe hideout, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area were quoted as saying that
no one had claimed responsility for the fire.
</P>
<P>
However, environmentalists here noted that the fire could
have been started by the heat of the dry season.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said it could have been cattle keepers in search
of green pastures that lit the fire. This is a traditional
practice by cattle keepers who believe that by burning the dry
bushes the soil is prepared for greener pasture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the security sources said the rebels who
had infiltrated part of the park escaped back to the mountains
and are on their way back to Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Jordan not Ready to Receive Hamas leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Times today quoted
Jordanian officials as saying that Jordan is not ready to receive
the would-be-deported Hamas leader Musa Abu Marzouk from the
United states.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that the officials, who declined to be
identified by names, maintained that Jordan's efforts to help get
release the head of the political bureau of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) do not necessarily mean that it has to accept the
man in its territory.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzouk, 46, was apprehended by New York immigration
officials in 1995 after a trip to the Middle East on grounds he
violated immigration laws by not declaring affiliation with
Hamas. he obtained a U.S. residency permit in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been involved in efforts to help secure the release
of the Hamas leader who is facing extradition from the U.S. to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
There has been reports that the Hamas leader could be sent to
Jordan instead of Israel as a compromise to avert possible
Palestinian violence that could undermine the peace process.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Official: PNA Ready for Final Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen) said that the Palestinian side is ready to start the final
phase negotiations in the middle of March.
</P>
<P>
In an interview this morning with the Egyptian Voice of Arab
radio, he said that the eight Palestinian-Israeli committees which
will begin their proceedings tomorrow will pave the way for
resuming final stage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the January 14th deal, Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority will begin talks on a final peace agreement
within two months. They will negotiate their final borders
and the future of Jerusalem and of the 144 Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Eight Palestinian and Israeli joint committees will examine
some outstanding problems in the Hebron protocol and transitional
accord between the two sides, like water, refugees, economy, safe
crossing linking Gaza strip to the West Bank and Gaza airport and
harbor.
</P>
<P>
"All issues to be discussed by the eight committees do not need
a long time unless Israel insists on posing obstacles before
these questions," said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
The PA has accused Israel of foot-dragging in forming joint
Palestinian-Israeli committees, which was cited in the Hebron
protocol clauses but agreed upon during talks between Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat
last Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that the coming steps toward settling the
Palestinian issue depend on how the joint committees will work.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Israel of trying to Judaize Jerusalem, Abu Mazen said
that several steps will be undertaken by the Anti-settlements
Committee of the Palestinian Authority for facing up to these
"illegitimate practices."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian committee is responsible for combating the
Israeli settlement expansion activities in all fields and at all
levels, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision to set up a new settlement in Abu Ghoneim
hill in southern Jerusalem has illicited strong Palestinian
outrage.

LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

improving economy would deliver victory to the Tories in May.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- World stock markets hit all-time high Friday as they
celebrated the continuation of the long bull market, which saw the
Dow Jones Industrial Average pass the 7,000 mark on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:

<HEADLINE> Peace Monitoring Force to Be Deployed in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A projected Peace Monitoring
Force (PMF) will be deployed in northern Iraq next month in a bid
to supervise the truce between the two rival Kurdish parties in
the region, local newspaper Daily News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP)
and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) agreed to the
establishment of the PMF in February in the third round of the
peace talks held in Ankara in January under the joint sponsorship
of the United States, Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In January, representatives from Turkey, the U.S. and Britain
met with Iraq's three delegations: the KDP, the PUK and the
Turkmen Front, to review progress in implementing the principles
agreed on October 31 and November 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
The delay is reportedly due to technical aspects of setting
up the force.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Turkmens, 200 of whom, will be part of the force, were
trained in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will provide the technical equipment of the force
and Turkey, backing Iraq's Turkmen minority because of ethnic
and cultural bonds, has persuaded the Kurds to offer them a say
in the administration of the area.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, supported by President Saddam Hussein, fought with
the Iran-backed PUK in late August, which led to U.S. air strikes
against Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
The two groups signed a peace deal on October 31, 1996 under
mediation of the U.S., Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Iraq has been occupied by Kurdish rebels
since the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into rival zones after
the KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Province Slows Down Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's prosperous
Zhejiang Province has decided to slow down its economic growth
after years of rapid development.
</P>
<P>
The provincial gross domestic product (GDP) is planned to grow
10 percent this year, down 2.7 percentage points from last
year. The annual growth rate for fixed-asset investment, retail
sales of consumer goods, and exports will go down by two, 2.3
and 5.5 percentage points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the economic development strategy, Li Zemin,
secretary of the provincial committee of the Communist Party of
China, said "we should effectively combine the effort to control
the overall size with that to readjust the structure."
</P>
<P>
"We want to pursue a reasonable growth rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's GDP saw an annual growth of 18.8 percent between
1991-1995, much higher than China's national average during the
same period. Its growth rate last year was 2.3 percentage points
down from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang will focus its efforts on improving the sectoral,
product and enterprise structures, reinforcing the foundation of
agriculture, tapping the international market and developing an
open-ended economy, to achieve a sustained and coordinated social
and economic progress, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Steady economic growth is a prerequisite for the sound
development of everything else and its importance must not be
underestimated, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Report: Kuwaiti Budget Deficit Drops due to Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti budget deficit in
1995-96 fiscal year dropped from an estimated 1.688 billion
Kuwait dinars (5.57 billion U.S. dollars) to one billion dinars
(3.3 billion dollars) by the end of the fiscal year on June 30,
1996 due to rise of oil prices in international market.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait State Audit Bureau, the state accounting watchdog,
said in a report released Friday that the drop was achieved
through a 25-percent surge in oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
Actual oil revenues increased from an estimated 2.49 billion
dinars (8.217 billion dollars) to 3.1135 billion dinars (10.27
billion dollars). The oil revenues contributed 89.65 percent of
the overall budget revenues, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said actual revenues in 1995-96 were up by 563.1
million dinars (1858 million dollars), or 19.4 percent increase
over the projections. Revenues were estimated at 2.91 billion
dinars (9.60 billion dollars), but actual revenues collected were
3.4731 billion dinars (11.46 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Public expenditures were slightly reduced by the end of the
fiscal year, registering a drop of 160.6 million dinars (529.98
million dollars) from an original projected spending of 4287.1
million dinars (14.147 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said the budget deficit was projected at 1611
million dinars (5.32 billion dollars) after adding the 10
percent deduction from revenues in favor of the Reserve Fund for
Future Generations according to the Kuwaiti laws. The deficit
was later adjusted to 1.688 billion dinars.
</P>
<P>
The actual budget deficit recorded was one billion dinars. But
if the deduction for the fund is excluded, the "net" deficit
becomes just 653 million dinars (2.15 billion dollars), the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, during the whole 1996, Kuwaiti actual budget deficit
came to less than 2 billion dollars because the oil prices
increased an average of 3 dollars per barrel during the second
half of the year, according to unofficial figures. Kuwait exports
nearly 2 million barrels of crude per day.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has a plan to eliminate its budget deficit by the year
2000. It had a budget deficit of 52.8 billion dollars after the
1991 Gulf War because of huge amount of money spent for a
U.S. led-offensive to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
The achievements recorded in 1996 were reminiscent of those
during the oil boom in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But
economists here said no one could guarantee the same performance
in the coming years as crude prices might weaken again.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the drop of Kuwaiti budget deficit was
achieved not due to government policies and plans.
</P>
<P>
The non-oil revenues dropped during the year, according to
official figures. The bureau called on the government to
rationalize expenditure and create new sources for revenues,
especially non-oil sources.
</P>
<P>
It also called for reviewing the existing taxation policies
with the aim to boost its contribution to the revenues. Taxes
contributed just 2.6 percent to the overall Kuwaiti revenues in
1995-96 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Rejects Playing in Davis Cup Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- World No. 1 Pete Sampras
will not play in the Davis Cup when the United States meets The
Netherlands in a second round tie in California in April, Sampras
said in San Jose on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Reuter, Sampras said playing the tie
would mean seven straight weeks of tennis for him and could hamper
his preparation for the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Sampras told U.S. captain Tom Gullikson he would make himself
available for the third-round tie should the U.S. win, but he
doesn't want to endanger his chances of maintaining the number one
ranking and winning Grand Slam titles this year.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who led the United States to the Davis Cup title in
1995, said he is confident the team can overcome the Netherlands
without him.
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi said on Friday he won't make a decision on
playing the tie until he speaks to Gullikson.
</P>
<P>
Number 4 ranked Michael Chang has told Gullikson he would like
to play. Jim Courier and Todd Martin are also possibilities.

<HEADLINE> ASEM Foreign Ministers' Meeting Ends With Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Asian and European foreign
ministers ended their first meeting here this afternoon, pledging
to further economic cooperation while calling for political
dialogue between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
A chairman's statement issued after the one-day meeting said
the ministers from 10 Asian and 15 European countries "emphasized
the importance of strengthening economic cooperation between Asia
and Europe."
</P>
<P>
"The ministers recalled that their leaders had recognized that
the growing economic links between the two regions form the basis
for their strong partnership," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the 25 foreign ministers and a
vice-president of the European Commission (EC) reviewed ASEM
activities since the First ASEM leaders' meeting held in Bangkok
in March last year and progress made in cooperation between the
two regions.
</P>
<P>
They "were pleased to note that, in a relatively short time
..., substantive progress has been made in many areas of ASEM
cooperation," the statement noted, adding, "Cooperation in
economic areas has advanced rapidly."
</P>
<P>
The ministers also exchanged views on the nature of the
political and security dialogue that should be undertaken by the
ASEM and on regional and international issues, it said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the dialogue should begin by discussing issues
of common interest and broaden the topics of the dialogue in due
course on a gradual basis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stressed that Asia-Europe cooperation should be
multi-faceted, encompassing all fields of human endeavor,
including the economy, politics, culture, education, the
environment and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"They underlined that closer people-to-people links are vital
for greater mutual understanding between the two regions," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were foreign ministers from Austria,
Belgium, Brunei, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg,
Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore,
Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, and EC
Vice President Manuel Marin Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, the host country, served as the chairman of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was the first ministerial meeting since the ASEM,
or the Asia-Europe Meeting, was inaugurated in Thailand last year
and the ministers were entrusted with the task of preparing for
the Second ASEM leaders' meeting in the United Kingdom next year.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to hold their next meeting in Germany in
the first half of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Earns 388 Million U.S. Dollars in Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coffee exports
earned 388 million U.S. Dollars in the 1995/96 coffee season,
making the country the top coffee exporter in Africa, the New
Vision newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Fred Kawuma, the Director of the Uganda Coffee Trade
Federation, was quoted as saying that Uganda in the last coffee
season exported 252 million kilograms of coffee, up from 180
million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The world's interest in Uganda's coffee has been boosted by
the Uganda coffee home page on Internet which was fully developed
last year with the support from the World Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the coffee produced in Uganda is exported.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the biggest foreign exchange earner in
the country. enditem

<HEADLINE> Over 155 Zairean Fighters Arrive in Western </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 155 Zairean
soldiers carrying 105 small weapons arrived at the Kibirizi port
in Kigoma, Western Tanzania, on Friday after fleeing heavy
fighting in eastern Zaire, reports from Kigom said today.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, most of them in uniforms, arrived at the port
aboard a boat hijacked three weeks ago on the Zaire-Tanzanian
border. Among them are one captain and three lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
Major Mkunda Llubungo, the soldiers' leader, was quoted as
saying that the soldiers, totally outgunned by the Zairean
Banyamulenge rebels, felt it was their only way out to surrender
and seek refuge in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The initially 815-strong contingent, has been fighting the
rebels since last August without supplies or reinforcements from
their headquarters in Kinshasa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Llubungo said his troops have managed to hit hard at the
insurgents although the latter had better U.S.-made arms and was
backed by neighboring Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Many soldiers from the army loyal to Zairean President Mobutu
have been integrated into civilian ranks and sought asylum in
Tanzania, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kibirizi port is an important entry point for refugees
from Zaire and Burundi into the eastern African country.

<HEADLINE> Benazir Takes Oath as Member of Pak National Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto today wished for a full term for the new
government, saying the country is in badly need of political and
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to end politics of conspiracies and to work on the
issues relating to the country's economic and social problems,"
said Benazir, chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP),
after taking oath as member of the National Assembly for the
fourth time at the Parliament House.
</P>
<P>
No government was allowed to complete its term in the last
eight years and were removed without giving them an ample
opportunity to complete their agenda, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The country needs a stable government away from political
cynicism because this leads to nowhere," Benazir said. "We,
despite the provocations, will not go for agitation and work for
the political and economic stability."
</P>
<P>
It was just for such reason that the PPP was not thinking of
launching campaign out of the Parliament, said Benazir.
</P>
<P>
"It is my keen desire that the incoming government should
complete its term and the next elections are held by the present
set up," Benazir said.
</P>
<P>
Benazir's government was sacked by President Farooq Leghari
last November on charges of corruption, extrajudical killing and
misrule. The general elections were called for February 3 at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Muslim League (N) led by Nawaz Sharif, who was
prime minister from 1990 to 1993, has bagged two-thirds of the
217-member National Assembly seats and Sharif is set to be the
next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Benazir's PPP has claimed that the elections were rigged after
suffering the worst defeat by wining only 17 seats in the National
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Blocks American Airlines Pilots Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today blocked an American Airlines pilots strike minutes after the
walkout started, by ordering a 60-day "cooling off" period.
</P>
<P>
During this period, negotiations will continue but the strike
won't be allowed, said Bruce Lindsey, the president's top liaison
to the talks between the airlines management and union leaders.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was acting under a 60-year-old provision of the
Railroad Labor Act designed to protect the economy from labor
strikes, which also covers airlines.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a U.S. president to carry out the
law in an airline strike in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Pilots Union President James Sovich ordered local strike
leaders around the country to shut down the airline after two and
a half years of negotiations between union and the management.
</P>
<P>
The strike would strand up to 40,000 travelers, cost up to 200
million U.S. dollars a day and force layoffs of 90,000 airline
workers, administration officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
American Airlines had before hand canceled most overseas
flights to avoid stranding planes on foreign soil and begun
canceling some domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
In signing the order, Clinton appointed a three-member
emergency board, which will take 30 days to propose a settlement
while the pilots continue to fly. The parties would get another 30
days to resolve the dispute. If that doesn't work, the Congress
could impose a settlement.
</P>
<P>
The major differences between the American Airlines and the
pilot union were the rate of wage increases and stock options.
Pilots want raises totaling 11 percent through 2000 and increased
stock options. The company has offered 6 percent and smaller stock
options.
</P>
<P>
The average American Airlines pilot makes 120,000 dollars a
year.

<HEADLINE> Italy Revising Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government today
approved a draft revision to the Immigration Law, which will limit
legal immigration, legalize the status of foreigners in Italy and
crack down on illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Those who enter Italy illegally, do not renew their residence
permits or are considered a risk to the society will be expelled
under the new Immigration Law, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the revised law gives legal immigrants, who
have been living in Italy for six years, the right to vote in
local elections.
</P>
<P>
Italian Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano said that entry
quota will be based on the labor market and countries which do
their best to fight illegal immigration will be given extra entry
quota as an award.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to past laws, this one more clearly differentiates
between those who enter and reside legally and those who must
instead be expelled," the interior minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 365 people were
killed and other 1,750 injured in some 500 road accidents
throughout Nepal last year, a government report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey by the Department of Roads, most of the
road accidents involved long-route buses running on highways in
different hilly areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Many fatal bus accidents occurred when passenger buses made
head-on collisions with other vehicles in some risky highway
stretches or when the buses skidded off the road and fell down to
ravines below, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although long distance night bus service is very common in this
mountainous country, the department's survey found that 75 percent
of the highway accidents took place during daytime.
</P>
<P>
The survey of road accidents was part of the country's Road
Maintenance Project, which has recommended to bring some
significant changes in Nepal's existing road system.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the Department of Roads, the department
will soon hold a meeting here to work out strategies for improving
road conditions and traffic rules in the country.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 10,000 buses in Nepal currently and about
95 percent of them are owned by private operators and individuals,
traffic police said.

BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC), one
of China's four state-owned banks, has become a giant
international bank with 533 overseas subsidiaries, according to
bank president Wang Xuebing.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the 85-year-old BOC also has 13,000 subsidiaries at
home and more than 1.8 trillion yuan (about 219 billion US
dollars) in domestic assets and 131 billion US dollars in overseas
assets, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The BOC, with over 200,000 employees in and outside China,
ranked 26th in capital volume and 31st in total assets among the
largest 1,000 banks in the world in 1996, according to Bankers, a
British magazine.
</P>
<P>
Euro Money, another well-known magazine, has selected BOC as
the best Chinese bank for two consecutive years, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the number of his bank's overseas subsidiaries
has almost doubled since China initiated the reform and opening-up
drive in late 1970s, and the overseas business as a whole has
expanded several dozen times.
</P>
<P>
"Our bank has followed a globalization strategy since 1993 and
our branches in Hong Kong and Macao have become note issuers in
the two places," Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
The steady growth in overseas business has enabled the BOC to
move towards the goal of becoming a modern international
commercial bank, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Opposition Leader to Start Countrywide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Begum Khaleda Zia is likely to
start a cross-country trip, in a bid to strengthen her party
network and mobilize public opinion against so-called repression
by the government, party sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"February 26 has been chosen to begin the intended tour and it
may start from Feni, Khaleda Zia's home district," said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the planned tough anti-government street
agitation by the major opposition party is unlikely to be launched
in the near future, according to an influential member of the BNP
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the BNP chief Khaleda Zia had given an Eid-Day, the
festival of fast-breaking, deadline for the government to accept
her party's demands or face a tough agitation 15 days after the
Eid Day on February 9.
</P>
<P>
The BNP's demands include ending "repression" on opposition
activists and allowing the parliament to function smoothly and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister and chief of the ruling Awami
(People') League Sheikh Hasina said Wednesday that no plan for an
anti-government movement would succeed at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party won't be able to destabilize the political
situation in the name of agitation, she added.

losses of nearly four billion taka (about 100 million U.S.
dollars) while the outstanding bank loans stood at 4.72 billion
taka (about 118 million U.S. dollars), official sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the state-owned jute units totally owed
about 15 billion taka (about 375 million dollars) to different
nationalized banks, although a considerable position of the
outstanding bank loans had been settled under jute sector
adjustment credit program financed by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
With the repeated suggestions by the World Bank to disinvest
the state-run sick enterprises, the Textile Ministry has decided
to lay off 18 textile mills this year as part of a process to
privatize them in phases.
</P>
<P>
However, bureaucratic red-tape, sharp opposition from the trade
unions and government's go-slow policy were contributing factors
for delay in privatizing the sick industry.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the intending entrepreneurs have also lost interest to
buy the sick units because of their high bank liabilities, the
sources added.

WELLINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard arrived in New Zealand this afternoon for a three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ reported that Howard arrived in the Ohakea Air Base about
150 km north of Wellington and was met by his NZ counterpart Jim
Bolger. Then they left for the tourist town Rotorua and will spend
the weekend there.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth meeting between the two leaders in less than
one year, but it is the first time for Howard to visit NZ since he
became Australia's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ said the visit, with an informal emphasis, aims to
re-establish close ties between the two countries and more regular
contacts between the two leaders. New Zealand and Australia did
not get on so well during the government of Paul Keating although
they were supposed to enjoy a special relationship known as CER
(closer economic relations).

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Rubber &AMP; Tin Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO), rubber and tin all closed higher this
holiday-shortened week.
</P>
<P>
In this three-day trading week, February south price of CPO
physicals closed at 1,365 ringgit (about 546 U.S. dollars) per
ton, up 17.50 ringgit (about 7 dollars) compared with the previous
week's closing.
</P>
<P>
Prices of CPO physicals are expected to move sideways next week
despite the expected lower production of palm oil for February.
</P>
<P>
A trader said there were concerns that prices might be too
high, although other underlying fundamentals were still good,
especially with the lower production figures.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market this week was generally quiet as
many traders extended their holidays, but rubber prices were
still higher as the local market had adjusted prices in line with
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
At the close this week, March RSS 1 was up 2.0 sen at 304 sen
(about 121.6 U.S. cents) per kg compared with 302 sen (about 120.8
U.S. cents) per kg at the previous week's close while SMR 20 was
2.5 sen higher at 299.50 sen (about 119.8 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to open higher next week with traders
entering the market after a long festive season break, with prices
for the March RSS 1 to be above 310 sen (about 124 U.S. cents) per
kg at the next week end, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
This week, tin price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) rose
10 sen to close at 14.41 ringgit (about 5.764 U.S. dollars) per kg
 compared with 14.31 ringgit (about 5.724 dollars) the previous
trading week.
</P>
<P>
A trader said the market might move sideways but if price on
the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose, the market would also rise.
He expected more players in the market next week compared with
this week.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover for the three-day week was only 242 tons, as
most traders stayed on the sidelines especially on the week's
closing day.
</P>
<P>
Buyers were mostly Japanese, Europeans and locals, but on
Friday Europeans were noticeably absent.

the Composite Index surging on two consecutive days, seeing a
high of 1,259 points before settling at 1,246.91 points at the
close Friday after bouts of profit taking.
</P>
<P>
The steep rise was mainly attributable to the record

The broader Emas Index rose 5.76 points to 361.96 points while

billion shares valued at 5.767 billion Ringgit (about 2.31
billion US dollars) against the previous week's 494.475 million
shares worth 3.017 billion Ringgit (about 1.21 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Second board turnover increased to 126.407 million shares worth
1.613 billion Ringgit (about 645.2 million dollars) against

502.8 million dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Off market deals decreased to 65.570 million shares valued at

</P>
<P>
Market observers said the upward momentum is expected to
continue next week as the market's bullishness remained intact.
</P>
<P>
They said although the market went through what seemed like a
minor consolidation on Friday, the bullish undertone was still
there as players continued to be active.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian auto maker Fiat has
expressed its willingness to invest about 1.2 billion US dollars
within the next five years in various projects in India.
</P>
<P>
This move included Fiat's proposal to manufacture cars in
collaboration with India's Premier Automobile Ltd. (PAL),
envisaging an initial investment of about 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fiat's new Holland subsidiary was also planning to invest 50
million dollars to make tractors in the country, said Fiat's

</P>
<P>
"The car venture with PAL will constitute the biggest share of
Fiat's proposed investment in India but the company has plans to
invest in other projects too," he said.

Fiat has proposed setting up a joint venture with PAL to
manufacture Fiat's "Palio" car in India. PAL has recently started
manufacturing Fiat's "Uno" model. Fiat would have a 74 percent
stake in the proposed joint venture while PAL would hold the
remaining equity.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has cautioned against
blindly following western code of corporate governance which has
been found extreme and counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
The western model would mean the constant engagement of company
management in board room battles subject to fears of takeovers
when the chamber desires the management to commit themselves to
the welfare of the company and its stability, FICCI sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued simultaneously from Mumbai (Bombay)
and New Delhi Friday, FICCI President A. S. Kasilwal unveiled
FICCI's considered views on corporate governance which was
discussed by the FICCI in depth.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim should be to catalyze the corporates to maximize
production, provide employment, set value standards and standards
of quality, provide adequate returns to the shareholders, and give
the exchequer what is due to it," Kasilwal said.
</P>
<P>
The development of institutions which hold the stake should not
act as asset managers but as owners of the companies and should
not look at short-term interests. The concept they should adopt is
maximizing the wealth production capacity of enterprise, he added.

<HEADLINE> Plans to Downgrade Thailand's Credit Rating Objected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand governor
Rerngchai Marakanond believes that "the time has not come yet" for
a downgrade of the country's credit rating.
</P>
<P>
He said this on Friday, commenting on reports that Moody's
Investor Services, a US-based international credit rating agency,
said that it was reviewing and might downgrade the A2 rating of
long-term foreign currency debt owed by the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Moody's report, the Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index closed the morning session on Friday down by 4.53
percent, or 31.54 points, at 666.42.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai said he was confident that Moody's would retain the
A2 rating after considering the latest information supplied by the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
The A2 rating signifies an upper-medium grade investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Thai finance ministry source accused Moody's of
not thoroughly studying Thailand's economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan said the country's economic
policy was on the right track and that he was confident steps
taken by the government, particularly the 99-billion-baht (about
3.96 billion US dollar) cutting of state spending, would improve
the current account deficit and ease inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
Moody's said its review was prompted "by concerns regarding the
soundness of Thailand's financial sector" and concentration in
that sector of "a large portion of the recent accumulation of
short-term foreign currency debt."
</P>
<P>
Moody's said Thailand's financial institutions, particularly
finance companies, had built up their exposure to the property
market and were experiencing an increase in non-performing loans
as a result of lower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, another international credit rating agency, Standard
and Poor's Corp, offered a contrasting conclusion, saying that it
considered Thailand's economy as robust and strongly placed
financially to ride out current pressures without its ratings
being jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
It said Thailand's creditworthiness had not changed since the
agency affirmed the ratings last year as single A for long-term
debt and A1 for short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
Countries rated single A are more susceptible to adverse
changes in economic condition than are those in higher categories,
according to a Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has restructured its external debt, with the ratio of
short-term to long-term debt improving from 50:50 to 44.67:55.33.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign debt totaled 89 billion US dollars last
November, of which 49 billion dollars was long-term foreign debt,
and 18 billion dollars was sovereign debt, according to the
central bank.

<HEADLINE> Panel to Probe Why Charges Dropped on Thai Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister in
charge of financial matters Amnuay Virawan has set up a panel to
find out why a charge against three former Bangkok Bank of
Commerce (BBC) executives has been dropped.
</P>
<P>
Former BBC president Krirkkiat Jalichandra, ex-vice president
Ekkachai Athikhomnantha and former treasury adviser Rakesh Saxena
have been charged with embezzling more than 1.6 billion baht (64
million US dollars) from their bank, which has now almost
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the prosecution announced that they could not
proceed with the case because the one-year statute of limitations
had expired since January 19.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Crime Investigation Division, which has
investigated six cases in connection with the BBC scandal, said it
understood that the statutory one-year period ended on February
12.
</P>
<P>
The panel will have one month to decide whether any of those
dealing with BBC cases are guilty of negligence and if they should
be held responsible for any damage that may result.
</P>
<P>
The police held the Bank of Thailand, the country's central
bank, responsible for failure to take the three to court, accusing
the central bank of being too slow to submit its report on alleged
wrongdoing and other pieces of evidence to investigators.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Kanit Na Nakhon, citing legal terms, supported
the prosecution's decision to drop the charge.
</P>
<P>
He said in a report to prime minister's office minister Pokin
Polakul that the prosecution found that the Bank of Thailand had
spotted the alleged wrongdoing on January 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the commercial bank act of 1962, the case must be
taken to the court within one year after the wrongdoing are
traced. The prosecution could not pursue this particular case
because it had received the police investigation report on
February 5.
</P>
<P>
Kanit said the statutory one-year period had already ended on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
The case can be revived only if new evidence is found, or legal
terms are found to prove that the statute of limitations has not
yet expired.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has alleged that kickbacks might be made to some
concerned authorities to drop the charge.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Chinese Scientists to Cooperate in More Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from China and the
United States will join hands in research projects involving
agriculture, environmental protection, communication, population
and public health in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The projects were discussed Friday by leaders of the China
Association for Science and Technology (CAST) and the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) at an annual
AAAS meeting, which opened in Seattle Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both CAST and AAAS are the largest non-governmental
organizations on science and technology in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Friday's discussions highlighted the training of and exchange
between Chinese and American young scientists to help them become
leaders of research disciplines, according to participants
attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Chinese participants also probed into the
possibility of setting up an Asia-Pacific organization on regional
cooperation in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese participant quoted CAST President Zhou Guangzhao, a
renowned theoretical physicist in China, as saying that regional
cooperation was important in scientific advancement.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who is also the president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, proposed that more activities featuring regional
cooperation be organized at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
But Zhou pointed out that opinions should be heard widely as
Asia-Pacific nations are diversified with different cultures and
in terms of development levels of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed at the meeting that the second Asia-Pacific
conference of science and technology leaders will be held in 1999,
the year before the next century.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Government Ends Second Hostage Talks with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government and
rebels on Friday ended this week's second round of talks on the
future of the 72 captives the rebels held at the Japanese
ambassador's home, leaving the differences over a negotiation
agenda to be mended to a third meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour negotiations had achieved "real progress" toward
an end of the 59-day hostage crisis, Canadian Ambassador Anthony
Vincent, one of the mediators of the talks, said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Reading a written statement, Vincent said the government and
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels had "put
forward their proposals for the contents of an agenda" for future
definitive talks, although "the agenda has not been agreed."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a white Red Cross car had earlier left the
rendezvous of the talk, a safe house across the street from the
holed-up residence of the Japanese ambassador, taking a MRTA
guerrilla back to the diplomatic compound.
</P>
<P>
The MRTA negotiator was believed to be the group's No. 2
leader, Rolly Rojas.
</P>
<P>
The two sides resumed direct talks on Tuesday for the first
time since December 28.
</P>
<P>
Government negotiator Domingo Palermo, the education minister,
met with rebel negotiator Rojas Tuesday in the presence of a
mediating commission, which comprised the Canadian ambassador,
Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Luis Cipriani, Red Cross representative
Michel Minnig and Japan's observer Teruke Terada.
</P>
<P>
A group of MRTA rebels raided a party at the Japanese
ambassador's home on December 17 and held hundreds of guests as
hostages, whom the rebels said would only be released in exchange
for about 400 jailed fellow rebels.
</P>
<P>
Although the rebels have since freed most of the hostages, they
still held the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors, two Peruvian
ministers, Fujimori's brother, Pedro, and more than 20 Japanese
businessmen and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
With two rounds of talks concluded, prospects of the two sides
reaching an agreement were still low, as the rebels refused to
wield its main demand of freeing their fellowmen, which was firmly
rejected by the government.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, during what Palermo described as a "quite positive"
meeting, the two sides agreed to have further talks.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the government was worried about the
situation, Palermo said on Thursday that they will continue their
efforts to seek a quick and peaceful solution to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Speaks at U.S. Science Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese scientist
warned here Thursday that people should not forget the
environmental problems caused by industrial modernization when
enjoying the fruits of the advancement of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
was speaking at the opening session of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the world's largest general
scientific organization.
</P>
<P>
At the six-day 163rd national meeting of AAAS, he cited
population explosion, resources depletion and environmental
degradation as a close companion of industrial modernization and
the luxury life style of the rich.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, a renowned theoretical physicist and also president of
the China Association for Science and Technology, mentioned at the
meeting challenges facing the scientific community now and in the
future from the prospective of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that advances in science and technology have
significantly broadened China's choice of strategies to build a
sustainable modern society.
</P>
<P>
The immediate concern, he said, is how to educate the society
to develop technology adaptable to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,100 scientists from across the United States are
attending the meeting, with the theme of "Engaging Science --
Sustaining Society." The meeting covers a diverse array of

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist on Path to Sustainability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- To find an innovative way to
achieve sustainability in China is much more difficult than just
to follow the traditional road of modernization adopted by
developed countries, a Chinese scientist said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
was speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of
Science (AAAS) annual meeting that opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said in the course of modernization, China should adopt and
use extensively the latest development in science and technology,
while setting up a feasible strategy with clear and limited goals.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, a well-known Chinese scientist and also President of the
China Association for Science and technology, outlined the main
points of this strategy as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Put continuous emphasis on agriculture and improve
conditions of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
-- Build a public massive transportation system in both cities
and suburbs, develop fast speed trains, electric bicycles and
cars, and form a computer control system of transportation.
</P>
<P>
-- Develop efficient communication and TV broadcast networks
using optical fibers and satellites. Popularize the use of
computers, mobile phones, the Chinanet and Internet, and extend
cable TV net to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
-- Invest more on education, scientific research, cultural
activities and health care infrastructure. Build more public
parks, libraries, sports grounds and schools for continuous
education.
</P>
<P>
-- Emphasize energy, water and material saving in production
and consumption.
</P>
<P>
-- Put environmental protection as a basic requirement for
industry and enforce it by law.
</P>
<P>
He said that solving the complex problems of sustainability in
China is a great challenge to the Chinese people and Chinese
scientists.
</P>
<P>
As market forces in general do not take the requirement of
long-term sustainability into account, he added, the scientific
community must work together with policy makers of central and
local governments to identify urgent problems and possible dangers
ahead.
</P>
<P>
"They should work together to educate the society to form a
single voice that achieving sustainability is the top priority for
China from now on," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan PM Condemns Killing of Ellawala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Prime Minister
Sirimavo Bandaranaike has condemned the assassination of Ratbapura
District MP Nalanda Ellawala at Kuruwita town.
</P>
<P>
In a statement received this morning, She said that the killing
of Ellawala and a police officer could be described as a
re-wakening of the "era of killer politics."
</P>
<P>
Ellawala and his parliamentary colleague Dilan Perera as well
as a police officer died last Tuesday at Kuruwita town, 110
kilometers from Colombo, during local election violence between
the ruling People's Alliance (PA) and the main opposition United
National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
She said that this is a political conspiracy of "thug
politicians" who lost their privileges to sabotage the
government's democratic efforts to hold peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
Ellawala was a young politician who was capable of contributing
much to the country, the prime minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
While condemning this assassination, she appealed to the people
and all political parties to take necessary action to prevent such
a tragic incident in the future.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Highlights Equality Before Women's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China's capital of Beijing is
urging local women to make more efforts for equality with men as
the International Working Women's Day, March 8, is drawing near,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qiaoyun, chairperson of the Beijing Women's Association,
said at a press conference Friday that state policy on equality
and Marxist theory on women should be publicized during the
celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
Last year Beijing implemented two programs for the
development of women and children in the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), and had made remarkable achievements, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In the election of city's township people's congresses (TPCs)
last month, 4,363 women were elected as deputies, accounting for
31.6 percent of the total, compared with 26.1 percent in the last
election three years ago.
</P>
<P>
This year is the fifth anniversary of the promulgation of the
State law on protecting women's rights, and the capital will work
hard to publicize the law, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Women's Association will organize a group of
outstanding women from various trades to give lectures on how to
become self-reliant and how to make outstanding contributions to
society, she said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Charter Changes Raise Hot Debate Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos recently changed his mind and wanted to have the
Constitution amended, touching off again a hot debate in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed this desire after the country's Supreme Court
had voided a winning bid of a Malaysian firm for the sale of the
historic Manila Hotel. The ruling prompted Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad to declare that Malaysia would cut down
its investments in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Philippine Constitution Association last Friday,
the President called for changes in the Constitution "to make it
more responsive to the changing times" and enable the Filipinos to
"pole vault into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"Right now, our greatest need is a Constitution that will
respond to our political community's needs as we strive to
fast-track the modernization of our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' new aspiration stunned the whole country because he has
kept on saying he opposes constitutional amendments. Last year,
some of his supporters launched several signature-collecting
campaigns in a bid to amend the Constitution to lift the term
limits for the President and other elective officials.
</P>
<P>
The supporters said Ramos deserves a second term for the
economic gains achieved and the peace efforts made by his
administration. Last year, the country continued to post a robust
economic growth and ended a 24-year-old war with the Moro National
Liberation Front in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
To counter the opposition's allegation that he masterminded
these drives, Ramos has repeatedly declared that he opposes any
changes in the Charter and that he would step down when his term
ends in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ramos took a further step toward amending the Charter by
vetoing a provision in the 1997 national budget which bans the use
of government funds for any activities for the purpose of amending
the Charter. He signed the national budget into law on February
12.
</P>
<P>
Although Ramos said he wants Constitutional amendments to
sustain the country's development and seek a review of the
relationship among the three branches of the government, the
opposition and some lawmakers charged him with plotting to stay in
power beyond 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, at least 50 representatives crossed party lines
in filing a resolution urging the House of Representatives to
override Ramos' veto.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 19 of the 24 members in the Senate endorsed a
resolution after an emergency meeting, denouncing Ramos for
exposing the Charter to possible changes.
</P>
<P>
The congressmen stressed that the "no-to-charter-change"
provision was included in the budget "precisely to safeguard the
sanctity of the Constitution and thwart any attempt" to amend it.
</P>
<P>
"The Presidential veto would, in effect, allow the use of
unlimited public funds for the purpose of amending the
constitution," they said.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first time that a serious attempt would be made
to override a presidential veto, analysts said, adding that the
lawmakers were very confident that the resolution will be adopted
by the House.
</P>
<P>
However, President Ramos belittled the threat, saying the House
will not pass the resolution since the majority of Congressmen
belong to his ruling Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Joseph Estrada also voiced his anger over Ramos.
In a speech highly critical of Ramos, he said that the President
erred in calling for Charter amendments and that "nobody is above
the law, not even the President or myself."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was also the first time that Estrada, an
aspirant for 1998 presidential elections, has questioned Ramos'
policies and decisions. However, they believed that it has almost
been impossible for Ramos to seek re-election after having a
clot-removing surgery on his neck last year.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Investors' Interest in China Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese investors' enthusiasm
in China is rising months after China's policy readjustment which
cancelled tariff exemptions on capital goods imports by
overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese investors' enthusiasm in China is rising and will
continue to rise for the foreseeable future," today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
China's policy readjustment last April did arouse complaints
and trigger a wait-and-see attitude among Japanese companies, the
newspaper quoted Xu Changwen of the International Trade Research
Institute as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But after a few months, most of them adapted to the new
situation and determined to inject further investment into China,"
Xu said. "Large enterprises have shown special vigor."
</P>
<P>
Besides trading consortia, large Japanese manufacturers are
launching umbrella companies in China, Xu said, adding that late
last year NEC Corp (Nippon Electric Corp), mitsubishi Electric
Corp and Sony Corp all launched investment companies involving
more than 30 million US dollars each to expand their investment in
China.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that Japanese investors are generally confident in
China's steady and high economic growth. Chinese experts have
predicted that China's gross domestic product will grow more than
eight percent this year.
</P>
<P>
When compared with Viet Nam and India, which are considered
potential rivals in attracting investment, China enjoys advantages
in low-cost labor and an overall good investment environment, Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investment in high-tech sectors and infrastructure
construction will expand rapidly, as many investors have realized
the importance of choosing projects given priority treatment by
the Chinese Government, Xu said.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Drive to Modernize Telecom Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China has begun major
construction of fibre-optic cables in an effort to modernize its
rapidly expanding telecommunications network, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The drive comes as public demand for clearer and faster
communication rises and the development of cable TV encourages
more cables to link as many areas as possible, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Cross-provincial fibre-optic trunk cables, which can connect
major cities in different provinces and autonomous regions, are
vital to upgrading China's national and local telephone networks,
the English-language newspaper quoted sources of the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The MPT sources said that this year China is expected to start
construction of 12 fibre-optic trunk cables with a total length of
33,000 km, adding that the cables will link Hohhot-Beihai,
Xi'an-Hefei, Lanzhou-Xining-Lhasa, Nanning-Guiyang-Kunming, and
Guangzhou-kunming-Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
To date China has installed 128,000 km of fibre-optic trunk
cables, excluding those linking counties or cities within a
province or autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, China will complete the construction
of and put into operation eight more fibre-optic trunk cables,
including one linking Beijing, Jiujiang and Guangzhou, the MPT
sources said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that China has been working hard to build a
nationwide fibre-optic cable system to link the three
municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and all provincial
capitals.
</P>
<P>
Some cables have extended to cities in neighboring countries,
the MPT sources said, noting that construction of a 970-km
fibre-optic cable linking Harbin, the capital city of northeastern
Heilongjiang Province, with Khabarovsk in Russia, China's first
international optical cable on land, has already been completed.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, China has built two undersea optical cables to
Japan and the Republic of Korea, which have more than tripled the
country's international telephone line capacity, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Hostage-for-rebel Swap Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The leader of a rebel Islamic
group holding 14 hostages in Tajikistan said on Friday that his
men were ready to free the hostages in exchange for their rebel
comrades in neighboring Afghanistan, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said rebel leader Bakhram Sadirov told Russian Deputy
Prime Minister Vitaly Ignatenko by telephone Friday night that the
captives and the rebels waiting for swap were ready to group at
his base on a mountain top in a rocky region about 80 kilometers
from the capital Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
The report said two women hostages -- reporters from Itar-Tass
and Interfax news agency -- were already heading out of the rebel
camp with a driver for Russia's NTV television network.
</P>
<P>
Under a procedure agreed by Tajik and Russian officials and the
rebels, the captives will meet a group of rebels flown in from
Afghanistan by Tajik authorities and then return together to the
rebels' base. Then, all 14 hostages, four Russian reporters and a
driver, eight U.N.representatives and the Tajik security minister,
will be freed, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels took 13 hostages on February 4 and seized Tajik
security minister on February 5 while negotiating.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports that one of the hostages had been killed were
false.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demanded that the Tajik authorities fly in Sadirov's
supporters from neighboring Afghanistan and allow the hostage
group and rebel group for swap to meet up at the rebels' base.

<HEADLINE> Birth Rate Begins to Rise in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of births from an
average Italian woman rose in the first eight months last year,
possibly marking a reversal of the trend that has kept the country
hovering around zero population growth.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Central Statistics Board showed that the
country's fertility index -- number of babies each woman has
during her fertile years -- nudged up as of August 1996, from
1.19 in 1995 to 1.25 in that period.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by data for the year of 1996, which would be
collected by March, the slight increase of births could indicate a
true demographic turning point for Italy, the board said.
</P>
<P>
Given the improved situation, Italy still ranked among the
world's lowest birth rates, the United Nations statistics showed.
With a rate of around 10 births per thousand, it trailed far
behind some African countries, where crude birth rates range
between 40 to 50 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
World Bank data for 1991 showed that an average Italian woman
has 1.3 children, compared with 1.5 children by a German or
Spanish woman and 1.6 by a Japanese or Dutch woman.
</P>
<P>
Among the world's poorest nations, often regions of the fastest
population growth in the world, Rwandan women give births to an
average 8.3 children each, while Yemeni women to 7.7 children and
Malawian women to 7.6.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Expands Special Export Category </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to grant special facilities to six additional categories
of products in a bid to boost the country's flagging exports, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Tunky Ariwibowo said here Friday
the six additional categories of products are food, paper, rubber,
fish, vegetable oils and toys.
</P>
<P>
This brought the number of eligible product categories to ten
after four industrial commodities -- textile and textile products,
leather shoes, wood products and electronics -- received export
tax and non-tax incentives in January.
</P>
<P>
Special facilities offered include exemption from a customs
post-audit one year after goods are exported; notification that
goods for export can be delivered directly to export officials at
embarkation port without passing through a foreign exchange bank;
and an establishment of special places/services for document
inspection.
</P>
<P>
According to a new decree issued Friday by the Industry and
Trade Ministry, companies entitled to the facilities are
producer-exporters and non-producer exporters who are free of tax
or loan problems, and have paid tax for the last two consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has set an increase of 14.2 percent
in non-oil/gas exports for the 1997/98 fiscal year, while total
exports were estimated to rise by 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economic and Finance Saleh Afiff said
recently that the country's ballooning current account deficit was
expected to reach 9.798 billion US dollars in fiscal 1997/98, or
some 4 percent of the country's gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Panama Signs Agreement to Install Undersea Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Panama has signed an
agreement with several American countries to link themselves
through an optical fiber undersea cable, the manager of the
National Telecommunications Institute said today.
</P>
<P>
The communications system to start in 1998 will link the United
States, Aruba, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia
and Chile, manager Juan Ramos Porras told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 309 million U.S. dollars and Panama will
share 5 million.
</P>
<P>
Ramos Porras said the telephone traffic final routing will be
toward the United States, seeking to compete with other
communication means, such as transmission via satellite.
</P>
<P>
Panama could become an undersea cable internaitonal operation
center because of its geographical location, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among other benefits, this system is expected to give the
Panamanian company more competitiveness in the national market,
and when its operation starts it will be able to lower
communications costs.
</P>
<P>
The project will also help Panama create many jobs, the manager
said.

ISLAMABAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Nawaz Sharif, chief of the
Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), was elected last night as
parliamentary leader of the majority party in the National

majority of the house, is expected to take oath as Pakistan's new
prime minister the same day.

The new prime minister shall, within a period of 60 days,
obtain a vote of confidence from the National Assembly. A small

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Guerrilla Demobilization Starts March 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Organization (UNO) set March 3 as the date to start the process of
verification of the disarming and demobilization of the Guatemalan
guerrillas, which will end in May of this year.
</P>
<P>
March 3 is "D-Day" established in the agreements to start the
most important part of the transition in that Central American
country, said Kofi Annan, U.N. secretary-general, according to
reports from New York received in this city.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan said in a report that on that date the group of 155
military observers, headed by Brig. Gen. Jose Rodriguez, a
Spaniard, will be in full operational capacity to start their
mission.
</P>
<P>
The UNO military group will be in charge of separating the
forces, disarming the former insurgent Guatemalan National
Revolutionary Unit (URNG) and the demobilization of nearly 3,000
former rebel combatants.
</P>
<P>
The separation of the forces will be made in several stages.
Guatemalan Army forces will be deployed to prestablished sites and
the guerrillas will concentrate themselves in eight camps located
in the interior of the country.
</P>
<P>
The disarming will consist in the deposit, registration, and
delivery to the United Nations by the former combatants of all
defensive and offensive weapons, explosives, and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The processes of disarming and concentration will start
simultaneously March 14 and end no later than April 14.
</P>
<P>
The demobilization of the combatants that will end with the
URNG military structure will be made in the following manner: 33
percent between April 16 and 21 and the rest from April 22 to May
3.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hails Arbitration on Bosnian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini today welcomed an international arbitration panel's decision
to place Bosnia's disputed town of Brcko under international
supervision for a year before finally deciding its fate.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy hoped authorities of Bosnia's Serb-led
Republika Sprska and the Muslim-Croat Federation, who both claim
control of the town, to respect the decision announced earlier
today by international arbiter Roberts Owen.
</P>
<P>
Italy will encourage both sides to reduce tensions in the town
in northern Bosnia and pave the way towards real peace in the
region, Dini said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement delaying a final decision over the status of
the disputed town came after a year's work by the international
arbitration commission, which includes Owen, European Union envoy
Carl Bildt, and members of the Contact Group, made up of the
United States, Britain, France, Italy and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Brcko is strategically located in a narrow corridor linking
eastern and western halves of Serb-controlled territory in
northern Bosnia. It was mainly populated by Muslims, but they were
driven out by Serbs who took control of the town during the
Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
Both Muslims and Serbs claim they should control the town. The
dispute almost stalled talks to end the Bosnian conflict.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Dayton Peace Accord which ended the war, an
arbitration panel was charged with deciding the fate of the town
by the end of last year. However, the deadline was extended until
today because of the severe tensions between the Muslims and
Serbs.

According to a press report here.
</P>
<P>
Devers and three-time Olympic gold medalist Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, both coached by Bob Kersee, pulled out of the
Millrose meet because of a financial misunderstanding with USA
Track and Field, the U.S. athletics governing body.
</P>
<P>
Kersee apparently thought his two athletes would receive dlrs
35,000 for that meet, but contracts never were signed.
</P>
<P>
For the Mobil Invitational, Devers will get about dlrs 17,500.
</P>
<P>
The addition of Devers was announced at an emotional news
conference where organizers said the prestigious meet's 10-year run
might end because of the loss of Mobil's sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
Mobil announced last fall it was ending its 16-year corporate
relationship with USATF.
</P>
<P>
The Mobil Invitational has been one of the premier indoor meets
in the United States for several years and was ranked No. 3
worldwide in 1994 by the International Amateur Athletic
Federation.

<P>
KIEV, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said today that Ukraine and Georgia will build a marine corridor
on the Black Sea, linking their economies closely.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma made the announcement at a joint press conference with
his Georgian counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, who arrived here
Thursday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the marine corridor, connecting Ukraine's
Ilchevsk and Georgia's Poti, is a major event in bilateral
relations, Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
Once the corridor, part of the Euroasian Transport Corridor, is
open to traffic, cargo from Europe will use less time and money to
reach Central Asia than by land.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate construction of the marine corridor, Kuchma and
Shevardnadze signed agreements on avoiding double taxation and
customs cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
DUBAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The No. 2 seed Thomas Muster of
Austria had to battle for two hours and 31 minutes to fend off a
strong challenge from unseeded Christian Ruud of Norther Ireland
in the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian beat Ruud 6-4, 6-7, 7-5 to seize a semifinal
berth. He will face challenge from Jim Courier of the United
States, who ousted the 4th seed South African Wayne Ferreira in
another quarter-final today.
</P>
<P>
The number 7th seed German Boris Becker brought a drama to his
scheduled match with top seed Croatian Goran Ivanisevic by
announcing his withdrawal from the quarterfinals due to a wrist
injury. The pull-out sent Ivanisevic directly into the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic will meet Jiri Hovak of Czech Republic in Saturday's
semifinal. Hovak outplayed Richard Krajicek of Netherland 6-2, 6-2
to claim the last spot.
</P>
<P>
In today's actions, the in-formed Ruud placed Muster under
pressure by lauching efficient attacks from the baseline and
rushing the net at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Ruud broke Muster's serve in the 4th game of the vital third
set, but he allowed Muster to break back in the next game to level
5-5. After Muster held his sixth service game to lead 6-5, the
Austrian went on to break Ruud's serve to nail the victory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Urge New Sanctions on Blacklisted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Terrorism and human rights
are what U.S. Congressmen often pick up to justify their
oppositions to other countries, and this time some Congressmen
again came out to urge the Clinton administration to step up
sanctions on Iran and Burma.
</P>
<P>
On Feb 10, a group fo senators wrote a letter, released on
Friday, to President Bill Clinton, saying: "We urge you to
maintain and intensify your efforts to isolate the Iranian
regime... since there is simply no reasonable cause to believe
this regime can be reformed from within."
</P>
<P>
The senators, seven Republicans and three Democrats, urged
Clinton to craft any new measures, aimed at changing the Iranian
government's "behavior".
</P>
<P>
Also, a representative, called Doug Bereuter, chairman of the
House subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, required Clinton
on Friday to ban new U.S. investment in Burma.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the mandated sanctions are appropriate or not, I
frankly do not see how the administration can avoid imposing
sanctions on the regime in Rangoon," he said at the Washington
roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press at the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Bereuter complained the Clinton administration had been
"ignoring" a law, which mandates the president to cut off new
investment in Burma.
</P>
<P>
Under current policy, the Clinton administration neither
encourages nor discourages U.S. companies from doing business in
Burma.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Pepsico Inc. pulled out of Burma under pressure
from so-called human rights groups, but days before its pullback,
Unocal Corp, the largest U.S. investor there, said it had signed a
deal to expand its off-shore petroleum prospecting.
</P>
<P>
Other two congressmen, Bill McCollum and Charles Schumer, on
Friday sought to tighten existing so-called "anti-terrorism
legislation", aimed at blocking U.S. financial deals with Syria
and Sudan, blacklisted as "terrorism-sponsors".
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Treasury Department issued regulations
permitting financial transactions with Syria and Sudan, but the
two congressmen said the existing legislation allowing the
administration leeway to grant exceptions should be amended so
that comprehensive sanctions could be imposed on all countries in
the U.S. blacklist, including Syria and Sudan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Arbitration on Bosnian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States welcomes
an arbitral decision to put the disputed strategic northern
Bosnian town of Brcko, announced a spokesman for the U.S. State
Department today.
</P>
<P>
"The United States welcomes the arbitral decision on the status
of Brcko, announced by Roberts Owen in Rome this morning,"
Nicholas Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Owen, a U.S. arbiter, declared that Brcko would
be placed under international supervision pending a final ruling
on its future next year.
</P>
<P>
"No winner is being announced today," Owen said, "We want
international supervision for Brcko for not less than one
year...to allow for a reduction of tensions. We will make a final
choice no later than March 1998."
</P>
<P>
Burns said the U.S. commended Owen and other members of the
tribunal for their careful consideration of this "difficult and
complex issue."
</P>
<P>
"The United States believes the judgement is a fair decision,
which places a high priority on reducing the underlying tensions,
which burden the area, as the key to resolving the status of this
strategically important area," Burns noted.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, which lies on the Sava River, is in a narrow land
corridor linking eastern and western halves of Serb-controlled
territory in northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Both Muslims and Serbs claim that they should control the town.
The row had almost caused the collapse of talks to end the
conflict in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Dayton Agreement, a panel should make an
arbitration by the end of last year over who should control the
town. However, it was delayed by severe tensions between the
Muslims and Serbs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Calls on Bosnian Entities to Cooperate on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Envoy for Europe
and Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum appealed Friday in
Sarajevo on all Bosnian parties to cooperate in implementing the
decision on the status of Brcko.
</P>
<P>
He also invited the international community, especially the
five-nation contact group member-states, to assume their share of
responsibility concerning the thorny issue in Bosnia, according to
Tanjug news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum arrived in Sarajevo Friday afternoon from Rome, where
the international mediators announced earlier in the day that the
arbitration on the fate of the strategic town of Brcko would be
postponed for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
Roberts Owen, Chairman of the International Arbitration
Committee for Brcko, announced that "We want international
supervision of Brcko for not less than a year to let the three
candidates further develop their governmental institutions and to
allow time for the reduction of tension" in the area.
</P>
<P>
Bocko is the only place in Bosnia which is still disputable in
the Dayton agreement that was reached in November 1995. The
judgment on the fate of the town was already postponed once for
two months from December 14, 1996 till now.
</P>
<P>
The strategic town controls the narrow Posavina corridor
linking the east and west parts of Bosnian Serb republic. But it
is equally vital for the Muslim-Croat federation, controlling the
maid road across the Sava river which links Muslims in the south
and Croatia in the north.
</P>
<P>
In Sarajevo, Kornblum had held talks with leaders of both
entities on the need for implementing the decision of the
arbitration panel on Brcko.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, President of Bosnia's collective presidency
Alija Izetbegovic said Friday evening at a joint press conference
that the decision on Brcko was a step towards justice, but not
justice yet, and added it had its good and bad points.
</P>
<P>
President of the Muslim-Croat federation Kresimir Zubak said
the decision on the status of Brcko was expected and added that
the arbitration panel could not have taken a definite decision in
the present situation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after meeting Kornblum and international High
Representative Carl Bildt in the Serb capital Pale, the Serb
representative of the Bosnian presidency Momcilo Krajisnik said
Republika Srpska was informed about the assessments and principled
solutions on the status of Brcko, and conveyed its stands to the
group's representatives.
</P>
<P>
"Our arbiter, and the arbiter of the Muslim-Croat federation,
did not sign anything, as the ruling was unacceptable equally to
Republika Srpska and the federation," Tanjug quoted him as saying.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Bosnian Parties to Abide by Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council urged on Friday the Bosnian parties to abide by a decision
by the arbitral tribunal to put Brcko under international control
for not less than one year.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, which lies on the Sava River, sits on a narrow land
corridor which links eastern and western halves of Serb-controlled
territory in northern Bosnia and was seized by Bosnian Serbs early
in the 1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over who should control it almost caused talks
which ended the conflict to collapse in November 1995. According
to the decision by the arbitral tribunal on 14 February 1997,
Brcko would be placed under international supervision pending a
final decision on the town next year.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council," said the statement, "reminds the
parties... of their obligation to be bound by the decision without
delay.
</P>
<P>
"The Council underscores the importance of prompt and full
cooperation by the parties to the Peace Agreement in carrying
out their commitments to implement the Peace Agreement in its
entirety," the statement said.

NEW YORK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- New York stock retreated
today as more investors took some of their profits, following a
three-day rally that saw the Dow Jones industrial average rise
more than 200 points and surpass 7,000.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 33.48 points at 6,988.96. For the week, the
Dow increased 133.16 points.
</P>
<P>
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 480.14 million shares,
down from Thursday's brisk 584.39 million.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indexes were also lower, but on the NYSE the
number of advancing issues still beat decliners by a 10-to-9
margin.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 0.94 to 423.48. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.37 to 808.45. Both had set records
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.62 to 1,367.19, weighed down
by falling computer shares. The American Stock Exchange market
value index lost 1.25 to 594.15.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said that producer prices fell 0.3 percent
in January, while market watchers were expecting a 0.2 percent
rise. The decrease was led by heating oil, meat and cars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Commerce Department said industrial production
was unchanged in January. That was in line with analysts
expectations. And the percentage of factories in operation fell a
slight 0.2 point to 83.3 percent, also in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks were among the weaker issues with usual
bellwethers leading the way. The share prices of Intel, Microsoft
and IBM all moved down.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose, sending the yield on the 30-year bond down
nearly 0.10 point to 6.53 percent, which partly benefited the

<HEADLINE> ILO, UNICEF Unite to Combat Child Labor in Soccer Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization signed today an agreement with the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Pakistani local government of
Sialkot in Punjab Province to eliminate child labor in the soccer
ball industry there during the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
According to an ILO press release, the Sialkot district alone
produces nearly 75 percent of the world's hand-stitched soccer
balls for an export market that generates 1 billion U.S. dollars
in retail sales annually. A recent ILO study estimates that as
many as 7,000 children currently work in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in Atlanta of the United States, sets up
a program to assist manufacturers and assemblers of soccer balls
in identifying and removing child laborers from the industry and
providing them with educational and other opportunities. The
voluntary program calls on manufacturers to publicly commit to a
series of actions designed to prevent the practice of stitching by
children under 14 years of age, by requiring the formal
registration of all contractors, all stitching locations and all
stitchers, including documentation of their ages.
</P>
<P>
About 1 million dollars will be involved in the program, with
500,000 dollars from the ILO, 200,000 dollars from the UNICEF,
360,000 dollars from local manufacturers and 100,000 dollars from
the Soccer Industry Council of America.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Pilots Poised to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged the American Airlines and its pilots union to continue
seeking a settlement as the pilots were poised to strike at
midnight today.
</P>
<P>
"They need to go back to work," Clinton said this afternoon.
"They've got a few more hours of work to do."
</P>
<P>
The airline has announced that it would halt overseas flights
beginning tonight to avoid planes parking on foreign airports. It
also began canceling some domestic flights today. Passengers
across the country have to make alternate arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department estimates a walkout would cost up
to 200 million U.S. dollars a day and strand up to 40,000
passengers. The largest American airline's pilots strike could
also affect 90,000 workers in related jobs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton could declare an emergency, making it illegal for
pilots to strike and creating a 60-day "cooling-off" period. But
he was trying to avoid using the power.
</P>
<P>
The major differences between the American and the union were
the rate of wage increases and stock options. Pilots want raises
of totaling 11 percent through 2000 and increased stock options.
The company has offered 6 percent and smaller stock options.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for the airline and the pilots haven't met
face-to-face since Wednesday, but a federal mediator has shuttled
proposals between them.
</P>
<P>
The pilots set up a late-night conference call to spread the
word about developments. The airlines also set up hot lines for
passengers inquiries.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be willing to negotiate around the clock until we get a
deal, but at 12:01 we go on strike," said union spokesman Dave
Bates.

<P>
NEW YORK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
will not take the place of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and
will not set up any office in Hong Kong after July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuan, Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, made
this statement at a seminar held here today, during which, banking
officials from both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong expressed
their full confidence in a stable and consistent monetary system
in Hong Kong after China resumes its sovereignty over the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Chen made a key note speech at the seminar named "Hong Kong's
Monetary Arrangements Through 1997", which was hosted by the New
York Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
In line with the Basic Law, he said, the monetary systems of
the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong will maintain their mutually
independent relationship.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, the People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority will maintain a mutually independent
relationship with each performing its own functions in their
respective areas, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the central bank supports Hong Kong's
commitment to maintaining the linkage between the H.K. dollar and
the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate of 7.80 H.K. dollars to 1
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The mainland-based financial institutions setting up offices in
Hong Kong shall be approved and supervised on the same basis as
their foreign counterparts by the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
While raising funds in Hong Kong, mainland companies will be
given equal treatment as other international and local market
participants, without any privileges, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also talked about the role of Shanghai which is re-emerging
as China's financial center. He said that in the short run and at
least before the Renminbi becomes fully convertible, Shanghai is
not likely to develop fully into an international financial
center. But he added that given the size of China's economy, China
has the capacity to hold more than one financial center.

NEW YORK, February 14 (Xinhua)-- Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, gave his support to Chen's view
of mutual independence, adding that in fact, the degree of
monetary autonomy that Hong Kong will enjoy after July 1 will be
even higher than what it currently enjoys as a British colony.
</P>
<P>
"The monetary relationship.... has now been defined as one
country with two currencies, two monetary systems and two monetary
authorities which are mutually independent," he said. Banks from
mainland operating in Hong Kong will enjoy no special privileges,
according to the agreement between the monetary authorities of the
mainland and Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuebing, Chairman and President of the Bank of China,
expressed his belief that Hong Kong, as a financial window for the
mainland, will play a more significant role in raising capital for
the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wang also turn down the saying that China will favor Shanghai
as its main financial center. "Such concerns, however, are
unfounded for one very simple reason -- China knows that the
continued success of Shanghai is closely tied to that of Hong
Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 15.1 billion U.S. dollars flew from Hong Kong to the
Chinese mainland as direct foreign investment, which pushed the
total of such funds to more than 93.7 billion U.S. dollars. This
represents 57 percent of total foreign direct investment that has
flowed into mainland since 1979, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Also at the seminar, John Bond, Group Chief Executive of the
Hongkong Shanghai Banking Cooperation, and Patrick Gillam,
Chairman of the Standard Chartered Bank, voiced the commitment of
their banks to furthering the prosperity of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Disarmament Conference Adopts Vague Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament
(CD) today failed to adopt a specific agenda for 1997 but listed
eight items in a vague agenda.
</P>
<P>
According to a CD press release, the eight items listed for
consideration by the CD are cessation of the nuclear arms race and
nuclear disarmament; prevention of nuclear war, including all
related matters; prevention of an arms race in outer space;
effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon
states against the use or threat of nuclear weapons; new types of
weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons,
including radiological weapons; a comprehensive program of
disarmament; transparency in armaments; and consideration and
adoption of the annual report and any other report, as
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
However, in a formal statement on completion of his term in the
rotating presidency of the CD, Joun Yung Sun from South Korea said
here today that he was pleased that CD members had been able to
adopt an agenda, though not a specific one as expected, at the
"eleventh hour" of his tenure. He said that if there was consensus
in the CD to deal with any other issues later, they could be
considered under the extensive agenda.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the broad agenda adopted today is a
compromise among negotiators just for the session to go on. Since
the CD began its current session on January 21, what should be
priority issues for the disarmament talks has been one of the
major differences between the negotiators in their debates.
</P>
<P>
During the past three and a half weeks, representatives from CD
members have identified their priority issues and have made their
positions on such issues more clearly known through their
statements in the plenaries, informal plenaries, and other forms
of consultations.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the three sessions of the open-ended informal
presidential consultations respectively devoted to such issues as
nuclear disarmament, a fissile material cut-off treaty and
anti-personnel landmines, were useful and contributed to moving
the overall process of the CD forward," Sun said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he regretted that the question on how to enchance the
credibility of the CD as the single multilateral negotiating forum
for disarmament has not yet been answered collectively by all CD
members.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the CD has accepted Japan's proposal to appoint a
special coordinator to conduct consultations with its members to
identify the issues in nuclear disarmament which could be
negotiated in the CD and to report to the CD on the result of
these consultations no later than the conclusion of the 1997
session.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the CD agenda should not be limited to the
three subjects listed by Sun. A Chinese representative said that
discussion on these points was not sufficient to achieve consensus
on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the CD on January 30, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that he strongly supported
continued efforts towards nuclear disarmament, including
negotiation of a convention banning production of fissile
material. He also support efforts to ban anti-personnel landmines
and said it seemed logical for the CD to play a role.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the CD to continue to use "one of its strongest
instruments", a consensus approach to problem solving. "Consensus
protects the interests of each state, big or small, and ensures
that negotiated treaties and conventions command the widest
support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Group of 21 non-aligned countries have
stressed that their proposals should be taken into account, in
particular with respect to nuclear disarmament, the Groups's
overall priority. Pakistan has underlined that nuclear
disarmament, security assurances for non-nuclear powers and
regional conventional arms reduction were its priorities.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has expressed reservations against the separation of the
fissile material issue from that of nuclear disarmament. The ban
on fissile material for military purposes should become a sub-item
of the nuclear disarmament issue, like that questions of security
assurances and the prevention of an arms race in outer space, its
representative said.
</P>
<P>
Western countries like the United States, Italy and Spain have
said clearly that their priorities are the following two: a ban on
production of fissile material and a ban on anti-personnel
landmines.
</P>
<P>
After two-and-a-half years of negotiations culminating in the
drafting of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treat approved by
the UN General Assembly last September, the CD is now ready to
focus increased attention on other issues on the international
disarmament agenda.
</P>
<P>
The CD presidency rotates among all of its members for a four
working-week period in accordance with the listing of the
membership in English alphabetical order. The next plenary meeting
of the CD is scheduled for February 20. The representative of
Romania will chair the remaining part of the current session
ending on March 27. Selecting one or two more specific issues from
the current vague agenda of eight items will be one of his major
challenges.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Urge New Sanctions on Iran, Burma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Terrorism and human rights
are what U.S. Congressmen often pick up to justify their
oppositions to other countries, and this time some Congressmen
again came out to urge the Clinton administration to step up
sanctions on Iran and Burma.
</P>
<P>
On Feb 10, a group fo senators wrote a letter, released on
Friday, to President Bill Clinton, saying: "We urge you to
maintain and intensify your efforts to isolate the Iranian
regime... since there is simply no reasonable cause to believe
this regime can be reformed from within."
</P>
<P>
The senators, seven Republicans and three Democrats, urged
Clinton to craft any new measures, aimed at changing the Iranian
government's "behavior".
</P>
<P>
Also, a representative, called Doug Bereuter, chairman of the
House subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, required Clinton
on Friday to ban new U.S. investment in Burma.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the mandated sanctions are appropriate or not, I
frankly do not see how the administration can avoid imposing
sanctions on the regime in Rangoon," he said at the Washington
roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press at the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Bereuter complained the Clinton administration had been
"ignoring" a law, which mandates the president to cut off new
investment in Burma.
</P>
<P>
Under current policy, the Clinton administration neither
encourages nor discourages U.S. companies from doing business in
Burma.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Pepsico Inc. pulled out of Burma under pressure
from so-called human rights groups, but days before its pullback,
Unocal Corp, the largest U.S. investor there, said it had signed a
deal to expand its off-shore petroleum prospecting.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Measures to Increase Adoptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed bonus payments for states that increase adoption of
children in an effort to let the nation's 450,000 children in
foster care to find homes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposal was part of his "Adoption 2002" campaign
designed to double the rate of adoptions in five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the White House, 450,000 children were in foster
care in the nation in 1995 and only 20,000 of them have been
adopted.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health and Human Services aims to place
54,000 children into new homes by 2002 by reducing bureaucratic
barriers to adoption.
</P>
<P>
The Department recommended federal fund for every child that
states adopted over their prior-year totals. Larger bonuses would
be awarded when children with special needs find homes.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed 10 million U.S. dollars for technical
assistance and grants for state agencies, courts and communities
to help find ways to recruit parents and place children.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a law took effect allowing families with
incomes below 115,000 dollars to receive a tax credit of up to
5,000 dollars if they adopt a child.
</P>
<P>
For those who adopt hard-to-place youngsters, such as those who
are minorities, older, disabled or have siblings, the tax credit
will be more.

<HEADLINE> Most European Shares up, London, Frankfurt Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Most major stock markets in
Europe ended the week higher Friday, with London and Frankfurt
both hitting new closing highs, boosted by Wall Street's overnight
sharp gains and the strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index on the London market sustained most of its
early gains today, boosted by the Dow's record closing Thursday
and the strong bond market despite Wall Street's negative opening
Friday, and managed to end at a new closing high of 4,341.0, 13.9
points up on the day and 33.2 points higher over last week.
</P>
<P>
Traders said receding political concerns also helped the London
market after reports that a March 20 election had been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares, although ending below the day's
highs reached earlier, still finished 18.7 points up at a new
record level of 3,248.18, a gain of 110.17 over last Friday, still
supported by New York and the strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, share prices also lost early gains,
despite of expectations of stronger French growth in 1997, after
Wall Street started to consolidate its rally, with the CAC-40
index finishing the session just in the negative ground, 0.99
points lower at 2,627.42, but still a rise of 29.9 points on last
week.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended up 13.9
points at 4,341.0. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index closed 18.7 points
higher at 3,248.18. In Paris, the CAC-40 index finished 0.99
points down at 2,627.42.

<HEADLINE> Canada Trails Others in Trade with Asia, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada is being left behind in the
race among Western nations to develop new trade with Asia, according
to a new study by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Canada's share of the Asian market has dropped by 33 percent to a
1.6-percent share of the Asian import market during the past decade,
while other Group of Seven countries (excluding Japan) have slipped
only 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Business and political preoccupation with the U.S. market, a
limited choice of high-value products to sell, a clumsy sales pitch
and Canadian ignorance of the region have cost Canada dearly, said the
report, which was released today.
</P>
<P>
Overall, over 80 percent of all Canadian exports go to the U.S. and
only 9 percent of its exports are to Asia, according to the
foundation, which was set up 12 years ago to promote Canadian
awareness of Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic relations with some countries are long-standing...but
nowhere in Asia are we a major economic presence," the Globe and Mail
newspaper quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Canada's strength in raw material and components (which lack
popular brand names or national identity) means "we are, in Asia, the
Unknown Country," the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are growth opportunities for entrepreneurs who match Canadian
expertise and advantage with large Asian markets for processed food
products, education services, cultural industries, environmental
services and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
However, only 600 Canadian-owned firms maintain permanent staff in
Asia, which the report said is "disappointing for a country of three
million people and 2.3 million companies."
</P>
<P>
Even in 1995, the best year for Canada, the 17.5 billion U.S.
dollar value of Canadian goods exported to Asia lagged behind all
other G7 countries, with Italy at 22.6 billion; France, 26 billion;
Britain 27 billion, Germany 54.1 billion; the United States 179.9
billion; and Japan, 193.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
It's partly a problem of what Canada sells and how it sells it, as
well as its late start in jumping into the market, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Unchanged in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua)-- U.S. industrial production
was unchanged in January after a sharp rise late last year, the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was a latest sign that showed U.S. economic growth was
moderating from a fourth-quarter surge last year and suggested
restrained price pressures.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report said production at the nation's factories, mines
and utilities was unchanged in January after rising a 0.5 percent
in December. But it was still 4.7 percent above its level of
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The output of consumer goods in the month was unchanged after
having risen at a rapid pace in the preceding two months. The
output of business equipments rose by 0.8 percent while production
of intermediate products declined by 0.5 percent after a revised
drop of 0.8 percent in last December.
</P>
<P>
Among industry groups, the manufacturing output edged down by
0.2 percent in January after an increase of 0.7 percent in last
December.
</P>
<P>
The operating rate for U.S. industry slipped to 83.3 percent in
January from 83.5 percent a month earlier, indicating there's room
for moderate growth without inflationary bottlenecks developing.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of a well-balanced economy, the U.S. Commerce
Department said today that U.S. business inventories fell by 0.1
percent in last December after holding unchanged in November. An
unwanted buildup in inventories can cause layoffs and production
cutbacks as businesses try to clear their shelves and stocks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the latest reports showed that U.S. economy
is slowing its pace since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government announced late last month that U.S. economy
expanded at a quick pace of 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of
last year.

BONN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said today that the good relations between Germany and the
United States have become "self-evident".
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the upcoming visit to Bonn by the U.S.
State Secretary Madeleine Albright beginning on Sunday, Kinkel
told the General-Anzeiger newspaper that he can not agree with the
notion that the current German-U.S. relations are losing
substance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Bonn and Washington can have a dialogue on all
issues.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel showed reservations about the French proposal that five
large NATO states should negotiate with Russia over a solution to
the dispute on NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We must examine all the possibilities, which would make it
easier for Russia to discuss the expansion issue," Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister will leave for Moscow on February
18 for a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Refuses to Pick up Syrian Talks Where </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday repeated his call on the Syrians to
resume peace talks, but refused to pick up them where they ended.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a private think-tank, the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, Netanyahu said the talks, which broke down in
disagreement a year ago, could be revived without preconditions
and he was ready to meet with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
But he rejected Syrian demands to pick up peace talks at the
point where they left off, only saying: "If President Assad does
prove... that he chooses the path to peace, he sill find us
reasonable and cooperative partners."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel had started their sporadic talks since 1991,
and in 1995, Israel's former labor government had offered Syria a
pullback on the Golan Heights in exchange for a secure peace. But
the talks collapsed last year as disagreement emerged and the
Israeli election was looming ahead.
</P>
<P>
Syrian negotiator Walid Mouallem has insisted the offer by the
Labor government was binging, and other Syrian officials have said
if the peace talks were to resume with Netanyahu's government, the
negotiations should begin from that point.
</P>
<P>
Israel refused to accept the approach and Netanyahu said at the
institute: "We cannot be bound by conversations or by ideas or by
speculations,... We can only honor signed agreements."
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli prime minister indicated that he would
"take note" of the concessions proposed by his predecessors, Labor
prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
His offer to "take note of what took place in the talks between
Syrian negotiators and the previous government" was seen as a
gesture toward Damascus. He also did not rule out a territorial
compromise.
</P>
<P>
When touched on the Palestinian issue, Netanyahu gave no sign
to agree to the final status of a Palestinian state covering the
whole Israel-occupied territories and East Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians constantly demand.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he reaffirmed Jerusalem "will continue to be
undivided and under our sovereignty," and insisted to "develop"
existing Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
And he also shifted blames on Syria for Israeli troops not to
pull out of Lebanon, saying it was Syria that would not let him
withdraw the troops.
