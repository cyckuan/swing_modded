A WIN IS ALL THAT MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Raljon, Md. - Your emotions are splintered, your nerves are
frayed.
</P>
<P>
   You're not sure whether to celebrate 30 minutes of exhilarating
dominance or fret over a team that nearly authored the greatest
collapse in NFL history. And you're wondering what to think of this
football team.
</P>
<P>
   You're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is a win on the road against a team that thought
it was going to kick our (expletive) up and down the field,''
personnel boss Bob Ferguson said. ``In this case, you take the win
and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in this case, all that matters is the outcome. Because
after 60 minutes in enemy territory in what might have been the
most pivotal game in the push for the postseason, the Cardinals had
more points than the Redskins. And while the stunning improvement
of the offense is equaled only by the staggering decline of the
defense, there is little doubt that this team is getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 6-5 in the NFL,'' center Aaron Graham said. ``If we take
care of business, if we win three of the next five games, we're
9-7. That probably puts us in the playoffs where anything can
happen. So whether people like it or not, we're a
playoff-contending team.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, a playoff-caliber offense.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they racked up 436 yards. The three-headed running
back produced 178 yards in 34 carries, 5.24 yards per rush. And in
the last 10 quarters, the offense has scored 95 points.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable achievement, given their feeble stagger from the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   What's important here is the progress. An offense that couldn't
find the end zone with a zoom lens is now moving with damaging
efficiency. An offense that believes it can move the ball on
anyone. And proving it.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half against Detroit, the light bulb went on. In
the second half against Dallas, they went to a no-huddle attack in
hopes of erasing a huge deficit. It almost worked. Against the
Redskins, they were determined to strike quickly, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty pleased with what we're doing,'' tackle Lomas
Brown said. ``But I think Jake (Plummer) is just a lot more
comfortable. He's taking his time. He's taking what the defense
gives him. At first, he was pressing because of our start. Now,
he's taking the offense to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, much of this is attributed to a long-awaited comfort
zone. Not just for Plummer, but for offensive coordinator Marc
Trestman.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the play-calling was wonderful in diversity and
intent. And as the lead shrank with alarming frequency in the
second half, the play-calling remained gutsy and oozing with
confidence, the sign of a team playing to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting that relationship where he feels comfortable
calling any play at any time,'' Plummer said. ``Early in the year,
Marc wasn't in a groove calling plays. As an offensive coordinator,
you've got to find that groove. It took him a while to find out
what kind of offense we are. Now, he's figured that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Trestman: ``I knew there would be a learning process. Not
just for the players, but also for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the defense is currently in shambles. Eric Swann's
injury might turn into a six-game ordeal. J.B. Brown can't cover
anyone. The pass rush dips in and out of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a defense that has given up 11 touchdowns in the
past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense will be fine,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   How so?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it always has in the past, right?'' Ferguson said.
``Besides, it's OK to outscore them for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is OK. Because after an 0-2 start, after needing
three chances to get over .500, after questioning themselves and
the officials, after three of the most exciting football games
you'll ever see, the Cardinals are 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   And when they came down the mountain from Flagstaff, it is a
record most would have embraced after 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Just like you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably be a little disappointed,'' Plummer said. ``But
seeing how we've struggled, what we've gone through and how we've
come out of it, I'm happy to be where we're at.'' &QL;

DEVILS, CATS IN STATE OF CONFU SION

<P>
   PHOENIX - They wear different colors, reside in different towns
and answer to different area codes.
</P>
<P>
   But for the people who don't know or care about those
differences, Arizona could be in Arkansas and a Wildcat is a Sun
Devil. Or are we talking about Wild Devils and Sun Cats?
</P>
<P>
   No two schools in the country seem to face the identity problems
that haunt Arizona and Arizona State. Broadcasters often mix up the
nicknames. At least three preseason college football magazines got
it wrong in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever is the editor of those has to be an idiot,'' Arizona
State fullback Jeff Paulk said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a mistake that sits well with the teams' players and
alumni. One never wants to be confused for the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ask former ASU lineman Joe Cajic, who is battling leukemia and
has talked to the University of Arizona's Medical Center about a
possible bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hate that I may have to go down there and ask the
`devil' to save my life,'' he smirked. ``I figure when I'm down
there, I might as well try to steal some plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the schools' names confused all the time. And I don't
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   So repeat: Arizona ``Wildcats.'' Arizona State ``Sun Devils.''
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant on a 5{-hour journey from Los Angeles to
Honolulu sure didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was aboard Sept. 2, a couple of days before its 27-6
victory at Hawaii to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of a lonely preseason camp at Cochise College
near the Mexican border, these Wildcats were anxious for
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   As the flight landed came this announcement from the attendant,
a Hawaiian resident who wasn't aware of the not-so-subtle
differences between Tempe and Tucson:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for flying with us, and good luck to the Arizona
State Wildcats.''
</P>
<P>
   The groans muffled the sound of downshifting engines as the
flight's tires hit the the runway at Honolulu International.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Arizona's youngest players looked around in disbelief.
About 10 days later, they began to learn that a mixed and mistaken
identity is probably a permanent malady.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning before Arizona's 31-14 victory at Stanford on
Sept. 12, the Wildcats picked up a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Above a box full of statistics, starters and injuries, there
were the names of the schools with a helmet next to each.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Arizona, there was the ASU helmet in mocking maroon and
gold. The helmet's dancing Sun Devil seemed to be winking as if to
say:
</P>
<P>
   Gotcha again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to distinguish state schools when athletically
they're polar opposites,'' said Cynthia Van Matre, assistant
director of promotions for the NCAA. ``Because the two have had
similar athletic success, people, probably most east of the
Mississippi, have trouble differentiating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we think of all those tan people walking around in the
sunshine as one and the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Why don't similar problems seem to plague universities in the
same boat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, could you get back to me on that one?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Increased national exposure would only help the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often do you hear Florida and Florida State confused?''
ESPN's Lee Corso said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU deals with it as often as Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 team's visit to the Rose Bowl, a vendor was
selling T-shirts that said, ``Ohio State vs. Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice during functions at the Sun Bowl last season, they were
introduced as Wildcats, once by a coach from the opposing team,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was just trying to be a jerk,'' Paulk said.
</P>
<P>
   Sports highlight shows often get the schools' logos wrong,
showing a Wildcat for a Sun Devil and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Even the very different course of the two teams this season
might stir up some of the same old confusion. Consider the national
polls.
</P>
<P>
   In the Associated Press preseason poll last August, ASU was No.
8. In last week's AP poll, Arizona was No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Or is that the University of Arizona State at No. 8?
</P>
<P>
   For a casual football fan or an occasional newspaper reader from
outside the state, it might look that way. &QL;

MAJERUS' HEART IS IN UTAH, BUT ASU COURTSHIP TEMPTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ During a news conference Sunday featuring the
eight coaches whose teams will compete in the Maui Invitational,
Rick Majerus sat next to Rob Evans.
</P>
<P>
   And tonight, in the last game of the night, Majerus' Utah team
will play Evans' Arizona State squad.
</P>
<P>
   As some might say in these parts: ``'A'ole pele kekahi mea''?
</P>
<P>
   (Isn't that something?)
</P>
<P>
   Majerus was courted, and courted hard, by ASU Athletic Director
Kevin White after the forced resignation of Bill Frieder in
September 1997. White met Majerus in Atlanta and the two talked for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about money, shoe deals and White's mandate of
building a first-class program. But a few days later, Majerus said
he was staying at Utah. Afterward, White publicly said Majerus'
contract with Reebok was an obstacle because ASU was in the process
of becoming affiliated with Nike.
</P>
<P>
   But the real reason, White knew, was that Majerus simply was not
emotionally ready to leave Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what the bottom line was,'' Majerus said.
</P>
<P>
   White made Don Newman the interim coach and kept looking, but
Majerus still headed the list.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Utah had a big year. The Utes got into the NCAA
Tournament, where Majerus sprung a triangle-and-two defense (with
the help of then-Seattle SuperSonics Coach George Karl) on Arizona
and beat the Wildcats by 25 points in the NCAA West Regional final.
That put Utah in the Final Four, where it lost to Kentucky in the
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Now Majerus _ the glib, funny regular guy who lives in a hotel,
a man consumed with basketball and the academic success of his
players and, oh yeah, one heck of a coach _ was an even hotter
commodity than before. And White tried again, this time making his
pitch in a San Antonio hotel the day after the Kentucky-Utah game.
</P>
<P>
   And again Majerus said thanks, but no thanks. Like before, it
wasn't the money (ASU would have found a way to come close to the
$1 million or so Majerus makes from combined sources) or the shoe
deal. Majerus underwent multiple-bypass surgery several years ago,
but his heart works fine. And it was telling him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   So White hired Evans, who had coached White's son, Michael, for
three years at Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin White is really a good guy, a good friend,'' Majerus
said. ``An opportunity to work with him and for him would have been
terrific. And obviously, there's a lot more sunshine, and the
livability is a lot higher in Tempe. But I really like Utah, and I
have a commitment to my players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ASU job is a great job. ASU should be in the Final Four.
It should be a national power. It has everything _ campus,
facilities, athletic director. It's a sleeping giant. But it wasn't
the right time given a lot of the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Majerus said he seriously considered White's offers. He loves
Arizona's weather and pondered moving his mother, two aunts and two
uncles to the Valley for the winter. But some of the
``circumstances'' involved returning players Andre Miller and Hanno
Mottola, and players Majerus ``thought'' would be returning. But
three began their two-year Mormon mission, leaving Majerus with a
more inexperienced team than he planned.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue, however, is how well Majerus is treated at
Utah. He has a great relationship with the president, the athletic
director and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at Utah,'' he said, ``have been very good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   None has been better than billionaire Jon Huntsman, the
program's No. 1 booster whose name adorns the Utah arena. Huntsman
is ga-ga over Majerus. He lets him use his private jet and would do
just about anything to make sure the coach stays. Like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day Jon saw the women (basketball team) coming into
practice, and he said, `I never realized you had to leave the gym,'
'' Majerus said. ``And then he said, `I'm gonna build you a gym if
you want.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If I asked Jon to do that, he probably would. But I'm not
gonna ask Jon to do that. I told him I'd rather you build another
wing on the cancer center. He's building the biggest cancer center
in America. My mother had breast cancer. My grandfather died of
cancer. One of my close friends growing up died of cancer. I'd much
rather not leave the gym, but, Jon, find a cure for cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Majerus can see himself remaining at Utah another four or five
years, but he says repeatedly this is not his last job, that change
is good. Majerus sometimes wonders what it would be like to coach
in the NBA, and acknowledges the ``frustrations'' of trying to
recruit to a place where it snows a lot, where there are few blacks
and which is perceived by outsiders as a ``religious school.''
Ultimately, he admitted, ``I don't know what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, meanwhile, wants ASU to be his last stop. He doesn't mind
that he wasn't the first choice, so long as he was the final
choice. He knows White didn't want to consider him at first because
Michael White had another year remaining at Mississippi. But when
Michael not only gave his blessing but lobbied his dad to hire
Evans, Kevin White's conscience cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick has had a tremendous amount of success,'' Evans said.
``He has a great program. It was smart of Kevin to pursue it. . . .
But my family and I have really been embraced by the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, in fact, might have been White's guy all along if not for
the conflict with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried not to do this,'' White reportedly said when Evans
came to interview, ``but it was inevitable.''

SKIERESZ READY TO RUN IN REMATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The record is startling.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen victories and two second-place finishes in four years
are the kind of numbers that lead to talk of a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Skieresz might laugh at even the suggestion. Dynasties are
like empires and bandwagons. They can get awfully crowded.
</P>
<P>
   There are no crowds for a long-distance runner such as Skieresz,
a University of Arizona senior. She is usually by herself at or
near the lead, where her only company is the course and a possible
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   That's where she figures to be today in a rematch with
Villanova's Carrie Tollefson in the NCAA's cross-country
championships at Lawrence, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tollefson beat Skieresz over a 6,000-meter course at
Furman University. Skieresz, the 1996 national champion and 1995
runner-up, has no illusions. Either the course or Tollefson or some
unknown is always there to spring an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Skieresz intends to win back her title but is prepared for
anything. Otherwise, just let her do what she always done better
than just about anybody. Let her run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to deal with other people after the race,'' she
said of having to confront media questions after last year's
finish. ``I just wanted to leave, but I couldn't. The way everybody
was treating me, it was as if everyone thought somebody had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions were like you were hurt or sick. I lost the race
and that was it. It was just that day. I had no answers.''
</P>
<P>
   For a young woman, the difficult experience might one day be
seen as an important lesson in the life of an Olympian. An Olympic
medal isn't won without some of the personal mettle forged by tough
times.
</P>
<P>
   Skieresz, 22, has bounced back. She went on to win the 1998 NCAA
outdoor titles in the 5,000- and 10,000-meter runs. She added an
indoor title in the 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens today, she is being measured for her
chances at making the 2000 Games at Sydney. If she is not a
dynasty, she is definitely an Olympic hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Olympic Trials, Skieresz got a glimpse at how big a
leap it is from college stardom to world class. She ran in the
5,000 meters after missing seven weeks of training because of a
stress fracture. She still finished 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't expect much after the stress fracture,'' said
Skieresz, who totals seven individual NCAA championships in cross
country and track. ``But it was a good experience. I'm glad I went.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to line up against Mary Slaney. That was
incredible. I could have gone home after just doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also puts you in your place. You're in college and you
think everything is great, then you realize how small you are and
how much faster you need to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, running itself is enough. Skieresz says she doesn't
especially like organized workouts. Interval training is a grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love just running,'' said Skieresz, who today is among a
list of favorites that includes another Arizona senior, Abdi
Abdirahman, in the men's 10,000 meters over a winding course at the
University of Kansas' Rim Rock Farm. ``I like the runs of an hour
or more. That's something I would do even after I'm not
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State and Northern Arizona also will be competing for
the women's team title. BYU is the defending champion, but it can
expect stiff challenges from Stanford and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is the defending men's champ, but the favorite is
Arkansas, which finished three points behind the Cardinal last
year. &QL;

SUN DEVILS FRESHMAN TO PLAY SOON

<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ Even before playing its first game in the Maui
Invitational, Arizona State came out a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Rob Evans learned late Saturday night the Sun Devils
will have the services of Kenny Crandall, the highly touted
freshman point guard from Mesa Mountain View High School.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is when. Crandall received the necessary SAT
score to regain his eligibility but has to proceed through the NCAA
bureaucracy to be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Evans can't say when that will be. There is an outside chance
Crandall could join his teammates before the end of the tournament.
ASU plays Utah tonight and has games on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 Crandall, who is paying his own way at ASU this
semester, has not been allowed to practice with the team. He has
been working out on his own, and Evans said he can't say when
Crandall will be in game shape.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of when Crandall plays, his addition is a huge boost
for the Sun Devils. Starting point guard, sophomore Alton Mason,
has had trouble adjusting from junior college. Crandall also
provides depth at the off-guard position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough, hard-nosed kid, and we need that,'' Evans said.
He's a 6-foot-4 point guard. I like that. He really adds a huge
piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils will get the final piece of this year's puzzle
when forward Mike Batiste becomes academically eligible on Dec.

DEFENSIVE PLAYERS EMBAR RASSED

<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Kwamie Lassiter's game-saving interception
didn't wipe away the sting.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a member of the Cardinals' defense who felt good
about allowing Washington to score touchdowns on six consecutive
drives Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage finally stopped when Lassiter, who forced a fumble
earlier, intercepted Trent Green with 1:02 left to preserve the
45-42 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think think there is anyone on the defense who isn't
embarrassed,'' rookie safety Pat Tillman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, down 25 points at halftime, gained 289 yards, 250
through the air, in the second half against a defense that was
rated in the top 10 in the NFL just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Green threw three second-half touchdown passes, two to wide
receiver Michael Westbrook and one to Leslie Shepherd, who combined
to finish with 17 catches for 242 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have a lead like that, we have to put a foot on their
throat and crush their larynx,'' linebacker Jamir Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unfamiliar territory for the Cardinals, who had never
held a 31-0 lead since moving to Arizona in 1988. They had scored
only 10 points in the first quarter all season and were averaging
seven points in first halves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the second half, there is no way they should have
even had a chance,'' strong safety Tommy Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins put on scoring drives of 79, 80, 61, 48 and 78
yards in the second half. Two of the marches took two minutes or
less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out at the start of the ballgame talking about trying
to stop the run,'' defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said. ``We
got way ahead, they went to to a three-receiver set. All of a
sudden, there was a landslide.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just because the Cardinals were playing without
their best defensive lineman, Eric Swann, who missed his fourth
consecutive game after undergoing knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was killing me, watching that,'' said Swann, who made the
trip at Coach Vince Tobin's request.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' game plan in the second half was simple _ they
double- and triple-teamed defensive ends Simeon Rice and Andre
Wadsworth, eliminating the Cardinals' pass rush that had four sacks
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   They had Green roll out often and throw at cornerback J.B.
Brown, who was forced to play the entire second half because Tommy
Knight reinjured his hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, they had a lot of success against me,'' Brown
said. ``This wasn't one of my better games. Maybe I was pressing
too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Cardinals replaced Brown with J.J. McCleskey,
whose 42-yard pass interference penalty with two minutes left set
up the Redskins' final score.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I looked back, I know they wouldn't have called it,''
McCleskey said. ``You have to make plays. A couple of times, I
didn't make plays. Thank God we won this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was more frustrated than McGinnis, who emptied out his
playbook in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were running every coverage, every blitz, every personnel
grouping,'' McGinnis said. ``We were fighting for our lives. They
would extend things, and the noose would tighten.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense faced its final test after Washington stopped Mario
Bates on fourth and 1 at the Redskins' 31 with 1:16 left.
</P>
<P>
   On second down, Green tried to hit Westbrook. The pass was high,
and Westbrook tipped it to Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody just had to step up and make a play,'' Lassiter said.
``If it wasn't me, it would have been somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a bold statement, given what had been going on throughout
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so dazed,'' Tillman said. ``They came out and beat the
(bleep) out of us, beat the (bleep) out of me. We won, but that's
small consolation.'' &QL;

LOVE OR HATE IT, UNIQUELY AMERICAN FORMULA SELLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A tawdry affair has Congress tied up in
impeachment hearings. A professional wrestler is the new governor
of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   And Jerry Springer has a movie coming out.
</P>
<P>
   Some may view this as evidence that the country is in trouble _
especially that last one.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough, critics say, that ``The Jerry Springer Show'' _
which offers up daily doses of hair-pulling, eye-blackening
discussion on topics ranging from interspecies marriage to adults
who wear diapers for fun _ averages 7 million viewers and often
beats ``Oprah'' for the top television talk-show ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's further coarsening the culture by playing a shock-chat
host named Jerry in the comedy ``Ringmaster,'' which opens in
theaters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that Springer's just-released autobiography
``Ringmaster!'' and a best-selling series of ``Too Hot For TV!''
videos, and it looks like Springer is out to grab the King of All
Media crown from fellow shockmeister Howard Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, he told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people who had done `Dumb and Dumber' came to me with
the idea of doing a comedy,'' Springer said. ``It just sounded like
fun. The actual acting was OK, but it was neither a high or a low
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I know what this is,'' he added, referring to
Springermania. ``This is a fleeting moment, it's a blip on the
screen, I'm not going into any time capsule. Right now, I'm part of
the pop culture; I understand it has a life span.''
</P>
<P>
   A life span some pray will be short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's never matured beyond the imagination stage of
cognitive development, Springer displays an uncanny knack for
pandering to prurient interests,'' said Ted Baehr, conservative
media critic and publisher of the Camarillo-based Movieguide
magazine. ``It just adds to the unraveling of the social fabric of
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a counterargument, of course, which boils down to the
soft-spoken, borderline intellectual Springer being less a menace
to society than just a guy who knows the entertainment value of its
underbelly better than, say, Kenneth Starr does.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, The Associated Press reported that TV sets across the
nation were switched to Springer's show _ the topic was ``I Will
Break Up Your Marriage!'' _ in response to Starr's droning,
televised testimony Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects the culture; it doesn't do anything to the
culture,'' said Springer, 54 and looking fit in an expensive
T-shirt and dark Armani suit. ``Not that one show reflects America;
that suggests that there's only one way for the 250 million people
in America to live. Television is at its best when it reflects the
entire community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our show, and some shows like it, come along and show us, for
the first time, people we've never seen before on television,''
said Springer, the divorced father of a 22-year-old daughter who
jealously guards his own personal life.
</P>
<P>
   The film focuses on two ``typical'' guest groups who vie for a
slot on the slightly fictionalized ``Jerry Show.'' There's the
trailer-dwelling mother and daughter who compete at seducing one
another's male partners, and a woman who catches her boyfriend in
bed with her two best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a broad, sweeping tendency to look down upon these
people,'' said the film's director, Neil Abramson. ``I wanted to
show that these people are human beings. My agenda was very
nonjudgmental. To me, the movie is really about people trying to
communicate, in some odd way.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer would say the same thing about his show. Nationally
recognized media expert Robert Thompson agrees _ to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, people are complaining that it's crude and
tasteless, but in many ways the show is giving voice to individuals
that many people just don't think should be able to talk on
television,'' said Thompson, professor of film and television at
Syracuse University. ``If you take those complaints to their heart,
they are very much issues of classism and elitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Springer's right about that, but I completely disagree that
he's somehow solving that problem. It would be a noble act if he
were just giving regular human beings a voice. But if the only
place that we get to see them is `The Jerry Springer Show' when
they're all acting like circus freaks, instead of doing a great
favor to the silent majority he's in fact presenting them as a
completely out-of-control group of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What middle-class America takes away from that is: Oh, they're
what we always thought they were. They're run exclusively by their
emotions, they can be set off at the slightest bit of provocation,
they're violent and all the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jerry thinks that somehow he's doing a favor to that class
of people, I think he's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer has a fallback to that argument. He said the show was
never meant to be taken the least bit seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost amusing to see people get all excited about a
silly television show. Obviously, lots of people love it and other
people just hate it. You've got to wonder; there's got to be
something else going on in the world to get excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Springer has a realistic perspective on the
matter. Which is not surprising; he's had a lot of other things go
on in his life, most of them more exciting (if none quite as
lucrative) as hosting ``The Jerry Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Springer was deeply involved in liberal politics (he was a
campaign aide for Robert F. Kennedy) when he graduated from
Northwestern University law school in 1968. He won a seat on the
Cincinnati City Council three years later, which he was forced to
resign in 1974 when it was discovered that he had paid a Kentucky
prostitute with a personal check.
</P>
<P>
   By 1977, Springer had bounced back to become the city's mayor.
When his term ended, he began a 10-year stint as Cincinnati's
top-rated TV newscaster and commentator, a job he gave up in 1993
to devote more attention to his Chicago-based talk show. Last year,
an attempt to resume serious news commentary for Chicago's NBC
affiliate lasted a week, cut short by a storm of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Springer's family background. His parents escaped
Berlin on the eve of World War II and he was born in London five
years later; the rest of his relatives were murdered in the
Holocaust. In his autobiography, Springer eloquently relates how
after 40 years of living in the United States, his aged father kept
a big car he could barely drive anymore. ``In case,'' the old man
told his son, ``we've got to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Springer critic Thompson agrees that there are worse things
to worry about than a syndicated circus of dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``American culture has a lot of really, really serious problems
it's got to deal with. Jerry Springer isn't on the top 100 of that
list,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's not the most tasteful thing in the world; pregnant
women getting hit by chairs is not exactly something I would want
to get on a soapbox and start defending. On the other hand, as much
as we can make comparisons to the fall of Rome, Jerry Springer is,
in the end, kind of like a dirty joke we tell in the locker room.
The future of the free world is not so much at stake because of him
as many people think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns, however, have led to a few changes. Earlier this
year, the show's producer, Studios USA, was pressured to request
Springer stop the fights that regularly broke out on his
contentious chatfest.
</P>
<P>
   Like that could work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company wanted to lessen the violence on the show and,
yet, keep the confrontation,'' Springer said. ``That's an easy
policy to write down; it's a tough one to pull off. If you'll
notice, the summer shows, which had already been taped, looked
really weird, because in order to cut out a punch there you had to
jump cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you've watched in these last few weeks, you'll notice
that our shows are as wild as ever. They're probably less violent,
though, because we're using more cameras and better editing. You
see all the scuffling but you don't see a punch to the face if that
were to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The very notion that violence on a real-time taped, ``reality''
show could be regulated is informed by the widely held notion that
most of Springer's shows are faked. While admitting that it
happens, Springer maintains that a good 95 percent of his guests _
and their unreal problems _ are the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been duped by guests, we've been duped by producers,''
he acknowledged. ``And I won't even say, sometimes, `duped.' There
can be so much pressure to get that show done by Friday, they call
their friends and say, C'mon say this. But we have a pretty good
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand, there's no obligation for it to be real, we could
script the whole thing. As long as it's entertaining, that's our
job.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a loyal, naturalized American, Springer thoroughly
understands that the business of this country is business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great American entrepreneur, I'll give him that,''
Thompson said. ``Jerry is a perfect example of American television
at its most American. He looked at the field. He assessed, not what
people would say about him, but what people would actually watch
when nobody knew they were watching it _ and there's a big
difference. He saw how Donahue had left, how Oprah had classed-up
her act, and he just realized that this was a huge, ripe plum ready
to pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he picked it. Cruel and crude as it may sound, that is a
very American concept.''
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of wrapping himself in the Constitution _
he said he's not a First Amendment hero, just a beneficiary _
Springer is vocally grateful to live in a country where every man
and woman, and the transvestites who love them, are free to
embarrass themselves in front of a nationwide audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love America. We were that immigrant family that came
over and saw the Statue of Liberty was everything that she said
she'd be. But we sometimes have to battle for it. Some people here
would give up the Bill of Rights if they've had a busy day. They
don't realize how precious this is.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ In the long and bitter border rivalry between
Minnesota and Green Bay, Randy Moss has supplanted Brett Favre as
the big cheese.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something about the Packers that brings out the best in
Moss, Minnesota's extraordinary rookie receiver. For the second
time this season, Moss made the Green Bay defense smell like
week-old Limburger.
</P>
<P>
   With eight catches for 153 yards and a touchdown, Moss ignited
the Vikings to a 28-14 victory Sunday and a Minnesota sweep of
Green Bay for the first time since Dennis Green and Mike Holmgren
became the coaches in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota improved its record to an NFC-best 10-1 and left the
Cheeseheads for dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, who visit Dallas on Thanksgiving Day, moved another
step closer to the NFC Central title and home-field advantage in
the playoffs. With five games remaining, they have a three-game
lead and the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Packers, who dropped
to 7-4 and watched their three-year stranglehold on the division
slip away before 64,471, the largest crowd in Vikings history.
</P>
<P>
   Packers fans left Minneapolis howling, ``No Moss.'' No wonder.
</P>
<P>
   In two games against the Packers, Moss had 13 receptions for 343
yards and three touchdowns. He had an 80-yard touchdown called back
in the Monday-night game at Green Bay and had a 61-yard touchdown
nullified Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy was fired up and ready to play, and we found ways to get
him the ball,'' Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham said. ``I
just throw the ball up, and he gets it. Nothing he does surprises
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham completed 20 of 30 passes for 264 yards and two
touchdowns, with one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, who was 31-of-39 for 303 yards and two touchdowns, with
one interception, pulled the Packers to within 20-14 with 7:31
remaining when he threw his second scoring pass to tight end Tyrone
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offense is going to score points, but we had a chance to
win at the end, and that's all you can ask for,'' Favre said.
</P>
<P>
   Favre may have asked, but he didn't receive. The Vikings
responded with what could turn out to be their most important drive
of the season. Cunningham and Moss were the primary conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   First, they hooked up for a 19-yard gain on third-and-nine.
Then, they collaborated on a 49-yard touchdown when Moss turned
backup cornerback Rod Smith inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy has that rare ability to make a play no matter if he's
covered or not,'' Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick
said. ``He's a little like Barry Sanders in that there's always a
chance he might score on any play.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Vikings owned the Packers this season, Holmgren
wouldn't concede that Minnesota is the better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to say that,'' said Holmgren, whose record fell
to 5-9 against the Vikings, including 1-6 at the Metrodome. ``After
we gave up 10 points (in the first quarter), the game was real
close in the fourth quarter. I don't think anybody's better than
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers proved again they don't have the cornerbacks to
match up against the Vikings' tall threesome of Moss, Cris Carter
and Jake Reed. Craig Newsome, Green Bay's best cornerback, left the
game in the first half when he suffered a deep cut on his knee.
Moss abused Smith, his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the coverage that matters, not who's on that side,''
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's defense was as good as the offense. The Vikings
forced three turnovers, including an interception by cornerback
Jimmy Hitchcock that was returned 58 yards for a touchdown that
gave them a 10-0 lead after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can hold that team to 14 points, you're playing
good defense,'' Green said of the Packers. ``We put pressure some
pressure on Favre, and we played excellent run defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings sacked Favre three times and forced a fumble. They
limited Green Bay to 53 yards rushing and an average of 2.9 yards a
carry.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings had another advantage _ the fans. The Metrodome was
so loud, Green Bay committed nine penalties for 48 yards, including
five on its fourth-quarter touchdown drive. Four were false starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this was the most dominant Vikings crowd in a
Packer-Viking game,'' Green said. ``In the past, there were 25,000
Packer fans cheering. This time, we had a little bit more control
because our fans held on to their tickets and wanted to get into
our house.''
</P>
<P>
   And they helped make Green Bay's life miserable from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings led 13-0 in the second quarter after Hitchcock's
interception return and Gary Anderson field goals of 35 and 29
yards. Favre's first touchdown pass to Davis made it 13-7, but
Minnesota led 20-7 at halftime when Cunningham found Carter alone
in the back of the end zone on a four-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   There was no scoring in the third quarter. Davis and Moss had
touchdown catches in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My touchdown really got the Metrodome rocking,'' Moss said.
``It was a matter of me adjusting to the ball. Our offensive line
was giving Randall time to throw. I told him to just put it up
there, and I'd get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a lot of single coverage today, and the ball was
coming my way. Moments like this make me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   And make the Packers feel bad.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay should earn a wild-card berth and could meet the
Vikings a third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure we'll still find ways to get him the ball,''
Cunningham said with a sly smile.

SPECIAL TEAMS TAKE ADVANTAGE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALJON, Md. -  &UR; Kwamie Lassiter wasted no time Sunday practicing
what he and his teammates had preached all week.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter, the Cardinals' backup safety, and the rest of the
special-teams unit determined before their 45-42 win over the
Washington Redskins that turnovers were going to be the key. After
the Cardinals went three-and-out on their first possession,
Lassiter stripped Washington's  &UR; Brian Mitchell on the punt return
to set up  &UR; Joe
 &UR; Nedney's field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get a chance, we have to seize the opportunity,''
Lassiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Special-teams play figured big on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Washington kicker  &UR; Cary Blanchard had his first field-goal
attempt blocked by  &UR; Bernard Wilson and came up short on his second
attempt, a 52-yarder. He also hooked an extra-point attempt.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Redskins recovered an onside kick,
their second this season against the Cardinals. But when they tried
again after their final score late in the fourth quarter,  &UR; Pat
Tillman recovered for Arizona. &QL; 
Cardinal killer
</P>
<P>
   Redskins wide receiver  &UR; Michael Westbrook, considered by many to
be an underachiever since Washington selected him fourth overall in
the 1995 draft, has made a living at home against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Six of his 12 career touchdowns have come at home against the
Cardinals, including three Sunday to go along with 135 yards on 10
catches. Westbrook caught two last year at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium,
including the game winner in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a tough, tough receiver,'' Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince
Tobin said. ``He's awfully tough to keep in check.'' &QL; 
A scary moment
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals video director  &UR; Benny Greenberg said he's going to
have a headache for a few days, but things could have been a lot
worse after the stool he was sitting on broke and he hit the back
of his head and neck on the floor during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said he wanted to continue working after some
co-workers helped him to his feet, but team and stadium officials
insisted on X-rays and a trip to the hospital. Although he was able
to walk, he was asked to leave on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up missing the second, third and fourth quarters,''
said Greenberg, who expects to be back at work next week against
Kansas City. ``And that really made me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, 72, is in his 33rd season with the Cardinals. &QL; 
On the road again
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' third road win of the season is their highest
total since 1994, when they won three under Coach  &UR; Buddy Ryan
during an 8-8 campaign. The last time the Cardinals finished at
least .500 on the road was 1984, when they finished 4-4 while still
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have two away games remaining: at Kansas City
Sunday and at Philadelphia on Dec. 13. &QL; 
Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals wanted to prove that their 187-yard rushing
outburst against the Redskins during the teams' first meeting two
weeks ago wasn't a fluke. And they did.  &UR; Adrian Murrell's 92 yards
paced the Cardinals, who bettered the previous meeting's total with
188 rushing yards.  &UR; Mario Bates added 56 yards on 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' five sacks were their highest total of the
season. &QL;

ANOTHER NON CALL COMPLAINT  
 THIS TIME IT'S REDSKINS UPSET WITH OFFICIATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ It was the great comeback that almost was.
</P>
<P>
   After it had fallen barely short, the Washington Redskins were
not only angry at themselves, but also cranky with the referees for
a perplexing call leading to Arizona's critical final touchdown in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the call in their favor might not have changed the
outcome of the game, and it certainly wouldn't have altered the
course of Washington's lousy season. But it could have helped.
</P>
<P>
   The call came after the Redskins, who had once trailed, 31-0,
battled to keep Jake Plummer out of the end zone yet again with the
Cardinals ahead, 38-35, and less than 4 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer leaped from the 1, with the ball extended. As the ball
appeared to cross the plane of the goal line, it was knocked out of
the quarterback's hands and recovered by Redskins linebacker Derek
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he was going to put the ball across, somebody knocked it
out and I jumped on top of it,'' said Smith, a college teammate of
Plummer's at ASU. ``I thought it was a fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals argued for a touchdown because, they said, Plummer
controlled the ball as it crossed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials ruled neither touchdown nor fumble. Referee
Mike Carey said Plummer's forward progress was halted before
reaching the end zone. Thus, the Cardinals maintained possession,
and Plummer dived over from the 1 on the next play for a 44-35
Arizona lead.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins Coach Norv Turner said the officials missed the fumble
and compounded their mistake by, in effect, trying to turn back
time and pretend it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explanation I got was that basically back when you were 8
years old and you used to play in the back yard and you're playing
with your buddies, you have five on each side, and you are not sure
what (the call) was. So you called it a do-over. You know, play it
again,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some tough calls and tough decisions, but you have
to make them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carey, the referee, said afterward that the officials never saw
the ball cross into the end zone. He didn't say whether that was
because the ball didn't break the plane, or if it was because the
officials were screened and simply couldn't see the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forward progress was stopped,'' he said. ``Therefore, we can't
give him a touchdown and we couldn't determine when the ball came
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's score on the ensuing play gave the Cardinals the
insurance they needed to withstand one last Redskins touchdown and
prevent Washington from successfully completing the greatest
comeback in regular-season NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins quarterback Trent Green completed 14 of 17 passes for
203 yards _ in the third quarter. The Redskins scored touchdowns on
six straight possessions, beginning at the end of the second
quarter and extending into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the Redskins originally thought Arizona cornerback
Aeneas Williams might be assigned exclusively to one receiver:
either the dangerous Michael Westbrook or Leslie Shepherd. The
Redskins feared Williams more than anyone else in the Arizona
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up that they left Aeneas on the same side all day, so
they each (Westbrook and Shepherd) had opportunities to go on
different guys all day,'' Green said. ``Both Michael and Shep had
great days. When you are down by 31 points, you need to put the
ball upfield.''

DEION-LESS DALLAS SURVIVES SEAHAWKS, BUT VIKINGS NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It was an improbable Dallas Cowboys' victory for
a multitude of reasons. Like too many mindless penalties, and too
many injuries, with one of those causing the sudden departure of a
nine-toed Deion.
</P>
<P>
   But one local myth was buried Sunday, at least temporarily. The
Cowboys defense is capable of still facing the music when Deion is
rendered danceless and useless.
</P>
<P>
   Listen closely, however, and you can hear the big band sound of
Minnesota's orchestra of receivers. Those trombones will be here
way too soon, meaning Thursday, for a Dallas defense that now has
an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   What to do without Deion? His fingerprints and footprints are
supposed to be all over this defense. His crippled limp out of the
postgame locker room Sunday suggested his game-readiness for
Thursday is basically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the 30-22 victory against Seattle at least provided the
Cowboys with a short-notice blueprint on how to handle the upcoming
season's toughest test since that long-ago visit to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks aren't exactly Minnesota, but the element of
offensive danger was very real Sunday. Receiver Joey Galloway can
torch a cornerback in a hurry _ and did. Kevin Smith suffered a
first-degree touchdown burn early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And while the debate was still going on over why Smith was left
in single coverage on Galloway, Deion took a second-quarter limp
off the field, not to return. With the game very much undecided at
that point, the Cowboys had to play the remainder of the afternoon
with the cornerback duo of Smith-Charlie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, this was a defense still wearing Jake the Snake
skidmarks from a week ago in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in reality, we benefited today from the breakdowns we had
in Arizona,'' defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``If we hadn't
responded to that kind of adversity, it wouldn't have been the
group of guys I think we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Charlie goes, he practiced all week at corner, took
all the reps with Deion out, so he was also more prepared, as
opposed to when he had to come in cold last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Troy Aikman and Co. continued to show offensive thunder
and consistency, leading to a whopping 17-minute advantage in
possession time. This is the best friend of any defense.
</P>
<P>
   But that still subtracts nothing from how the Cowboys' defense
played without Deion. Holding the Seahawks to one touchdown in the
first 56 minutes, two for the game, and then snuffing a late drive,
was a total reversal from the collapse of last week.
</P>
<P>
   The front four provided adequate pressure on Warren Moon, the
blitz paid off with Darren Woodson forcing an early Moon fumble,
Campo left Galloway admittedly frustrated with his ``help''
coverage for Charlie Williams, and ...
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith proved yet again that the one thing he hasn't lost
is mental toughness. Beaten upon all season by receivers and local
critics, Smith still never caves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin gave up that long one early, but he bounced right back
and kept making the plays, including the biggest play of all _ the
last one,'' Woodson said.
</P>
<P>
   On a Seattle fourth down from midfield, Smith knocked away a
pass intended for Galloway. With just over two minutes left, that
one sacked the game for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much the players on this team appreciate
Kevin,'' added Woodson. ``I know a lot of people don't, but we do.
He hung in there today. We all did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was another one of those games we don't win the last
couple of years.'' Woodson said. ``But that's a tribute to Chan
Gailey and the coaching staff. Week after week, we have to rely on
our depth, and those people come in ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injuries and penalties that piled up Sunday, Gailey,
responding to a question, said, ``Yes, this was a game we were
still supposed to win even if there were a lot of reasons we could
have lost it. If you want to be a good team, you have to overcome
all forms of adversity. We did that. And we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Gailey also added, ``But we weren't supposed to be that
ragged doing it, I admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gailey could have held Deion out of the Seattle game,
hoping for an improved toe against Minnesota. But why?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to win now, and worry about the next game when it
gets here,'' said Gailey. Amen to that.
</P>
<P>
   By winning now, the Cowboys are 8-3 and have won four straight.
Now, of course, the worry can start, both about the next game and
Deion's toe.

COWBOYS BEAT PAIN, PENALTIES AND SEAHAWKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys continued their steady ascent
to the league's elite Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They overcame 15 penalties and worrisome injuries to several
star performers, then claimed their fourth consecutive victory for
the first time in three years, popping the dangerous Seattle
Seahawks, 30-22, at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman remained undefeated in games he has
finished this season. In his finest outing of the season, Aikman
was 28-of-42 for 296 yards with two touchdowns and had one
hard-luck interception.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's accuracy, particularly on third down where he helped
his club convert 10 of 15 times, let the Cowboys control the clock
in a game that wasn't as close as the final score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   In part because there were five players watching from the bench
at the end of the game due to injuries, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said he has more confidence in his club than he had in the
beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know (if you can win) until you experience it,''
Gailey said of the adversity the Cowboys faced. ``We experienced
it. And we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the next game, however, will be a mountainous challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders (toe), Emmitt Smith (ankle), Chris Warren (groin),
Everett McIver (knee), and Ernie Mills (stomach) left Sunday's game
with injuries and the status of all but McIver's is unknown for the
Thanksgiving Day game against the Minnesota Vikings. Gailey said
McIver is probably out for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota will be a big challenge for us,'' Cowboys strong
safety Darren Woodson said. ``But they have a short week, too, and
they will be just as sore as we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys know, however, that the pain would have felt worse
with a loss. Despite committing the season-high 15 penalties, the
Cowboys (8-3) maintained their two-game lead over Arizona in the
NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman led his team to 30 points or more for the fourth time in
five games that he has finished. With a Seahawks defense initially
geared to stop the Cowboys rushing attack, Aikman threw 28 times in
the first half. He was especially effective on third down,
completing 7-of-8 for 63 yards and six first downs. He spread the
ball around all day, hitting 10 different receivers from a
multitude of formations that consumed about 90 percent of the
gameplan.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys normally use about 50 percent of the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of different pass patterns go,'' Gailey said.
``We called more (routes) than we've called all year. Troy hits
guys that you wouldn't even tell some quarterbacks to even throw
at. He never stops amazing me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' running game finally got going and accounted for
173 yards. They dominated the Seahawks in total yards (465-249) and
time of possession (38:26 to 21:34). But when Seahawks lineman Sam
Adams tipped an Aikman pass to himself and raced in 25 yards for a
score, Seattle had a 14-13 lead late in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys quickly regained control. Aikman led the team to
a field goal right before the half ended. Then he directed
fourth-quarter touchdown drives of 86 and 71 yards to give the
Cowboys a 30-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were just as dominant on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders re-aggravated his big toe sprain with 5:40 to go in the
second quarter. But there would be no repeat of what happened in
Arizona last week. Cornerback Kevin Smith, and Sanders'
replacement, Charlie Williams, each allowed touchdown passes: Smith
a 44-yarder to Galloway in the second quarter, and Williams a
5-yarder to James McKnight to get the Seahawks to within 30-22 with
4:30 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith had two big plays of his own. He stopped one Seattle
drive deep in Cowboys territory with an interception of Moon in the
second quarter. Then, he ended the Seahawks' last-gasp drive by
knocking down a pass intended for Galloway with a little more than
two minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys kept them out of the end zone,'' Gailey said. ``It
was a fight against a very good football team. ''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, the Cowboys showed how good they have become.

DUCKS KEEP WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Everybody knows that Stu Grimson is capable of
delivering a knockout punch with his fists. But Sunday night the
big winger helped the Anaheim Mighty Ducks knockout the Chicago
Blackhawks with his fists _ and his offense.
</P>
<P>
   Grimson scored the game's first goal, provided a sizeable screen
on the second, and beat up Brad Brown in Anaheim's 4-1 victory
before 16,423 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``People joke about guys like Stu scoring, but Stu has pretty
good skills and can shoot the puck, said Ducks goalie Guy Hebert of
Grimson, who tied his career high in goals with his third of the
season at 2:27 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Grimson didn't get credit for an assist on a goal by Marty
McInnis, but he took advantage of some rare power play time when he
used his 6-foot-5, 239-pound frame to provide a screen that
prevented Chicago goalie Mark Fitzpatrick from seeing the shot that
gave Anaheim a 2-0 lead at 5:34.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen seconds later Grimon was challenged by Brown in the
first of three fights that the frustrated Blackhawks lost.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was roughed up again when he challenged Jim McKenzie later
in the second period and Jason Marshall sent Ethan Moreau to the
ice with one punch when the Chicago winger came headhunting in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I can shake things up with scrap or a goal everybody
gets pretty excited, said Grimson, who admittedly was stunned to
find himself wide open in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had time to turn and say `what's wrong with you guys,' joked
Grimson. ``I had all kinds of time. There is still no more
enjoyable way of contributing than scoring a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there is a lot wrong with a Chicago team that has been
outscored 53-20 in a 1-10-1 skid.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the Kings had hammered the Blackhawks on Saturday, the
Ducks didn't want to give Chicago (5-12-3) any reason for hope on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stealing this from (Anaheim coach) Craig (Hartsburg), but
let them get their confidence back against somebody else, said
Hebert, who lost his shutout bid at 17:37 of the third period when
Eric Daze scored a power play goal while Steve Rucchin was in the
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized to Guy, it was a bad penalty, said Rucchin, whose
third-period goal gives him a career high seven-game point scoring
streak.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hebert insisted that no apology was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shutouts don't float my boat, he said. ``They are nice, but
the bottom line is the team winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' victory was their third on the four-game homestand
and they have won five of six overall heading into a six-game road
trip that begins Wednesday in Detroit. The win also moved Anaheim
(8-7-4) ahead of Vancouver and St. Louis into fifth in the Western
Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play that great, but it's good to end the homestand
on a positive note, said Paul Kariya, whose two assists give him 26
points and a share of the NHL scoring lead with Peter Forsberg.
``It's a confidence builder and we just have to keep hammering
away.
</P>
<P>
   Although the win, in which the Ducks were outshot 27-23, may
have not been an artistic success, Hebert, a fisherman of some
note, said he wouldn't throw it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we could play a great game and not win or get a tie,
he said. ``Right now we are finding a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   And they are winning without Teemu Selanne and Tomas Sandstrom.
The Ducks are 4-2 since Selanne went down with a thigh injury and
5-2 since Sandstrom broke his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were also without Travis Green on Sunday due to a
strained knee, but newcomer McInnis continued his torrid pace. The
winger, who had an assist on Rucchin's goal, has 14 points in 13
games since being acquired from the Blackhawks, whose GM Bob Murray
has openly second guessed himself for letting McInnis go shortly
after he was acquired in a deal with Calgary.

Vaughn took a dramatic turn Sunday night, when Red Sox general
manager Dan Duquette met in Atlanta with free agent center fielder
Bernie Williams and his agent, Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are scheduled to continue Monday, when Jimy Williams will
join the discussions. The manager was a participant when Duquette
met with slugger Albert Belle in Los Angeles, but there were
indications last night that the reigning American League batting
champion is Boston's No. 1 choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're negotiating in good faith,'' said Boras, who has been
talking with Duquette for the past two weeks but refused to say
whether the Sox have made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is an interest between Boston and us, and
we've been talking about this for some time. We've had some pretty
extensive conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who won the batting title by 2 points (.339 to .337)
over Vaughn and won a Gold Glove, is still being courted by the
Yankees. Boras met last week with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
and said afterward that the 30-year-old switch hitter still had a
strong interest in returning to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also has met with officials of the Arizona
Diamondbacks, who denied reports that they had made him a
seven-year, $100 million offer. There were indications Sunday that
another team has entered the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance the Red Sox have of signing Williams would involve
reversing the historical trend, dating back to the sale of Babe
Ruth, of the Yankees outbidding or outmaneuvering the Sox for
premium players. To get the better of the Yankees, the Sox might be
placed in the position of making Williams the highest-paid position
player in the game. Last year, of course, the Red Sox made Pedro
Martinez the highest-paid pitcher with a precedent-setting
six-year, $75 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, like the Red Sox, also have pursued Belle, the
righthanded slugger who has until Dec. 2, under a unique contract
provision, to decide whether to return to the White Sox or go
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Red Sox had been believed to be Belle's only
suitors, but Belle's brother Terry, who acts as the player's
spokesman, hinted late Saturday night that another team might be
involved in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when Albert was a free agent the first time (winter
of '96) and everybody said, `Florida, Florida, Florida,' until the
White Sox jumped in?'' Terry Belle said, alluding to how the
Marlins were favored to sign Belle until White Sox owner Jerry
Reinsdorf outbid the field with a five-year, $55 million contract
that includes a $5 million buyout. ``You never know if there is
another surprise team.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle has said he hoped to have a deal done by
Thanksgiving. That's still his desire, his brother said, but he
won't be rushed. ``Albert is still weighing all his options,'' he
said. ``Something is going to happen in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert likes Boston. He's comfortable there, he likes hitting
there, he knows some of the guys on the team and respects them as
competitors. Boston has great tradition, and great fan support, if
you produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Belle would not say whether his brother has received
offers from any team to date. He has three years left on a White
Sox contract that pays him $10 million a year, $11 million a year
if you prorate his $5 million buyout over the life of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Belle has a history of antisocial behavior that has made him the
object of withering criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Belle was asked about the attacks on his brother, and if
he had any fears regarding how he would be received here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess everybody has to answer to their maker about saying
things about someone when they've never met him or made any attempt
to understand him,'' Terry Belle said. ``The only thing Albert is
worried about is playing ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can't accept that, that's out of his control.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams doesn't bring any of the baggage Belle has. But while
he has been one of the league's most productive hitters, he is not
in the class of Belle or Vaughn as a power threat. A two-time
All-Star who hit over .300 each of the last four seasons, Williams
last season hit 26 home runs and drove in 97 runs despite missing
31 games with a sprained right knee.

LOSS TO DALLAS DROPS SEAHAWKS DEEPER INTO SINK HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It was a new day, but the same old story for the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 30-22 loss to the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium was
frustratingly similar to other recent efforts that have seen the
Seahawks slip to 5-6 and all but out of the playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   When there were plays to be made, too often it was the Cowboys
who made them.
</P>
<P>
   That will be the Seahawks' epitaph when this season is
officially over. Realistically, it already is. There are five games
left, but even if this struggling team could somehow find a way to
win them all, the franchise's first postseason appearance since
1988 still would not be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 5-6 now,'' said head coach Dennis Erickson, ``so we are
at the end of our rope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty dim. It's real dim,'' defensive end Michael
Sinclair said when asked if this loss had snuffed the life from
this season. ``This baby is really running on only, what, one volt?
But we've still got a little left. We need a little CPR, but we've
still got a little left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks never gave up Sunday, but they never did enough to
do in the Cowboys either.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman picked apart a Seahawks secondary that was missing
cornerback Willie Williams and played parts of Sunday's game
without cornerbacks Shawn Springs and Fred Thomas. Aikman completed
28 of 42 passes to 10 different receivers for 296 yards. He threw
TD passes to Emmitt Smith and Billy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys controlled the ball for almost 38{ minutes as Smith
and former Seahawks running back Chris Warren combined to rush for
145 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Seahawk defense forced the Cowboys to settle for
Richie Cunningham field goals on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks, meanwhile, continued to sputter on offense. Warren
Moon hooked up with Joey Galloway on a 44-yard touchdown pass in
the second quarter and also found James McKnight with a short
scoring pass in the fourth quarter. But Moon completed only 15
passes, and the Seahawks converted just one of eight third-down
situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' other TD came when defensive end Sam Adams
deflected an Aikman pass high into the air, caught it and rambled
25 yards for defense's sixth score this season.
</P>
<P>
   More of the same produced, well, more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same thing,'' Sinclair said. ``Their players made
more plays than our players.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Cowboys are 8-3 and talking about rediscovering
the attitude that helped them win three Super Bowls in four years
(1992-95) as they head into their Thanksgiving Day matchup with the
10-1 Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting back to the mentality we had (during the Super
Bowl years),'' Aikman said. ``Chan (Gailey, the first-year head
coach) deserves a lot of credit. He's done a great job in
assembling a team with a lot of new faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Those new players played large roles Sunday. Warren. Nickel
safety George Teague. Center Mike Kiselak. Wide receivers Patrick
Jeffers, Ernie Mills and Jeff Ogden, who's from Eastern Washington
and Snohomish High School. Defensive end Greg Ellis, this year's
first-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Each made at least one big play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks also have acquired a lot of talent since Erickson
became the coach in 1995, arguably more than the Cowboys. That's
why this season has become so frustrating for them.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's loss was their sixth in the past eight games. It was
stuffed with plays that needed to be made, but weren't:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)On their first possession, Moon led the Seahawks to the
Cowboys' 26-yard line. But he fumbled on third down when sacked by
blitzing strong safety Darren Woodson and the ball was recovered by
Dallas' Kavika Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)On the ensuing series, the Seahawks got the Cowboys into a
third-and-13 situation, only to let them wriggle out of it when
Thomas gave up a 19-yard completion to Jeffers. Four plays later,
Aikman passed to Smith for a TD and a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)After Moon and Galloway hooked up on their TD, the defense
allowed Aikman to drive the Cowboys 65 yards in 12 plays to
Cunningham's second field goal.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The Seahawks came right back, moving from their own 26 to
the Cowboys 29. But Moon's second-down pass to Mike Pritchard was
intercepted by cornerback Kevin Smith at the Dallas 8.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Adams then made his huge play to give the Seahawks a 14-13
lead, but the Cowboys came right back, driving 59 yards to another
Cunningham field as time expired in the first half. The drive was
prolonged when a third-down incompletion was nullified by a holding
penalty on linebacker Chad Brown.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The Seahawks' first possession in the fourth quarter
included false-start penalties on center Chris Gray and guard Brian
Habib and a dropped pass by running back Ricky Watters on third
down.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The Cowboys then scored on Warren's 1-yard leap, but not
until the drive was given new life when a holding penalty on
defensive lineman Matt LaBounty erased a third-down incompletion by
Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The Seahawks had one last chance, but Moon's fourth-down
pass to Galloway was broken up by Smith at the Cowboys' 39-yard
line with 2:31 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Makeable plays that were not made. Mistakes that erased plays
that were made. Plays it seemed the Cowboys should not have been
able to make, but somehow did. They epitomized this game and, for
the Seahawks, the season.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were missing regulars in their defensive backfields
because of injuries, but the Cowboys made successful adjustments to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
   After Moon's long pass to Galloway, and Dallas lost All-Pro
cornerback Deion Sanders when he aggravated a sprained toe, the
Cowboys started playing softer zone coverages and rolling two
defenders to Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also hit Moon more than he has been hit all season,
despite rushing only four players and dropping seven into coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome left the Cowboys tied for the fourth-best record in
the NFC, and the Seahawks with knots in their stomachs as they
tried to explain another lost opportunity.

LAYOFFS, NOT PLAYOFFS AWAIT UNDERACHIEVING SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Shawn Springs couldn't have looked more
bewildered if Bill Clinton had come to the door to ask his mother
for a date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a situation like this,'' said the Seahawks'
second-year cornerback. ``To be honest with you, I don't know what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he can join the club _ the Home for New Year's
Fraternity, which has hosted the Seahawks and their fans for what
will now be a 10th season.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Arizona Cardinals have had more consecutive NFL years
of playoff-free membership.
</P>
<P>
   Even more puzzling than that streak is that the Seahawks, a
consensus playoff threat in pre-season speculation, are out of
postseason contention before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   With the caliber of talent on this team, the feat is drop-dead
astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   To screw up a season this badly, without flat-out quitting on
the job, is an epic achievement that is surpassed perhaps only by
the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose six of our last eight ... '' said linebacker Chad
Brown, who had the same Clinton-at-the-door look. He couldn't
finish the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's 30-22 loss at Texas Stadium to Some of America's
Team _ the banged-up Dallas Cowboys _ Brown, Springs and most of
the rest of this highly compensated 5-6 outfit face pointlessness
for fully one-third of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being all but mathematically eliminated from the
playoffs, they all know their coach, Dennis Erickson, and his staff
are through. Yet the likelihood is he won't be fired until after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   No well-regarded free-agent coach, such as George Seifert, is
going to step into this debris and risk staining his reputation.
Appointing a current staffer to replace Erickson temporarily is
equally futile, because none is head-coaching material, nor would
any of them be likely to make meaningful change.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are stuck. They are in irons. A DNF (did not
finish), as it's called in motor sports. Eased, as they say in
horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   The roster is nearly the best that money can buy, yet it cannot
purchase a third-down conversion. There is no lineup change, with
the possible exception of quarterback, that will provide spark.
There is no strategic shift that will dumbfound any decent
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even a worthwhile exercise to debate the plays chosen
by the increasingly erratic offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many things wrong with the offense,'' said guard
Pete Kendall, ``I'm not going to get into second-guessing the
play-calling.''
</P>
<P>
   The most stupefying aspect of the Seahawks is how they have not
gotten well in the increasingly parity-riddled NFL. Consider that
the Cowboys were 6-10 a year ago, and are now 8-3, albeit in a
balsa-wood division. The team that beat the Seahawks twice in the
previous three weeks, the Oakland Raiders, was 4-12 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both benefited from a coaching change last offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Erickson deserved this shot in his fourth and final
contract year, mostly because he was dealt a wretched hand by his
first boss, owner Ken Behring. Since then, however, he has been
dealt aces and faces by his new boss, Paul Allen, and folded
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telltale comparison is that 20 of the NFL's 30
teams made the playoffs in Erickson's first three years. Now, it's
possible that Atlanta, Oakland and another team may make it in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Only four other teams besides the Seahawks in these four years
are certain to be shut out of the postseason _ Cincinnati, St.
Louis, Cleveland/Baltimore and Houston/Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that the NFL, with its draft, reverse scheduling
and relatively restrictive player movement, goes way out of its way
to make sure no team stays bad for too long.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have found a way around that. They are the
anti-Borg _ resistance is easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should be 8-3,'' Springs said. ``I guess it shows
you never know what can happen in football.''
</P>
<P>
   From week to week, however, it's easy to know what will happen
to the Seahawks. Again Sunday, the defense played respectably
enough to win, but was left on the field so much by an inept
offense that it broke down too.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Seahawks did have a one-play touchdown drive of 44
yards from quarterback Warren Moon to receiver Joey Galloway, they
sustained only one other scoring drive, and that came in the fourth
quarter after the Cowboys built a 30-14 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the Seahawks had only 107 offensive yards on 20
plays. For the game, they never sustained a drive that flirted with
a field goal. Even one three-pointer might have made a strategic
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense wants to be a big-play offense, but the risk in
that is time of possession,'' said Brown, referring to the Cowboys'
almost two-to-one advantage on the clock. ``You're not going to win
many games with a time of possession like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the defense is out there a lot. After you show the
(opponent offense) what you've got, they can do some things.''
</P>
<P>
   So can the Seahawk offense. But never more than once at a time.
The vastly improved Cowboys have some serious weapons in Troy
Aikman, Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith, yet on their fabled Texas
Stadium turf, the Seahawks were driving to a shot at a tie inside
three minutes. But as happened so many times this season, they
squandered the chance, this time with three heavily defended
incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks weren't bad Sunday. Just not good enough. In a
league where just about every team gets good once in a while,
especially teams that spend money, the Seahawks continue their
astonishing defiance of the fates.

NO EXCUSES FOR PATRIOTS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No excuses Monday night. Please.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that the soon-to-be-packing football team has plenty
of excuses. Bob Kraft's Hartford Term Lifers can use the old
``distraction'' alibi if they get croaked by the Miami Dolphins.
It's certainly been a distracting couple of days for Kraft's
fourth-place Hartford Deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   But it's time to stop crying about distractions and injuries.
It's time to open a can of Whoop Ass and drive a pipe through the
Dolphins. That is the only response that'll satisfy the
long-faithful fans of the I-84-bound Hartford Policies.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly time to stop listing injuries. This is football.
People get hurt. A football team blaming losses on injuries is no
different from a boxer complaining about getting knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, folks, I could have won the fight. I have more boxing
talent than that palooka, but I hurt my head when he knocked me to
the canvas. I was injured and couldn't get back up to resume the
fight. That's why I lost. Cuz I was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the Hartford Annuities. They must be the only NFL team with
wounded players. As a result, they are 0-3 against the perfectly
healthy Dolphins, Jets, and Bills _ the teams ahead of them in the
AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Favorites to win the division, the Hartford Actuarial Tables
(thank you, Ron Borges) are 5-5 overall, and the schedule looks
rough. Hartford's football team faces the frightening reality of
going from the Super Bowl to out-of-the-playoffs in two short
years.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it's a good thing they swindled the Jets out of
all those draft picks. The extra depth was supposed to insulate
these Hartford Underwriters (thank you, Brian Mooney) from the woes
of the injured list, but where are Sedrick Shaw, Damon Denson,
Chris Canty, and Tebucky Jones now that the Hartford Beneficiaries
need them? It's certainly a good thing the team doesn't have that
Tuna bully _ who didn't know talent _ overseeing the draft anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Since Moneybags Kraft and Bobby Grier took control of the team
from the Tuna, there has been a reluctance to admit error. As
Borges told us eight days ago, the Packers have drafted 16 players
since Super Bowl XXX but kept only seven. The Hartford
Compulsories, on the other hand, have drafted 19 and still have 17.
Funny how Kraft and his people can be so right all the time.
</P>
<P>
   With each day that passes, the Hartford Adjusters act like they
are taking management direction from Red Sox general manager Dan
Duquette. The Duquette premise is: Everyone from the old regime is
expendable. However, unlike those who run the football team,
Duquette has been willing to cut his losses when he makes a mistake
(Wes Chamberlain, Dwayne Hosey, Kevin Mitchell, etc.). It also
should be mentioned that Bill Parcells _ the man who can't measure
talent to the satisfaction of Kraft and Grier _ has brought in 32
new players since taking over the Jets. And if we can believe the
standings, Parcells already has made the Jets better than the Super
Bowl team he left in the hands of the two Bobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Premiums moaned because they didn't have a fullback
to replace Tony Carter. Why, then, were they so casual about losing
Keith Byars and Sam Gash? Byars and Gash seemed to enjoy flattening
their old teammates earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Israel is hurt and Chris Canty is a bowser. So whose fault
is it that Jimmy Hitchcock was dumped last summer? In football,
more than any sport, you have to prepare for injuries to protect
your team from collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we have an owner blowing out of town, lining his
pockets with Connecticut state tax dollars, and still obsessed with
Mr. Tuna-fish. The petty ``tampering'' charge against Parcells
proves only that the Tuna is still punishing the Hartford Coverages
from 200 miles to the southwest. Remember that this free fall
started when Parcells's Jets tucked it to the 4-1 Team Formerly
Known As The Patriots on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's going to tell Kraft anything (except maybe to remind
him this might not be the best night to take the golf cart around
the stadium soliciting high-fives). He's become filthy rich and
he's got a coach he can order around. But isn't he beginning to
wonder about the dedication of some of his warriors?
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Liabilities became the hot sports team in New
England over the last few years, but now they are getting harsh
treatment. Prosperity begets expectation. No one likes a greedy
owner who says he cried when the Boston Braves left town, then
takes the football team halfway to New York. And no one likes a
bloated team that finds ways to lose to inferior opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Riders should cease talking about distractions and
injuries and stop imagining demons in Jet Green.
</P>
<P>
   And they should start by beating the Dolphins Monday night.

SOME ENCOUNTERS IN HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HARTFORD _ For a few days last week, I wasn't sure if I was
reading Boston-area newspaper articles or excerpts from a Chris
Rock standup routine. At noon last Thursday, the Patriots announced
they were moving here. At 12:01 last Thursday, the one-liners began
to flow furiously. The subject of the joke, the buildup of the
joke, and the punchline to the joke were all the same: Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was clowning this place last week, weren't they?
Hartford was characterized as a huge correctional facility.
Hartford was the bunion that you would pay to have removed from
your little toe. No sports pulse. No interesting places. No
interesting people. I was waiting for someone to link Hartford to
one of those ``Yo' mama'' jokes I used to hear as a kid. ``Hey, yo'
mama so busted-ugly that when she wake up in the morning she look
like downtown Hartford ...''
</P>
<P>
   I decided I didn't know enough about Hartford to make fun of it.
I am one of the people Gov. John G. Rowland talked about in his
Thursday press conference; one of the people who use this city as a
mile marker on their way to somewhere else. So on Friday evening I
left Boston for Hartford, anxious to see if it had a social rhythm
and a sports heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   In fewer than 24 hours, I watched a historic performance by guys
named Jacco and Haarhuis; had a very strange ESPN moment; missed
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy and Salem native Rick Brunson at the
State Armory; briefly offended a University of Tennessee football
fan; frantically searched for Trinity College's gymnasium; settled
a long dispute with Mark Twain; trespassed at Adriaen's Landing;
and received a salsa/-merengue/-bachata invitation from a DJ known
as Jesus The Juice.
</P>
<P>
   I do not have a T-shirt to commemorate my 19-hour
Hartford-a-thon. Just this story:

   As I drive into Hartford at 8 p.m., I begin thinking that this
place cannot possibly rank below some of the other sports venues
I've visited. I have seen Sacramento. I have seen Jacksonville. I
have seen Orchard Park, N.Y. I have seen East Rutherford, N.J. For
that matter, I have seen Foxborough. A city does not have to have
panache to have a pro sports team. It only needs access to
something that rhymes with panache. Cash. Rowland says Hartford
will come up with lots of cash for Patriots owner Bob Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Hartford plan also is to get fans walking through
this city, exposing them to restaurants and shops. This is good.
One of the first things you notice about the city is that you can
drive and walk for a while without seeing many people. Rowland, the
youngest governor in the country (he's 40), is trying to change
that. The Republican has altered the face of local politics with
his own face. During a lull in Rowland's press conference, an
impressed female reporter scribbled a note to me that read, ``The
Gov is a hottie.''
</P>
<P>
   There are not many lights on at night downtown. Your instincts
tell you to drive through here as quickly as possible. But I am
looking for a basketball game and am thinking strictly colleges.
Thanks to the eternal NBA negotiatons led by David Stern and Billy
Hunter, I am searching for the matchup between Trinity and Endicott
College. I am on Trinity's campus, a lovely college on a hill. One
of Boston's brightest young coaches, Boston University's Dennis
Wolff, began his head coaching career here. I ask a young man how I
can get to the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, man. I'm not from here,'' he says, repeating a
people-of-Hartford anthem. You can talk to many people in Boston
who tell you that they grew up around or went to school in
Hartford; you can talk to many people in Hartford who tell you that
they are not from here. Later I will find that seven NBA scouts and
Van Gundy were at the State Armory watching Brunson and the
Connecticut Pride beat the Quad City Thunder. I am a scrub. I
forgot about the CBA's Pride. But 2,871 others did not. And
Brunson, who played horribly when the Trail Blazers lost to the
Celtics at the FleetCenter last season, brought his game along. He
led everyone with 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   I have finally found Trinity's gym, which is very nice. The game
is over. Trinity won by 24 points. So now I am retreating, looking
for an alternative. On Sports Radio 1410: Central Connecticut is
taking it to Brown. I check into a downtown hotel. I visit the
hotel's sports bar. At first it is quiet. Someone puts on Steve
Miller-type music that would be a perfect soundtrack if anyone ever
decided to make a Caucasian sequel to ``Shaft.'' A big-screen
television shows Stanford and Southwest Missouri State. A small
screen shows Glenn Ordway's mug on Fox Sports New England. My
favorite picture of Bill Russell, blocking Wilt Chamberlain's shot
at Boston Garden, is on a wall. But so is a New York Giants
schedule. And in the corner, there is a reminder of the bitter
past: skates, gloves, and sticks from the Hartford Whalers, who,
like many people, can tell someone that they used to live in
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   It is a slow sports night. It is near midnight. The perception
is that the Patriots won't have to worry about nightlife once they
get here. Perception is not accurate. There are many places in the
Union Square area to have fun and eventually find trouble. I choose
a club at the corner of Asylum and Trumbull streets. It is called
the Bar With No Name. I could have gone to Velvet, at the corner of
Allyn and Union Place. The man to see there, according to a flier,
is DJ Maa Bell, who ``kicks your ass with earth-shattering, nonstop
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I am having my backside moved by salsa and merengue.
Dancing to merengue is all footwork and hips, not too much shoulder
movement. It takes coordination. So I sit and watch. Jesus The
Juice isn't turning the turntables, but I wish he were (his gig is
on Sundays). The current DJ has a lot of Rob Deer in him: The hits
will be home runs, everything else will be a .205 batting average
with a ton of strikeouts. But the hits are intriguing, and so are
the people. Two guys in sweater vests are clearly the best dancers
in the house. And a woman wearing an outrageously short velour
miniskirt and knee-length boots is getting the most attention. The
lights come on at 2 a.m. As I walk back to the hotel, I see a
banner hanging from the Civic Center for the ATP World Doubles
Championships. Tennis? Me? Sure.
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful Saturday morning. There are signs everywhere
for the Mark Twain house. Twain, a fine writer, lived here for 17
years in the late 1800s. I thought of visiting his home. But I
hated some of his characters in Huck Finn, a book that was forced
on me in high school. I finally have settled my Twain dispute. I
will ignore him. I will not go to his home.
</P>
<P>
   I will go to Adriaen's Landing, the site of Kraft's 68,000-seat
stadium. If you plan to visit here, bring your imagination. Right
now the $1 billion development is mud, industrial buildings,
parking lots, barbed-wire fences, construction vehicles, and
portable restrooms. One of Kraft's early concerns here will have to
be providing ample tailgating space. One of Drew Bledsoe's concerns
should be how the wind off the Connecticut River will affect his
passes in late November and early December.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for tennis. Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis, the top
doubles team in the world, will be playing their last weekend
together. Eltingh will retire soon. I buy a $27, seventh-row
ticket. Just after buying it, I overhear two men talking about
sports. I follow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, fellas. Are you sports fans?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not of no tennis,'' one of them says, eyeing my ticket and
thinking I want to scalp it.
</P>
<P>
   I ask what they think of the Patriots moving to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Giants fan,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   I look at his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Steelers fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I ask, what do you think of the comments that Hartford is
a joke?
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be all right when the Patriots get here,'' one says,
moving away from the weird guy with the pen who is asking too many
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis. I'm psyched. I take my seat and watch Eltingh and
Haarhuis easily defeat Don Johnson and Francisco Montana. Before
the second semifinal starts, I look up at the overhead screen and
see myself on ESPN. I don't know what to do. I look away and then
look back up. Still there. What am I supposed to do, wave?
</P>
<P>
   I am beginning to realize that Hartford is a decent city. It is
not and never will be Boston. Or Manhattan, Chicago, D.C., or Los
Angeles. It is OK. Not many cities of its size (about 130,000) have
its potential. And the sports fan is right: It will be much better
than what it is if lawmakers approve the Rowland-Kraft stadium
plan. I head to Coach's Sports Bar and see Tennessee playing
Kentucky. I begin to root for Kentucky because, as an Ohio State
fan, I am deluded enough to believe that the Buckeyes still have a
national-title shot if Tennessee, Kansas State, and UCLA all lose.
All of them are winning on this day.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky scores to take a 7-6 lead and I say, ``Yes, baby.'' The
man next to me asks if I am rooting for the Wildcats. I nod and he
tells me that he is a Volunteers fan and he has money on this game.
After about 10 minutes of conversation, he also mentions that he
has had a gun since he was 4. I decide it's a good time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   On my way back to Boston, I remember that I still can catch the
Siena-University of Hartford men's basketball game. I like
basketball. And I like Hartford. But not that much.

HUSKY BOWLING PARTNER REMAINS MATTER OF INTRIGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Washington's invitation to play a bowl game in Hawaii
on Christmas Day likely will come late Monday or Tuesday. And it
figures to be harder for the Huskies to preserve a winning season
than it was in Saturday's 16-9 Apple Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to think maybe we created this game for
Washington,'' said Marcia Klompus, executive director of the Aloha
and the new Oahu Bowl. ``This will be their fourth appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a selection-committee meeting and some routine calls to the
Pac-10 and a couple of other bowls keeps Klompus from formally
extending the Huskies an invitation to play at the same site they
appeared a year ago and in 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent is still a large question mark, however, and the
Huskies need a postseason victory to avoid finishing 6-6 and going
without a winning season for the first time since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Bowl Games of Hawaii got an acceptance from Air
Force, a 10-1 team that will play in the WAC championship game Dec.
5. The Falcons, 14th-ranked in the USA Today/ESPN poll, are a
possible opponent for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This is the picture for the Huskies with many variables
remaining on the other two participants in Hawaii:
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 is contractually committed to two slots in Hawaii
(the teams wouldn't play each other). But if UCLA should proceed to
the Fiesta Bowl and Arizona is invited to the Rose Bowl after a
possible victory Friday over Arizona State, ASU would be short the
required six wins and the Hawaii bowls would need to fill two more
slots to go with UW and Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates that would make Klompus happy are Colorado (7-3) of
the Big 12 and Miami (7-2) or Syracuse (7-3). Colorado must play at
Nebraska on Friday and Miami is at Syracuse on Saturday for the Big
East title.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted us to sign before the Nebraska game,'' said a
Colorado spokesman, referring to the Hawaii bowls, ``but if we beat
them, there's also the possibility of the Holiday Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaii organizers would be ecstatic with an Arizona State
victory over Arizona. Not only would it make ASU (5-5)
bowl-eligible, it might drop Arizona out of the Rose Bowl, and thus
free up either Oregon or USC to play in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona wins, Klompus says, no Hawaii matchups will be
announced until after several major games Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's BCS lead over Kansas State is expected to shrink further
Monday, and speculation is that K-State may eventually overtake the
Bruins if all three unbeatens, including Tennessee, win out. The
Bruins, who visit Miami on Dec. 5, thus need a Miami victory this
week at Syracuse, and perhaps a USC win over Notre Dame, to aid
UCLA's strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited just to go to Hawaii, first off,'' said Washington
running back Braxton Cleman. ``A bowl game in Hawaii, what more can
you ask for?''
</P>
<P>
   Washington hosts Air Force and Colorado on consecutive weeks
next September, and Miami was on the 1998 UW schedule until the
Huskies replaced it with Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   If Colorado makes it along with Air Force, it would be unlikely
for the two to be matched against each other, so Washington might
draw one or the other. The option-based Falcons could be a nasty
matchup for a team that has had trouble with that offense in recent
years, although there would be plenty of time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force is a well-balanced team that leads the WAC in both
scoring offense (36.6) and scoring defense (13.4). The Falcons' 10
wins is the most ever for a team going to a Hawaii bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which had a talent-laden team that beat the Huskies in
the 1996 Holiday Bowl, has had a fitful offensive season behind
quarterback Mike Moschetti and a depleted offensive line. Overall,
26 different players have received their first start this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to look at the styles,'' Klompus said. ``We're
looking to keep people in the stadium for seven hours.''

GREAT MATCH? TAKE IT TO THE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a bank job.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clydes could rob banks, so could the Bonnies, and these
two menacing molls _ called Martina and Lindsay _ heisted $750,000
of Chase Manhattan's small change Sunday by raiding the Madison
Square Garden branch in full view of 13,792 bug-eyed witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Tommy guns, they fired away intimidatingly with
elongated skillets (a.k.a. tennis rackets), bringing forth constant
``oohs'' and ``aahs'' and heartfelt wails of appreciation and
encouragement for the best pair of safe-crackers in their business.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was a beautiful afternoon for a walk in Manhattan, No.
2 Martina Hingis, the Chase Championship victor, 7-5, 6-4, 4-6,
6-2, and Lindsay Davenport _ consoled that even defeat couldn't
dislodge her from No. 1 _ chose to run their heads off in a
hothouse for nearly 2 1/2 hours. That's because, as all-time
financial house breaker Willie Sutton used to say, ``It's where the
money was.''
</P>
<P>
   As cow bells clangled and white-crossed scarlet flags of her
adopted homeland sprouted throughout the Garden, one wondered if
the Hingis-favoring crowd was composed of Swiss bank account
holders. Or did this gifted child inspire sympathy, seeming one of
the Zurich gnomes in the presence of the 6-foot-3-inch Davenport?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but nobody feels sorry for the quick and confident Hingis,
who has more racket savvy than any Mafia don, and may become the
most accomplished shotmaker to grace a court.
</P>
<P>
   And almost everybody outside of Switzerland is glad for
Davenport, who has outgrown the typical too-big awkwardness and
shyness to show that she has heart and will to go with the muscle
in becoming a deserving No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport made that clear in September at the US Open by
brushing aside Venus Williams and Hingis (the 1997 finalists) to
lift the title from Martina, and followed up by deposing the kid
from the prime ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing for pride,'' Hingis kept saying during the Chase,
the season-closing playoffs among the top 16 players on the Women's
Tennis Association tour.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was saying that although she'd crashed all the way down
to No. 2 she could salvage face by hitting Chase for more cash than
Davenport _ a half million to a quarter _ by winning. So she did,
displaying a fuller package that included groundies almost as
thundering as the American's, plus volleys, drop shots, lobs, and
well-deposited serves. As a tactician, Hingis, if but 18, remains
at the pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina does everything, and is only getting better,''
complimented Mother Freedom of the women's game, Billie Jean King.
``But don't think it'll be easy for her to get No. 1 back from
Lindsay. Nobody thought Lindsay believed in herself. But I did.''
</P>
<P>
   As US Olympic coach two years ago in Atlanta, King lit a
confidence flame in gold medalist Davenport that has been fanned by
her permanent coach, Robert Van't Hof, as she streamlined her frame
and stepped up her footwork. ``Lindsay has such good hands, and her
serve will become a killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Never since the 1973 introduction of Medusa, the WTA rankings
computer that takes a hard-eyed look at results, had the race for
No. 1 come down to the last few days of the season. It will, too,
for the men _ Pete Sampras or Marcelo Rios? _ in this week's ATP
Championships at Hannover. Whatever happens there, it's doubtful
that the men, having lost finesse and control to unwisely
overpowered rackets, will put on as absorbing a show. They're the
second-fiddling sex in tennis these days.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis could have made enough points to regain the summit had
she beaten No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the semis on her way to
the title. However, Sanchez Vicario wasn't there, jolted earlier by
Irina Spirlea, and Martina's win over the lesser Romanian didn't
help her cause mathematically.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, then, Davenport was merely 288 computer points ahead,
although Hingis led, 3-2, head-to-head, won more money ($3,163,131
to $ 2,597,788), and posted a higher winning percentage (.837 to
.821).
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could have been more fitting than for Billie Jean,
celebrating her 55th birthday, to present the prizes, notably the
newly crafted King Trophy, an eternal reward for the champion of
this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy for both players,'' she gleamed. ``Martina leads
the wonderful crop of kids on the tour, and Lindsay shows a
resurgence of Americans.'' She's the first from California,
historically the vineyard of champs, to stand as No. 1 since King
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, King cooked His Piggishness, Bobby Riggs,
to make the game's biggest splash. ``Gosh, I'm the same age now
that Bobby was then. But I wouldn't want to play Steffi Graf, who's
my age then. Today's players,'' King said generously, ``are way
ahead of our generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also in 1973 that Chris Evert won this tournament. She
ran off with $25,000. A piggy bank job.

BRAWL WAS ALL THE RAGE TO BRUINS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe says he didn't
want to get involved in Saturday's brawl with the Washington
Capitals, but Dale Hunter forced his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Don Sweeney, whose one-on-one duel with Craig Berube
ignited the first-period fireworks, says he could see trouble
brewing early on.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe and Sweeney, along with teammates Ken Belanger, Ken
Baumgartner, Grant Led-yard, and Peter Ferraro, all received game
misconducts from referee Mark Faucette for their involvement in the
incident, which resulted in 233 minutes of penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Faucette doled out 124 of those minutes to the Capitals and
slapped game misconducts on Hunter, Berube, Mark Tinordi, Dmitri
Mironov, Ken Klee, and goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   So, with one toot of his whistle, Faucette wiped out 30 percent
of each team's roster, including starting goalies Dafoe and Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, though, had the last laugh on the Capitals, for this
night, at least, winning in overtime, 5-4, on Jason Allison's
second goal of the game with just 30.2 seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the Ristuccia Center, the Bruins' Gang of Six, along
with Shawn Bates, Kyle McLaren, and Dave Ellett, worked out briefly
under the eye of assistant coach Bobby Francis. After, Dafoe and
Sweeney talked about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed out of it as long as I could,'' said Dafoe, who at
the time enjoyed a 2-0 lead and looked sharp. ``But when you get an
odd-man situation and when it escalates to the point that it had,
you just have to jump in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that Hunter got away from the referee and
came back into the pile. Belanger was being held by the referee, so
we were outmanned. It was two-on-one against Sweeney, so that's why
I jumped in on Hunter. Obviously, then Olaf is obligated to come
join the circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said he understood the action Faucette took, but really
didn't think he, or Kolzig, should have received game misconducts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't throw any punches, so it really surprised me,'' said
Dafoe. ``The referee obviously had had enough and just said
everyone on the ice was out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a game where there's been 12 game
misconducts. I think it was not so much all the fighting that was
going on, it was more that everyone was getting mismatched.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe believes the bad blood spills over from last year, when
the Capitals eliminated the Bruins in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, we knew coming into the game that that's the way
they are. We learned that during the playoffs. We were up, 2-0, and
they wanted to send a statement to us, I guess, and thankfully we
had a couple of our big guys out there to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said he saw the handwriting on the wall early, and that
if that was the way the Capitals wanted to play, the Bruins would
oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter takes a bit of a run at Raymond (Bourque) early and you
realize that may be the way they're going to play so you have to be
prepared for everything,'' he said. ``We were going to try to win
at all costs, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all stuck together. This hockey club is a close-knit bunch
of guys and we're going to continue to stick together. Winning and
losing you do as a team and 20 guys contribute each and every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Dafoe added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to beat up a Dale Hunter, let's not kid
ourselves, but at the same time I'm not going to let Dale Hunter
two-on-one any of our players. The jersey really means something in
a situation like that. It doesn't matter who it is on the team.
He's a part of the team and you protect. That's why you're called a
team.''

A CLASSIC WIN FOR BC WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Entering Sunday's fourth annual Reebok Classic, the
coaches of Boston College and Michigan State believed their teams
were surprisingly well matched. Right they were: First, the
visitors needed a 3-pointer with two seconds left in regulation to
tie the game at 64; then, the hosts required almost every second of
overtime to eke out an 80-74 win before 6,834 fans at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing here for four years, and this is probably
the best win here,'' said senior forward Paula Bacso after the dust
had settled. ``It shows we have character and we're not going to
let down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, winning their Classic game for the second straight
year, improved to 3-0, while MSU fell to 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Bacso and center Whitney Steele, confined to the bench for much
of the game after getting into early foul trouble, controlled the
overtime session. With the score tied at 66 after the teams traded
jumpers, Bacso fed Steele for a layup to put the Eagles ahead,
68-66. When the Spartans tied the game again at 70, Bacso found
Steele to go up, 72-70. After chipping in with a jumper of her own
to put the Eagles ahead, 74-70, Bacso helped answer a Spartan
basket with yet another handoff to, you guessed it, Steele. Score:
76-72.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of clutch free throws apiece by junior forward Alissa
Murphy and freshman point guard Brianne Stepherson in the last 19
seconds put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the games we need,'' said BC coach Cathy Inglese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let these games slip away. If we did, we'd be looking
back at the end of the season saying, `OK, that's 18 or 19 wins, if
we'd have stolen one or two more ...''' Inglese's teams the last
two seasons have fallen just two (18-10) or three (17-11) games shy
of the magical 20 wins likely to get a team into the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't looking promising for the Eagles midway through
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 8, 25-17, Steele picked up her third foul; meanwhile
the Spartan frontcourt of Kristen Rasmussen and Becky Cummings, who
scored 10 of her 12 total points in the first half, was dominating.
That's when Inglese made what was perhaps the key decision of the
game: going to man-to-man defense to change the tempo. ``We weren't
scoring,'' said Inglese. ``We were just struggling in the
halfcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. BC went on a 14-0 run that held the Spartans
scoreless for more than 5 1/2 minutes. With 3:36 left in the half
the Eagles went ahead, 26-25, on a layup by Murphy, and took a
33-29 lead into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But Rasmussen and Co. weren't finished.
</P>
<P>
   With 9:57 left in the game, Christie Pung hit a 3-pointer to
bring the Spartans within 46-42; Rasmussen connected on yet another
layup to come within 2, and Nikki Davis hit a jumper for her only
basket of the day to tie it at 46 with 8:55 left.
</P>
<P>
   After that, BC twice would go up by as many as 5 but couldn't
put the game away, and a 3-point bomb by Maxann Reese _ who
connected on only 2 of 14 long-distance attempts on the day _ put
the game into the overtime Bacso and Steele would dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen would lead all scorers with 22 points, while Murphy's
19 and Bacso's 18 tied their career highs. Cal Bouchard, who missed
Thursday's game against Holy Cross with a concussion, added 14,
while freshman forward Becky Gottstein led the Eagles with nine
rebounds. Steele finished with 8 points, but 6 were in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In the early game, No. 20 Florida pulled a mild upset over No.
13 George Washington when it turned a 44-32 halftime lead into an
82-59 rout.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators were led by Tonya Washington's 19 points and 20 _
count 'em, 20 _ rebounds.

INJURY MAKES CULLORS BACKTRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ One day about a month ago in the Patriots'
locker room, Derrick Cullors's back hurt so badly he couldn't reach
down to put some of his clothing in a duffle bag.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he was on the field returning kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the rash of injuries that has appeared on New England's
injury report, Cullors kept practicing and playing when he had no
business being on the field. His kick return average, which at one
point led the NFL, began a free fall over the last seven games. His
production as a third-down back also suffered, going from nine
receptions in his first four games to one, for 5 yards, in the next
six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really remember what happened, but as time went on it
got worse and worse and when I did a lot of hitting it got sorer
and sorer,'' said Cullors. ``At one point I couldn't even bend
over. I couldn't run full speed. When you're playing, you feel like
you have to give it your all, but when you're out there, your all
isn't full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembered not making a certain cut, ``because that
particular cut might hurt you too bad. Your body is not allowing
you to make that cut full speed. I'm not gonna use that for an
excuse (on returns). It's always been one block here or there or
one misread. I haven't lost confidence in myself and I still
believe I'm a good return guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game against Miami amid the hoopla about the team
moving is crucial for the Patriots, whose big-play players must
start doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terry Glenn (hamstring) is listed as questionable
but is expected to give it a go, which should help spread out the
defense and give quarterback Drew Bledsoe one more weapon to go to.
</P>
<P>
   All great teams, however, have big-play guys on special teams.
This season Cullors was tabbed as the player who would take over
some of the departed Dave Meggett's duties, as a kick returner and
third-down back. Over the first three games he was doing that well,
and now that he considers himself healthy again, he hopes it
happens again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' said Cullors, who had been one of the team's
best cover men on special teams before his back problem. ``It's
better than I've been feeling for a while. I feel a little sore
once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullors, who was forced to replace Curtis Martin last season
when he sustained an abdominal injury, believes that part of the
reason for his reduced production lately may be the attention he's
getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to guys on other teams,'' Cullors said. ``Sam Gash
was telling me how the Bills felt about me. I remember the Jets'
special teams coach talking to me. A lot of teams out there respect
my return abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just nowhere close to satisfied. I feel like we're a much
better kickoff return team than what we've shown. We've got to put
these mistakes behind us. No holding. We've had eight holding
penalties this year, and that's hurting our average as a team on
kickoffs. But it's also Chris Canty and myself needing to make
better reads on our runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullors also wants to get more involved in the offense,
especially since he seemed to be a spark in the first few games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can make things happen,'' he said. ``Me and Robert
(Edwards) have a different running style. A team gets used to his
north-south running, and my style is a little quicker than what
Robert has. We could loosen up the defense. I can get it into
another hole and mix it up a little bit. I've been patient. I want
to do it within the system. If that comes around, I would be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's never felt pressure to replace Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had the ability to make guys around me play
better,'' he said. ``I want to make something happen to hype the
team up. Meggett was a great kickoff return man. He had his style
and I have mine. He always tried to keep me upbeat. He told me to
be patient and my time would come. If I drew any comparisons, it
would be to Curtis a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm my own guy. I never felt I had to replace anyone. Even
when Curtis went down last year, I felt I had to go in and do as
good as Curtis. I got to the league by doing what I did on my own.
I think I'm a good running back and my style is my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullors said the running backs did a lot of soul-searching this
week. Edwards has averaged only 40 yards per game in the last four,
while his average per carry has dropped from almost 4.4 yards to
2.4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've critiqued ourselves and critiqued the defenses we're
playing against,'' said Cullors. ``We've talked about our strengths
and weaknesses and we've put it all out on the table. We want to go
with our strengths.''

BAD MEMORIES: JEFFERSON DROPS THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Yes, NFL players are paid good money, paid
good money to make good plays. Yet, for most of these players, no
amount of money can repay the pain of not making the play.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-week, Shawn Jefferson was back to being himself.
Jefferson was talking as he always talks, words pouring forth a
sentence a second, smiling as he usually smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to do, and the only thing you can, is to
forget,'' said the Patriots wide receiver. ``You've got to forget
by the next day. Good game or bad game, you have to learn to forget
what you did on Sunday by Monday. Or else ... you're done in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, of course, Jefferson was not smiling. To his credit,
though, he was talking in that locker room in Buffalo, still
delivering a sentence a second, but all his words came down
mercilessly on his own head.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is paid good money to catch passes. In Buffalo,
though, at the most crucial point of the game for his team, on a
fourth down in the final two minutes to keep alive a game-winning
or tying drive, Jefferson dropped a pass at the right sideline. The
ball was delivered by Drew Bledsoe right into his hands for what
appeared to be a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never accept losing,'' Jefferson said. When the team
loses, he went on, your food tastes bad, your wife looks bad, ``and
when you look around your house, all you can imagine is termites
eating away the inside of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is talking about the generic loss there. But last
Sunday's loss was so much more personal because New England's
season was unraveling and it was Jefferson who did not catch the
pass that might have righted the ship a bit. And, as always with
these players, the mistake was so public, seen by hundreds of
thousands of eyes, if not millions. Accountants and bricklayers
make mistakes, too, but only a handful ever know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad game,'' said Jefferson. ``That's what it was ... a
bad game.''
</P>
<P>
   All players have a bad game. That is not the issue; rather, it
is how players handle it, what their reaction is, how they come
back. That is the fascination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you writing your stories,'' said Jefferson. ``You
may write the best story ever written, and what do people do with
it? They just crumble up your paper and throw it in the
wastebasket. That's where your great story goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's how you have to approach it _ you can be great one
day or you can be terrible, but the next day is brand new. That's
the only way to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few lockers away from him, Tony Simmons was smiling and
telling the media about his rookie year. Simmons is coming on,
making more and more big catches, but he is still a rookie. There
will be other days, other kinds of days. Simmons will learn.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson looked over at Simmons and said he, too, was like that
his rookie year. He would have a big game and he wouldn't put the
glory out of his mind by Tuesday or Wednesday. He would have a bad
game and he wouldn't be able to let go of the blame for days, maybe
not until the kickoff of the game the following Sunday. ``But I
learned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Jefferson said he is no different from other athletes, going
over a game, thinking about what he did or didn't do in the waning
hours of most Sundays. ``But, by the next day,'' he said, ``it's
got to be gone. I can catch three touchdown passes and it's gone.
You got to do it. Or I can have a bad game ... and it's got to be
gone from your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the first one to miss a ball and I won't be the last
one,'' said Jefferson. ``Just as I'm not the first one to catch a
TD pass and I won't be the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ``You have to forget about it. You keep
bringing that stuff back to your mind, then you might as well leave
the game, because you'll be no good. It's a brand-new week on
Mondays. I don't even know what happened last week _ what happened
last week, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   And no excuses, ever. Compared to the bent and broken bodies of
these Patriots, George Washington's patriots might as well have
been on a cruise to Aruba than headed to Valley Forge. And
Jefferson has played on, despite very sore ribs, ribs he injured a
month ago in Miami. But that's no excuse, just as the fact a
Buffalo defender hit Jefferson an instant after that fourth-down
pass reached his hands. No excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose, you just have to go on,'' he said. ``Say you have
a big game and then you carry that around with you the next week,
you know what happens next? You're lackadaisical in the next game,
you think you just have to show up. And then somebody will kick
your butt. All you can do is forget it quick, win or lose, good or
bad.''

SCHEDULE A PROBLEM FOR KANSAS ST. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Everyone took their best shot and everyone failed.
The top three teams in college football _ according to the polls,
at least _ were Tennessee, Kansas State, and UCLA entering
Saturday's Rivalry Weekend games.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky thought it had a chance against the Vols, Missouri
thought it had a shot against the Wildcats, and USC thought it
could edge the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   None of it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   All three undefeated teams won. The polls did not change, which
means that the Bowl Championship Series rankings don't figure to
change either.
</P>
<P>
   That is scary news for K-State, which is No. 1 in the coaches'
poll, No. 2 in the writers' poll, but No. 3 in the BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? That the Wildcats could beat Texas A&AMP;M in
the Big 12 championship game Dec. 5 and still be shut out of the
``national championship'' game in the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4 if UCLA
beats Miami in its makeup game Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line seems clear. Kansas State, which has struggled
the last two weeks but still won against Nebraska and Missouri, is
being penalized for playing a weak nonconference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wildcats had played anyone on their nonconference
schedule, they would be a strong No. 2 in the BCS rankings and it
would be UCLA that would be wondering what to do.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee, Kansas State, and UCLA all win out, the Vols are a
lock for one spot, and the battle between Kansas State and UCLA
could come down to the records of their opponents' opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is clear if a team wants to win a national title
under this system. Go out and play someone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bowl matchups are set, or being set. Outside of the
Fiesta Bowl no one is more nervous than the Gator Bowl people. If
Notre Dame loses to USC this Saturday, the Irish will go to
Jacksonville to play ACC co-champion Georgia Tech. If the Irish
beat USC, the Gator probably will put Georgia Tech vs. the
Syracuse-Miami loser ... There is an outside possibility the Rose
Bowl could have a Wisconsin-Ohio State game. Here's how: UCLA would
take a spot in the Fiesta Bowl. Arizona would lose to Arizona
State, making it easier for the Rose Bowl to pass on taking a
Pac-10 team and a West Coast representative for the first time in
its history, and Notre Dame would lose to USC, knocking them out of
the BCS bowls. Under that scenario, Ohio State would become the
most attractive available team, setting up a ``Big 10 championship
game'' between the co-champs who did not meet in the regular season
... What's with West Virginia coach  &UR; Don Nehlen  &LR; ripping reporters
for making a big deal of the  &UR; Amos Zereoue &LR; - &UR; Mike Cloud  &LR; verbal
joust last week? Reporters didn't force Zereoue to say that Cloud
wasn't the best running back in the Big East. Reporters also didn't
call Cloud ``McCloud'', as Nehlen did during his weekly Big East
coaches' call Monday. So the media wasn't stirring things up. They
were asking questions because someone said something. That's their
job. They are not paid to pat Zereoue on the shoulder when he says
something non-vanilla and say, ``Now are you sure you want to say
that?''

   Auburn should come to a decision about a replacement for  &UR; Terry
Bowden  &LR; in the next few days. The Clemson job is open already, as
is Oklahoma's with the firing of  &UR; John Blake yesterday &LR; , and South
Carolina, and Iowa could have vacancies soon. Tulane coach  &UR; Tommy
Bowden  &LR; reportedly is the front-runner at Clemson, which could make
Clemson-Florida State games even more interesting when you add in
the father-son coaching factor ... Former Notre Dame coach  &UR; Lou
Holtz  &LR; is letting his name be thrown around for potential openings.
South Carolina or Oklahoma might be possibilities. Iowa coach
 &UR; Hayden Fry  &LR; says he will make some sort of announcement in a few
days. ``I know what I want to do in my own mind,'' said Fry, who
watched the Hawkeyes get pounded by Minnesota, 49-7, Saturday. That
closed out a 3-8 season, Fry's worst at Iowa ... Auburn's loss to
Alabama probably eliminated interim coach  &UR; Bill Oliver  &LR; from the
mix. Had Auburn won, Oliver almost certainly would have gotten the
job.

   No one has played more exciting games than the Pac-10. The
latest example was Oregon State's 44-41 double overtime win over
Oregon Saturday. In the first overtime, it appeared Oregon had come
up short on a fourth-down play, which would have given Oregon State
a 38-31 win. The long-suffering OSU fans stormed the field, but did
not see a flag had been thrown on the play, signifying a penalty
against the Beavers. After the field was cleared and the players,
some of whom had headed to the locker room, were brought back, the
game was resumed. Oregon scored to tie the game and force a second
OT.

   If Tennessee beats Vanderbilt this week, the Vols will have
their first undefeated regular season since 1956 ... If Central
Florida doesn't make a bowl game, quarterback  &UR; Daunte Culpepper
 &LR; finished his collegiate career on a high note Saturday, completing
23 of 32 passes in a 38-6 win over New Mexico. That gave him a
major college record for completion percentage in a season, .736
... The crowd was so small at Temple's game against Syracuse at
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia that an Owl defensive player
shifted his position when he heard a coach yell instructions from
the press box ... Notre Dame's chances of beating USC and getting a
BCS bid declined considerably when quarterback  &UR; Jarious Jackson
 &LR; went down with a partially torn medial collateral ligament in his
right knee while taking a safety during the final seconds of a
39-36 win over LSU. Freshman  &UR; Arnaz Battle  &LR; or sophomore  &UR; Eric
Chappell &LR;  will call the signals against the Trojans ... Washington
junior quarterback  &UR; Brock Huard  &LR; said he'll skip his final season
of eligibility to enter the NFL draft. Huard, 22, made the
announcement after Saturday's 16-9 win over intrastate rival
Washington State.

UMASS TO FACE MCNEESE 
</HEADLINE>
 DIVISION 1AA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Mark Whipple stood before his University of
Massachusetts football team Sunday moments after the Minutemen were
selected to play McNeese State in the first round of the Division
1-AA playoffs. With excited players hanging on his every word, the
first-year coach brought up the subject of losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we lost to Delaware in the season opener and won our
next four games,'' said Whipple. ``Then we lost to Connecticut and
won four. We just lost to UConn (Saturday), and if we win four this
time we win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Positive thinking has returned to UMass football. The team that
was left stunned and saddened after Saturday's 28-27 defeat was in
jubilation Sunday when it found out it was seeded 11th in the
national tournament and would meet sixth-seeded McNeese State of
the Southland Conference in the first round Saturday at 8 p.m., in
Lake Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   For the Minutemen (8-3), it marks the first trip to the 16-team
playoff since 1990, when they were routed by William &AMP; Mary, 38-0.
</P>
<P>
   UMass was one of three Atlantic 10 teams that advanced. UConn,
which finished the season with a school-record nine wins, will host
Mid-Eastern Athletic member Hampton in the first round at Storrs,
Conn. A-10 champion Richmond (9-2), guided by former UMass coach
and Boston College assistant Jim Reid, will host Patriot League
champion Lehigh in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in four seasons, none of the perennial
conference powers Delaware, William &AMP; Mary, or Villanova made the
tournament. UConn reached the tourney for the first time, and
Richmond did so for the first time since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just gives credibility to the statement that
there's parity in this league,'' said Reid, who coached the 1990
UMass team. ``All we know about Lehigh is that they're 11-0 and
that means you're a great team regardless of what league you're
in.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass lost out on its bid to host its first playoff game as a
Division 1-AA school with Saturday's defeat. Whipple said that is
his only regret. The coach who guided New Haven to the 1992
Division 2 championship game sat in the back of the room flashing a
smile while his players roared with elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you kept thinking about UConn, you felt awful,'' he
said. ``As soon as they knew (who they would play) they were
focused, envirgorated, ready to go, and that's the way I think
we'll be all week.''
</P>
<P>
   That is good, for the task won't be easy. McNeese State lost in
last season's championship game and was the preseason pick to win
it all this year. The Cowboys feature one of the best defenses in
Division 1-AA, allowing just 82.4 rushing yards and 144.7 passing
yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having one of the best offenses in 1-AA (482.7
yards a game) and a defense that allowed just one touchdown against
UConn, Whipple said he is relying on the fact that UMass has played
its best coming off defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been our pattern,'' said Whipple. ``We just stay with
our pattern we'll be all right. But the biggest thing is that we've
learned a lot as the year has gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the UMass players say they could not have imagined going
to the playoffs after last season's 2-9 debacle. Among the happiest
was senior tight end and cocaptain Kerry Taylor, who drew a
personal foul against UConn Saturday after the Minutemen went
ahead, 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-yard infraction led to a missed point-after try by Jason
Cherry, and it proved the difference in the game. ``I felt as if I
had lost two games for us this year,'' said Taylor, who dropped a
pass in the end zone with 43 seconds left in the season-opening
loss at Delaware. ``After our name came up (Sunday), I just felt a
whole lot of relief.''

DESPITE RECORD, BC MADE SOME GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. _ Two weeks ago, Boston College coach Tom
O'Brien said this year's football team would have beaten last
year's team, which went 4-7. ``We're a much better team than we
were last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident at the beginning of the season when the Eagles
started out 3-0, beating Georgia Tech (41-31), Rutgers (41-14), and
Temple (31-7). But an 0-for-4 October was part of a six-game losing
streak that was marked by stinging losses to Navy (32-31) and Notre
Dame (31-26). After snapping the skein with a 23-15 victory at
Pittsburgh, the Eagles wound up 4-7 again when they lost Saturday
at West Virginia, 35-10.
</P>
<P>
   So does O'Brien still believe this year's team was much better
than last year's?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``We were lucky to be 4-7 last year,
and we were probably unlucky to be 4-7 this year, but you make your
own luck. We had a chance to win a couple of more games this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason was the presence of 14 seniors, including quarterback
Scott Mutryn, who finished the season with 2,218 yards and 12 TDs
on 171 completions in 286 attempts; sixth-year linebacker Brian
Maye, a cocaptain who wound up leading the team with 90 tackles;
wide receiver Anthony DiCosmo, who made 47 catches for 804 yards
and 7 TDs; left guard Doug Brzezinski, a cocaptain and offensive
line stalwart who made 46 consecutive starts; and running back Mike
Cloud, who, despite falling 274 yards short of his preseason
objective of 2,000 yards, had the greatest season of any BC
ballcarrier by rushing 308 times for 1,726 yards and 14 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud shattered BC's record for a season (1,387 yards) set by
Chuckie Dukes in 1992 and surpassed by 93 yards the career mark
(3,504) set by Troy Stradford from 1982-86. Cloud also broke the
Big East records for rushing attempts (264) and yards in a season
(1,505) set a year ago by West Virginia's Amos Zereoue. In rushing
28 times for 179 yards in BC's season finale, Cloud improved his
career total to 3,597 yards and wrested the Big East career record
from Zereoue _ at least temporarily. Zereoue has 3,569 yards with
one regular-season game remaining, Friday at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous effort by him,'' O'Brien said of Cloud's
season. ``I think it's a tribute to him and his offensive line,
they did a great job. He's a heck of a runner and a heck of a back.
The guy has a great future ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Eagles? The offense will have to be retooled with the
departure of eight seniors, including two offensive linemen, three
receivers, and a quarterback, running back, and tight end.
Sophomore Tim Hasselbeck appears to be Mutryn's heir apparent at
QB, but he likely will be challenged by sophomore Dave Robbins and
Brian St. Pierre, the standout from St. John's Prep who will be a
redshirt freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Who will step in for Cloud? Cedric Washington and Carlton Rowe
will compete next season, but also could be challenged by any of
BC's recruits, most notably William Green, a 6-foot-2-inch,
220-pounder from Holy Spirit High in Absecon, N.J. Green was one of
14 prospects to verbally commit to BC during the season.
</P>
<P>
   The wide receiving corps will undergo a complete overhaul with
the departure of seniors DiCosmo, Dennis Harding, and Jermaine
Walker, who suffered a season-ending knee injury against Notre
Dame. Junior Derrick Crittenden will be the veteran among the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Though the offensive line will lose its two starting guards _
Brzezinski and right guard Dan Collins _ the Eagles will be
bolstered by the return of junior center Damien Woody, junior
tackle Darnell Alford, and sophomore tackles Paul Zukauskas and
Mike Cook.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, linebackers Willie Wright and Maye will be the only
losses. The Eagles return virtually everyone among their front
seven, including junior nose guard Chris Hovan, junior tackle Mike
Willetts, sophomore tackle Adam Grace, and freshman Antonio Garay,
who was pressed into service this season. Freshman linebackers Andy
Romanowsky and Scott Bradley will return and help fill out a group
that will include juniors Frank Chamberlin and Adam Newman. The
secondary, which was riddled by injuries this season, likely will
be a strength with juniors George White and Pedro Cirino back.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told (the seniors) in the locker room, we couldn't be
where we are today without their efforts,'' O'Brien said. ``There
were some tremendous players in that group, some of whom have a
chance to play at the next level. We didn't accomplish a lot of the
goals we wanted to get to, but the program's on much more solid
ground than it was a year ago. We have a chance now and, as they
say in the South, the most important season is now _ recruiting
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to build some depth so that we're not playing
walk-ons, and we're playing scholarship kids, and we give ourselves
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   A chance to be better than 4-7.

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)

   WASHINGTON _ This city has always kept an unwritten list of
foreign leaders _ dictators, unfriendly authoritarians and
consistently annoying allies _ who it thinks can make an enormous
contribution to peace, security or America's agenda by taking early
retirement, at a minimum. In the 1950s, the leftist leaders of Iran
and Guatamala made the Top 10, in the '60s it was populated by Diem
and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon
and his advisers infamously agreed at a secret meeting in the '70s
that the best way to deal with the government of Salvador Allende
Gossens in Chile was to ``make the economy scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic etiquette, though, has usually discouraged shouting
America's enemies list from the White House rooftop. After all,
foreign policy isn't about personalities, right? But last week,
driven by frustration, or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding
tough for cameras, the Clinton administration piped up, twice. In
very different situations, in opposite corners of the world, the
United States spoke loudly because it can't find a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, hours after he called off an attack on Iraq, Clinton
finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of U.S. policy
toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein _ what
Clinton called supporting the ``forces of change in Iraq.'' No
matter that covert efforts to do just that have failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore
used his visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to
throw U.S. support behind protesters calling for ``reformasi,'' the
code word on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamed. He has long been a burr in Washington's side,
denouncing America, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently
imprisoned his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim,
who has suddenly become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But
Mahathir is no Saddam, not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides insist that his speech was a call for reform, not a
demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted that way.
The New Zealanders called it ``megaphone diplomacy.'' The Malaysian
government called it ``disgusting'' and an ``interference in
internal affairs.'' Predictably, executives of several U.S.
companies that have flocked to Kuala Lumpur told the Malaysians
that Gore was rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered
words that needed to be said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's words, they raised the
question of what it takes these days for the world's most powerful
nation to begin publicly suggesting that it's time for a nettlesome
leader to go. Because there is no official list, there are no real
criteria for getting on it.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il of
North Korea. President Clinton is spending the weekend on the
Korean Peninsula, staring across the demilitarized zone at a
dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to break out
of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects, in
return for billions in Western energy aid. Yet Washington has never
called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's
repressive regime. His government, taking a page out of the Saddam
playbook, suggested last week that if the United States really
wants to look at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believes is a
nuclear installation in the making, it should write a check for
another $300 million. No one even called for Kim's removal when, a
few months ago, he lobbed a three-stage missile over Japan just to
show he knew how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules for calling for the end of a regime are pretty
murky,'' said Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of
California at San Diego who served in the Clinton administration's
first term. ``When they really want to push someone out, it is
because that country is part of a larger strategic concern at the
time. But the country itself usually doesn't have great strategic
weight'' _ it's another matter to call for a change of leadership
in Beijing or Moscow _ ``and it helps if there is some kind of
domestic opposition that we can point to.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely a
ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid
stockpiler of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who
was President George Bush's national security adviser, insisted
last week that Saddam nowadays is simply ``an irritant, an
annoyance, a pest and a problem, but not a threat to the region at
the moment'').
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, however, is far more complex case. He's a prime
example of how opposing Washington's political and economic agenda
for an interconnected world can move a leader from the list of
authoritarians whom Washington tolerates to the list of
authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Asian strongmen _ Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines
and Suharto of Indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear
was that Malaysia would become a communist domino. But he also
seemed eminently tolerable long after the Cold War was over. He has
never been accused of enormous corruption. He turned his country
into a model of competitiveness, and Malaysia became the exemplar
of the ``big emerging markets'' that Clinton's Commerce Department
touted until things went sour last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was always prickly. But he is no terrorist or killer _
U.S. companies have flocked to his country, and say they want to
stay _ and his iron control over political discourse is no stronger
than in neighboring Singapore. Just this summer, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin paid him an ostensibly friendly, if
strained, visit and made no reference to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when Ibrahim was arrested and beaten in jail.
He has long been an advocate of the Western-style solutions to
economic turmoil _ more openness, more freedom _ and the protest
movement against Mahathir only surfaced once he was in jail. Gore
leapt on that opportunity _ particularly striking because, in the
case of Indonesia earlier this year, it took the administration
months to come to the conclusion that President Suharto had to go.
He went.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fear now is that the public U.S. embrace of the nascent
opposition in Malaysia could bolster Mahathir's standing. After
all, he is a nationalist, and now he has evidence that the
Americans want to see him toppled. It's not a far stretch for him
to argue that Clinton _ who snubbed his country by skipping the
summit at the last minute _ is using currency traders the way
President Lyndon B. Johnson used Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore gave Mahathir the excuse to portray himself as a man
fighting for independence from the Americans,'' a senior Clinton
administration official said, arguing that the vice president went
too far. ``We've just taken a bad situation and made it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a man who is already running for president, standing up
to an Asian authoritarian can't be an entirely unwise move. The
risk is one of unintended consequences. It is easy to explain to
the world why you are simply going after brutal tyrants like Saddam
or drug runners and money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   But siding with ``reformers'' is trickier business. Clinton did
exactly that in Japan in 1993, abandoning decades of covert support
for Japan's conservative ruling party. By the time the reformers
were finished with the Japanese economy, Washington was begging for
the old-timers to come back.

<P>
   Sunday, hours after he called off an attack on Iraq, Clinton
finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of U.S. policy
toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein _ what
Clinton called supporting the ``forces of change in Iraq.'' No
matter that covert efforts to do just that have failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore
used his visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to
throw U.S. support behind protesters calling for ``reformasi,'' the
code word on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamed. He has long been a burr in Washington's side,
denouncing America, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently
imprisoned his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim,
who has suddenly become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But
Mahathir is no Saddam, not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides insist that his speech was a call for reform, not a
demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted that way.
The New Zealanders called it ``megaphone diplomacy.'' The Malaysian
government called it ``disgusting'' and an ``interference in
internal affairs.'' Predictably, executives of several U.S.
companies that have flocked to Kuala Lumpur told the Malaysians
that Gore was rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered
words that needed to be said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's words, they raised the
question of what it takes these days for the world's most powerful
nation to begin publicly suggesting that it's time for a nettlesome
leader to go. Because there is no official list, there are no real
criteria for getting on it.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il of
North Korea. President Clinton is spending the weekend on the
Korean Peninsula, staring across the demilitarized zone at a
dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to break out
of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects, in
return for billions in Western energy aid. Yet Washington has never
called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's
repressive regime. His government, taking a page out of the Saddam
playbook, suggested last week that if the United States really
wants to look at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believes is a
nuclear installation in the making, it should write a check for
another $300 million. No one even called for Kim's removal when, a
few months ago, he lobbed a three-stage missile over Japan just to
show he knew how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules for calling for the end of a regime are pretty
murky,'' said Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of
California at San Diego who served in the Clinton administration's
first term. ``When they really want to push someone out, it is
because that country is part of a larger strategic concern at the
time. But the country itself usually doesn't have great strategic
weight'' _ it's another matter to call for a change of leadership
in Beijing or Moscow _ ``and it helps if there is some kind of
domestic opposition that we can point to.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely a
ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid
stockpiler of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who
was President George Bush's national security adviser, insisted
last week that Saddam nowadays is simply ``an irritant, an
annoyance, a pest and a problem, but not a threat to the region at
the moment'').
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, however, is far more complex case. He's a prime
example of how opposing Washington's political and economic agenda
for an interconnected world can move a leader from the list of
authoritarians whom Washington tolerates to the list of
authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Asian strongmen _ Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines
and Suharto of Indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear
was that Malaysia would become a communist domino. But he also
seemed eminently tolerable long after the Cold War was over. He has
never been accused of enormous corruption. He turned his country
into a model of competitiveness, and Malaysia became the exemplar
of the ``big emerging markets'' that Clinton's Commerce Department
touted until things went sour last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was always prickly. But he is no terrorist or killer _
U.S. companies have flocked to his country, and say they want to
stay _ and his iron control over political discourse is no stronger
than in neighboring Singapore. Just this summer, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin paid him an ostensibly friendly, if
strained, visit and made no reference to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when Ibrahim was arrested and beaten in jail.
He has long been an advocate of the Western-style solutions to
economic turmoil _ more openness, more freedom _ and the protest
movement against Mahathir only surfaced once he was in jail. Gore
leapt on that opportunity _ particularly striking because, in the
case of Indonesia earlier this year, it took the administration
months to come to the conclusion that President Suharto had to go.
He went.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fear now is that the public U.S. embrace of the nascent
opposition in Malaysia could bolster Mahathir's standing. After
all, he is a nationalist, and now he has evidence that the
Americans want to see him toppled. It's not a far stretch for him
to argue that Clinton _ who snubbed his country by skipping the
summit at the last minute _ is using currency traders the way
President Lyndon B. Johnson used Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore gave Mahathir the excuse to portray himself as a man
fighting for independence from the Americans,'' a senior Clinton
administration official said, arguing that the vice president went
too far. ``We've just taken a bad situation and made it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a man who is already running for president, standing up
to an Asian authoritarian can't be an entirely unwise move. The
risk is one of unintended consequences. It is easy to explain to
the world why you are simply going after brutal tyrants like Saddam
or drug runners and money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   But siding with ``reformers'' is trickier business. Clinton did
exactly that in Japan in 1993, abandoning decades of covert support
for Japan's conservative ruling party. By the time the reformers
were finished with the Japanese economy, Washington was begging for
the old-timers to come back.

CLINTON TO EASE GUAM'S FRUSTRATION OVER SECOND CLASS STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGANA, Guam _ President Clinton visited Guam Monday, greeting
islanders with the local welcome, ``Hafa adai,'' and promising to
respond to claims by residents of this U.S. territory that they
suffer from federal neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told thousands of cheering, flag waving islanders at an
outdoor campaign-style rally that he will turn over additional U.S.
military property held since GIs stormed ashore in 1944 in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   He offered fresh federal assistance for a tourist-dependent, $3
billion economy that still looks to federal expenditures for 28
percent of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And the president said he will ``respond seriously'' to the
outcome of a popular, non-binding referendum in December 1999 in
which the island's 160,000 residents will choose between statehood,
independence or free association with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work to ensure that your voices are heard in
Washington, that you are treated fairly and sensitively by the
federal government, that you are consulted before policies are made
that affect your lives,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was returning to Washington, D.C., knowing ``the
rhythms, the energy, the smile, the realities of life here that I
would never have understood so well had I not been able to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who began his day in South Korea and planned to end it
back at the White House late Monday, got a rousing reception from
Guamanians who rarely see American presidents visit their
212-square mile volcanic island 8,900 miles from the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The last chief executive to come, President Ronald Reagan in
1986, alienated some islanders with remarks that praised U.S.
troops here but made scant mention of islanders' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Guamanians, infatuated with their latest visitor, made it clear
that they want Clinton to improve their status.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Underwood, D-Guam, a non-voting member of the House,
turned to Clinton and said: ``Mr. President, you are president of
the people of Guam but I would like to vote for you one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Guam Gov. Carl Gutierrez said ``someone in Washington needs to
stand up and do what is right by Americans in Guam.'' He urged
Clinton to release a greater share of the 44,800 acres under U.S.
control _ 23 percent of Guam's usable land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rich opportunities within our grasp if we are able
to move from our colonial past into a future partnership that sets
free the economic vitality locked up in land that must be
returned,'' Gutierrez declared.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on the island, which annually serves 1.4 million
tourists mostly from Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan,
eagerly seek return of U.S. military reservations to enable
construction of additional hotels, golf courses and resorts to draw
additional tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon still uses the holdings to stage military
operations across East Asia, particularly since returning Subic Bay
and Clark Air Force base to the Philippines in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Guam's air fields and harbor supported allied operations during
the Korean War. B-52 bombers based in Guam bombed Hanoi during the
Vietnam War. Pre-positioned supply ships anchored here helped
bolster reinforcements rushed to the Persian Gulf in 1990. The
United States also has used bases here to temporarily house
refugees from Vietnam and Kurdish areas in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to speed turnover of 3,213 acres promised in
1994 and announced plans to turn over 7,300 more acres.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton paid homage, as well, to the 1,300 Americans who died
retaking this island from Japanese occupiers in 1944 as part of the
U.S. island-hopping campaign to get allied bombers within range of
the Japanese homeland. Clinton laid a wreath of yellow roses at a
hilltop war memorial overlooking Asan Bay.

   Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan landed on this glistening
Pacific isle in desperation in 1521, his emaciated, scurvy-ridden
crew eating rats and sea-soaked leather. Spying the Spaniards'
three anchored galleons, islanders stole the skiff that Magellan
and his men had used to land at Umatac.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrated Spaniard promptly named Guam the Isle of Thieves
and personally led a raiding party that reclaimed the skiff,
killing at least seven islanders and leaving their village in
charred ruins before setting off again.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan was killed less than two months later on an island in
the Philippines chain.
</P>
<P>
   But his visit to Guam set the stage for the arrival of Spanish
missionaries in 1568, launching 330 years of colonial rule by
Spain.

YOU, TOO, CAN AVOID MONICA'S KISS-AND-TELL BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't wish to crush the entrepreneurial spirit that built this
country (well, along with a lot of heavy Earth-moving equipment),
but I am announcing now, well before it's published, that I will
not purchase and will not read the tell-tale book Monica Lewinsky
has just signed a huge contract to write. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I say ``huge,'' knowing only that the wire services, which
surely know whereof they spread rumors, have reported that it's a
``seven-figure deal.'' I am guessing that most of those figures
will fall to the left of the decimal point, though I could be
wrong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the contract is worth, the result will be a book
that will not interest me in the slightest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And I say ``write,'' even though it's doubtful that Lewinsky
will be doing much, if any, of that herself. Her volume is to be
co-authored by Andrew Morton, biographer of another young woman
with considerable attraction to both danger and men _ the late
Princess Diana. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's late November. The Lewinsky book deal has been revealed
only recently. But the book is due to come out either in February
or by summer, depending on which report you buy. Between now and
then are some major holidays, ranging from Thanksgiving to Hanukkah
to Christmas to my birthday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of this timing information tells me that readers may expect
a book that has been written in rough draft and printed that way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to someone like me, who faces daily deadlines, not
having to turn something in until early next year would seem like
an invitation to head to Florida for a month and play golf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But your average author of books often piddles around for 18
months on just the preface. And not just piddles around, either,
but pours his or her heart and thesaurus into the task so that the
result is, if not memorable literature, at least not embarrassing
schlock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've given considerable thought (well, a lot for someone who
faces daily deadlines _ 4 minutes) to why I will shun the Lewinsky
book. After only 30 seconds of that elapsed time, I was certain of
the primary reason _ I already know way more than I need or want to
about Monica. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suppose someone had asked you a year ago, before her name was a
household word, if you would read a book by a former White House
intern in her early 20s. Your reaction, no doubt, would have been
similar to mine: ``Yes, just as soon as I finish every other book
in the Library of Congress.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened in the interim to make some publisher (St.
Martin's Press _ making the publisher, by the way, the only saint
in this story) think such a book will sell? Well, what's happened
is that part of Lewinsky's anatomy and part of the anatomy of the
president of the United States have come into contact several
times. And everybody knows it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But is this any reason to read a book? Puh-leeze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will your life be improved if you know how Monica's blue Gap
dress got stained and why, in her own words (well, OK, in Andrew
Morton's words), she kept the messed-up thing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do you really care what she has to say about her ``friend''
Linda Tripp? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What will it profit you to hear a text replay of Monica and Bill
having phone sex? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friends, this is an obtuse 25-year-old woman with the morals of
a vacuum cleaner who will write about a bright but stupid
52-year-old man with the morals of a vacuum cleaner. To heck with
her book. I'll wait for the movie. &QL;

   &UR; CALIFORNIA'S OVER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Louis B. Jones. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In detailing the narcissistic foibles of a hippie family in the
1970s, this novel strives to capture the era's hypersincerity and
inflated sense of destiny. The result is ``a satirical elegy for
the age of dime-store Zen,'' Walter Kirn said here last year. ``The
book is as light and swirly and eccentric as its Marin County
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY NAME ESCAPES ME: THE DIARY OF A RETIRING ACTOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alec Guinness. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from this lively journal undertaken at the age of 80,
the versatile and idiosyncratic actor still has plenty to say. He
holds forth in charming and humorous fashion on everything from the
English weather to politics to his warm friendships with pets and
humans, not to mention the performances of other actors. Through it
all, ``Guinness remains pungently human, warts and all,'' John
Simon wrote in the Book Review in 1997. ``Sir Alec is an
accomplished writer, both in extended passages and in finely
etched, memory-hugging one-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOB THE GAMBLER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Frederick Barthelme.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This novel focuses on the effects of compulsive gambling on a
family that wagers its comfortable life-style on a chance to escape
the banality of middle-class existence. ``It is Barthelme's
peculiar post-modern gift to be able to invert the easy ironies of
contemporary life and reveal the truths beneath them,'' A.O. Scott
said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JAPAN: A REINTERPRETATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patrick Smith. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist punctures the postwar myth of a single-minded Japan
Inc., content with conformity and dependency on the West, and
instead finds a troubled society struggling to reinvent itself in
the absence of any meaningful democracy. Last year our reviewer,
Frank Gibney, called this ``a stimulating, provocative book.''
 &UR; GEISHA &LR; , by Liza Crihfield Dalby (University of California,
$17.95), tells of an American doctoral candidate who traveled to
Japan in the mid-1970s to study the female entertainers known as
geisha and wound up working as one. Her account, which has been
reissued with a new preface, is marked by ``delicate observation
and subtle common sense,'' Donald Rich wrote here in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SKY, THE STARS, THE WILDERNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Rick Bass. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These three novellas cover a lot of ground _ from Canada to
Mississippi _ but they share a precise observation of nature that
is both unsentimental and ecstatic. ``Reading this book has made me
glad ... that there are still writers who can bring the wilderness
back alive and pin it to the page,'' Michael Gorra said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BOOK OF MEMORIES  &LR;  By Peter Nadas. Translated by Ivan
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Penguin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This large, philosophically complex Hungarian novel transposes
two elaborately linked Proustian narratives of consciousness to the
universe of communist East Berlin and Budapest. ``The terrain of
Eastern European experience ... gains an amplitude and an
illumination from the painstaking attentiveness, the penetration
with which it is imagined and contemplated,'' Eva Hoffman wrote
here last year.  &UR; THE LAND OF GREEN PLUMS &LR; , by Herta Mueller,
translated from the German by Michael Hofmann (Hydra
Books/Northwestern University, $14.95), is a grim novel about a
group of young Romanians persecuted as dissidents during the
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. ``Mueller's vision ... reads
like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony,
stupidity and brutality,'' Larry Wolff wrote here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STEPHEN FOSTER AND THE RISE OF AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE  &LR;  By
Ken Emerson. Da Capo, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of ``Oh! Susanna,'' ``Camptown Races'' and other
enduring tunes from the 1800s was the first American songwriter to
achieve artistic independence from Europe. This is ``a vigorous,
thoroughly researched, amiably chatty tour through his life and
times,'' Margo Jefferson wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REQUIRED READING: WHY OUR A ERICAN CLASSICS MATTER NOW  &LR;  By
Andrew Delbanco.
</P>
<P>
   Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to give new urgency to the works of Melville, Thoreau
and nine other writers, a humanities professor argues that the best
American writing reflects political values in line with those of
liberal democracy. ``Delbanco's essays are effortlessly erudite and
smoothly readable,'' Jonathan Rosen said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PR! A SOCIAL HISTORY OF SPIN  &LR;  By Stuart Ewen. Basic Books,
$17.
</P>
<P>
   In tracing the evolution of public relations, the author shows
how the hype machine has persuaded Americans to buy everything from
new cars to new wars, and how it has undermined our political
discourse. Last year in these pages, Judith Newman called this an
``exhaustive and ambitious study.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WONDER WORKER  &LR;  By Susan Howatch. Fawcett Columbine, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman's obsession with the charismatic leader of a
London parish sets off a chain of events that includes a possible
murder and a suicide. Last year our reviewer, Betsy Groban, said
that despite its implausible ending, this is ``an absorbing
novel.''

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget E.F. Hutton. These days, when the markets speak,
everyone, even Alan Greenspan, listens.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message from the Federal Reserve Board's decision
last week to cut interest rates for the third time in seven weeks.
The reason for the rate reductions was not a slowdown in the
domestic economy, which is typically behind a rate cut. Rather the
moves were an attempt to eliminate ongoing problems in the
international bond markets that first surfaced in August when
Russia defaulted on its debt.
</P>
<P>
   A perhaps unintended consequence of the Fed's moves is a stock
market that has gone up, up and away. In about a month, the Dow
Jones industrial average has risen more than 1,000 points. This
recovery, from the depths of August's despair, is impressive
indeed. Compare it, for example, with how stocks acted after the
Crash of 1987. Then, according to Peter Canelo, an equity
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, it took 15 months for
stocks to recover half of what they lost. This year, it took less
than one month.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, many of the world's economic woes that caused the
market to go down remain as troubling now as they were two months
ago. Most of Asia continues in deep recession, the success of the
Brazilian bailout is unclear and earnings at corporations in this
country are falling. Many economists think prospects for economic
growth next year are tepid at best.
</P>
<P>
   And so the market is made up of two voices: one that votes with
its funds, another that worries over the economic data. The gulf
between these two is wider than it has been in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Those putting their money into stocks are saying that there will
be no recession in 1999 and that corporate profit growth next year
will not be as disappointing as pessimistic economists predict.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their optimism is based on lower interest rates, which
mean less onerous borrowing costs for corporations. Bond prices
typically also rise when the Fed cuts rates because the new lower
prevailing rate of interest paid on debt securities makes those
bonds issued previously and at higher rates more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   But three interest rate cuts, a balm to both economy and
consumer, cannot explain all of the stock market's feverish
movement. The rocketing stock market seems to be increasingly
unconnected to economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that investors are behaving irrationally.
Since the market is thousands of individuals making discrete
investment decisions with cold, hard cash each day, the market
actually tends to see the future better than the economists and
market strategists who pop up on television and in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows, of course, whether the market or the
pessimistic pundits will win out next year. What is knowable is
which voice is being heeded more these days. It is the voice of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   How do you search for clues about the nation's economic future?
Historically, analysts scrutinized the government's releases of
economic data to decide on an investment path. Now people are
looking at the market to see which path to take, buying stocks
simply because they are going up. More than one Wall Street
strategist says that since the market is very good at seeing
recessions on the horizon, rising stock prices mean there will be
no such thing in 1999. If the market saw a recession looming, stock
prices would not be rising, according to this argument.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Fed chairman seems riveted on the markets, not on
economic arcana such as, say, the U.S. international price index
for in-bound ocean line freight. His three recent rate cuts have
been strictly the result of disturbing patterns in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors used to watch the Fed to help them make their
investment decisions. Now the Fed analyzes investors to help it set
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the Fed no longer considers economic
data, of course. And part of the central bank's increased focus on
the bond market is the Fed's quite fitting response to the
increasing significance of the bond and stock markets. As more and
more individual investors put their savings into stocks, for
example, the performance of the stock market becomes more of a
predictor of consumer buying patterns. Since the American consumer
accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economy, a surging stock
market and its resulting wealth creation, has a big effect on
businesses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also something strangely circular in this focus on
the financial markets. As investors and policy-makers look
increasingly to the markets for wisdom, it becomes the investment
equivalent of looking at dancers looking at themselves in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost our anchor,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director of
Fimat U.S.A., a brokerage in New York that specializes in futures
and derivatives. ``We used to have some idea and take a bit of news
and say it means that the Fed is more or less likely to do
something. But now it's not the fundamentals, it's what other
people think about the fundamentals that are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the market isn't wise. It is, because the market is, at
any given time, the sum of investors' current knowledge of the
facts that influence investing decisions. But it is not omniscient;
sometimes, investors don't have all the facts they need to make an
informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   But facts are becoming less important to the increasing numbers
of investors who buy stocks. After years of a roaring bull market,
many players are short term oriented in their trading, investing
based on what they think valuations of stocks and bonds will be
next month or even next week; the objective is less about long-term
investing than it is about investing to outwit the masses. A
dangerous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior like this is as old as human nature. John Maynard
Keynes discussed it in his 1936 book, ``The General Theory of
Employment Interest and Money.'' To Keynes, ``professional
investment may be likened to newspaper competitions in which
competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred
photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice
most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the
competitors as a whole.'' What inevitably happens, he wrote, is
``each competitor picks not those faces which he himself finds
prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy
of the other competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the context of today's market, Keynes' observation translates
to: What counts is not what we think about the future of the
economy or the stock market but what we think most people think
about the future of the economy or the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent investment conference in New York City sponsored by
Grant's Interest Rate Observer, one of the speakers was Steven
Leuthold, a respected stock market analyst known for relying on
hard facts and historical data to draw his conclusions on market
strategy. Leuthold had been bearish recently, pointing to a raft of
figures that put the stock market at overvalued levels. Yet
Leuthold said he had become bullish about stocks and felt that the
Dow would pierce the 10,000 level within months.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his change of heart? The biggest indicator of
all: the crowd. Main Street is in love with stocks, he said, and
this made higher stock prices a given.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't beat them, get in line.

IN AN ODD TURN, OFFICIALS ARE PUSHING WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) 
 (ATTN: Texas, S.D., N.Y., Md., Wis.)   (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't gasp, but bureaucrats are rolling out the welcome mats at
some of the nation's welfare offices again.
</P>
<P>
   They are beckoning the working poor and courting the thousands
of single mothers abandoning the welfare rolls. And the message to
those struggling to survive without government checks? ``Don't
forget to apply for Medicaid and food stamps!''
</P>
<P>
   This touting of public charity may seem startling, even
contradictory, at a time when government officials are pushing
work, not welfare. But food stamps and Medicaid are considered
vital entitlements that keep working people off welfare and the
newly employed from slipping back on. And when federal officials
noticed a surprising dip in the number of food stamp recipients
earlier this year, they prodded states to act.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of recent memos, federal officials told states to
conduct ``aggressive outreach'' and regional officers to crack down
on wayward localities. The fear is that local governments may be
blocking access to food stamps and Medicaid as they persuade people
to give up the dole, snatching a valuable crutch from welfare
mothers hobbling toward self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, for instance, drew intense scrutiny earlier this
month with its practice of delaying Medicaid and food stamp
applications until a second visit to the welfare office. (Federal
law requires them to be supplied without delay.)
</P>
<P>
   But officials in some states are also wringing their hands over
computers that sometimes improperly terminate food stamps and
Medicaid benefits. And federal officials want to clear the clouds
of confusion in poor communities where some believe that ending
old-style welfare means an end to all government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the federal government's urgings _ coupled with local
concerns for the poor _ have persuaded some states to do the
unthinkable: vigorously hawk public aid. Maryland, where colorful
brochures about Medicaid and food stamps are stacked in its welfare
waiting rooms, now plans to mail that information to the 2,500
single mothers who leave the welfare rolls each month.

<P>
   South Dakota has sent hundreds of letters to food stamp
recipients to make sure they know about Medicaid. And in Wisconsin,
which has stationed Medicaid and food stamp workers in some
hospitals, Milwaukee is considering revamping its application
process altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting first with workers who discourage
applications for welfare, clients in Milwaukee may soon stop first
at the desks of officials who will discuss their rights to food
stamps and Medicaid, a shift sought by advocates for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning that you need to let people know they're
eligible,'' said Jean Rogers, an administrator at Wisconsin's
Department of Workforce Development. ``Both of these issues speak
to being able to hold a job,'' she said. ``If you're sick, you
can't hold down a job. If you're hungry the same applies.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has joined the rush to embrace food stamps,
which are financed entirely by the federal government, and
Medicaid, which is partly financed by the federal government. Some
local officials are still ambivalent, particularly about pushing
food stamps, a benefit tainted, to some, by welfare's sour smell of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have taken pains to distinguish between the
two. By law, municipalities can discourage people from applying for
welfare. Food stamps and Medicaid, however, are still federal
entitlements and applications must be offered without delay.
</P>
<P>
   But for some officials, the dividing line is still blurry.
Texas, for instance, gives awards to welfare offices that
discourage the largest numbers of people from applying for welfare
and food stamps. (State officials say they are now reconsidering
the reward for food stamps.)
</P>
<P>
   And in New York City, where applications are generally offered
only on a second visit, officials protest that offering easier
access to food stamps and Medicaid would damage their efforts to
destroy the culture of dependency in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some states have not bought in at a philosophical level that
they should make sure people get food stamps and Medicaid,'' said
Liz Schott, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it's not intentional,'' said Ms. Schott, who
has studied the issue. ``It's not that they don't want people to
get food stamps or Medicaid. But this zeal to reduce the welfare
caseloads hasn't been separated from food stamps and Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns bubbled up earlier this year when advocates for
the poor began noticing that the number of food stamp recipients
had fallen by 25 percent since 1996, the year the new welfare law
was signed, a decline that federal officials say cannot be
explained by the improved economy. (Comparable Medicaid statistics
are not yet available. In New York, declines in Medicaid and food
stamps have been similar.)
</P>
<P>
   At first, some officials thought people were finding jobs and no
longer needed food stamps, said Julie Paradis, an undersecretary at
the Department of Agriculture. But a closer look at the statistics
_ and conversations with advocates for the poor _ convinced federal
officials that many people were simply struggling without benefits,
she said. Most local officials now believe the downward trend must
be slowed, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials are now reaching out to applicants who are
confused by the new law or were deterred by overzealous welfare
workers, and to applicants and to those who are simply too ashamed
to admit they still need help after finding low-wage work.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to attr`ct people too proud to apply for Medicaid because
they associate it with the stigma of welfare, South Dakota even
took the word ``Medicaid'' off the covers of its promotional
brochures, replacing it with the words ``medical help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really heartened by their commitment,'' said Ms. Paradis.
``They really view the programs as something that should be
available to families.''

DOUBLE TALKING ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget E.F. Hutton. These days, when the markets speak,
everyone, even Alan Greenspan, listens.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message from the Federal Reserve Board's decision
last week to cut interest rates for the third time in seven weeks.
The reason for the rate reductions was not a slowdown in the
domestic economy, which is typically behind a rate cut. Rather the
moves were an attempt to eliminate ongoing problems in the
international bond markets that first surfaced in August when
Russia defaulted on its debt.
</P>
<P>
   A perhaps unintended consequence of the Fed's moves is a stock
market that has gone up, up and away. In about a month, the Dow
Jones industrial average has risen more than 1,000 points. This
recovery, from the depths of August's despair, is impressive
indeed. Compare it, for example, with how stocks acted after the
Crash of 1987. Then, according to Peter Canelo, an equity
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, it took 15 months for
stocks to recover half of what they lost. This year, it took less
than one month.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, many of the world's economic woes that caused the
market to go down remain as troubling now as they were two months
ago. Most of Asia continues in deep recession, the success of the
Brazilian bailout is unclear and earnings at corporations in this
country are falling. Many economists think prospects for economic
growth next year are tepid at best.
</P>
<P>
   And so the market is made up of two voices: one that votes with
its funds, another that worries over the economic data. The gulf
between these two is wider than it has been in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Those putting their money into stocks are saying that there will
be no recession in 1999 and that corporate profit growth next year
will not be as disappointing as pessimistic economists predict.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their optimism is based on lower interest rates, which
mean less onerous borrowing costs for corporations. Bond prices
typically also rise when the Fed cuts rates because the new lower
prevailing rate of interest paid on debt securities makes those
bonds issued previously and at higher rates more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   But three interest rate cuts, a balm to both economy and
consumer, cannot explain all of the stock market's feverish
movement. The rocketing stock market seems to be increasingly
unconnected to economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that investors are behaving irrationally.
Since the market is thousands of individuals making discrete
investment decisions with cold, hard cash each day, the market
actually tends to see the future better than the economists and
market strategists who pop up on television and in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows, of course, whether the market or the
pessimistic pundits will win out next year. What is knowable is
which voice is being heeded more these days. It is the voice of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   How do you search for clues about the nation's economic future?
Historically, analysts scrutinized the government's releases of
economic data to decide on an investment path. Now people are
looking at the market to see which path to take, buying stocks
simply because they are going up. More than one Wall Street
strategist says that since the market is very good at seeing
recessions on the horizon, rising stock prices mean there will be
no such thing in 1999. If the market saw a recession looming, stock
prices would not be rising, according to this argument.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Fed chairman seems riveted on the markets, not on
economic arcana such as, say, the U.S. international price index
for in-bound ocean line freight. His three recent rate cuts have
been strictly the result of disturbing patterns in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors used to watch the Fed to help them make their
investment decisions. Now the Fed analyzes investors to help it set
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the Fed no longer considers economic
data, of course. And part of the central bank's increased focus on
the bond market is the Fed's quite fitting response to the
increasing significance of the bond and stock markets. As more and
more individual investors put their savings into stocks, for
example, the performance of the stock market becomes more of a
predictor of consumer buying patterns. Since the American consumer
accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economy, a surging stock
market and its resulting wealth creation, has a big effect on
businesses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also something strangely circular in this focus on
the financial markets. As investors and policy-makers look
increasingly to the markets for wisdom, it becomes the investment
equivalent of looking at dancers looking at themselves in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost our anchor,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director of
Fimat U.S.A., a brokerage in New York that specializes in futures
and derivatives. ``We used to have some idea and take a bit of news
and say it means that the Fed is more or less likely to do
something. But now it's not the fundamentals, it's what other
people think about the fundamentals that are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the market isn't wise. It is, because the market is, at
any given time, the sum of investors' current knowledge of the
facts that influence investing decisions. But it is not omniscient;
sometimes, investors don't have all the facts they need to make an
informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   But facts are becoming less important to the increasing numbers
of investors who buy stocks. After years of a roaring bull market,
many players are short term oriented in their trading, investing
based on what they think valuations of stocks and bonds will be
next month or even next week; the objective is less about long-term
investing than it is about investing to outwit the masses. A
dangerous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior like this is as old as human nature. John Maynard
Keynes discussed it in his 1936 book, ``The General Theory of
Employment Interest and Money.'' To Keynes, ``professional
investment may be likened to newspaper competitions in which
competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred
photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice
most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the
competitors as a whole.'' What inevitably happens, he wrote, is
``each competitor picks not those faces which he himself finds
prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy
of the other competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the context of today's market, Keynes' observation translates
to: What counts is not what we think about the future of the
economy or the stock market but what we think most people think
about the future of the economy or the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent investment conference in New York City sponsored by
Grant's Interest Rate Observer, one of the speakers was Steven
Leuthold, a respected stock market analyst known for relying on
hard facts and historical data to draw his conclusions on market
strategy. Leuthold had been bearish recently, pointing to a raft of
figures that put the stock market at overvalued levels. Yet
Leuthold said he had become bullish about stocks and felt that the
Dow would pierce the 10,000 level within months.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his change of heart? The biggest indicator of
all: the crowd. Main Street is in love with stocks, he said, and
this made higher stock prices a given.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't beat them, get in line.

`STAR WARS' FANS, MAY THE TRAILER BE WITH YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who doesn't remember feeling an electrifying zing up the spine
at that majestic blast of trumpets and the ``Star Wars'' title
appearing on the big screen for the first time? With innovative
special effects and a classic good-vs.-evil theme, the ``Star
Wars'' series became a part of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Star Wars'' enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week
had its sneak preview announced on the Internet and sent a small
army of fans into theaters around the country to watch it over and
over again.
</P>
<P>
   The Zing strikes back.
</P>
<P>
   That was the response to the two-minute trailer _ just the
preview, mind you _ for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the
``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May
21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Star Wars'' trailer also began showing months before
the film's release in May 1977, but after reports of audiences
booing and laughing, the film's distributor, 20th Century Fox,
quailed and yanked it out of circulation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a completely different scene Tuesday night at the sneak
preview of the preview in a downtown Manhattan theater. (Its
official opening date was Friday, but the movie's Web site,
www.starwars.com, announced advance screenings at selected
theaters.) The lights went dark, and unlike the typical New York
movie experience, the audience instantly shut up. The crowd seemed
to be holding its breath as scenes from ``The Phantom Menace''
thundered onto the screen in a flurry of spaceships, aliens, robots
and humanoids, all new but vaguely familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Set a generation before the original ``Star Wars'' movie,
Episode I follows a youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker,
the boy who is destined to become Darth Vader. The cast includes
Liam Neesom, Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson, among others.
To see the preview, fans still had to pay $9, the price of
admission at most New York City theaters.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the trailer ended and the one for the remake of
``Psycho'' began, about 30 people ran to the theater next door to
catch the ``Phantom Menace'' preview again as it began to play
after the closing credits of ``Meet Joe Black.'' Ushers discreetly
looked the other way as the trailer was being trailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here since 10 a.m.,'' said Chris Bergoch, a
26-year-old diehard ``Star Wars'' fan who took the day off from
work and spent it ducking in and out of three screening rooms
showing the trailer. By 8 p.m., he'd seen it 20 times and was
planning to spend the rest of the night there. ``I've waited 16
years for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another all-day viewer was Jude Lane, who was only 3 when ``Star
Wars'' came out and says it was her first memory. ``No matter what
the color, race, background or religion of the people watching the
trailer, for two minutes and five seconds everyone feels the
same,'' she said. ``You're friends with everybody in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed buzz about ``Star Wars'' has been building since
last year's re-release of the trilogy, which incorporated new
footage and state-of-the-art digital effects. The movies offered
nostalgia for viewers, and some of them brought their own children
to experience the movies on the big screen, and not slice-and-dice
versions on television. Generation X, who once nagged Mom for those
little $1.49 Luke Skywalker action figures, can today choose from
vast array of toys including videos, games, books and a $29.95
CD-ROM titled ``Behind the Magic,'' which serves as a guide to the
``Star Wars'' universe and offers a glimpse of ``The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   But by May all the hype _ from merchandise to advertising _
might work to turn off an already cynical public. ``There are
concerns, certainly in the wake of `Godzilla,''' said Andrew
Hindes, a senior writer at Variety. ``Fox knows they don't have to
overhype this. You can't have more awareness. If they're smart,
they'll be subtle. You could open it cold and it would still be
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' cost Sony Pictures Entertainment $200 million to
make and market globally, but will result in little if any profit.
So far, the original ``Star Wars'' trilogy has made at least $1.7
billion. ``The Phantom Menace,'' the first in another Lucasfilm
trilogy, cost $115 million to make.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if the hype will overshadow ``The Phantom Menace''
itself. If Lucas has stuck with his original vision of the saga,
which was of a simple, feel-good action series full of universal
themes, it might not. Deep down, past all the special effects and
whiz-bang glitz, the director is conjuring with some fundamental
elements of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Star Wars' is not a simple morality play,'' the late Joseph
Campbell, an authority on mythology, wrote. ``It has to do with the
powers of life as they are either fulfilled or broken and
suppressed through the action of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe with this newest episode, the marketing team will resist
the temptation to paste hundreds of posters saying ``Yoda is THIS
tall'' on the sides of street-corner newspaper boxes. If there's a
film that doesn't need too much hype, it would be ``The Phantom
Menace,'' and face it, the Force is already with them.

IN AN ODD TURN, OFFICIALS ARE PUSHING WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) 
 (ATTN: Texas, S.D., N.Y., Md., Wis.)   (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't gasp, but bureaucrats are rolling out the welcome mats at
some of the nation's welfare offices again.
</P>
<P>
   They are beckoning the working poor and courting the thousands
of single mothers abandoning the welfare rolls. And the message to
those struggling to survive without government checks? ``Don't
forget to apply for Medicaid and food stamps!''
</P>
<P>
   This touting of public charity may seem startling, even
contradictory, at a time when government officials are pushing
work, not welfare. But food stamps and Medicaid are considered
vital entitlements that keep working people off welfare and the
newly employed from slipping back on. And when federal officials
noticed a surprising dip in the number of food stamp recipients
earlier this year, they prodded states to act.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of recent memos, federal officials told states to
conduct ``aggressive outreach'' and regional officers to crack down
on wayward localities. The fear is that local governments may be
blocking access to food stamps and Medicaid as they persuade people
to give up the dole, snatching a valuable crutch from welfare
mothers hobbling toward self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, for instance, drew intense scrutiny earlier this
month with its practice of delaying Medicaid and food stamp
applications until a second visit to the welfare office. (Federal
law requires them to be supplied without delay.)
</P>
<P>
   But officials in some states are also wringing their hands over
computers that sometimes improperly terminate food stamps and
Medicaid benefits. And federal officials want to clear the clouds
of confusion in poor communities where some believe that ending
old-style welfare means an end to all government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the federal government's urgings _ coupled with local
concerns for the poor _ have persuaded some states to do the
unthinkable: vigorously hawk public aid. Maryland, where colorful
brochures about Medicaid and food stamps are stacked in its welfare
waiting rooms, now plans to mail that information to the 2,500
single mothers who leave the welfare rolls each month.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota has sent hundreds of letters to food stamp
recipients to make sure they know about Medicaid. And in Wisconsin,
which has stationed Medicaid and food stamp workers in some
hospitals, Milwaukee is considering revamping its application
process altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting first with workers who discourage

26-year-old diehard ``Star Wars'' fan who took the day off from
work and spent it ducking in and out of three screening rooms
showing the trailer. By 8 p.m., he'd seen it 20 times and was
planning to spend the rest of the night there. ``I've waited 16
years for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another all-day viewer was Jude Lane, who was only 3 when ``Star
Wars'' came out and says it was her first memory. ``No matter what
the color, race, background or religion of the people watching the
trailer, for two minutes and five seconds everyone feels the
same,'' she said. ``You're friends with everybody in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed buzz about ``Star Wars'' has been building since
last year's re-release of the trilogy, which incorporated new
footage and state-of-the-art digital effects. The movies offered
nostalgia for viewers, and some of them brought their own children
to experience the movies on the big screen, and not slice-and-dice
versions on television. Generation X, who once nagged Mom for those
little $1.49 Luke Skywalker action figures, can today choose from
vast array of toys including videos, games, books and a $29.95
CD-ROM titled ``Behind the Magic,'' which serves as a guide to the
``Star Wars'' universe and offers a glimpse of ``The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   But by May all the hype _ from merchandise to advertising _
might work to turn off an already cynical public. ``There are
concerns, certainly in the wake of `Godzilla,''' said Andrew
Hindes, a senior writer at Variety. ``Fox knows they don't have to
overhype this. You can't have more awareness. If they're smart,
they'll be subtle. You could open it cold and it would still be
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' cost Sony Pictures Entertainment $200 million to
make and market globally, but will result in little if any profit.
So far, the original ``Star Wars'' trilogy has made at least $1.7
billion. ``The Phantom Menace,'' the first in another Lucasfilm
trilogy, cost $115 million to make.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if the hype will overshadow ``The Phantom Menace''
itself. If Lucas has stuck with his original vision of the saga,
which was of a simple, feel-good action series full of universal
themes, it might not. Deep down, past all the special effects and
whiz-bang glitz, the director is conjuring with some fundamental
elements of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Star Wars' is not a simple morality play,'' the late Joseph
Campbell, an authority on mythology, wrote. ``It has to do with the
powers of life as they are either fulfilled or broken and
suppressed through the action of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe with this newest episode, the marketing team will resist
the temptation to paste hundreds of posters saying ``Yoda is THIS
tall'' on the sides of street-corner newspaper boxes. If there's a
film that doesn't need too much hype, it would be ``The Phantom
Menace,'' and face it, the Force is already with them.

SECOND ACTS, AND BEYOND: CHECK OUT THE `ME, REBORN' GENERATION

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Looking for a role model for your career? How about Jesse
Ventura, the menacing wrestler turned blustery radio host turned
straight-talking Minnesota governor-elect?
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's election this month may have seemed simply a golden
moment in political eccentricity. But if you wade through the
bulging bookshelf of tomes on the changing nature of careers in
America, Ventura looks like something else as well _ a poster boy
for the new post-downsizing, information-age ethos of creative
reinvention that various deep thinkers trumpet as the new norm in
the American workplace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are striking changes in the economy, psychology
and demography of the country that make Ventura's unlikely path _
and the lure of inspired amateurism _ particularly illustrative.
But how new the ethos of reinvention is, whether it is a trend to
be welcomed or feared and how committed Americans are to it are all
questions worth pondering.
</P>
<P>
   As if taken from books with titles like, ``Career Intelligence:
the 12 New Rules for Work and Life Success,'' Ventura's career
seems crafted from the jargon of the career counseling class: He
sees his career as a lattice, not a ladder. He communicates in
persuasive yet unconventional ways. He thinks about roles, not
jobs, cultivates a broad network and keeps on learning. At 47, he
probably has several zigs and zags left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found a way to take his own authentic self and use it to
reposition himself as a politician,'' said Barbara Moses, head of
BBM Human Resource Consultants of Toronto and the author of
``Career Intelligence'' (Berrett-Koehler, 1998). ``I think of
careers in terms of Legos. You might have a space station, but a
kid takes the space vehicle and uses it at the zoo and then it
becomes an ambulance that takes people to the hospital. The pieces
are reconfigured, but their essential properties have not mutated.
More and more, we do the same thing in our careers.''
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald once mused that, ``There are no second acts
in American lives.'' It may be one of the least persuasive
aphorisms ever to get wide currency.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always had second acts. They have been immigrants
beginning anew. They have left behind families and scrawled ``Gone
to Texas'' on the walls of their houses. Second and third marriages
are routine. And even in the most conventional lives, retirees
leave familiar worlds behind for the Florida sun.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is that so many Americans are now having third and
fourth acts, they are having them later in life and several trends
may be making them unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   First is the aging of the population, the dominant demographic
trend as 76 million baby boomers continue to age into vital,
restless seniors. In 1900, life expectancy in the United States was
49. Today it is 76. People who reach age 55 can expect to live into
their 80s, meaning most will either be working longer or
anticipating a retirement more dynamic and challenging than models
from the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the wave of layoffs and restructurings of the early
1990s. A study by James Medoff, a Harvard economist, found that
workers between the ages of 35 and 54 were 55 percent more likely
to be jobless during the 1990s because of a layoff or job loss than
in the 1970s. The cuts at the nation's biggest companies
obliterated for many the expectation of lifelong employment with a
single employer, and made restructuring and career insecurity a
permanent part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the restructurings that kicked some middle
managers into the cold helped stoke a boom in the stock market that
has left unprecedented numbers of workers and managers able to cash
out and pick up new jobs or lives.
</P>
<P>
   Social expectations have changed too. Workers today seem to be
groping for more personal fulfillment than earlier generations did.
The increasing pace of technological change, the vogue for less
rigid corporate structures and perhaps even millennial ferment are
encouraging the shift toward multiple acts. And in a mass-media
environment, it can help to be a former wrestler campaigning
against two dull suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're jaded,'' said Ms. Moses. ``How do you get someone's
attention when they're tired and distracted? If you're new and
fresh, they don't go yawn yawn, blah blah and turn the page.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, all those factors are creating the golden age of
personal reinvention. Entertainers like Sonny Bono and athletes
like Jim Bunning and Steve Largent go to Congress or, like Bill
Bradley, go to Congress and then go on to something else. John
Glenn goes from astronaut to senator to astronaut (a greenhorn the
second time around because of advances in space-flight technology).
Internet gossip hound Matt Drudge irks journalists by serving up
news as well as innuendo in cyberspace. The great entrepreneurial
successes are Steve Jobs in his garage or Bill Gates dropping out
of Harvard to start Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it comes to health, a lot of people, some motivated by
rising costs, seem to prefer newcomers to medicine over old-line
professionals. A recent study in the Journal of the American
Medical Association reported on the astounding growth of
alternative medicine in the United States, with 83 million people
using some form of alternative medicine, up 47 percent over 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A search of recent news articles turns up a chorus of
reinvention _ the artist turned psychotherapist, the accountant
turned winemaker, the 76-year-old, first-time film director. To
some, the message is that the traditional career path is kaput.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old rules have fallen apart,'' said Marti Smye, author of
``Is It Too Late to Run Away and Join the Circus? A Guide for Your
Second Life'' (Macmillan, 1998). ``You talk to senior team members
at top companies and they're all thinking the same thing: What am I
going to do with my next life?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, new paradigms usually have to coexist with old ones.
Ventura probably won only because his two rivals split the rest of
the vote. The fact is that in politics, as in many other fields,
the game is still rigged in favor of the traditional careerists and
insiders over the amateurs and outsiders. And for every risk taker
nimbly skipping from career rock to career rock, there are nervous
middle managers hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura perhaps represents the glass-half-full aspect of the new
careerism. In a new book, ``Boomernomics'' (Ballantine, 1998),
William Sterling and Stephen Wells posit a future of 10 more
economic boom years and then a debacle as boomers try to sell
investments at the same time and Social Security and Medicare
stagger under the weight of too many aging boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to have to reinvent themselves at later
stages in life than were ever imaginable in the past,'' said
Sterling, an investment strategist with Credit Suisse Asset
Management. ``We're going to be asking more and more people in
their 50s and even their 60s to make employer and even career
changes at a period in the past when they were thinking about which
retirement community to choose. You get into the
old-dogs-and-new-tricks issue.''

FIRST READ THE DIRECTIONS, THEN DO NO HARM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With thousands of new tools and techniques introduced into
medicine each year, doctors face constant pressure to stay abreast
of technology. And savvy patients shop around for those who will
perform the latest procedures advertised in newspapers or discussed
at dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   But what most patients don't know as they're wheeled into the
operating room is how skilled their doctors are with the new
equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first time,
may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or
chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may lack any training, which was the case last year when
two doctors at New York's Beth Israel Medical Center operated on a
30-year-old woman to remove fibroid tumors from her uterus. The
woman, Lisa Smart, died of cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Last week her husband, Anderson, asked that criminal charges be
filed against her doctors, Robert Klinger and Marc Sklar, and David
Myers, a salesman for Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which manufactured the
equipment involved. A New York state Health Department report said
that Myers operated the equipment, and the New York state Education
Department, which licenses doctors, found evidence that his
activities amounted to practicing medicine without a license. The
Education Department has recommended that Myers be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The case has prompted many hospitals around the country to
examine their policies on continuing education for doctors. But it
is not the first time mastery of new medical technology has been
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s seven patients in New York died and 151 were
injured during gall bladder surgery because their doctors were
inadequately trained in using a laparoscope. One doctor had
received no formal instruction; others one- or two-day seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Education Department and the American Medical
Association have each developed guidelines recommending that
doctors take courses on new equipment and procedures and that they
demonstrate proficiency under the supervision of more experienced
doctors before they operate alone.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, however, are not legal requirements. Hospitals
and surgical clinic set their own standards. Dr. Randolph Smoak,
chairman of the AMA board, said the rules of most organizations are
not as strict as the association's. Other doctors agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that if you're practicing in a remote area in a
small department, it could be difficult to keep up with new
technology and establish standards,'' said Dr. Frederic Frigoletto,
chairman of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not restricted to remote places, said an
orthopedic surgeon at a New York hospital who asked not to be
identified. ``I'm not sure that teaching hospitals necessarily have
a better reputation for physician training than clinics or
community hospitals,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, there are probably
doctors who do cases that are beyond their capability and
expertise. And there are probably doctors who rely on sales reps
more than they should for training.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling detail from the Beth Israel incident
is that a salesman was in the operating room. In fact, salesmen
attend operations routinely, usually at the request of doctors
using new devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an accepted and acceptable practice to have service reps
there to provide information when there's new equipment,'' said
Susan Waltman, senior vice president and general counsel for the
Greater New York Hospital Association; she compared the presence of
a sales representative in surgery to that of a computer technician
in the office. The representatives receive thorough training in the
equipment they sell, she said, often by doctors. Every hospital has
a different policy on what the salesman can do, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the individual must be outside the surgical field
and not touching the patient,'' she said, but the salesman might be
allowed to operate the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than once I've seen a salesman say, `Doctor, I wouldn't
start the machine that high,''' said Dr. Martin Weisberg, clinical
associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia. ``The salesman might say that
it's not safe to go above 50, or that it's OK to go to 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoak, a surgeon, said he has seen representatives instruct
surgeons on inserting pacemakers. ``Occasionally, if we're having a
little trouble getting a pacemaker to maintain its position, a
salesman may suggest something that's worked elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors do not tell patients when a salesman will be present
during their surgery. The New York state Health Department wants to
change that. ``Obviously, this is an infringement of privacy,''
said Frances Tarlton, a department spokeswoman. The department will
soon send a statement to hospitals directing them to inform
patients if a salesman is present, as well as which procedure will
be done and by which health professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for surgeons to discuss these things
with patients so that they can accept or reject the procedure,''
Smoak said. If doctors are not forthcoming, he urges patients to
keep asking questions.

expertise. And there are probably doctors who rely on sales reps
more than they should for training.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling detail from the Beth Israel incident
is that a salesman was in the operating room. In fact, salesmen
attend operations routinely, usually at the request of doctors
using new devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an accepted and acceptable practice to have service reps
there to provide information when there's new equipment,'' said
Susan Waltman, senior vice president and general counsel for the
Greater New York Hospital Association; she compared the presence of
a sales representative in surgery to that of a computer technician
in the office. The representatives receive thorough training in the
equipment they sell, she said, often by doctors. Every hospital has
a different policy on what the salesman can do, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the individual must be outside the surgical field
and not touching the patient,'' she said, but the salesman might be
allowed to operate the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than once I've seen a salesman say, `Doctor, I wouldn't
start the machine that high,''' said Dr. Martin Weisberg, clinical
associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia. ``The salesman might say that
it's not safe to go above 50, or that it's OK to go to 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoak, a surgeon, said he has seen representatives instruct
surgeons on inserting pacemakers. ``Occasionally, if we're having a
little trouble getting a pacemaker to maintain its position, a
salesman may suggest something that's worked elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors do not tell patients when a salesman will be present
during their surgery. The New York state Health Department wants to
change that. ``Obviously, this is an infringement of privacy,''
said Frances Tarlton, a department spokeswoman. The department will
soon send a statement to hospitals directing them to inform
patients if a salesman is present, as well as which procedure will
be done and by which health professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for surgeons to discuss these things
with patients so that they can accept or reject the procedure,''
Smoak said. If doctors are not forthcoming, he urges patients to
keep asking questions.

THE CASE (IF ANY) AGAINST THE PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

   WASHINGTON _ As the Judiciary Committee hearing wore on into the
night last Thursday, Kenneth Starr came to resemble not so much a
congressional witness as a defendant in the dock. It was a display
of how much President Clinton's supporters have succeeded in
turning the issue before the nation from the impeachability of the
president to the behavior of Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   When David Kendall, the president's lawyer, questioned him near
the end of the hearing, Starr was goaded into shedding his Mr.
Rogers-goes-to-Congress-to-explain-things manner. Instead, he was
briefly reduced to indignant denials. And, although Kendall is the
president's defense lawyer, he did not spend a moment of his
allotted hour defending the president.
</P>
<P>
   There was really only The Case Against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The main arguments about the behavior and approach of Starr and
his associates concern how they have treated witnesses, notably
Monica Lewinsky, and whether they leaked confidential grand jury
proceedings. Critics have also raised other issues, including
whether Starr was involved improperly in Paula Corbin Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to portray Starr as vindictive and
unprofessional, Democrats have hinted darkly that Starr broke some
rule or violated some law. But the rules that govern prosecutorial
conduct are, for the most part, vaguely worded exhortations and
proscriptions in bar association manuals and Justice Department
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Charles Wolfram of the Cornell Law School, an
authority in legal ethics, said the rules about prosecutorial
misconduct are inherently vague and have been intentionally left
that way by the courts. ``Courts continually say that it is not the
behavior of the prosecutor that should be put on trial unless
there's something really extraordinary that happens,'' he said.
Moreover, he said, ``you never get a sharp definition of what these
vaguely orded guidelines mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Starr have been lobbed in the highly
specialized and partisan context of an impeachment proceeding, an
atmosphere with the subtlety of, say, Monday Night Football. In
such a proceeding, Wolfram said, the nuances of Starr's behavior
matter far less than broad impressions about whether he is fair.
``He can't just be another prosecutor playing fast and loose with
the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for perceptions, Starr suffered a blow Friday when
Samuel Dash abruptly resigned as his ethics adviser. The presence
of Dash, who was counsel to the Senate Watergate committee in 1973,
lent an air of rectitude to Starr's operation. Dash praised Starr's
overall conduct, but said that he had overstepped his bounds by
becoming an advocate for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But just as everyday prosecutors are rarely punished for
wrongdoing, Starr and his deputies are largely immune from penalty
even if some of the charges against them prove true. As an
independent counsel, he is chiefly the judge of his own behavior,
although he could be fired for misconduct by Attorney General Janet
Reno. She has shown little interest so far in complaints from the
White House about Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The area in which the guidelines are the most explicit and the
issue that may pose the greatest threat to Starr is the allegation
that his office improperly leaked grand jury information. The
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure flatly prohibit prosecutors
from disclosing grand jury matters.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that 24 news
accounts about the investigation of President Clinton appear to
show that prosecutors in Starr's office discussed grand jury
matters with reporters. The judge described the articles and
broadcasts as ``serious and repetitive'' evidence that Starr and
his staff may have violated the law. As a result, Starr now has to
prove that his office was not responsible for any of those 24 news
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue produced the liveliest moments in the Starr-Kendall
confrontation Thursday night. Kendall read from some of the news
accounts, noting that they included phrases like, ``sources in
Starr's office tell us,'' ``sources near Starr,'' and ``prosecutors
suggest.'' He then asked, ``Does the media make up these quotes,
Mr. Starr?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr replied, ``I'm not here to accuse the media of anything,''
adding that the matter was under litigation and it was unfair to
raise it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall countered, ``Mr. Starr, in fact, there has been no case
remotely similar to this in terms of the massive leaking from the
prosecutor's office, and I think we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr replied: ``I totally disagree with that. That's an
accusation and it's an unfair accusation. I completely reject it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Johnson were to find that Starr or his deputies
improperly disclosed grand jury materials, they could face
sanctions. The Judge could formally censure anyone in Starr's
office found to have violated the law, a significant blow to a
legal career.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also defended himself against charges that Ms. Lewinsky
was mistreated when his prosecutors first confronted her in a
suburban Virginia hotel last January. She told a grand jury she was
threatened, detained and discouraged from calling her lawyer or her
mother. ``You're 24, you're smart,'' she said a prosecutor told
her. ``You're old enough. You don't need to call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   However heavy-handed those comments might have been, the issue
that might run afoul of ethics guidelines is whether the
prosecutors tried to engage her as a witness after she asked to
speak to her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Rule 4.2 the American Bar Association Model Rules of
Professional Conduct, lawyers, including prosecutors, may not talk
directly to someone who might be involved in litigation or an
investigation if they know that person is represented by a lawyer.
A separate bar association manual on criminal matters makes it even
clearer that prosecutors should step aside immediately when they
learn someone they are interviewing is represented by a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened there was very improper,'' said Professor
Geoffrey Hazard of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. The
issue was so basic, he said, that even people whose only
information comes from television shows know that prosecutors are
not supposed to talk to subjects of an investigation once it's
clear they have a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Professor Bob Tuttle of the George Washington University Law
School said the situation is far from clear and that Starr may not
be bound by those guidelines. The manual for prosecutors is only
advisory, he said, and the Justice Department has long resisted
efforts to make the model code apply to its prosecutors. Congress
has approved legislation requiring the Justice Department to adhere
to the model code, he said, but it takes effect late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr is independent from the Justice Department, the
law authorizing his appointment provides that he must adhere to
department guidelines whenever possible. But Starr made clear that
he believed the guidelines were not an issue because Ms. Lewinsky's
perception that she was being threatened was inaccurate, and
because she had been free to leave the hotel at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used traditional law enforcement techniques,'' he said in
response to charges that the prosecutors threatened Ms. Lewinsky
with 27 years in jail and her mother's imprisonment. In fact, such
threats are common in the hard-edged world of modern prosecutors.
And he said his prosecutors did not have to allow Ms. Lewinsky to
contact her lawyer because he represented her in a civil matter,
the Paula Jones case, not a criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   On only one point did Starr give some ground. He conceded that
his agents may have gone too far if, as alleged, they went to the
school of a 16-year-old in Arkansas to serve a subpoena on him.

NETANYAHU AND HIS PARTY TURN AWAY FROM `GREATER ISRAEL' 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating or all needing.  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For well over half a century, the political contours
of the Zionist movement and Israel have been defined by a division
between those who are prepared to share the biblical Jewish
homeland with the Arabs, and those who claim it all.
</P>
<P>
   At Israel's founding in 1948, the Labor Zionist leadership,
which went on to govern Israel in its first three decades of
independence, accepted a pragmatic partition of what had been
British Palestine into independent Jewish and Arab states. The
opposition Revisionist Zionists, who evolved into today's Likud
party, sought ``Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema'' _ Greater Israel, or
literally, the Whole Land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the years that followed, that basic divergence in
outlook continued to define the difference between Labor and Likud,
the two principal movements in Israeli politics. Even after the
Camp David accords of 1978, the Oslo accords of 1993, and the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of Hebron last year, it was
still possible to think that a Likud government might halt or
reverse the process of turning over West Bank land to Arab control.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal
act of closing that historical political divide. At the instigation
of Likud's most important leaders, it approved the latest
Israeli-Palestinian accord by a large majority that crossed party
lines, and sanctioned a handover of territory that will leave the
Palestinians in full or partial control of 40 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the vote took the dream of a Greater Israel out of
the political mainstream and relegated it to the margins of Israeli
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The death knell of Greater Israel was barely audible during a
raucous late-night vote boycotted by several Cabinet members from
the Likud. It was left to Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, long a
champion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and a vocal opponent
of territorial compromise, to acknowledge the enormous shift that
had occurred in his political camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of another nation that would have given up areas
linked to its historical heritage,'' Sharon declared, ``but we in
the government had to decide whether we want to make a real and
honest effort to reach arrangements that may bring peace between us
and our neighbors. The government's response was yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of pragmatism blurred traditional distinctions.
Likud, despite defections, had joined Labor in accepting the
inevitability of territorial compromise, and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu worked to get the agreement passed in de facto
alliance with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approval of the agreement, which transfers significant areas
to the Palestinian Authority, has historic value because it will be
carried out by a government of the right,' the newspaper Haaretz
commented in an editorial. ``It will be difficult in the future to
go back to a policy of Greater Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   This was, of course, anathema to hard-core followers of Vladimir
Jabotinsky, the founder of the Revisionist movement, who in 1937
declared that partition would be ``the death of humanitarian
Zionism'' because it would leave no room for millions of Jewish
immigrants fleeing persecution, and would make a Jewish state
indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Likud party is virtually nonexistent,'' lamented Yitzhak
Shamir, a former prime minister who was a leader of the Irgun, a
Revisionist underground during the British Mandate in Palestine.
``Nothing is left of what was our backbone: the principle that the
Land of Israel is indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary as it may seem, Likud's abandonment of its
maximalist vision has in fact been evolving for years.
</P>
<P>
   The seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud brought
his party to power for the first time in a stunning election
victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli
troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by
overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ever since, Begin had
preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria (the
West Bank lands) and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did
not annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office,
reflecting a recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn
Israel it into a binational state instead of a Jewish one.
</P>
<P>
   After Egyptian President Anwar Sadat visited Israel in 1977,
Begin proposed autonomy for the Palestinians, suggesting that the
question of ultimate sovereignty over the occupied territories be
set aside. The plan lacked a territorial dimension, offering the
Palestinians administration of their own affairs under Israeli
rule, but it signaled an early readiness to acknowledge competing
claims to the same land.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1978 Camp David accords with Egypt, Begin took a further
step, agreeing to negotiate a transitional period of Palestinian
self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a final
agreement on those areas with Egypt, Jordan and Palestinian
representatives. Yet Begin continued to encourage Jewish settlement
in the occupied territories in an effort to block any possibility
of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Shamir, who succeeded Begin, sat face-to-face with Palestinian
representatives from the territories at the 1991 Middle East peace
talks in Madrid, even as they consulted more or less openly with
leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, in turn, committed himself during his election
campaign to honor the 1993 Oslo accord on Palestinian self-rule
signed by the previous Labor government, effectively assenting to a
withdrawal in the West Bank. He then signed on to the process
himself in the 1997 Hebron agreement, which set the terms for a
pullout from most of the city and for further Israeli withdrawals
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy is a combination of vision and reality, and we have
come to terms with reality,'' said Dan Meridor, a Likud lawmaker
who was a close aide to Begin and served in Netanyahu's Cabinet.
``The new line of the Likud is that we are going for a compromise,
but let's fight for every inch we can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a black or white picture any more,'' Meridor added.
``The question now isn't whether to compromise or not, but what
sort of compromise, how big or how small. We're more like America,
where the issue is who is more hawkish or dovish.''
</P>
<P>
   As ideological differences over the price of peace fade,
conventional labels of right and left could grow increasingly
irrelevant, giving way to new political alignments. Disputes
between secular and religious Israelis, gaps between rich and poor
and tensions between Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews have already
emerged as defining issues for powerful political constituencies.
``The political map no longer reflects the real divisions in
Israeli society,'' Meridor said.
</P>
<P>
   Avishai Margalit, a prominent Israeli political philosopher,
said that after the latest accord, the public seemed to be shifting
its attention from peacemaking to more mundane matters that impact
directly on the quality of daily life, such as health services,
economic opportunity and local politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the era of post peace, as if peace has already been
achieved,'' Margalit said. ``The public perception is that the
ideological debate has been decided, the Likud has accepted
compromise, and now it's just up to the lawyers to hammer out the
percentages. We've already bought the apartment.''

opposition Revisionist Zionists, who evolved into today's Likud
party, sought ``Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema'' _ Greater Israel, or
literally, the Whole Land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the years that followed, that basic divergence in
outlook continued to define the difference between Labor and Likud,
the two principal movements in Israeli politics. Even after the
Camp David accords of 1978, the Oslo accords of 1993, and the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of Hebron last year, it was
still possible to think that a Likud government might halt or
reverse the process of turning over West Bank land to Arab control.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal
act of closing that historical political divide. At the instigation
of Likud's most important leaders, it approved the latest
Israeli-Palestinian accord by a large majority that crossed party
lines, and sanctioned a handover of territory that will leave the
Palestinians in full or partial control of 40 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the vote took the dream of a Greater Israel out of
the political mainstream and relegated it to the margins of Israeli
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The death knell of Greater Israel was barely audible during a
raucous late-night vote boycotted by several Cabinet members from
the Likud. It was left to Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, long a
champion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and a vocal opponent
of territorial compromise, to acknowledge the enormous shift that
had occurred in his political camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of another nation that would have given up areas
linked to its historical heritage,'' Sharon declared, ``but we in
the government had to decide whether we want to make a real and
honest effort to reach arrangements that may bring peace between us
and our neighbors. The government's response was yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of pragmatism blurred traditional distinctions.
Likud, despite defections, had joined Labor in accepting the
inevitability of territorial compromise, and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu worked to get the agreement passed in de facto
alliance with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approval of the agreement, which transfers significant areas
to the Palestinian Authority, has historic value because it will be
carried out by a government of the right,' the newspaper Haaretz
commented in an editorial. ``It will be difficult in the future to
go back to a policy of Greater Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   This was, of course, anathema to hard-core followers of Vladimir
Jabotinsky, the founder of the Revisionist movement, who in 1937
declared that partition would be ``the death of humanitarian
Zionism'' because it would leave no room for millions of Jewish
immigrants fleeing persecution, and would make a Jewish state
indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Likud party is virtually nonexistent,'' lamented Yitzhak
Shamir, a former prime minister who was a leader of the Irgun, a
Revisionist underground during the British Mandate in Palestine.
``Nothing is left of what was our backbone: the principle that the
Land of Israel is indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary as it may seem, Likud's abandonment of its
maximalist vision has in fact been evolving for years.
</P>
<P>
   The seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud brought
his party to power for the first time in a stunning election
victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli
troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by
overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ever since, Begin had
preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria (the
West Bank lands) and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did
not annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office,
reflecting a recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn
Israel it into a binational state instead of a Jewish one.
</P>
<P>
   After Egyptian President Anwar Sadat visited Israel in 1977,
Begin proposed autonomy for the Palestinians, suggesting that the
question of ultimate sovereignty over the occupied territories be
set aside. The plan lacked a territorial dimension, offering the
Palestinians administration of their own affairs under Israeli
rule, but it signaled an early readiness to acknowledge competing
claims to the same land.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1978 Camp David accords with Egypt, Begin took a further
step, agreeing to negotiate a transitional period of Palestinian
self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a final
agreement on those areas with Egypt, Jordan and Palestinian
representatives. Yet Begin continued to encourage Jewish settlement
in the occupied territories in an effort to block any possibility
of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Shamir, who succeeded Begin, sat face-to-face with Palestinian
representatives from the territories at the 1991 Middle East peace
talks in Madrid, even as they consulted more or less openly with
leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, in turn, committed himself during his election
campaign to honor the 1993 Oslo accord on Palestinian self-rule
signed by the previous Labor government, effectively assenting to a
withdrawal in the West Bank. He then signed on to the process
himself in the 1997 Hebron agreement, which set the terms for a
pullout from most of the city and for further Israeli withdrawals
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy is a combination of vision and reality, and we have
come to terms with reality,'' said Dan Meridor, a Likud lawmaker
who was a close aide to Begin and served in Netanyahu's Cabinet.
``The new line of the Likud is that we are going for a compromise,
but let's fight for every inch we can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a black or white picture any more,'' Meridor added.
``The question now isn't whether to compromise or not, but what
sort of compromise, how big or how small. We're more like America,
where the issue is who is more hawkish or dovish.''
</P>
<P>
   As ideological differences over the price of peace fade,
conventional labels of right and left could grow increasingly
irrelevant, giving way to new political alignments. Disputes
between secular and religious Israelis, gaps between rich and poor
and tensions between Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews have already
emerged as defining issues for powerful political constituencies.
``The political map no longer reflects the real divisions in
Israeli society,'' Meridor said.
</P>
<P>
   Avishai Margalit, a prominent Israeli political philosopher,
said that after the latest accord, the public seemed to be shifting
its attention from peacemaking to more mundane matters that impact
directly on the quality of daily life, such as health services,
economic opportunity and local politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the era of post peace, as if peace has already been
achieved,'' Margalit said. ``The public perception is that the
ideological debate has been decided, the Likud has accepted
compromise, and now it's just up to the lawyers to hammer out the
percentages. We've already bought the apartment.''

for Sunday, Nov. 22, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds STARR-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   (`a' category) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at The Case Against Kenneth
Starr. The main arguments about the behavior and approach of Starr
and his associates concern how they have treated witnesses, notably
Monica Lewinsky, and whether they leaked confidential grand jury
proceedings. Critics have also raised other issues, including
whether Starr was involved improperly in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-EQUIPMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With thousands of new tools
and techniques introduced into medicine each year, doctors face
constant pressure to stay abreast of technology. And savvy patients
shop around for those who will perform the latest procedures
advertised in newspapers or discussed at dinner parties. But what
most patients don't know is how skilled their doctors are with the
new equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first
time, may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or
chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative. By Susan
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have always had
second acts. They have been immigrants beginning anew. They have
left behind families and scrawled ``Gone to Texas'' on the walls of
their houses. They have moved like gypsies and even in the most
conventional lives, have left their familiar world behind for a new
life at La Boca Vista in the Florida sun. What is new is that so
many Americans are now having third and fourth and fifth acts, they
are having them later in life and numerous trends may be making
them unavoidable. By Peter Applebome. (There is also an abridged
version of this story, EXP-LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW (Undated) _ For ``Star Wars''
enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview
announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into
theaters around the country to watch it over and over again. It was
the two-minute trailer for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the
``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May
21, 1999. By J.D. Biersdorfer. (There is also an abridged version
of this story, EXP-STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Despite an overall tightening of
welfare, the federal government is prodding many state and local
governments to encourage poor people to apply for food stamps and
Medicaid. The fear is that governments may be blocking access to
such aid programs, which are considered vital entitlements that
keep working people off welfare and the newly-employed from
slipping back on. By Rachel L. Swarns. (There is also an abridged
version of this story, EXP-WELFARE-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REACTIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The market is made up of two
voices. One that votes with its funds, another that worries over
the economic data. The gulf between these two voices is wider now
than it has been in a long time. By Gretchen Morgnson.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBER-THREAT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What to do when a bomber calls:
a checklist from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco abnd Firearms.

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.

<P>
   (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Diplomatic etiquette,
though, has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies list
from the White House rooftop. But last week, driven by frustration,
or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the
Clinton administration yelled out loud, twice. In dramatically
different situations, in opposite corners of the world, the U.S.
spoke loudly because it can't find a stick. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ARABS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ For many decades, the
political contours of the Zionist movement and Israel have been
defined by a division between those who are prepared to share the
Biblical Jewish homeland with the Arabs, and those who claim it
all. Last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal
act of closing that historical political divide. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-REVIEW (Santiago) _ The controversy here over Britain's
arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet represents what may well be the
most serious test of Chile's transition to democracy since Pinochet
left the presidency eight years ago. But the fact that the reaction
was not as explosive as it might have been suggests how much Chile
has calmed in recent years, after decades of inflamed passions. By
Clifford Krauss.

   For U.N. Inspectors, It's Back to Iraq
</P>
<P>
   International arms inspectors went back to work in Iraq, at
least to restart a system interrupted by Iraqi bans and the
withdrawal of monitors in advance of expected American bombing.
Short-notice inspections of new sites awaited the formation of
expert teams from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Saddam Hussein's controlled press went on
attacking the chief inspector, Richard Butler, an outspoken
Australian, and dropped hints that his new teams might hit some old
walls when the toughest inspections resume.

   The Fed Decides To Take No Chances
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has rebounded in the last few months, and the
global financial crisis seems to have eased. But the Federal
Reserve remained sufficiently concerned about the economic outlook
for the United States that it cut interest rates for the third time
in two months.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-point cut may have been the Fed's last move for a
while, though. The central bank said it thinks rates are now at a
level that should help the economy grow at a healthy pace.

   A Light Show In the Night Sky
</P>
<P>
   For most meteor fanciers, the Leonid show Tuesday night was
mediocre; at most, some 2,000 shooting stars blazed across the sky
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Storms of Leonid meteors _ tiny fragments of Comet Tuttle-Tempel
moving at 155,000 miles an hour _ tend to hit the Earth's
atmosphere at intervals of about 33 years, and this year there were
hopes of celestial fireworks as impressive as those of a vintage
year: 1966.
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be, although the show was better than those of
most off-years, and viewers in some places (the Canary Islands,
among others) saw some spectacular fireballs. After the storm,
worried operators of the 600 or so communications, surveillance,
scientific and navigation satellites that orbit the Earth were
relieved to learn that their costly spacecraft apparently escaped
damage.

   Meanwhile, Out West, Microsoft Loses a Round
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, the main event is its antitrust showdown with the
Justice Department in Washington, but that isn't the only stage on
which allegations that it engaged in anticompetitive practices are
being heard. The company suffered a stinging legal setback in
Silicon Valley when a federal judge in San Jose told the computer
software giant it could no longer ship Internet software that
violated its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems. The judge
gave Microsoft 90 days to modify its products.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Justice Department case, the Sun Microsystems suit
focuses on Microsoft's business practices and includes allegations
that Microsoft tried to undermine the challenge posed by a
competitor _ in this case, Sun's Java Internet programming
language. It did this, according to the Sun suit, by illegally
altering the Java software it licensed from Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is calling this a breach of contract. Nonsense, Microsoft
has answered, insisting it was merely trying to improve Sun's buggy
software.

   A New Blow To Affirmative Action
</P>
<P>
   The national debate over affirmative action in education moved
from the realm of higher education to the public-school level when
a three-judge federal appeals panel in Boston struck down racial
preferences at Boston Latin School, the city's top public high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Although the use of race in university admissions was barred two
years ago by a federal appeals court in a case involving the
University of Texas, the situation in which public schools found
themselves was considered more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for example, the public schools had operated for
years under judicial orders to achieve racial integration. Today,
Boston Latin selects half its students only on exam scores and
grades, with the other half of admissions weighted according to
race.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in a case brought by a father whose white child did
not get into Boston Latin, is expected to be draw intense interest
nationally.

<P>
   A New Kind Of Space Flight
</P>
<P>
   A new era in human space exploration opened as another closed,
both with great fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years ago, mankind's first steps off its planet began
as rival nations sought to prove their superiority. The Soviet
Union stunned the world in 1961 when Yuri Gagarin became the first
human to orbit the Earth. Ten months later, the United States sent
John Glenn up to circle the Earth three times and become a national
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, New York celebrated Glenn's recent space shuttle flight
by reprising the tickertape parade given him 36 years before. It
seemed fitting that a man made famous by the space race would be
there as it ended.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all future shuttle flights are devoted not to the U.S.
space program, but to building an international space station
sponsored by 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment of that station was launched by Russia Friday
from the Baikonur base in Kazakhstan, from which Gagarin made his
flight. The project essentially combines the world's piloted space
programs, turning competitors into colleagues.

   A Landmark's Second Chance
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years ago it became one of the most infamous towers
in the country when a student, Charles Whitman, barricaded himself
on the observation deck of the 307-foot University of Texas clock
tower and started spraying gunfire at passersby below. By the time
police killed him an hour and a half later, 14 people were dead and
31 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, in 1975, after a series of suicides by people
jumping from the observation deck, the university decided to close
the tower to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Now the university has announced that it will reopen the tower _
after installing iron barriers to deter suicides and assigning
security personnel to accompany visitors to the observation deck.
</P>
<P>
   A New Tobacco Deal
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest tobacco companies agreed to a deal with
state attorneys general under which they would pay $206 billion
over 25 years to the states in exchange for ending state lawsuits
against cigarette makers based on health costs associated with
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a scaled-back version of a $368.5 million settlement
plan announced last year that would have included measures like
federal nicotine regulation and an assessment of fines on the
companies if youth smoking did not decline. That plan was derailed
when Congress did not go along.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, with its more modest goals, does not require
congressional approval. It includes financing for campaigns to
deter youth smoking; cigarette makers also agreed to stop some
marketing practices, including the use of billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers 46 states that have sued the industry for
reimbursement, or are in a position to sue. The other four have
settled cases against cigarette makers based on the cost of
treating tobacco-related illness.

   The New Alamo Battle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History is a blood sport in Texas, with the latest battle over a
diary by a disgruntled 19th century Mexican officer. Among other
things, Jose Enrique de la Pena, who fought on the winning side at
the Alamo, said that Davy Crockett did not go down swinging, as
popular myth would have it, but was captured and tortured to death.
And not before trying to talk his way out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional historians who have looked at the diary
believe it is genuine, pointing to tests on the age of the paper
and corroborating accounts. But others, many of them Alamo
hobbyists, believe just as fervently that it's a fake, citing
apparent anachronisms and plagiarisms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pro-diary forces have won a round; the papers fetched
$350,000 at a Los Angeles auction when a pair of anonymous Texans
bought them to make sure the diary stays in the state.

   Freeh Sends a Signal. Or Does He?
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh's inner circle has always regarded him
as a potential Republican candidate back home in New York, although
Freeh has shrugged off talk of a political future, citing his
10-year term, which expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Now things may be changing. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is
retiring, and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may enter the
race for Moynihan's seat. And Freeh has kick-started gossip in the
capital by inviting former President George Bush to be keynote
speaker at the FBI's 90th anniversary celebration at Constitution
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Some of President Clinton's political appointees at the Justice
Department winced at the selection of Bush, but said ruefully that
Freeh has often seemed eager to distance himself from the
Democratic president who appointed him.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Freeh's career has had a succession of Republican
patrons: Giuliani, who as U.S. attorney in New York made Freeh a
top prosecutor; Richard Thornburgh, who as attorney general had
Freeh lead a high-profile prosecution, and Bush, who as president
appointed Freeh a federal judge.

   Most Valuable. But to Whom?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the nation's baseball writers voted on Thursday to give the
National League's Most Valuable Player award to the Chicago Cubs
slugger Sammy Sosa rather than the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark
McGwire, they underscored how malleable the term ``value'' is in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he obliterated Roger Maris' record with 70 home runs
and was an unquestionably superior offensive force, McGwire lost
out to Sosa because he played on a mediocre team while Sosa led his
Cubs to a wild-card playoff berth. Some writers listed McGwire
sixth or seventh on their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Which focuses attention on a question left unanswered by the
award: most valuable to whom?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not to the popularity of sport itself, in which case
McGwire would have won (or at least shared the prize with Sosa).
</P>
<P>
   And apparently not necessarily to the player's team. On the one
hand, McGwire, this year seems to have been so stigmatized by the
company he kept that the writers ignored the fact that he was his
team's greatest strength. On the other hand, McGwire just can't
catch a break. Playing for the Oakland Athletics in 1987, he tied
for the major league lead with 49 home runs but finished just sixth
in the most-valuable-player vote.
</P>
<P>
   The other player with 49 home runs that year won the award _
Andre Dawson of the Cubs, who finished in last place.

   For U.N. Inspectors, It's Back to Iraq
</P>
<P>
   International arms inspectors went back to work in Iraq, at
least to restart a system interrupted by Iraqi bans and the
withdrawal of monitors in advance of expected American bombing.
Short-notice inspections of new sites awaited the formation of
expert teams from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Saddam Hussein's controlled press went on
attacking the chief inspector, Richard Butler, an outspoken
Australian, and dropped hints that his new teams might hit some old
walls when the toughest inspections resume.

   The Fed Decides To Take No Chances
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has rebounded in the last few months, and the
global financial crisis seems to have eased. But the Federal
Reserve remained sufficiently concerned about the economic outlook
for the United States that it cut interest rates for the third time
in two months.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-point cut may have been the Fed's last move for a
while, though. The central bank said it thinks rates are now at a
level that should help the economy grow at a healthy pace.

   A Light Show In the Night Sky
</P>
<P>
   For most meteor fanciers, the Leonid show Tuesday night was
mediocre; at most, some 2,000 shooting stars blazed across the sky
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Storms of Leonid meteors _ tiny fragments of Comet Tuttle-Tempel
moving at 155,000 miles an hour _ tend to hit the Earth's
atmosphere at intervals of about 33 years, and this year there were
hopes of celestial fireworks as impressive as those of a vintage
year: 1966.
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be, although the show was better than those of
most off-years, and viewers in some places (the Canary Islands,
among others) saw some spectacular fireballs. After the storm,
worried operators of the 600 or so communications, surveillance,
scientific and navigation satellites that orbit the Earth were
relieved to learn that their costly spacecraft apparently escaped
damage.

   Meanwhile, Out West, Microsoft Loses a Round
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, the main event is its antitrust showdown with the
Justice Department in Washington, but that isn't the only stage on
which allegations that it engaged in anticompetitive practices are
being heard. The company suffered a stinging legal setback in
Silicon Valley when a federal judge in San Jose told the computer
software giant it could no longer ship Internet software that
violated its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems. The judge
gave Microsoft 90 days to modify its products.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Justice Department case, the Sun Microsystems suit
focuses on Microsoft's business practices and includes allegations
that Microsoft tried to undermine the challenge posed by a
competitor _ in this case, Sun's Java Internet programming
language. It did this, according to the Sun suit, by illegally
altering the Java software it licensed from Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is calling this a breach of contract. Nonsense, Microsoft
has answered, insisting it was merely trying to improve Sun's buggy
software.

   A New Blow To Affirmative Action
</P>
<P>
   The national debate over affirmative action in education moved
from the realm of higher education to the public-school level when
a three-judge federal appeals panel in Boston struck down racial
preferences at Boston Latin School, the city's top public high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Although the use of race in university admissions was barred two
years ago by a federal appeals court in a case involving the
University of Texas, the situation in which public schools found
themselves was considered more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for example, the public schools had operated for
years under judicial orders to achieve racial integration. Today,
Boston Latin selects half its students only on exam scores and
grades, with the other half of admissions weighted according to
race.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in a case brought by a father whose white child did
not get into Boston Latin, is expected to be draw intense interest
nationally.

<P>
   A New Kind Of Space Flight
</P>
<P>
   A new era in human space exploration opened as another closed,
both with great fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years ago, mankind's first steps off its planet began
as rival nations sought to prove their superiority. The Soviet
Union stunned the world in 1961 when Yuri Gagarin became the first
human to orbit the Earth. Ten months later, the United States sent
John Glenn up to circle the Earth three times and become a national
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, New York celebrated Glenn's recent space shuttle flight
by reprising the tickertape parade given him 36 years before. It
seemed fitting that a man made famous by the space race would be
there as it ended.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all future shuttle flights are devoted not to the U.S.
space program, but to building an international space station
sponsored by 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment of that station was launched by Russia Friday
from the Baikonur base in Kazakhstan, from which Gagarin made his
flight. The project essentially combines the world's piloted space
programs, turning competitors into colleagues.

   A Landmark's Second Chance
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years ago it became one of the most infamous towers
in the country when a student, Charles Whitman, barricaded himself
on the observation deck of the 307-foot University of Texas clock
tower and started spraying gunfire at passersby below. By the time
police killed him an hour and a half later, 14 people were dead and
31 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, in 1975, after a series of suicides by people
jumping from the observation deck, the university decided to close
the tower to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Now the university has announced that it will reopen the tower _
after installing iron barriers to deter suicides and assigning
security personnel to accompany visitors to the observation deck.
</P>
<P>
   A New Tobacco Deal
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest tobacco companies agreed to a deal with
state attorneys general under which they would pay $206 billion
over 25 years to the states in exchange for ending state lawsuits
against cigarette makers based on health costs associated with
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a scaled-back version of a $368.5 million settlement
plan announced last year that would have included measures like
federal nicotine regulation and an assessment of fines on the
companies if youth smoking did not decline. That plan was derailed
when Congress did not go along.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, with its more modest goals, does not require
congressional approval. It includes financing for campaigns to
deter youth smoking; cigarette makers also agreed to stop some
marketing practices, including the use of billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers 46 states that have sued the industry for
reimbursement, or are in a position to sue. The other four have
settled cases against cigarette makers based on the cost of
treating tobacco-related illness.

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Snapshots from Chile: Shortly after Gen.
Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London five weeks ago on a Spanish
warrant, neighborhood officials cut off garbage pickups at the
Spanish and British embassies here. But a couple of days later
cooler heads prevailed and garbage removal resumed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A portly right-wing senator, declaring his solidarity with
``the savior of our nation,'' announced that he was going on a
hunger strike until the general was released. But when legal
proceedings bogged down in London, he quietly succumbed to his
hunger pangs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exactly one month after the general's arrest, Walter Riesco,
president of the Confederation of Production and Commerce, publicly
warned that if the former dictator is extradited to Spain, ``the
situation in Chile will once again become unsustainable.'' On the
same day, the Chilean stock market climbed, contributing to a
sustained rally that has lifted the market's index more than 20
percent since Pinochet was detained.
</P>
<P>
   Such touches of whimsy have offered more than welcome respites
from what may well be the most serious test of Chile's transition
to democracy since Pinochet left the presidential palace eight
years ago. They suggest how much Chile has calmed in recent years,
after decades of inflamed passions stirred first by the chaotic
lunge toward socialism by the government of President Salvador
Allende, followed by the deadly coup in 1973 that propelled
Pinochet to power and began 17 years of brutal repression.
</P>
<P>
   The general's arrest provoked demonstrations by rightist and
leftist activists in which eggs and rocks were thrown, but these
have lost steam with nobody having been killed or seriously
injured. Some politicians have received death threats. But the
police and armed forces have remained disciplined for the most
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the country as very, very stable,'' said Ricardo Israel,
chairman of the political science department at the University of
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The relative calm presents a contrast to the last few times
Chile went through crises over issues of the past. In 1991, after
the release of a government truth commission report documenting the
deaths and disappearances of more than 2,000 people during the
Pinochet years, assassins took the lives of three political
figures, including a right-wing senator. Three years later,
soldiers appeared in the streets in a partially effective effort to
block investigations of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, Pinochet is dominating the news, and the
nightly broadcasts of emotional interviews with relatives of those
who disappeared have stirred memories that most Chileans would
prefer to forget. Nevertheless, commentators have pointed out that
such frequent broadcasts of interviews highly critical of Pinochet
and the army would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.
Particularly penetrating have been reports about Operation Condor,
the effort to seize and murder dozens of exiles living in Argentina
and other countries, for which Pinochet is being investigated by a
Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most striking image to emerge from the crisis
has been that of Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, a leader of
the Socialist Party that was once led by Allende and that now
governs with the centrist Christian Democrats, calling on the
British to free the man who once forced him into exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing Chile needs is Pinochet as a martyr,'' Insulza
said, expressing a commonly held notion that if Pinochet were
somehow hounded to death by his legal problems, the country could
still explode. It is a practical, political argument that suggests
no newfound respect for the general. Rather, when Insulza repeats
it almost daily, it is a reminder that the governing elite now
bridge a political divide that was as wide as any in Latin America
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our own Cold War but now there is a consensus in favor
of private enterprise and democracy,'' said Jorge Schaulsohn
Brodsky, a former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and a member
of the social democratic Party for Democracy. ``While we still have
a shopping list of issues, out of that shopping list we now only
disagree on one and we agree on all the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue on which Chileans disagree, of course, is still
Pinochet, who turns 83 on Wednesday and is in poor health. He
stepped down as armed forces commander eight months ago, but
remains a senator for life, a position that conveys legal immunity
under a constitution he conceived as dictator. So he was weighing
in on political issues until he was arrested. And his constitution
will probably continue to grant disproportionate influence to two
rightist parties and the military for at least several more years,
even if the constitution is overhauled eventually..
</P>
<P>
   But even if the panel of Britain's House of Lords that is
considering his case allows Pinochet to return to Chile soon, there
are already signs that he has become a much diminished figure.
Several influential conservatives have even suggested that the
general should make some grand gesture upon his return, like an
apology for excesses during his regime. A few have even endorsed a
proposal by the Chilean Catholic Church hierarchy to reassemble the
government truth commission to gather more information on those who
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the general comes back, that will be the end of it and he
will no longer play a political role,'' said Sebastian Pinera,
presidential candidate of the conservative National Renewal Party.
``But if he doesn't come back, he will be a player forever,
especially if he dies abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   So the crisis is not over. The other day, President Eduardo Frei
told a business group that the discord since Pinochet's arrest
``shows that our reconciliation is incomplete and we must work hard
to strengthen that process in the future.'' Then he flew off to
South Africa to start a nine-day global trade mission.

``shows that our reconciliation is incomplete and we must work hard
to strengthen that process in the future.'' Then he flew off to
South Africa to start a nine-day global trade mission.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Democrats should save Clinton, then bury him
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that it looks as though they'll be able to save their
president from impeachment, and with the general concurrence of the
public, the next task for congressional Democrats is to figure out
how to distance themselves from him in ways that same public
notices and credits.
</P>
<P>
   For while most Americans do not want President Clinton
impeached, neither do they want him absolved.
</P>
<P>
   Instinctive senses of fair play and proportion have kept most
Americans away from the ultimate sanction of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most are uneasy with the way the Starr investigation of
Whitewater _ a bust, we now know _ inexplicably inflated into a
permanent investigation of the Clintons and the Clinton
administration. The prosectors' treatment of Monica Lewinsky and
her mother as if they were mafia dons was repelling. (An impression
cemented by Kenneth Starr's dismissal of Monica in his Judicial
Committee testimony as simply a ``felon.'')
</P>
<P>
   And while Americans recognize lying under oath as reprehensible,
most can see shadings among lies. At the light end are lies about
sex, especially in circumstances that in part had been manipulated
in hopes of producing the lies. Impeachment strikes most as
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, it also remains clear, in every poll and most
conversations, that the president's misbehaviors appall just about
everyone except the small rump of actual hedonists among us. Far
from being the moral slugs the religious and cultural right
mistakes them for, most folks are as repulsed by Clinton's
errancies as they are by the Republican drive to politicize and
cash in on them.
</P>
<P>
   The public can be forgiven if it did not get a sense from the
first impeachment hearing that the committee's Democrats share
their revulsion. The relentless Democratic attack on Starr made it
seem as though the Democrats were defending Clinton across the
board, not just against impeachment and against Starr's
inappropriately prosecutorial, instead of properly factual, manner.
</P>
<P>
   (A guess: The concentration on Starr and his means was, at least
in part, laying the groundwork for arguing, should Clinton be
indicted after he leaves office, that the whole Lewinsky
investigation was so legally amiss any evidence arising from it is
inadmissible.)
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be an increasingly tricky problem for Democrats
as the president comes closer to slipping through the impeachment
net. Even as they keep the pressure on against impeachment,
Democrats will need, too, to begin signaling that in doing so, they
are not giving Clinton a bye on his sexual adventuring or his
lying.
</P>
<P>
   Just buying into a congressional censure, if it comes to that,
won't be enough. A Democratic caucus vote or leadership statement
sharply rebuking Clinton is needed. That would be a bitter pill to
Clinton, but then he has earned his medicine, hasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   An electorate that punished Republicans this year for not
recognizing that it didn't think the president's misbehaviors were
impeachable is as likely in 2000 to punish Democrats if they don't
recognize that the electorate also didn't like those misbehaviors
one little bit.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Whose millennium is this, anyway?
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, Nov. 25, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was with wry curiosity that I read, last weekend, of yet
another cult that believes the days of our existence are fatally
linked to the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Calling themselves the Concerned Christians, they are a band of
about 75 that originated in Denver but have disappeared from there,
picking up children, selling houses, cars and furniture. About 10
have shown up in Israel, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, remembrances of Jonestown and other suicide cults
come to mind, and already the Israelis have expressed displeasure
at the arrival of some of the Concerned Christians, whose original
theory that Denver would fall to an earthquake last October failed
to materialize. (In fact, Denver is still unbeaten.)
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the sect, Monte Kim Miller, having failed at one
prophecy, has issued another, or maybe two. He says he will be
killed on the streets of Jerusalem in December 1999, and this still
signal the coming of the end of us all. This puzzles me because
another of his prophecies claims only he and his followers will
survive the millennium turn and all the destruction it brings.
</P>
<P>
   As one never can be too sure which established or fringe
religion is the one above all else, and since there has been talk
among other religious groups of closure come the end of the
millennium, I did a little studying about this millennium stuff, as
I am sure you have.
</P>
<P>
   Let us discard as insoluble the brouhaha over whether the
millennium turns on Jan. 1, 2000, or Jan. 1, 2001. Let us accept,
as it was done by Hallmark Cards or whomever, that it will turn at
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   What so many have forgotten to take into consideration are all
the calendars of all the religions. Let us take Jerusalem, for
example, as this is where Mr. Miller believes he will meet his
maker at the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   That possibly will happen, but only in the Christian Quarter of
the Old City. If he or any of his followers are in the Jewish
Quarter, a millennium will not occur for another 241 years, as this
is the year 5759 in the Jewish calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be in the Muslim Quarter, he's got 580 or so years to
go, as the Muslim world presently is observing the year 1420, or
1421 _ I cannot determine which, for which I apologize to all
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Is my tongue deep into my cheek? Yes it is. And why shouldn't it
be? All this millennium and apocalypse material is a byproduct of
Christian belief, not necessarily traditional. The present Western
World calendar is based on religion. The A.D. after each year
stands for the Latin ``Anno Domini,'' meaning in the years since
the beginning of the Christian era.
</P>
<P>
   And it's been tinkered with. Let us not forget that in 1582,
Pope Gregory XIII decided the old Julian calender was not taking
scientific realities into consideration and dropped 10 days out of
it. The day after Oct. 4, 1582 became Oct. 15, 1582.
</P>
<P>
   Let us also consider the Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Shintos and
countless other religions of the world who are not bound, or
influenced, by proclamations of persons such as the Bishop of
Oxford, the Rt. Rev. Richard Harries, who said the millennium was
primarily a celebration of the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Western influence has vaulted the Gregorian calendar
to everyday worldwide usage. But there are other calendars hanging
on the walls of mosques, synagogues and sundry temples _ calendars
that do not relate to an immediate millennium. If frenetic
followers of fringe Christianity want to believe that the upcoming
advertised millennium is going to be doomsday, lots of luck to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, I'll be at the Orange Bowl football game that day.

 &HT;    Why does TV keep showing the same old movies?
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're in the mood to watch a good movie on TV. You don't want
to rent. So, you channel surf, hoping _ praying _ something will
catch your eye. The Beastmaster. Click. Uncle Buck. Click. Turner &AMP;
Hooch. Click.
</P>
<P>
   The next night _ or the next week _ you turn on the tube. The
Beastmaster. Click. Uncle Buck. Click. Turner &AMP; Hooch. Click.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Why are the same movies on all the time?
</P>
<P>
   Well, certain films get shown a lot for various reasons. High
ratings will almost guarantee additional showings. But all cable
networks cut studio deals which say they must air films a specific
number of times. The problem is, many of those films are, well, not
Oscar-worthy. Ironically, those same films often become cult
favorites on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Films that work best tend to be very fast moving,
action-packed and easy to watch in small bites,'' says Tim Brooks,
USA Networks' senior vice president of research. ``You can almost
half watch them if you want to. You can wander away and come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Lisa Mateas, TNT's senior vice president of programming:
``You've heard of comfort food, well there are also comfort
films.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some that comfort the most.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEASTMASTER
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A He-Man warrior (Marc Singer) who can talk to
animals, gets back at a no-good sorcerer (Rip Torn). Also stars the
va-va-va-voomy no-talent Tanya Roberts as a yummy slave. We're
talking medieval camp at its best, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: TBS
</P>
<P>
   Number of times: 25 since 1987
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: Well, Singer looked mighty manly in that
paper-thin loin cloth. The Beastmaster, though, has a more, uh,
intellectual take on the film's surprising longevity. ``There is a
direct descendent line between (directors) John Ford, Akira
Kurosawa and the popularity of The Beastmaster,'' explains a
dead-serious Singer. ``Each of those filmmakers were concerned with
the existential quest for zen perfection and, in truth, that is the
story of The Beastmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for clearing that up, Marc.
</P>
<P>
   TURNER &AMP; HOOCH
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Tom Hanks in his pre-Oscar days as a Felix
Unger-like detective who pairs up with a slobbering canine to solve
a murder. Yikes ... you know things are bad when Hanks gets
upstaged by a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: USA
</P>
<P>
   Number of times: 22 since 1994
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: We're not sure. Not even the folks at USA
are sure. But we are sure this is one film Mr. Two-Time Oscar
Winner would like to forget. ``It's Tom Hanks with a dog, for
heaven's sake,'' says Ray Giacopelli, USA's vice president of
audience analysis. ``They kill the dog in the end. What were they,
on crack? You just don't do that! You can kill John Wayne, but not
a dog!''
</P>
<P>
   VOLCANO
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A leathery-faced Tommy Lee Jones plays a steely
bureaucrat up to his eyes in soot after Los Angeles goes up in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: HBO
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 19 times since 1996
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: ``It has action, special effects and
Tommy Lee Jones,'' says David Baldwin, senior vice president of
programming planning for HBO and Cinemax. ``Sometimes you just want
to come home, sit on the couch and watch (stuff) explode.''
</P>
<P>
   More movies we see too much of:
</P>
<P>
   UNCLE BUCK
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A good 'ol slovenly uncle (John Candy) is
forced to look after his brother's three kids.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: USA
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 40 since 1992
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: ``John Candy and kids. It just works,''
says Ray Giacopelli, USA's vice president of audience analysis. And
it works a lot better when you don't have to pay $7 to see it.
</P>
<P>
   HER FINAL FURY: THE BETTY BRODERICK STORY
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Based on a true story, a woman (Meredith
Baxter) struggles when her husband leaves her for another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: Lifetime
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 12 since 1994
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: ``It has all the makings of a great
Lifetime movie,'' says Paul Noble, Lifetime's director of feature
films and program acquisitions. ``It has a great actress, a true
story about a woman who succeeds against all odds and learns how to
deal with her problems.'' Uh, yeah, but she deals with those
problems by killing her husband and his lover.
</P>
<P>
   K-9
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: James Belushi is a do-right cop who's teamed
with a feisty police dog.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: USA
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 31 times since 1992
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: The dog gets killed. OK, seriously.
``It's the sort of movie couples can agree on while both are
lunging toward the remote,'' reasons USA's Giacoppelli. But after
watching, those same couples are often lunging at each other's
throats.
</P>
<P>
   JOE'S APARTMENT
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: An Iowa farm boy (Jerry O'Connell) moves to New
York and meets millions of singing and dancing roaches in his
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: Showtime
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 28 times this year.
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: C'mon who doesn't love dancing roaches?
</P>
<P>
   OVER AND OVER
</P>
<P>
   The number of times they've shown this year (unless noted)
</P>
<P>
   Independence Day (HBO, 22 times)
</P>
<P>
   Alaska (Showtime, 22 times)

 &HT;    Consumer questions
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am in the sixth grade at Bastrop Intermediate and we are
writing a fan letter. I was wondering if you could find Mack
Brown's address. _Geoffrey Roach
</P>
<P>
   A: Geoffrey, I am sure Coach Brown will be happy to hear from
you. The address is Coach Mack Brown, University of Texas Football
Office, P.O. Box 7399, Austin 78713. And to all you Longhorn fans,
understand that the amazing coach already receives bundles of
letters _ praise, advice, criticism, etc. _ so if you write, don't
expect immediate acknowledgement.Q: I have a bet with my
daughter-in-law (you know how those Yankees think they know it
all): Who set the rule for the airlines requiring that everyone
show an ID to get on the airplane?
</P>
<P>
   _ George Mitchell
</P>
<P>
   A: The FAA. Did you win? The overall security program was
implemented partially as a response to threats against aviation
from none other than the Unabomber, says FAA spokesman Roland
Herwig. It includes passengers producing a proof of identity (a
photo ID or two pieces of identification, at least one of which
must be issued by a government authority), matching baggage to
passengers and the ever-controversial ``profiling.''Q: I've been
trying to find out how many calories and fat grams are in Popeyes
red beans and rice. _Kathy R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Small sizes (5.9 ounces) pack 270 calories and 16.9 grams of
fat. Popeyes spokesman Scott Hudler noted, ``Our customer usually
comes to Popeyes for the flavor, not the nutrition.'' Well said.
Did you know this product has been voted ``Best Red Beans &AMP; Rice''
in New Orleans for 10 consecutive years? Hudler also said fat
content is the most popular topic of questions the staff receives.
But hey, it tastes great. (I have been spotted at that
drive-through on more than one occasion.) Popeyes is also the home
of those great, deep-fried, holiday turkeys.Q: Do you have any
information on how I could get in contact with Nolan Ryan or John
Glenn? _ Laura E.
</P>
<P>
   A: Honing the Christmas card list? Write to Ryan in care of
Nolan Ryan Foundation, P.O. Box 1515, Alvin, Texas 77512 and Sen.
Glenn, 503 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.
20510-3501. Dash that missive off to Glenn quickly, as he will be
vacating his Senate office soon.Q: Help! My cat is naked!
Seriously, though, do you know anywhere I can find some
mini-sunglasses, hats or other clothes for my cat? A little cowboy
outfit would be great. It's a long story, but it's for a good
cause, and my cat doesn't mind. (She'll do anything for treats!)
_Faith R.
</P>
<P>
   A: The most comprehensive collection of fashions for pets is
Posh Pups of Venice Beach. The store has everything from cowboy
hats to sunglasses, from biker outfits (vest, hat and cuffs) to
sailor suits (blue or red, with matching hat). And if you feel the
need to have your cat go to the altar, the store also stock--
bridal outfits (white or ivory) and groom tuxedos (white or black).
Call (800) 347-0567 to order. The small sizes are perfect for
felines. Another catalog source is In the Company of Dogs at (800)
924-5050 _ leather jackets and cocktail attire are just a couple of
the items in this closet. Pet Quarters, (888) PET-NETT stocks an
assortment of jackets _ denim, biker and bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On ``Northern Exposure,'' there was an episode in which Dr.
Fleischman was on strike. The show ended with an American
Indian-type song, but only a little of it was played. I would love
to have a copy of that song.
</P>
<P>
   _Jim Johnston
</P>
<P>
   A: This haunting song is ``Ebudae'' by Enya. Sung in Gaelic,
it's on the ``Shepherd Moons'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Readers have asked about Ricky Williams T-shirts. Although the
running back's likeness has been seen on a few chests, these shirts
are not sanctioned by the University of Texas. Barbara Walker, UT
associate athletic director, says NCAA rules prohibit the use of
Williams' _ or any student athlete's _ likeness for commercial
ventures. Vendors will be shut down on sight. Remember the ``Run
Ricky Run'' shirts were stopped cold for the same reason. Let the
man run in peace.Q: I have heard (more than once) that all one
needs to keep a house clean is ammonia, bleach, baking soda and
vinegar. My question is: Which do I use, how, and in what ratios?
</P>
<P>
   _ Sarah Phillips
</P>
<P>
   A: So many uses, so little time. Baking soda may be used as a
substitute for a scouring cleanser, to control odors, as a laundry
additive or drain unclogger. Ammonia's best quality is its
grease-cutting and wax-stripping ability. Used with water ( 1/2 cup
ammonia to a gallon of water) it is a good window cleaner. Bleach,
of course, is a common disinfectant (one tablespoon to a gallon of
water). You can also whiten clothes (on purpose or by accident)
with bleach. Vinegar is also used to dissolve wax and control
common household odors. A little vinegar takes the streaks off
glass and windows, and in the washing machine (one cup in the
rinse) it sets colors.

 &HT;    School vouchers a bad deal
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the life of me I can't figure out where this voucher
business came from and why so many are falling for it.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Texas Poll results say 46 percent of Texans
favor vouchers to attend private schools using tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, voucher supporters are going to make another run at
the Legislature this session to try to get it passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin Supreme Court has OK'd that state's voucher plan
and the case is headed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Texans go on about damn Yankees, you'd think that
would raise a big ol' red flag.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, this is coming from a mom whose kids have spent
most of their educational lives in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   By the time my seventh-grade son graduates from high school, he
and his two sisters will have spent a total of 39 years in school
from kindergarten through 12th grade. Seventeen of those years will
have been in public school and 22 in Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   Since our family was created, we have moved quite a bit and my
husband and I decided early on that if there was a Catholic school
available to us, our children would attend it. The decision was a
matter of faith and not based on what was going on or not going in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Our move to Longview, Texas, eight years ago provided us with an
opportunity to be in a community with excellent public and private
education offerings.
</P>
<P>
   It is a decision we have been happy with and as our children
have graduated from eighth grade and moved on to public school, the
transition has been smooth and their academic success has
continued.
</P>
<P>
   We gave up things to pay for private education. We've driven the
wheels off cars and made good use of hand-me-down clothes. We've
passed on vacations and other material things.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not complaining because it was OUR decision. Never in our
wildest dreams did we think it was anyone else's responsibility to
pay for our kids' private school education. Conversely, it never
entered our minds that we should shirk our responsibility to the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the arguments for vouchers is it would help minority
children better themselves. Uh huh. I'm sure it has nothing at all
to do with the billions in education dollars educational
entrepreneurs could glean by tossing up a few school buildings, as
our state education board member suggested the other day.
</P>
<P>
   My conversations with private school administrators reveals a
lukewarm response to vouchers. They see strings tied to the money
that would change their schools radically.
</P>
<P>
   If our public schools are not the best they can be, let's see
what we can do for them with the money we now have. Let's not talk
about giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   If you're buying into the voucher idea, how about this deal for
you. I'm going to propose to my neighbors that we build a bigger,
better street. We could get as nice a street as we could afford,
and the rest of you taxpayers would give us a break on our taxes
according to what we spent on our street.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty sweet.
</P>
<P>
   So how 'bout them vouchers.

 &HT;    City must try harder to be mecca of high-tech
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Americans love lists. We compile lists of the richest
tycoons, the biggest corporations, the tastiest pizzas and even the
sexiest people.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ``hot'' lists are those that rank the best places
outside of California's Silicon Valley to start high-tech
companies. Newsweek magazine recently named Austin, Texas; Seattle
and Salt Lake City among the new tech meccas. Other experts give
top grades to Dallas, Denver, Raleigh/Durham and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta rarely leads anyone's cybersuccess list. The city is
known as a great place for developers, sales representatives,
pilots and warehouse workers. But its reputation as a
transportation/retail hub obscures its increasingly important role
in the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   The metro area has become a significant center for
telecommunications, software and computer-related services,
high-tech manufacturing and biomedical industries. Atlanta already
has more fiber-optic cable than any other city in the country and
is home to several communications giants, including BellSouth, CNN
and Turner Broadcasting, and Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, image matters. To keep businesses growing,
Atlanta has to start topping those ``tech cities'' lists to attract
more talent. We need the ``buzz'' that would allow young people to
impress their old dorm roommates when they announce plans to move
to Atlanta. Workers in their 20s love Seattle, Boston and Austin
because those cities sound cool. Atlanta sounds, well, suburban.
Its image involves big lawns, bad traffic and cookie-cutter
shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   So how can Atlanta become more techno-groovy?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a suggestion: build ``people incubators'' to raise an
army of Information Age workers. We could develop lots of
one-bedroom and studio apartments near the Georgia Tech campus and
subsidize high-tech renters with corporate donations and tax
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   We already support about a dozen business incubators in Georgia
to help fledgling companies expand and create jobs. The incubators
provide business owners with technical advice, low rents and a
chance to bounce ideas off other entrepreneurs. They typically are
nonprofit enterprises partially financed by government grants, or
sponsored by for-profit companies or venture capitalists. For
example, Georgia Tech and Emory University are now developing an
incubator to help spur the creation of biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   But these incubators would have a better chance of hatching hot
businesses if they could draw from a bigger pool of skilled
workers. By subsidizing housing, we could create human resources.
This is not a new idea; in fact, textile companies began this
century by using offers of cheap housing to attract workers
throughout the South. These ``company towns'' helped rural people
make the transition into the Industrial Age.
</P>
<P>
   Now companies need a new generation to make the next shift, this
time into the Information Age. The HOPE scholarship program already
is helping young people make the move. The offer of low-rent, but
high-tech, apartments after college might help, too.
</P>
<P>
   A 22-year-old graduate might be more inclined to live in Atlanta
if she could get a safe, clean apartment that offered fiber-optic
wiring, free Internet access and $400-a-month rent for the first
year. In this ``people incubator,'' she could meet other members of
this frontier community to share business ideas and job
information.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, company towns allowed young Southerners to leave
their rural roots and provide labor for manufacturers. Today, hip
apartments may be one way to help young people find their way to
Atlanta to provide the talent for the new industries of the mind.

 &HT;    Remains of deadly Hurricane Mitch still linger
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPARRO, Honduras _ The only evidence left that there was a
village here is the smell of its dead.
</P>
<P>
   Before the disaster, Chaparro was an isolated community of 15
adobe houses flanked by melon fields and a river wide as a football
field _ big enough to blow a constant, cool breeze over its 60
residents.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-day downpour delivered by Hurricane Mitch earlier
this month engorged the river and snatched the thatched-roof homes
off the shore or buried them in the tons of mud left behind. Today,
Chaparro is a barren moonscape dotted with massive, snarled clumps
of tree stumps and debris and, from the smell of them, bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Out here in a remote agricultural region of southern Honduras,
there's no National Guard brigade brought out to dig through the
piles and excavate Chaparro's residents. No bulldozers to move the
muck to see if there's a house buried underneath.
</P>
<P>
   So like the thousands of Hondurans still looking for their loved
ones, 50-year-old Salomon Escoto was left to his own devices. But
unlike most of them, Escoto, a stern police major from the capital
city of Tegucigalpa, at least had some devices.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on Nov. 8-10, he and his wife, Lilian Oliva, and some
officers from his unit scoured the area for three days searching
for his missing father, mother and brother _ fully expecting to
find them dead.
</P>
<P>
   He started near where the family's two-room house used to be. He
searched by shoveling or poking a stick into the reeking piles then
sniffing the end to see if he had hit a body.
</P>
<P>
   They found eight in total, among them Escoto's 78-year-old
father, Alfonso.
</P>
<P>
   The river had dumped Alfonso about a mile from where his house
once stood, enveloping him in branches and straw, Oliva said. The
only recognizable feature left after a week in the Central American
sun was a metal plate from where he broke his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Upon seeing the plate, Escoto, a stoic man, according to his
wife, picked up the corpse and held it a long while, sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like it wasn't even his father because he looked so
horrible,'' Oliva said. ``But we had to look. This way, we'll
always know where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Escoto's officers carried his father, wrapped in
garbage bags, for miles to meet the major at the closest point
where a car could reach. As they placed Alfonso into a coffin and
loaded it in a pick-up truck, Escoto stared in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unreal. Everything now is unreal for us,'' Oliva said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return with the body and prepare for the funeral,
which was later that day, the major and his men set out again to
search for his mother and brother. They walked for hours across the
muddy plain, crossing a river where a river never used to be,
prodding the piles.
</P>
<P>
   Scavengers in the area collecting the few pieces of rubber and
firewood told the group of a body they had seen about a half mile
away. Escoto and his men set out and returned to report that this
one was a child. The major looked relieved.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, Escoto had to leave for the nearby city
of Choluteca for his father's funeral. After that he had to return
to work in Tegucigalpa the next day.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he'll dispatch more of his officers to continue
searching for his mother and brother.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also retrieve the bodies already discovered _ and carry
away the last trace of a breezy village called Chaparro.

 &HT;    Why does TV keep showing the same old movies?
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're in the mood to watch a good movie on TV. You don't want
to rent. So, you channel surf, hoping _ praying _ something will
catch your eye. The Beastmaster. Click. Uncle Buck. Click. Turner &AMP;
Hooch. Click.
</P>
<P>
   The next night _ or the next week _ you turn on the tube. The
Beastmaster. Click. Uncle Buck. Click. Turner &AMP; Hooch. Click.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Why are the same movies on all the time?
</P>
<P>
   Well, certain films get shown a lot for various reasons. High
ratings will almost guarantee additional showings. But all cable
networks cut studio deals which say they must air films a specific
number of times. The problem is, many of those films are, well, not
Oscar-worthy. Ironically, those same films often become cult
favorites on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Films that work best tend to be very fast moving,
action-packed and easy to watch in small bites,'' says Tim Brooks,
USA Networks' senior vice president of research. ``You can almost
half watch them if you want to. You can wander away and come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Lisa Mateas, TNT's senior vice president of programming:
``You've heard of comfort food, well there are also comfort
films.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some that comfort the most.
</P>
<P>
   THE BEASTMASTER
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A He-Man warrior (Marc Singer) who can talk to
animals, gets back at a no-good sorcerer (Rip Torn). Also stars the
va-va-va-voomy no-talent Tanya Roberts as a yummy slave. We're
talking medieval camp at its best, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: TBS
</P>
<P>
   Number of times: 25 since 1987
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: Well, Singer looked mighty manly in that
paper-thin loin cloth. The Beastmaster, though, has a more, uh,
intellectual take on the film's surprising longevity. ``There is a
direct descendent line between (directors) John Ford, Akira
Kurosawa and the popularity of The Beastmaster,'' explains a
dead-serious Singer. ``Each of those filmmakers were concerned with
the existential quest for zen perfection and, in truth, that is the
story of The Beastmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for clearing that up, Marc.
</P>
<P>
   TURNER &AMP; HOOCH
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Tom Hanks in his pre-Oscar days as a Felix
Unger-like detective who pairs up with a slobbering canine to solve
a murder. Yikes ... you know things are bad when Hanks gets
upstaged by a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: USA
</P>
<P>
   Number of times: 22 since 1994
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: We're not sure. Not even the folks at USA
are sure. But we are sure this is one film Mr. Two-Time Oscar
Winner would like to forget. ``It's Tom Hanks with a dog, for
heaven's sake,'' says Ray Giacopelli, USA's vice president of
audience analysis. ``They kill the dog in the end. What were they,
on crack? You just don't do that! You can kill John Wayne, but not
a dog!''
</P>
<P>
   VOLCANO
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A leathery-faced Tommy Lee Jones plays a steely
bureaucrat up to his eyes in soot after Los Angeles goes up in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: HBO
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 19 times since 1996
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: ``It has action, special effects and
Tommy Lee Jones,'' says David Baldwin, senior vice president of
programming planning for HBO and Cinemax. ``Sometimes you just want
to come home, sit on the couch and watch (stuff) explode.''
</P>
<P>
   More movies we see too much of:
</P>
<P>
   UNCLE BUCK
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A good 'ol slovenly uncle (John Candy) is
forced to look after his brother's three kids.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: USA
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 40 since 1992
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: ``John Candy and kids. It just works,''
says Ray Giacopelli, USA's vice president of audience analysis. And
it works a lot better when you don't have to pay $7 to see it.
</P>
<P>
   HER FINAL FURY: THE BETTY BRODERICK STORY
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Based on a true story, a woman (Meredith
Baxter) struggles when her husband leaves her for another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: Lifetime
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 12 since 1994
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: ``It has all the makings of a great
Lifetime movie,'' says Paul Noble, Lifetime's director of feature
films and program acquisitions. ``It has a great actress, a true
story about a woman who succeeds against all odds and learns how to
deal with her problems.'' Uh, yeah, but she deals with those
problems by killing her husband and his lover.
</P>
<P>
   K-9
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: James Belushi is a do-right cop who's teamed
with a feisty police dog.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: USA
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 31 times since 1992
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: The dog gets killed. OK, seriously.
``It's the sort of movie couples can agree on while both are
lunging toward the remote,'' reasons USA's Giacoppelli. But after
watching, those same couples are often lunging at each other's
throats.
</P>
<P>
   JOE'S APARTMENT
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: An Iowa farm boy (Jerry O'Connell) moves to New
York and meets millions of singing and dancing roaches in his
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Where it airs: Showtime
</P>
<P>
   Number of times it aired: 28 times this year.
</P>
<P>
   Why we like to see it: C'mon who doesn't love dancing roaches?
</P>
<P>
   OVER AND OVER
</P>
<P>
   The number of times they've shown this year (unless noted)
</P>
<P>
   Independence Day (HBO, 22 times)
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Proper planning minimizes horror of holiday travel
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In less than seven days, most Americans will find
their dinner tables are bedecked with turkey and dressing.
Thanksgiving marks the beginning of our winter holiday season.
Unfortunately, more ``turkeys'' will take to our nation's highways
than will ever be stuffed or adorned with cranberry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, Thanksgiving is a heavier travel holiday than
Christmas. It's off to Grandma's or Aunt Ethyl's or Uncle Fred's or
whoever's house we go at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   What it means is travel by car will be a nightmare on the
Wednesday before Thanksgiving, as well as the Sunday afterward when
everyone is trying to squeeze just ``one more visit'' into their
long weekend itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   As if just plain old everyday traffic wasn't bad enough for most
folks, how are you to deal with the additional pressures of holiday
traventer one of the Thanksgiving ``turkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are confronted by one of these ``turkeys,'' please
remember two wrongs don't make a right. It could not only
jeopardize your safety, but that of everyone in your vehicle. Just
take a deep breath, look for the nearest exit and treat yourself to
a little timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the holidays are hectic times and we all have schedules to
keep, but remember your most important agenda is to reach your
destination safely. Common sense will always be the responsibility
of the person behind the steering wheel. Please don't let the
advances of even one ``turkey'' take the stuffing out of your
holiday.

 &HT;    It's that time of year for `best of' lists
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You can always tell the holiday season is around the
corner when computer magazines start running the ``best of'' lists.
The first out of the gate this year is PC World, which features the
best computer CDs and DVDs in its December issue. The magazine's
top 10 titles include Microsoft's Encarta Reference Suite 99, an
electronic encyclopedia that retails for $100. Other picks include
Access Software's golf game ``Links LS 1999,'' Blizzard
Entertainment's ``StarCraft'' and National Geographic Maps from
Mindscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, the magazine's editors decided to
test a boast by Apple's Steve Jobs that his new iMac was faster
than the quickest Pentium II PC. They pitted the iMac against the
most expensive Pentium and a system that was $300 less than the
iMac, which retails for $1,299. The iMac finished last in every
test against both of these PCs. The magazine concluded Jobs' boast
was ``pure hype.'' It did find, though, the iMac is indeed the
easiest computer to set up and get going on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   If rock musicians can do it, how about the star of a 1980s video
game? Hasbro Interactive is hoping so in its re-release of
``Centipede'' in the form of a computer CD. ``Centipede'' made its
debut as an Atari video game. Now Hasbro has souped it up with 3-D
graphics and new game play. Now you don't just blow away the evil
Centipedes but must also rescue the Wee People threatened by them.
Available only for PCs with operating systems Windows 95 or newer,
``Centipede'' retails for about $40.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it seems you're never too young for your first
computer game. For the holiday season, Fisher-Price has released a
new game for children as young as three. It's called the ``Little
People Christmas Activity Center.'' The game is a two-computer CD
set that lets kids make holiday cards, gift tags and wrapping
paper. There also are printing activities and other games. The game
works with both PCs and Macs and retails for $9.99 if you buy
another Fisher-Price title.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   It's the dawn of the holiday season but not everyone is happy.
Just check out the Web. Sadly, it has become a breeding ground for
hate groups. Now you can keep up with what sites to avoid and steer
your children clear of. The site is called Hatewatch. You'll find
it at http://www.hatewatch.org.

 &HT;    Map sites on Web make charting your life easier
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the help of a map, most of us can get very
confused.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when a map actually helps. You'll find maps
on the Web that will plot your route across town or across the
country. But the many sites on the Net that offer maps offer a lot
more than that. Many of the maps can be copied and then pasted into
homework assignments for geography and others offer you a chance to
better understand news stories that happen half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start our trip through the maps of the Web at a couple of
sites that offer help driving to a new location. One of the best is
MapQuest at http://www.mapquest.com. You can use the site without
joining, but you'll get additional services once you're a member.
Since membership is free, go ahead and enroll.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of the page is its ability to plot a
turn-by-turn course to a destination anywhere in the country.
Besides the map, you'll get a text description of the turns to
take. In fact, since the maps are relatively small and don't show
much detail (you can zoom in for more detail but sometimes end up
with a map that doesn't cover a large enough area to be helpful),
you'll find that the text is the best way to use the navigational
information.
</P>
<P>
   The routes plotted seem to be accurate and do a good job of
following a logical route. However, if you are familiar with an
area, you probably know a better way. However, if you're familiar
with an area, you probably don't need the map in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Another service that offers much the same service is AltaVista
Maps, run by the search engine company of the same name, at
http://maps.altavista.com/cgi-bin/mapcgi. Even though you probably
won't find much difference between the routes provided by these two
sites, it's handy to bookmark both. These are high traffic sites
and you may want an option if one site is particularly slow because
of online traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The next site _ called Create A Map at http://www.aquarius
</P>
<P>
   .geomar.de/omc/ _ may not be as useful in day-to-day life but is
enormous fun. You can build your own maps using this excellent
German site (most of the text here is in English as well as German
so you shouldn't have any trouble using the site) and manipulate
the way the map is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   You can, for instance, enter coordinates in latitude and
longitude and then select the map you want, including a
topographical map that shows ridges and features of the Earth. You
can also tell the site to include city names or to leave them out.
It's my guess that you'll spend a lot of time practicing map-making
here. And if you have children, this is a great way to teach them
geography.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever searched the Web for online maps, you know that
the place is the world's greatest repository of maps. So the ones
we've mentioned just scratch the surface of what's available.
That's why the next Web site is an enormous help for anyone
interested in maps.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Online Map Resources, and it is located at
http://www.geog.ukans.edu/map.htm. You'll find a plain-vanilla page
here that is filled with links to various places on the Web where
you'll find maps. You can, for instance, at the click of a mouse go
to the excellent University of Texas map site at
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Mapcollection/Map
</P>
<P>
   collection.html. There also are links to the Harvard University
map site at http://icg.harvard.edu/(tilde)maps/ and dozens of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Maps, you'll find, are a pleasant way to lose yourself for
hours.

 &HT;    Some communities are more orderly than others
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Community'' is a word that gets tossed around on the
Web almost as much as ``portal,'' ``commerce'' and ``IPO.''
However, if you ask three Web pundits what community is, you're
likely to get three different answers.
</P>
<P>
   TheGlobe.com (http://www.theglobe.com), GeoCities
(http://www.geocities.com), Tripod (http://www.tripod
</P>
<P>
   .com) and local sites such as AccessAtlanta
(http://www.accessatlanta.com) each invite users to build
special-interest home pages, add chat rooms and build a presence on
the Web. But while community has become the buzzword du jour, even
the folks at the Mining Company (http://www.miningco
</P>
<P>
   .com), which pioneered the notion of a networked collection of
special-interest Web sites, have trouble defining community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community is a much misunderstood concept,'' says Amanda Hass,
who works on program and community development for the Mining
Company. ``There's a lot of buzz about community, but if there
isn't a responsible guide in charge, that's not community, that's
anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Company aims for a more professional look and feel to
its sites and encourages its guides to build out their sites with
incentives. So far, the results have been good: Media Metrix ranks
the Mining Company the eighth most popular site on the Web in the
information/entertainment/news category.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Company believes hiring experienced guides to develop
and maintain special-interest sites is the answer to the anarchy of
random personal pages with no clear voice directing the information
on the site. The company recruits guides expert in areas ranging
from pregnancy and politics to rock music and rodeos, puts them
through a three-week online training period, then helps them set up
sites that provide users with chat, links, articles and even an
e-mailed newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, there were 642 guides with sites on the Mining
Company site. A recent peek at a site devoted to the impeachment
hearings assembled by guide Tim Hosfeldt is one of the most
complete collections of information and background on the Starr
investigation on the Web. Sites devoted to Canadian news and the
Beatles are equally comprehensive. If you need information, you'll
probably be able to find something you can use from a Mining
Company site.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the Mining Company's sites do it because they
love their subject matter, but there's also monetary compensation.
Guides get 40 percent of advertising revenue and transactions made
via partnerships with companies like online bookseller Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you define online community as a group of people who may or
may not know each other drawn together by an interest in a
particular subject, then the Mining Company is certainly a
community. However, as Hass points out, ``We were revolutionary
when we launched, but now more and more people are moving toward
our model.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says she sees no immediate threats from any community
sites or wannabes. ``We pioneered the model that made (the other
sites) possible. The problem is getting users to find you and love
you.''
</P>
<P>

and freeze-dried ice cream. Discover the myriad other things it
does _ from studying meteors to helping to preserve the original

 &HT;    `Deer Avenger' targets humor
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So far, most computer games have been devoted to
digitizing what we do, paying taxes, playing football, flying
planes and hunting deer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, companies are coming out with games for your PC that make
fun of what we do. ``Deer Avenger,'' a CD-ROM by Simon &AMP; Schuster
Interactive, is expected out by Thanksgiving, still in time for
deer hunting season in most states. The game is a parody of the
popular ``Deer Hunter'' series. It is written by Brian McCann, a
writer for ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD can be installed or played off your CD-ROM drive. The
game gives you the option of hunting in Connecticut, Minnesota or
West Virginia. ``Come for the hunting, stay for the wacky, dancing,
banjo-playing in-bred freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   After choosing your hunting locale, you pick a weapon: bazooka,
rifle or slingshot. Then you look for hunters; telltale signs
include stacks of magazines, tree markings and a roll of toilet
paper. Once you've chosen an area in which to focus your hunt, you
can click the ``Call'' icon to ferret out your hunter. Calls
include, ``Free tickets to a Molly Hatchet reunion concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a hunter is out in the open, you click on the ``aim'' icon
and shoot. Which is not as easy as it sounds. Your mouse controls
the sights and you click to fire, but the game makes your mouse
very sensitive. Missed shots elicit trash talk from the CD-ROM,
including, ``I've seen better shots in the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM has a suggested retail of $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the get-go
</P>
<P>
   So, you finally give in to the crush and drop your $1,500 on
your first PC. Then it doesn't work. According to a survey in the
October issue of Windows magazine, you're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13 percent of all new computers either fail to start on
their first boot or they ship with bad parts.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway were evaluated the strongest:
92 percent of Hewlett-Packard users had computers that worked fine
from the jump; 91 percent of Dell and Gateway's customers also had
bug-free start-ups. The industry average was 87 percent. NEC and
Packard Bell were among the companies rated ``poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked 6,000 of the magazine's readers, 2,925 of whom
responded. People were asked to comment on their computer's
performance and the technical support provided by the manufacturer.
Most of the machines, 73 percent, were less than 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is probably off newsstands, but it can be read online
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .winmag.com/library/1998/1001/Fea0044
</P>
<P>
   .htm.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing with the Gray Wave
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's Gray Wave is the focus of the November/December
issue of Modern Maturity magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The feature looks at how seniors can get the system that best
suits them. It looks at the technology needs of four different
types of people _ high-end users, average users, low-average users
and low-end users.
</P>
<P>
   A separate section breaks down the essential technology
questions, like ``Mac or PC?'' Also included is a glossary of 13
words to help take the ``techno'' out of ``technospeak.''
</P>
<P>
   Four famous people _ Ed Bradley, Francis Ford Coppola, Newt
Gingrich and Martha Stewart _ tell what computers add to their
lives. Gingrich uses a Compaq and tells of writing his third book
by e-mailing chapters to his editor.
</P>
<P>
   A site for smart kids
</P>
<P>
   A new online site devoted to education products for kids was
unveiled recently.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.smarterkids.com sells software, books, games, toys
and services geared for kids preschool through ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Products can be chosen based on a child's educational goals,
learning style, ratings and educational approach. User registration
is via e-mail or phone contact with consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Correct address
</P>
<P>
   The Web site address for Whole World Theatre's broadcast of
``Last Hour Live,'' was listed incorrectly last week. The correct
address is http://www.ibtv.net.

 &HT;    Today's kids need more of a chance to build gadgets and gizmos
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week I spoke to one of the toughest and most
intelligent audiences I have faced in awhile. I've made my share of
speeches, dabbled in national TV, once had a radio talk show and
still do weekly work on WCNN radio, but all that is easy. Last week
I was sweating bullets and working hard just to understand the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to three classes of sixth-graders, all enrolled in one
of those modern programs that fast-tracks especially bright kids.
By the time I finished the third class I was exhausted ... just
staying up with the questions (we talked about everything from
celestial navigation to the possible social consequences of virtual
reality) left me thinking I could never return to teaching. I don't
have the endurance.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every category, these kids were brighter than high
school students of my generation (I'm middle-aged and getting past
the middle part fast). But in visiting with some of the kids in the
hallway, I realized there was one category in which bright students
of today lag my generation. And the more I thought about it, the
more I decided it was an important failing.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a kid _ back in the days when the Rocky Mountains
were young _ kids built things. There were great companies such as
Allied Radio and Heathkit that offered build-it-yourself projects
such as radios, hi-fidelity audio and even TV sets. One of the most
popular Christmas gifts was another form of do-it-yourself
experimenting, a chemistry set (preferably by Gilbert). And erector
sets were big. Not all the building involved a kit; most kids knew
how to make a radio set using a razor blade.
</P>
<P>
   If the bright kids I visited with are any indicator, kits are
out these days. Instead, that experimental energy goes into
creating Web pages and learning about the Internet and playing
video games. None of those things is bad. In fact, I would argue
that they're terrific. But there is a whole generation growing up
missing the delight of actually creating a gadget from pieces of
bell wire, pencil leads and razor blades.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. This isn't the fault of the kids. Most
electronic gadgets these days would be almost impossible to
construct at home. Instead of great big resistors with nice wire
ends, there are little bitty parts _ small enough so that you could
hold 12 of 'em on your fingernail _ that use a technology called
surface mount. These parts are attached directly _ without wires in
most cases _ to the circuit board. Working at this almost
microscopic level is next to impossible at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of basic-level electronic construction is
important. I keep thinking of conversations I've had with
engineers, and most of them started out building gadgets in the
basement. I worry that we'll grow up with a generation of software
gurus who don't know to grab the cool end of a soldering iron.
Maybe I'm way out in space here, but I think that the building gap
will eventually matter. Maybe that has already started.
</P>
<P>
   I was at the University of North Carolina's computer lab awhile
back, and I spent some time chatting with the fellow who ran the
joint. He explained that, a few years back, a lot of the hardware
in the lab was either built or assembled by graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, he said, he had turned to outside contractors
since not enough kids knew how to do the work. He was quick to
praise the intelligence of the students and said that they could
write computer programs in C++ until the world looked flat. But
most of them didn't know the difference between a capacitor and a
beanie hat.
</P>
<P>
   If any of this hits home and if you have a kid or know one, you
can help. Electronics kits still exist. And chemistry sets and
microscope sets abound. You'll be buying holiday gifts anyway and,
by giving a kit, you'll be building more than the gadget itself.

 &HT;    Compton's on CD-ROM varies widely in quality
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We'll begin looking at the new editions of electronic
encyclopedias with Compton's two-disc Encyclopedia Deluxe for 1999,
which overflows with multimedia productions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it also provides more nonsense than any
dependable encyclopedia ought to have. It is perhaps the most
uneven CD-ROM encyclopedia I've seen, ranging from excellence to
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The interface is quite glitzy and easy to use, and has the same
kind of slide-down menu lists that Microsoft introduced with its
encyclopedia, Encarta, several years ago. There are all the usual
facets _ World Wide Web links, various research aids, an atlas, a
historical time line and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   I ran my more or less standard tests, searching for obscure
subjects in which I have a special interest.
</P>
<P>
   Under flamenco, Compton's provides five responses. The first is
a one-sentence description of the term that is partially incorrect
and entirely useless. The second comes under the heading of
Dance-Spain, and the second of its two paragraphs provides an
absurd description of flamenco.
</P>
<P>
   Within this window, however, there is a link to ``Music _
Spanish Flamenco,'' which brings us a silly photograph, a snatch of
guitar playing and a brief but reasonably cogent description of the
art.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the links lead to a pair of passing references to
castanets, which are not really flamenco at all, and the longest
text block of all _ a biography of Carlos Montoya, a guitarist of
no real significance whose fame rested entirely in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for ``Australia'' points up the preposterous indexing
this encyclopedia uses. The list of references brought up is
interminable. There are, for instance, a few articles on the more
significant snakes to be found on the continent. But there is an
index entry for every last serpent's son of them, and most of them
merely take you to the bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   There is an extensive and very nice selection of short video and
historic film clips, and not the more hackneyed ones. The only
problem here is the narration, which is occasionally silly and
sometimes dead wrong. I seriously doubt, for instance, that even
the most adroit grizzly bears have ever caught a fish by ``grabbing
it with their paw.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of sounds, while very large, is perhaps the most
bizarre thing about this strange encyclopedia. As with every entry
in it, there is no source, so it is left up to one's ear and
imagination as to exactly what is producing the sounds, most
particularly the music.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Mozart selections I listened to were produced
properly; ``Eiene Kleine Nachtmusik'' by full orchestra, the
``Rondo alla Turca'' by a grand piano. However, Schubert's ``Octet
for Winds'' appears to be played, if one can call it that, by toy
piano and hurdy-gurdy.
</P>
<P>
   The stranger the musical reproduction, the lower the volume with
which it is reproduced, one hopes due to embarrassment. At any
rate, after trying to figure out what was desecrating Handel, the
mating gurgle of the prairie chicken nearly blew me out of my
chair.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to like about this encyclopedia. However, the
overenthusiastic indexing will enrage any reasonably patient adult,
let alone a child, and there is just too much misinformation,
sloppy scholarship and plain silliness for it to merit a
recommendation.

 &HT;    Map sites on Web make charting your life easier

<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the help of a map, most of us can get very
confused.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when a map actually helps. You'll find maps
on the Web that will plot your route across town or across the
country. But the many sites on the Net that offer maps offer a lot
more than that. Many of the maps can be copied and then pasted into
homework assignments for geography and others offer you a chance to
better understand news stories that happen half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start our trip through the maps of the Web at a couple of
sites that offer help driving to a new location. One of the best is
MapQuest at http://www.mapquest.com. You can use the site without
joining, but you'll get additional services once you're a member.
Since membership is free, go ahead and enroll.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of the page is its ability to plot a
turn-by-turn course to a destination anywhere in the country.
Besides the map, you'll get a text description of the turns to
take. In fact, since the maps are relatively small and don't show
much detail (you can zoom in for more detail but sometimes end up
with a map that doesn't cover a large enough area to be helpful),
you'll find that the text is the best way to use the navigational
information.
</P>
<P>
   The routes plotted seem to be accurate and do a good job of
following a logical route. However, if you are familiar with an
area, you probably know a better way. However, if you're familiar
with an area, you probably don't need the map in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Another service that offers much the same service is AltaVista
Maps, run by the search engine company of the same name, at
http://maps.altavista.com/cgi-bin/mapcgi. Even though you probably
won't find much difference between the routes provided by these two
sites, it's handy to bookmark both. These are high traffic sites
and you may want an option if one site is particularly slow because
of online traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The next site _ called Create A Map at http://www.aquarius
</P>
<P>
   .geomar.de/omc/ _ may not be as useful in day-to-day life but is
enormous fun. You can build your own maps using this excellent
German site (most of the text here is in English as well as German
so you shouldn't have any trouble using the site) and manipulate
the way the map is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   You can, for instance, enter coordinates in latitude and
longitude and then select the map you want, including a
topographical map that shows ridges and features of the Earth. You
can also tell the site to include city names or to leave them out.
It's my guess that you'll spend a lot of time practicing map-making
here. And if you have children, this is a great way to teach them
geography.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever searched the Web for online maps, you know that
the place is the world's greatest repository of maps. So the ones
we've mentioned just scratch the surface of what's available.
That's why the next Web site is an enormous help for anyone
interested in maps.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Online Map Resources, and it is located at
http://www.geog.ukans.edu/map.htm. You'll find a plain-vanilla page
here that is filled with links to various places on the Web where
you'll find maps. You can, for instance, at the click of a mouse go
to the excellent University of Texas map site at
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Mapcollection/Map
</P>
<P>
   collection.html. There also are links to the Harvard University
map site at http://icg.harvard.edu/(tilde)maps/ and dozens of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Maps, you'll find, are a pleasant way to lose yourself for
hours.

 &HT;    Some communities are more orderly than others
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Community'' is a word that gets tossed around on the
Web almost as much as ``portal,'' ``commerce'' and ``IPO.''
However, if you ask three Web pundits what community is, you're
likely to get three different answers.
</P>
<P>
   TheGlobe.com (http://www.theglobe.com), GeoCities
(http://www.geocities.com), Tripod (http://www.tripod
</P>
<P>
   .com) and local sites such as AccessAtlanta
(http://www.accessatlanta.com) each invite users to build
special-interest home pages, add chat rooms and build a presence on
the Web. But while community has become the buzzword du jour, even
the folks at the Mining Company (http://www.miningco
</P>
<P>
   .com), which pioneered the notion of a networked collection of
special-interest Web sites, have trouble defining community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community is a much misunderstood concept,'' says Amanda Hass,
who works on program and community development for the Mining
Company. ``There's a lot of buzz about community, but if there
isn't a responsible guide in charge, that's not community, that's
anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Company aims for a more professional look and feel to
its sites and encourages its guides to build out their sites with
incentives. So far, the results have been good: Media Metrix ranks
the Mining Company the eighth most popular site on the Web in the
information/entertainment/news category.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Company believes hiring experienced guides to develop
and maintain special-interest sites is the answer to the anarchy of
random personal pages with no clear voice directing the information
on the site. The company recruits guides expert in areas ranging
from pregnancy and politics to rock music and rodeos, puts them
through a three-week online training period, then helps them set up
sites that provide users with chat, links, articles and even an
e-mailed newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, there were 642 guides with sites on the Mining
Company site. A recent peek at a site devoted to the impeachment
hearings assembled by guide Tim Hosfeldt is one of the most
complete collections of information and background on the Starr
investigation on the Web. Sites devoted to Canadian news and the
Beatles are equally comprehensive. If you need information, you'll
probably be able to find something you can use from a Mining
Company site.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the Mining Company's sites do it because they
love their subject matter, but there's also monetary compensation.
Guides get 40 percent of advertising revenue and transactions made
via partnerships with companies like online bookseller Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you define online community as a group of people who may or
may not know each other drawn together by an interest in a
particular subject, then the Mining Company is certainly a
community. However, as Hass points out, ``We were revolutionary
when we launched, but now more and more people are moving toward
our model.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says she sees no immediate threats from any community
sites or wannabes. ``We pioneered the model that made (the other
sites) possible. The problem is getting users to find you and love
you.''
</P>

 &HT;    Proper planning minimizes horror of holiday travel
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In less than seven days, most Americans will find
their dinner tables are bedecked with turkey and dressing.
Thanksgiving marks the beginning of our winter holiday season.
Unfortunately, more ``turkeys'' will take to our nation's highways
than will ever be stuffed or adorned with cranberry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, Thanksgiving is a heavier travel holiday than
Christmas. It's off to Grandma's or Aunt Ethyl's or Uncle Fred's or
whoever's house we go at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   What it means is travel by car will be a nightmare on the
Wednesday before Thanksgiving, as well as the Sunday afterward when
everyone is trying to squeeze just ``one more visit'' into their
long weekend itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   As if just plain old everyday traffic wasn't bad enough for most
folks, how are you to deal with the additional pressures of holiday
travel?
</P>
<P>
   My first advice is to plan ahead. Don't start packing the car 20
minutes before you plan to leave. Get each of your family members
to get their acts together at least the day before. That will allow
one organized person to make sure everything fits neatly and safely
in your vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Packages on the shelf or rolling around on the floor are not a
good idea. In the event of an accident, they can become deadly
projectiles. In ordinary driving, they can greatly impair
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   A bright idea _ clean your lights
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of visibility, take a few minutes to make sure all your
vehicle's lights are in working order. That includes turns signals,
brake lights and headlights. And every time you buy gas, clean not
only your windows, but your headlights as well. A dirty windshield
or window is like wax paper _ you can't see through it very well.
Dirty headlight lenses can reduce your lights' illumination
capability by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve stress during the drive, make sure you allow ample
time to arrive at your destination with frequent stops, especially
if you are traveling with children or senior citizens. Long spans
of sitting not only rile tempers but play havoc on well-used
joints. You will also find that breaks improve the driver's
disposition and greatly reduce the temptation to retaliate when you
encounter one of the Thanksgiving ``turkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are confronted by one of these ``turkeys,'' please
remember two wrongs don't make a right. It could not only
jeopardize your safety, but that of everyone in your vehicle. Just
take a deep breath, look for the nearest exit and treat yourself to
a little timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the holidays are hectic times and we all have schedules to
keep, but remember your most important agenda is to reach your
destination safely. Common sense will always be the responsibility
of the person behind the steering wheel. Please don't let the
advances of even one ``turkey'' take the stuffing out of your
holiday.

 &HT;    It's that time of year for `best of' lists
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You can always tell the holiday season is around the
corner when computer magazines start running the ``best of'' lists.
The first out of the gate this year is PC World, which features the
best computer CDs and DVDs in its December issue. The magazine's
top 10 titles include Microsoft's Encarta Reference Suite 99, an
electronic encyclopedia that retails for $100. Other picks include
Access Software's golf game ``Links LS 1999,'' Blizzard
Entertainment's ``StarCraft'' and National Geographic Maps from
Mindscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, the magazine's editors decided to
test a boast by Apple's Steve Jobs that his new iMac was faster
than the quickest Pentium II PC. They pitted the iMac against the
most expensive Pentium and a system that was $300 less than the
iMac, which retails for $1,299. The iMac finished last in every
test against both of these PCs. The magazine concluded Jobs' boast
was ``pure hype.'' It did find, though, the iMac is indeed the
easiest computer to set up and get going on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   If rock musicians can do it, how about the star of a 1980s video
game? Hasbro Interactive is hoping so in its re-release of
``Centipede'' in the form of a computer CD. ``Centipede'' made its
debut as an Atari video game. Now Hasbro has souped it up with 3-D
graphics and new game play. Now you don't just blow away the evil
Centipedes but must also rescue the Wee People threatened by them.
Available only for PCs with operating systems Windows 95 or newer,
``Centipede'' retails for about $40.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it seems you're never too young for your first
computer game. For the holiday season, Fisher-Price has released a
new game for children as young as three. It's called the ``Little
People Christmas Activity Center.'' The game is a two-computer CD
set that lets kids make holiday cards, gift tags and wrapping
paper. There also are printing activities and other games. The game
works with both PCs and Macs and retails for $9.99 if you buy
another Fisher-Price title.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   It's the dawn of the holiday season but not everyone is happy.
Just check out the Web. Sadly, it has become a breeding ground for
hate groups. Now you can keep up with what sites to avoid and steer
your children clear of. The site is called Hatewatch. You'll find
it at http://www.hatewatch.org.

 &HT;    `Deer Avenger' targets humor
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So far, most computer games have been devoted to
digitizing what we do, paying taxes, playing football, flying
planes and hunting deer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, companies are coming out with games for your PC that make
fun of what we do. ``Deer Avenger,'' a CD-ROM by Simon &AMP; Schuster
Interactive, is expected out by Thanksgiving, still in time for
deer hunting season in most states. The game is a parody of the
popular ``Deer Hunter'' series. It is written by Brian McCann, a
writer for ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD can be installed or played off your CD-ROM drive. The
game gives you the option of hunting in Connecticut, Minnesota or
West Virginia. ``Come for the hunting, stay for the wacky, dancing,
banjo-playing in-bred freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   After choosing your hunting locale, you pick a weapon: bazooka,
rifle or slingshot. Then you look for hunters; telltale signs
include stacks of magazines, tree markings and a roll of toilet
paper. Once you've chosen an area in which to focus your hunt, you
can click the ``Call'' icon to ferret out your hunter. Calls
include, ``Free tickets to a Molly Hatchet reunion concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a hunter is out in the open, you click on the ``aim'' icon
and shoot. Which is not as easy as it sounds. Your mouse controls
the sights and you click to fire, but the game makes your mouse
very sensitive. Missed shots elicit trash talk from the CD-ROM,
including, ``I've seen better shots in the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM has a suggested retail of $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the get-go
</P>
<P>
   So, you finally give in to the crush and drop your $1,500 on
your first PC. Then it doesn't work. According to a survey in the
October issue of Windows magazine, you're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13 percent of all new computers either fail to start on
their first boot or they ship with bad parts.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway were evaluated the strongest:
92 percent of Hewlett-Packard users had computers that worked fine
from the jump; 91 percent of Dell and Gateway's customers also had
bug-free start-ups. The industry average was 87 percent. NEC and
Packard Bell were among the companies rated ``poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked 6,000 of the magazine's readers, 2,925 of whom
responded. People were asked to comment on their computer's
performance and the technical support provided by the manufacturer.
Most of the machines, 73 percent, were less than 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is probably off newsstands, but it can be read online
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .winmag.com/library/1998/1001/Fea0044
</P>
<P>
   .htm.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing with the Gray Wave
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's Gray Wave is the focus of the November/December
issue of Modern Maturity magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The feature looks at how seniors can get the system that best
suits them. It looks at the technology needs of four different
types of people _ high-end users, average users, low-average users
and low-end users.
</P>
<P>
   A separate section breaks down the essential technology
questions, like ``Mac or PC?'' Also included is a glossary of 13
words to help take the ``techno'' out of ``technospeak.''
</P>
<P>
   Four famous people _ Ed Bradley, Francis Ford Coppola, Newt
Gingrich and Martha Stewart _ tell what computers add to their
lives. Gingrich uses a Compaq and tells of writing his third book
by e-mailing chapters to his editor.
</P>
<P>
   A site for smart kids
</P>
<P>
   A new online site devoted to education products for kids was
unveiled recently.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.smarterkids.com sells software, books, games, toys
and services geared for kids preschool through ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Products can be chosen based on a child's educational goals,
learning style, ratings and educational approach. User registration
is via e-mail or phone contact with consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Correct address
</P>
<P>
   The Web site address for Whole World Theatre's broadcast of
``Last Hour Live,'' was listed incorrectly last week. The correct
address is http://www.ibtv.net.

 &HT;    Compton's on CD-ROM varies widely in quality
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We'll begin looking at the new editions of electronic
encyclopedias with Compton's two-disc Encyclopedia Deluxe for 1999,
which overflows with multimedia productions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it also provides more nonsense than any
dependable encyclopedia ought to have. It is perhaps the most
uneven CD-ROM encyclopedia I've seen, ranging from excellence to
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The interface is quite glitzy and easy to use, and has the same
kind of slide-down menu lists that Microsoft introduced with its
encyclopedia, Encarta, several years ago. There are all the usual
facets _ World Wide Web links, various research aids, an atlas, a
historical time line and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   I ran my more or less standard tests, searching for obscure
subjects in which I have a special interest.
</P>
<P>
   Under flamenco, Compton's provides five responses. The first is
a one-sentence description of the term that is partially incorrect
and entirely useless. The second comes under the heading of
Dance-Spain, and the second of its two paragraphs provides an
absurd description of flamenco.
</P>
<P>
   Within this window, however, there is a link to ``Music _
Spanish Flamenco,'' which brings us a silly photograph, a snatch of
guitar playing and a brief but reasonably cogent description of the
art.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the links lead to a pair of passing references to
castanets, which are not really flamenco at all, and the longest
text block of all _ a biography of Carlos Montoya, a guitarist of
no real significance whose fame rested entirely in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for ``Australia'' points up the preposterous indexing
this encyclopedia uses. The list of references brought up is
interminable. There are, for instance, a few articles on the more
significant snakes to be found on the continent. But there is an
index entry for every last serpent's son of them, and most of them
merely take you to the bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   There is an extensive and very nice selection of short video and
historic film clips, and not the more hackneyed ones. The only
problem here is the narration, which is occasionally silly and
sometimes dead wrong. I seriously doubt, for instance, that even
the most adroit grizzly bears have ever caught a fish by ``grabbing
it with their paw.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of sounds, while very large, is perhaps the most
bizarre thing about this strange encyclopedia. As with every entry
in it, there is no source, so it is left up to one's ear and
imagination as to exactly what is producing the sounds, most
particularly the music.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Mozart selections I listened to were produced
properly; ``Eiene Kleine Nachtmusik'' by full orchestra, the
``Rondo alla Turca'' by a grand piano. However, Schubert's ``Octet
for Winds'' appears to be played, if one can call it that, by toy
piano and hurdy-gurdy.
</P>
<P>
   The stranger the musical reproduction, the lower the volume with
which it is reproduced, one hopes due to embarrassment. At any
rate, after trying to figure out what was desecrating Handel, the
mating gurgle of the prairie chicken nearly blew me out of my
chair.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to like about this encyclopedia. However, the
overenthusiastic indexing will enrage any reasonably patient adult,
let alone a child, and there is just too much misinformation,
sloppy scholarship and plain silliness for it to merit a
recommendation.

 &HT;    Higher costs for elder care, but fewer answers
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Taking care of elderly parents was once relegated to
kitchen-table discussions. But today, the issue is reshaping the
American workplace as employees and employers grapple with this
demographic time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one in four U.S. households have responsibility for caring
for elderly kin; most caregivers work full time. In the next decade
or so, as the senior population explodes with aging baby boomers,
elder care responsibilities will hit one in two households.
</P>
<P>
   For business, the issue is clear: Will it be prepared?
</P>
<P>
   Already, the cost to corporate America is high _ some $12
billion annually in absenteeism and lost productivity from workers
taking care of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   But most businesses have no formal elder care policies.
</P>
<P>
   That can cause pain for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Former CNN news writer Clint Deloatch had a promising career in
the news business. Fifteen years in all, first at CNN and then at
Headline News as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   But the metro Atlantan's career was sidetracked after his
diabetic, 70-year-old mother had a leg amputated. He and his eight
siblings had put together what they thought was a workable
schedule, with weekly rotations for caregiving. His parents live in
Margarettsville, N.C., a six-hour drive from Atlanta. Sometimes, he
would return from visiting his parents, grab a few hours' sleep and
then rush to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it puts a lot of strain on you,'' said Deloatch,
who now manages a natural products store in Hapeville. ``When
you're at work, you really want to concentrate on your job, but
believe me, when it's your mother you're not thinking a whole lot
about work. ... Suppose your mom dies and you're down there working
at a desk at CNN? What kind of kid are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Deloatch, 41, didn't realize his work was suffering until he was
called into his supervisor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of my work had dropped off terribly,'' said
Deloatch. Headline News already had announced it was cutting jobs.
So Deloatch and his supervisor discussed the matter and agreed that
Deloatch could leave the company with a severance package.
``Luckily, they were willing to work with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving a job should be a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   That's why more businesses will develop elder care strategies,
such as allowing more people to work out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is still relatively new,'' said Danny Devine, a
spokesman for the Employee Benefit Research Institute. While 85
percent of companies offer child care benefits, only one-third
offer elder care programs, largely in the form of resource and
referral services. A handful offer long-term care insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But elder care could outstrip child care as the next
millennium's key workplace issue. It takes a lot more in time and
energy to care for an elderly person than it does to care for a
child, because if an elderly person needs care, it is usually
associated with a health problem. Baby boomers, the biggest pool of
working caregivers, will demand change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the American work force developed with more mothers coming
into the work force, child care became an issue over a period of
time,'' Devine said. ``With baby boomers having to care for their
parents, elder care will become an even bigger issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are starting to realize that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ford Motor Co., which has a plant in Hapeville, Ga., has an
elder care consultation and referral service. Employees call a
toll-free number and can get information about nursing homes and
Alzheimer's disease and talk to social workers who specialize in
gerontology issues. Workers can also make flexible working
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   _ GE Capital Services offers on-site caregiver fairs. They are
usually four hours and include exhibits by elder care service
vendors and informational sessions.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Lucent Technologies, elder care has become a ``growing
concern'' for the company's 136,000 workers, said spokesman Bill
Price.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has a group in its human resources department that
focuses on work and family issues. Workers who call a company
hotline receive a kit that explains the elder care issue and
identifies nursing homes in different geographical regions.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its unions also support a family care
development fund. The fund contributes to community-based dependent
care programs. In Oklahoma, for example, money was used to
refurbish a kitchen in an adult day care center.
</P>
<P>
   For James Price Jr., a project manager for National Accounts
Service Co. in Atlanta, flex-time has been a key to balancing work
with caring for his parents and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   His supervisor sometimes lets him work from home and understands
when Price has to take time to check on his parents or take them to
medical appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very flexible,'' he said. ``You can't expect a
person to work when they're distracted like that. The best thing to
do is let them take care of what they need to do and then come back
fully focused. That motivates you to be more productive. I try to
make a commitment to myself to get at least my eight hours of work
in, whether it's here or at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that continue to ignore elder care as a workplace
issue will pay a steep price _ one that will only escalate _ as
they lose productive workers to depression and other negative
emotions that sometimes accompany caregiving, as well as to
debilitating physical ailments such as back pain, sleeplessness and
stomach disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are becoming caregivers as more and more
live longer,'' said Karen Wilson, executive director of the
Levittown, Pa.-based Children of Aging Parents, which organizes
support groups for caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Most workers can't afford professional caregivers. For the
workplace, that means higher rates of absenteeism, workday
interruptions and even replacing employees as they deal with elder
care crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sitting in your office and all of a sudden your
mother can't find her medicine or she's sick,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go to your department head and say you need half
an hour to go see how your mom is. Some are understanding and some
aren't. You may have to quit and the company has just lost a
valued, trained employee. And we're just now starting to get to the
tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Several metro Atlanta callers to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution
hotline complained of unequal treatment when caregiving involved an
elderly relative, instead of a child.
</P>
<P>
   One caller said his boss gave him a hard time when he needed to
take the day off to care for his mother, who was injured in a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that if I didn't come in, I couldn't be assured of
a job. If a parent has a child who is sick, they're happy to let
them go. I'm tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even workers with compassionate employers feel the strain.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Arlene Stevens' ailing, 81-year-old mother came
to live with her and her two children, both of whom are in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought it (taking care of her) would be an issue,''
said Stevens, a sales account executive at First Data Corp. Last
year, her mother suffered lung, heart and kidney failure, and
doctors said she would not be able to live on her own _ in a third
floor walk-up apartment in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nerves are shot,'' said Stevens, whose children help out
when they're home. But when they're gone: ``It's me, me and me. I
can't quit my job to become a nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said her employer has been good about giving her time
off and flexible hours when she needs them. She has made
arrangements to have her mother picked up and taken to medical
appointments, when needed. Right now, her mother is mobile and can
manage daily tasks for herself, such as making light meals.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens could take time off under the Family Medical Leave Act
and even take half days if needed. But with a sales job, that can
be difficult and costly. Too much time off means a loss in
commission, something she can't afford with two kids in school.
</P>
<P>
   And even with an understanding boss, Stevens knows there are
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't keep taking time off or maybe they might not be so
understanding,'' she said.

 &HT;    Remember, caregivers' lives have value, too
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pace yourself. A sprint can turn into a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the most important lessons I learned after my
86-year-old mother moved in with us because she no longer could
take care of herself. Congestive heart failure had turned this
fiercely independent widow into a contradiction of time _ her body
could no longer keep up with her mind.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some illnesses, this one had no predictable
timetable. At first, it looked like she had only three to six
months to live. But then she stabilized, partly because her
ever-weakening heart had less pumping to do in our house than it
had been doing in her own. No more dusting furniture or mopping the
kitchen floor at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   If my wife and I had not set a slower pace called for by the
indefinite nature of my mother's disease, we would have spent
ourselves too quickly. That would have undermined the very reason
we took my mother in _ to avoid a nursing home and the guilt I
would have had for putting her there.
</P>
<P>
   So we had no choice. We had to adapt for the long haul. We had
to live as normally as we could, recognizing that would be a
challenge. We both continued to work. And we were intent on not
letting this new responsibility take away from our 9-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half my mother lived with us before she died,
we learned many lessons the hard way. Hopefully, some of them will
help if you get involved in a similar situation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand why you're doing it. As an only child, I knew I
would never be able to put my mother in a nursing home. I explained
this to my wife, Margaret, who understood and told me to do what I
thought was right. Whenever we grew weary of the responsibility, we
tried to focus on the reason we were doing it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get used to changing roles. My mother did not like being a
dependent person and, to her detriment, often rebelled against the
situation. She would attempt to load and unload the dishwasher. But
just taking the dishes out of the dishwasher and placing them in
the kitchen cabinet caused her quite a bit of huffing and puffing.
The doctor told her that her heart had only a limited number of
ticks left, and that she should spend them more wisely _ like
playing cards and board games with my son, Max.
</P>
<P>
   While she loved doing that, she had a hard time not doing
housework. It was a ritual as entrenched as brushing her teeth. At
first, we came down hard on her, which accomplished nothing. Then
we backed off. But we let her know that she needed to come to grips
with her new situation. Slowly she began to give up the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   She also began to understand that she could play other vital
roles, such as helping Max with his homework or baby-sitting while
Margaret and I went out. That gave us a needed break and made her
feel like an important member of the household.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Margaret and I needed to adjust. My mother
often treated my wife and I like we were 10 years old. Every time
we left the house, she needed to know where we were going and when
we would return. We had to learn to politely answer the questions
and then scream as loudly as we could when we got into the car. And
if our plans changed, we would have to call home to tell my mother.
There's nothing like repeating your childhood all over again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accept that the balance of power shifts. My mother wasn't used
to taking direction from anyone, let alone from her son. And I
wasn't used to parenting my mother. But as her health deteriorated,
she became more irresponsible. I had to take control of her
finances and her checkbook. I had to take control of her daily drug
log to make sure she was taking all of her pills.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret joked that we now had two kids, a 9-year-old and an
86-year-old, and the 86-year-old was the problem child. It's
amazing how many guilt trips my mother tried to run on me to get
her way. On several occasions, she threatened to go back to living
by herself when that was physically impossible. I had to be firm
and set the rules. If she blew up, so be it. She'd cool back down
again in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't feel guilty about living your life. If you don't live it
fully, you probably won't survive the long haul. Margaret and I
continued to go out by ourselves on occasion. If we didn't, we
would have strangled my mother. As Margaret and I shared our
feelings and worked as a team, our marriage grew stronger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never underestimate the value of humor. My mother was living
with us for about six months when she was diagnosed with cancer.
``Cancer, schmancer,'' we would joke. She was one of the lucky
ones, we would say, because she could actually play God and choose
whether she wanted to die from cancer or heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turn negatives into positives. My son learned lifelong lessons
about responsibility and what it means to be a family. He learned
about the aging process and that death is a part of life. He
learned how to help my mother walk up and down steps.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he learned how to inject medicine. That's right. My
mother had a permanent intravenous line put in her arm so she could
receive medical treatment at home on a regular basis. The hospice
nurse taught Max how to sterilize the line and then inject the
medicine using a needleless syringe. Max did this on a daily basis,
which meant the nurse didn't have to come every day. He'll never
forget this.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't go there. As my mother grew weaker, she needed help
taking a bath. It was very important for us not to perform that
role. Certain boundaries shouldn't be crossed. A nurse's aide was
the solution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek help. You can't do it alone. A wonderful neighbor checked
in on my mother every day while we were at work. Also, the hospice
agency sent a nurse's aide five days a week for about an hour a
day. A nurse came on an as-needed basis, but at least a few times a
week. Make sure you have a doctor you can communicate with because
he or she can access a variety of medical and social services to
help you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Let your boss know. Taking care of an elderly parent is a lot
different from taking care of a sick child. There are usually more
medical tests, more doctor visits, more complications and more
hospital stays. You might have to take time off in the middle of
the day to handle some of these things, and then make up the work
some other time. If you have an understanding boss, it can really
reduce your anxiety level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have an escape room. Luckily, we have three bedrooms. Max and
my mother slept downstairs in separate rooms, and my wife and I
were upstairs. Being able to escape to our room after my mother
would run her latest guilt trip was critical to our mental health.
Remember, your house is no longer yours when your mother is there.
In fact, I can remember several times when I returned to work to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   _ Settle the score. Don't wait until it's too late to tell your
mother your feelings about her. We were able to use her stay to
talk about some of the wonderful times we had together. I told her
how much I appreciated her putting cardboard in her shoes so she
could save enough money to send me to summer camp when I was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   My mother lived just long enough to see another generation enjoy
camp. On her deathbed, she held on and waited for Max to return
from a three-week stay at summer camp so she could see him one last
time. A few hours later, she died. She was at peace, and so were
we.

 &HT;    The never-ending back and forth _ but Mom has last word
 &HT;    By Elizabeht Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Remind me never to go shopping with my son
again. Each time I do, it's just like the time before. Only worse.
The size of the purchase makes no difference. Our exchanges heat up
just the same whether it's computers or sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Computer discussion. Me: I don't want that one. I want this one.
Him: Why? Me: Because it's black. He says nothing, rolls his eyes
at the salesman, and I wind up with a gray computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaker discussion. Him: You should get the yellow ones. Me: No.
Him: Why not? Me: I don't like yellow high tops. I'm too old to go
around looking like Whoopi Goldberg. Him: The yellow ones are
better shoes and they're on sale. Me: I don't care if they're
giving them away _ they're ugly. Him: (raising both eyebrows)
You're entering a beauty contest or something? (Anybody need a pair
</P>
<P>
   of goldenrod high tops, size 7?)
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the discussion begins, the end is predictable. I
climb onto something tall _ a footstool, a packing crate, anything
handy so I can get eye-to-eye with this twerp who had the nerve to
outgrow his old lady by a foot and then some _ and treat him to a
refresher course on Mothering 101. ``I was picking out my own stuff
when Eisenhower was president.'' He grins, sighs,
</P>
<P>
   wraps his arm around the top of my head and asks how I got along
without him all of those years.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago we went stereo shopping. Him: What do you think
of this one? Me: I don't like it. Him: Why not? The sound is great.
Just listen to the ... (he rattles off a bunch of stuff I've never
heard of as the salesman nods smug agreement _ a guy thing I
guess). Me: Don't want it. Him: (serious expression
</P>
<P>
   meaning he's not fooling around any more) Mother, you have a tin
ear. Me: I know that. That's why my '49 Magnavox still sounds
pretty good to me. Him: Then let me pick out the machine for you.
Me: (shoulders slumped and hangdog pose) OK. Him: (to the salesman)
We'll take that one. Me: The ugly one? Him: It's the sound that
counts. (Dinah Washington is sounding great but looking bad.)
</P>
<P>
   And now it's time for a monumental decision, one I never should
have brought up until it was a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago over dinner, a discussion that began innocently
enough with the salad course, grew into a killer skirmish over
grilled halibut, and threatened to become World War 3 by dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Me: I think it's time to buy a new car. Him: Have you really
thought about this? Me: What's to think? The Bronco's 12-years old.
Him: You can't just spring something like this on me. I need time
to think it over. Me: Think what over? You're buying, maybe? You've
got until morning. Him: (the eye roll thing again).
</P>
<P>
   At breakfast he blinks his bloodshot baby blues and tells me
he's spent half the night on the Internet looking up car
information so he'll know exactly what I want. I tell him he
shouldn't have bothered _ he should've asked.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he thinks I'm joking and launches into a long-winded,
one-sided discussion of a bunch of boring statistics. I tell him
he's talking about an old-lady car. He says wait five minutes and
I'll be one. I take a swipe at him, spill coffee on a
computer-generated picture of a family sedan and declare the
discussion over. He babbles on. My eyes glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   Him: Mother, you're not listening. Me: Got that right. Him: All
right, tell me what kind of a car you want. Me: A black one. Him:
Mom, this is a car we're talking about, not a computer and black
isn't a ``kind'' it's a color. Me: What's your point?
</P>
<P>
   He's exasperated. I'm irritated _ hoping this discussion is over
and kicking myself for having brought it up in the first place. But
I have to have the last word. It's a mother thing.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Son, if I'd had this much trouble picking out kids you'd
have had whiskers before I ever brought you home. Him: (with a sly
chuckle) Do you remember what kind of a car you were driving?
</P>
<P>
   Of course I do, but I'd never tell him. It was a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   BORING.

 &HT;    Today's kids need more of a chance to build gadgets and gizmos
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week I spoke to one of the toughest and most
intelligent audiences I have faced in awhile. I've made my share of
speeches, dabbled in national TV, once had a radio talk show and
still do weekly work on WCNN radio, but all that is easy. Last week
I was sweating bullets and working hard just to understand the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to three classes of sixth-graders, all enrolled in one
of those modern programs that fast-tracks especially bright kids.
By the time I finished the third class I was exhausted ... just
staying up with the questions (we talked about everything from
celestial navigation to the possible social consequences of virtual
reality) left me thinking I could never return to teaching. I don't
have the endurance.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every category, these kids were brighter than high
school students of my generation (I'm middle-aged and getting past
the middle part fast). But in visiting with some of the kids in the
hallway, I realized there was one category in which bright students
of today lag my generation. And the more I thought about it, the
more I decided it was an important failing.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a kid _ back in the days when the Rocky Mountains
were young _ kids built things. There were great companies such as
Allied Radio and Heathkit that offered build-it-yourself projects
such as radios, hi-fidelity audio and even TV sets. One of the most
popular Christmas gifts was another form of do-it-yourself
experimenting, a chemistry set (preferably by Gilbert). And erector
sets were big. Not all the building involved a kit; most kids knew
how to make a radio set using a razor blade.
</P>
<P>
   If the bright kids I visited with are any indicator, kits are
out these days. Instead, that experimental energy goes into
creating Web pages and learning about the Internet and playing
video games. None of those things is bad. In fact, I would argue
that they're terrific. But there is a whole generation growing up
missing the delight of actually creating a gadget from pieces of
bell wire, pencil leads and razor blades.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. This isn't the fault of the kids. Most
electronic gadgets these days would be almost impossible to
construct at home. Instead of great big resistors with nice wire
ends, there are little bitty parts _ small enough so that you could
hold 12 of 'em on your fingernail _ that use a technology called
surface mount. These parts are attached directly _ without wires in
most cases _ to the circuit board. Working at this almost
microscopic level is next to impossible at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of basic-level electronic construction is
important. I keep thinking of conversations I've had with
engineers, and most of them started out building gadgets in the
basement. I worry that we'll grow up with a generation of software
gurus who don't know to grab the cool end of a soldering iron.
Maybe I'm way out in space here, but I think that the building gap
will eventually matter. Maybe that has already started.
</P>
<P>
   I was at the University of North Carolina's computer lab awhile
back, and I spent some time chatting with the fellow who ran the
joint. He explained that, a few years back, a lot of the hardware
in the lab was either built or assembled by graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, he said, he had turned to outside contractors
since not enough kids knew how to do the work. He was quick to
praise the intelligence of the students and said that they could
write computer programs in C++ until the world looked flat. But
most of them didn't know the difference between a capacitor and a
beanie hat.
</P>
<P>
   If any of this hits home and if you have a kid or know one, you
can help. Electronics kits still exist. And chemistry sets and
microscope sets abound. You'll be buying holiday gifts anyway and,
by giving a kit, you'll be building more than the gadget itself.

 &HT;    The ALICO tower has stood the test of time, and more
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The December Texas Highways magazine is out
containing a readers' poll about the best places in Texas. Waco is
not one of them according to this list. That may offend some, but
is somewhat understandable.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio and the Alamo ring the bell as favorite destination
and attraction, understandably. Big Bend gets raves for camping and
hiking, Barton Springs for swimming, Brenham for wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Waco does not have crowd-pleasing assets like ocean-front
property or historic battlegrounds (unless you count Floyd Casey
Stadium among the latter). It does not have migrating cranes
wintering on marshland as does Port Aransas. It does not have
auburn canyons or mountain vistas. Yes, I have a son in a school
called Mountainview. I hope no one slips a disk looking for one
there.
</P>
<P>
   But Waco does have a lot of good stuff, and I'm surprised to see
almost none of it mentioned by the readers of Texas Highways.
</P>
<P>
   If Waco intends to get mentioned or noticed, it's going to have
to go out and make itself noticed:
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's 125 acres
</P>
<P>
   The magazine has 19 categories for favorite things to see or
visit. Several categories seemingly would have ``Cameron Park''
written all over them, if anyone in Texas knew where Cameron Park
was.
</P>
<P>
   It could be one of Texas' best places to walk or hike (first
place, Big Bend, followed by San Antonio's River Walk). Its chalk
cliffs could be considered contenders for ``most unusual sight.''
(Enchanted Rock ranks No. 1.) Certainly its mammoth dig could be as
interesting one of these days as are Glenn Rose's dinosaur tracks,
which log in at No. 5 as ``most unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite dramatic improvements at the park, Cameron Park is
underused and underappreciated even by the people in its own city.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Baylor history students last spring came forward with
a set of excellent recommendations to increase use of the park and
to better inform citizens about its history, social and geological.
</P>
<P>
   If, as the students say in their report, ``Cameron Park is
Waco,'' that explains why Waco's charms are among Texas' best-kept
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Zoological wonders
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Cameron Park, opponents of putting a zoo in there
warned that it would destroy the park's natural qualities. In fact,
the Cameron Park Zoo has heightened the park's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Highways poll rates San Antonio's as Texas' best zoo,
followed by Fort Worth, Brownsville, Houston and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Waco's zoo couldn't be considered a contender at this time. But
its time may come. Every time one returns to the Cameron Park Zoo
it seems something new has been added. The next big addition is the
African lion exhibit, scheduled to open next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo director Larry Groth and the Cameron Park Zoological Society
talk up ambitous plans _ 2,500 animals, rivaling the 3,000 of San
Antonio's zoo. Speaking as a customer, however: Numbers alone don't
impress me. Ambience. Preserve the ambience.
</P>
<P>
   22 stories of history
</P>
<P>
   Waco missed a chance for recognition when Texas Highways readers
were polled on ``most beautiful building'' and ``best historic site
or building.'' Color me provincial, but the ALICO tower deserves
mention among Texas' storied structures.
</P>
<P>
   History? The tower that Artemus Roberts built in 1911 to
withstand a ``hurricane load'' took a killer tornado head-on in
1953 and then stood watch over a downtown reduced to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   It was Texas' first skyscraper and at one time the tallest
building west of the Mississippi. It remains as conspicuous as the
Jolly Green Giant among Keebler elves. How do you miss it?
</P>
<P>
   Museum garden grows
</P>
<P>
   One of the few mentions Waco gets in the Texas Highways poll is
the No. 8 ranking of the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame and Museum in
the ``best museum'' category. The Kimball Art Museum in Fort Worth
is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet the recognition for the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame
comes from people for whom it's been a while since their last
look-see in Waco. They would be further impressed by the way the
Ranger Hall looks since that last stop.
</P>
<P>
   Probably when they made that last stop the Dr Pepper Museum was
either an empty warehouse or a germinating seed of a museum, and
the Texas Sports Hall of Fame was a vacant lot and the Helen Marie
Taylor Museum on Jefferson Avenue was an abandoned school poised
for the wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   Helpful folks
</P>
<P>
   The readers of Texas Highways ranked San Antonio tops in the
category ``friendliest town or city'', nudging out Fredericksburg
by one vote. Others in order were Fort Worth, New Braunfels,
Austin, Lubbock, Houston, College Station, Amarillo and San Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, being ranked as a friendly town requires reasons for
people to pull off the interstate for more than chicken planks and
a Gordita.
</P>
<P>
   Waco doesn't do enough to convey that. But some of its people
still manage to impress. Witness the letter received recently from
Linda Spearman of Waco. She raved over the treatment she got from
two cart pushers at the Bellmead Wal-Mart. They replaced her flat
tire in the store parking lot. She only got their first names _ Ken
and Jeff. We got their last names, Meeker and Kroll.
</P>
<P>
   Ken and Jeff say they've replaced tires, jump-started vehicles,
helped locked-out customers get into their cars and done whatever
needs to be done. Good work, guys. A recount, Texas Highways?

 &HT;    Presidents' pilot remembers JFK
 &HT;    By Jim Reeder
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM CITY, Fla. _ Bill Shaw, like everyone who was old enough at
the time, remembers where he was 35 years ago when news came that
President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But if the memory is a little more painful for Shaw, it's
because he knew and served Kennedy as an Army helicopter pilot
assigned to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The retired Army major was at the controls 35 years ago this
weekend when Kennedy flew from the White House to Andrews Air Force
Base for his flight to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' Shaw said. ``We'll never know how great he might
have been had he lived.''
</P>
<P>
   That last helicopter flight with Kennedy was unusual because the
president's son, John F. Kennedy Jr., was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``John-John, as he was known, was crying,'' Shaw said. ``The
Secret Service kept him aboard the helicopter and away from the
press after his parents got off, then took him back to the White
House by car.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was off-duty the next day, Nov. 22, 1963, and heard the
news from Dallas on his car radio while picking up building
supplies for a project at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 50 years from now they'll finally find the truth about
what happened,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw flew for Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon
from 1958 to 1973 during a White House career that was interrupted
by two tours of duty in Vietnam in 1962 and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The walls and shelves of Shaw's house are filled with
autographed photos and other memorabilia _ playing cards, tie
clips, matchbooks and other souvenirs with the presidential seal.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are is a photo of JFK and Jackie taken in Palm Beach,
which Mrs. Kennedy signed and sent to Shaw after the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   His most prized possession in is an autographed, leather-bound
copy of Kennedy's Pulitzer-Prize winning book, Profiles in Courage.
SEE NOTE AT TOP
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in California once and Kennedy ordered the limousine
to stop because he wanted some ice cream,'' Shaw said. ``He didn't
have any money and borrowed a dollar from a Secret Service agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clerk refused to sell him the ice cream unless he
autographed the dollar bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Name a major political figure from the past four decades and his
or her picture is probably on the wall of Shaw's mini-museum.
</P>
<P>
   If Shaw could pick any of the four presidents he knew, which
would he prefer to have dinner with?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon,'' came the quick reply. ``He was so down to earth and
personable, a regular guy. He would go out of his way to say thank
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the people I knew, Pat Nixon was the nicest and right
behind her was Lady Bird Johnson,'' Shaw said. ``LBJ almost never
said thank you, but one time Lady Bird grabbed him by the arm, spun
him around and made him come back to thank the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has remained active since his retirement from the Army. He
served on the Danbury, Conn., city council and has been active in
Martin County politics since moving here six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of Citizens Against Project Aeroplex, which
battled a proposed airport west of Palm City.

the thatched-roof homes off the shore or buried them in the tons of

   ILLEGALMAKEUP _ The morning wake-up/make-up ritual is much
easier for Kathy Summerford these days. The Canton, Ga., nurse used
to struggle to make the best of her thin lips and meager eyebrows.
She changed that permanently in April when she had her eyebrows
tattooed and her pale lips outlined with permanent pigmentation.
Summerford is pleased with her appearance now, but was less than
thrilled to find out that parts of the procedures she had done are
illegal in Georgia, because they weren't performed by a licensed
physician. Although a state law passed in 1990 forbids any
tattooing within an inch of an eye socket by anyone other than a
licensed doctor, the procedure has grown in popularity in recent
years, and is performed by technicians in the metro Atlanta area
who work in doctors' offices, as well as spas and clinics. A look
at what is - and is not - legal in the permanent makeup business.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 23 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A major business development, AOL's nearly consummated purchase
of Netscape, leads at USA Today, the Washington Post and the Los
Angeles Times. The move also gets a front-page leader at the Wall
Street Journal. (According to the AP, the Journal online edition
and the new Newsweek broke the story.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times puts the story above the fold, but leads with
Iraq's latest weapons inspection snit and off-leads with word that
driven by budget constraints as much as by the reduced threat of
nuclear attack, the Pentagon is quietly recommending unilateral
reductions in U.S. nuclear warheads. Both the NYT and LAT go
top-front with the same picture of Bill Clinton: At the Korean DMZ
complete with howitzer backdrop, decked out in scrambled-eggs
ball-cap and Army field jacket, he's doing a grip-and-grin with a
bunch of soldiers. Judging by his 105mm smile, he's finally
enjoying the military lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The papers report that the AOL/Netscape deal is actually
triangular, with AOL buying Netscape for about $4 billion in stock
and then licensing Netscape's e-commerce software to Sun
Microsystems, which hopes to use it as a vehicle for disseminating
its Java language as an alternative to Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody reports that the deal could have big ramifications for
Microsoft, with USAT making the point that the deal formally bonds
three companies whose charges that Microsoft uses monopoly power to
block competitors' products have played central roles in the
current anti-trust trial. Indeed, the NYT says that the companies
were emboldened to deal because of their perception that the case
would weaken MS.
</P>
<P>
   But USAT quotes a Microsoft spokesman's claim that the deal
would ``blow an enormous hole in the government's case,'' because
it shows that MS' competitors have retained the ability to change
the landscape overnight--in ways that the government claims is
illegal when Microsoft tries it. The LAT and WSJ make this point
too but the Journal adds that on the other hand, the government
could argue that Netscape was driven into AOL's arms by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   USAT's front reports that one of the highest-ranking female law
enforcement officials in the government, a higher-up at Treasury,
is being investigated to see if she used her position to steer
government business to a subordinate who is a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   The WP front covers a lawsuit in which a man is suing a woman
for becoming pregnant against his will--she had, he says, promised
to take birth control pills. The woman claims that she became
pregnant accidentally. That factual issue may be settled at trial,
but it seems that there is a larger legal issue well worth
addressing. Since court findings of paternity cost the imputed
fathers 18 years' worth of support, it seems only fair that women
be held accountable for any promises they make about attempting to
remain childless. In the absence of that, a woman's promise to take
charge of birth control and then not doing so remains the only form
of monetary fraud Today's Papers can think of that is not only not
punished, but is in fact regularly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT's Column One does a long take-out on the increasing
attempts by companies to market their products inside schools,
especially public schools. Everybody from software manufacturers
(Microsoft being one of them) to cheese companies has been finding
new ways to do this, and parents are, says the paper, finding more
product solicitations coming home in their kids' backpacks. The
good deals and cut rates are often dangled as a way to help schools
get stuff they need, which is particularly attractive to school
administrators strapped for funds in an environment in which voters
keep turning down so many school bond issues. The LAT admits it
school-markets too, by handing out free papers on campuses,
ostensibly to promote reading, but also to increase the paper's
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The WP runs an AP item about the opening of the
6,400-square-foot house about to become the home of Kenny and Bobby
McCaughey and their septuplets and their other child. The story
describes such features as a 648 square foot playroom, a bathroom
with a ``Roman tub,'' and an intercom system connecting the various
parts of the house. The story says scores of businesses and
residents contributed materials, services, money and land for the
new home. Yet no money figures are ever mentioned--an interesting
omission when the typical story about welfare recipients enumerates
the monthly ``giveaway'' check down to the penny. The story's lucre
lacunae comport well with the locals' theories about how all this
came about--it quotes a neighbor saying, ``Looks like God is going
to provide all these things.''

</P>
<P>
   MISSING-STUDENT (Stockton, Calif.) _ It's been two years and
five months since anyone saw Kristin Smart. Her parents believe
they know who is responsible for her disappearance _ and police say
he is their only suspect. But as yet there is no hard evidence, no
weapon, no body. Kristin Smart vanished, apparently leaving no
clues behind. By ANASTASIA HENDRIX.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS-PRICEY (Houston) _ When University of Houston professor
Viswanathan Kumar recently tried to get a prescription filled for
the popular allergy medicine Claritin-D, he was in for a surprise.
The pharmacist told him his insurance plan no longer covered the
drug. With prescription drug prices rising 12 to 15 percent each
year, HMOs are looking for ways to keep a lid on costs. Delisting
some drugs from coverage is one way. Raising insurance premiums is
another. By MARY SIT-DuVALL.
</P>
<P>
   WACO-SEX (Waco, Texas) _ Waco might be the buckle of the Bible
Belt, but its school district just says no to an ``abstinence
only'' sex education program that critics say could endanger teen
health. The issue, however, just won't go away. A group that has
hundreds of thousands of federal dollars to teach the program keeps
pressuring the district to change its mind. Meanwhile, some Waco
educators are concerned that the program could inadvertently lead
sexually active kids to stop using any protection at all. By POLLY
ROSS HUGHES.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-KILLING (San Francisco) _ A prison guard allegedly
boasted of fatally shooting an unarmed inmate who had escaped from
prison, begun a new life in Puerto Rico and become a ``pillar of
the community'' before being recaptured and returned to San
Quentin. By SETH ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-FINANCE (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   STEAMSHIPS (San Francisco) _ The company that launched the
earliest San Francisco Bay steamers _ American President Lines _ is
still around, having survived 150 years of pell-mell commerce under
a variety of names and owners. Based in Oakland since 1973, when it
moved from San Francisco, APL has been a wholly owned subsidiary of
Singapore's Neptune Orient Lines since last year. By DAVID
ARMSTRONG.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K (San Francisco)_ _ Power goes out; phones fail; elevators
stop; bank cards are useless; paychecks never arrive. It's not the
next earthquake. These are some of the effects that even the most
moderate experts believe could hit worldwide when the Year 2000
computer bug hits. By ERIN McCORMICK.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-ROSSI-PROFILE (Undated) _ Her high-horsepower first name and
down-to-there blonde hair seem to complement the take-no-prisoners
toughness Portia de Rossi brings to her role as Nelle Porter on
``Ally McBeal.'' But it's all an act. Or is it? By MIKE McDANIEL.
</P>
<P>
   TV-ROSSI-SIDEBAR (Undated) _ Short sidebar on show's unisex
restrooms.By MIKE McDANIEL.
</P>
<P>
   TV-REVIEW-JAG (Undated) _ ``JAG'' was once rightly dismissed as
a mindless action show with pretty faces, a ``Baywatch'' in
uniforms, strictly for guys. But today, the drama finds itself not
only looking good, but smart. And last week, the military/legal
program netted its highest Nielsen rating ever. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Is hunting relevant anymore in
modern society? The numbers in California say it is mostly not: In
a population of 33 million, 154,000 bought deer hunting tags last
year, and 75,000 bought duck stamps. That means only one out of 214
residents hunt deer, and only one out of 440 residents hunt ducks.
By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-BRONCOS (Denver) _ We can only explain the Denver Broncos
this way: This is how the 49ers used to look. They are well stocked
at every position and utterly convinced of their own collective
destiny. So confident are they, in fact, that they could return
team icon John Elway to action after two weeks on the sidelines
with injuries and find a way to make him a receiver. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING (Albany, N.Y.) _ Taco Bell hyperbolizes when the
company claims that its talking-chihuahua stuffed animals will be
``the hottest new toy for this holiday season,'' but forgivably so.
The critters are in their own way as quirkily cute as what will
actually be the hottest toy, Furby. By STEVE BARNES.
</P>
<P>
   LESHER-WARDROBE (Walnut Creek, Calif.) _ The wardrobe of
deceased newspaper heiress Margaret Lesher went on sale to the
public. Janice Perkins, a customer, said: ``I compare this to
something happening to the Bay Area on the smaller scale of
Princess Diana or Jaqueline Kennedy.'' By RAY DELGADO.
</P>
<P>
   VIAGRA-TELEPHONE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Call an 800 number and have
Viagra delivered to your door, without the embarrassment of seeing
a physician or having a physical exam. Health officials and
physicians say that's a prescription for serious problems and are
warning consumers not to buy into ``M.D. by Phone,'' one of the
latest mail-order companies advertising in the area. By SYLVIA
WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   NEWORLEANS-CHRISTMAS (Undated) _ New Orleans' annual holiday
celebration offers not only merriment and fabulous food but also
good bargains at hotels and restaurants. Here are tips on what to
expect this year. By SYD KEARNEY.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Undated) _ With the holiday season approaching,
many individuals will be making a rare airplane trip. Or their
first trip.
</P>
<P>
   And some are apprehensive. Two new books _ one written by a
former pilot _ help ease concerns. By HARRY SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Soccer is bad for parents. The
facts are in. Soccer leads to endless shuttling of children to and
from games and practice. Soccer leads to Jeep Cherokees. Soccer
leads to prolonged sitting on sidelines with people who shout at
their kids and referees. Soccer leads to being stereotyped by
political consultants who want parents' votes. Soccer is bad for
children, too. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Saratoga Springs, N.Y.) _ A paranoid schizophrenic
can hear voices that aren't there and suffer delusions that seem
utterly and completely real. He begins to believe that he's the
target of a vast conspiracy _ usually the victim of the FBI, the
CIA or some other powerful organization. He might even feel that
he's being persecuted by extraterrestrial beings. So, often, the
paranoid schizophrenic runs and hides. From his perspective, that's
only reasonable. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ A clear, impassioned feminist
cry for Monica Lewinsky is no easy feat. This is not because the
former White House intern isn't a victim deserving of pity and
possibly outrage. Rather, it is because she is the victim of a
diverse set of forces, only one of which fits the classic
``sexism'' category. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   JFK-ASSASSINATION (Beaumont, Texas) _ It's not surprising that
only 18 percent of the American people believe a conspiracy was not
involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy 35 years
ago in Dallas. Heck, everybody loves a mystery, and the Kennedy
assassination fits nicely as the mystery of the century. By THOMAS
TASCHINGER.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Without question, the best
aspect of last week's impeachment hearings in the House Judiciary
Committee was that television coverage gave all Americans the
opportunity to watch it from beginning to end. Rewards were there
for those who had the time and patience. By HARRY ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ Taxpayers could do without most
of the 5,000 or more bills that will be introduced before and
during next year's five-month legislative session. Many will be
unneeded. Others will be misguided, and some will be downright
silly. We already are getting a preview with the bills that
lawmakers started pre-filing the week after Election Day. BY CLAY
ROBISON.

CHILE RENDERS VERDICT ON PINOCHET: LET'S MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Snapshots from Chile: Shortly after Gen.
Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London five weeks ago on a Spanish
warrant, neighborhood officials cut off garbage pickups at the
Spanish and British embassies here. But a couple of days later
cooler heads prevailed and garbage removal resumed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A portly right-wing senator, declaring his solidarity with
``the savior of our nation,'' announced that he was going on a
hunger strike until the general was released. But when legal
proceedings bogged down in London, he quietly succumbed to his
hunger pangs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exactly one month after the general's arrest, Walter Riesco,
president of the Confederation of Production and Commerce, publicly
warned that if the former dictator is extradited to Spain, ``the
situation in Chile will once again become unsustainable.'' On the
same day, the Chilean stock market climbed, contributing to a
sustained rally that has lifted the market's index more than 20
percent since Pinochet was detained.
</P>
<P>
   Such touches of whimsy have offered more than welcome respites
from what may well be the most serious test of Chile's transition
to democracy since Pinochet left the presidential palace eight
years ago. They suggest how much Chile has calmed in recent years,
after decades of inflamed passions stirred first by the chaotic
lunge toward socialism by the government of President Salvador
Allende, followed by the deadly coup in 1973 that propelled
Pinochet to power and began 17 years of brutal repression.
</P>
<P>
   The general's arrest provoked demonstrations by rightist and
leftist activists in which eggs and rocks were thrown, but these
have lost steam with nobody having been killed or seriously
injured. Some politicians have received death threats. But the
police and armed forces have remained disciplined for the most
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the country as very, very stable,'' said Ricardo Israel,
chairman of the political science department at the University of
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The relative calm presents a contrast to the last few times
Chile went through crises over issues of the past. In 1991, after
the release of a government truth commission report documenting the
deaths and disappearances of more than 2,000 people during the
Pinochet years, assassins took the lives of three political
figures, including a right-wing senator. Three years later,
soldiers appeared in the streets in a partially effective effort to
block investigations of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, Pinochet is dominating the news, and the
nightly broadcasts of emotional interviews with relatives of those
who disappeared have stirred memories that most Chileans would
prefer to forget. Nevertheless, commentators have pointed out that
such frequent broadcasts of interviews highly critical of Pinochet
and the army would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.
Particularly penetrating have been reports about Operation Condor,
the effort to seize and murder dozens of exiles living in Argentina
and other countries, for which Pinochet is being investigated by a
Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most striking image to emerge from the crisis
has been that of Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, a leader of
the Socialist Party that was once led by Allende and that now
governs with the centrist Christian Democrats, calling on the
British to free the man who once forced him into exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing Chile needs is Pinochet as a martyr,'' Insulza
said, expressing a commonly held notion that if Pinochet were
somehow hounded to death by his legal problems, the country could
still explode. It is a practical, political argument that suggests
no newfound respect for the general. Rather, when Insulza repeats
it almost daily, it is a reminder that the governing elite now
bridge a political divide that was as wide as any in Latin America
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our own Cold War but now there is a consensus in favor
of private enterprise and democracy,'' said Jorge Schaulsohn
Brodsky, a former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and a member
of the social democratic Party for Democracy. ``While we still have
a shopping list of issues, out of that shopping list we now only
disagree on one and we agree on all the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue on which Chileans disagree, of course, is still
Pinochet, who turns 83 on Wednesday and is in poor health. He
stepped down as armed forces commander eight months ago, but
remains a senator for life, a position that conveys legal immunity
under a constitution he conceived as dictator. So he was weighing
in on political issues until he was arrested. And his constitution
will probably continue to grant disproportionate influence to two
rightist parties and the military for at least several more years,
even if the constitution is overhauled eventually..
</P>
<P>
   But even if the panel of Britain's House of Lords that is
considering his case allows Pinochet to return to Chile soon, there
are already signs that he has become a much diminished figure.
Several influential conservatives have even suggested that the
general should make some grand gesture upon his return, like an
apology for excesses during his regime. A few have even endorsed a
proposal by the Chilean Catholic Church hierarchy to reassemble the
government truth commission to gather more information on those who
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the general comes back, that will be the end of it and he
will no longer play a political role,'' said Sebastian Pinera,
presidential candidate of the conservative National Renewal Party.
``But if he doesn't come back, he will be a player forever,
especially if he dies abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   So the crisis is not over. The other day, President Eduardo Frei
told a business group that the discord since Pinochet's arrest
``shows that our reconciliation is incomplete and we must work hard
to strengthen that process in the future.'' Then he flew off to
South Africa to start a nine-day global trade mission.

 &HT;    EDITORS: RESEND WITH CORRECTION. PLEASE USE THIS VERSION
 &HT;    This spray and wash gives roof a clean slate
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Judy Wright of Marietta, Ga. wrote to ask about a
``Weekend Handyman'' that ran about a year ago on how to clean
roofs that have black stains and streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of replacing our roof, which was really affected and
looked really bad, we had it cleaned by a painter who used the
method described in your column. Our roof looks great now and we
really appreciate your help. Now we have neighbors in our
subdivision whose house tops need this same application. Could you
possibly rerun that article?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Judy, as I mentioned in that column, mildew problems are
as common in Atlanta as talk-show hosts _ and nearly as annoying.
</P>
<P>
   The best solution for roof and deck problems is a product called
M-1 that costs about $21 for a gallon of concentrate. Spray it on
and let it sit according to directions and then wash it off with a
hose.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of annoying problems, some of the most common
complaints I hear are usually minor ones, such as refrigerator
doors that won't stay closed, shower curtains with torn eyeholes,
stickers and labels that are hard to remove, and doors that drag.
Here are some simple solutions from the October issue of The Family
Handyman:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My refrigerator door stays open more than it should because
I'm a midnight snacker. But if yours won't stay closed, try putting
a strip of 1/2-inch wood under the front wheels. It'll be hidden
behind the removable grill and the tilt won't be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If your shower curtain already has several eyeholes torn out,
it's time to replace it anyway. But to make your new one last
longer, prevent tearing by taking a long piece of nylon
grass-trimmer cord and cut it the length of the curtain. Run it
inside the curtain pocket above the eyeholes to add support.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To unstick stickers such as labels on new appliances or
windowpanes, use a hair dryer to soften the adhesive. Usually the
sticker will peel off easily.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most of us ignore dragging doors because it's too much trouble
to take them off the hinges and shave off the bottom. But sometimes
you can fix the problem without removing the door. Using a
drill-powered sanding disc, reverse the disc so the sandpaper faces
the drill. Protecting the floor with a piece of cardboard, slide
the disc under the bottom of the door and sand down the area that
is dragging. This only works if you have about 1/16-inch or less to
remove.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tips of the month: If you have scratches on your windowpanes,
maybe you don't have to replace them. Try rubbing the scratch with
a soft cotton cloth and Brasso.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a nifty way to create a perfect bead of caulking
where your bathtub meets the wall. Apply two pieces of masking tape
_ one on the wall and one on the tub _ leaving enough space for the
proper amount of caulking. After applying the caulk, wet your
finger and drag it along the bead. The excess caulk will be pushed
over onto the masking tape. When you remove the tape, you have a
neat bead of caulk.

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

NIRDI RELIS in New York at 212-499-3333, or by fax at

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly

 Includes a color slide of Vince Vaughn in a scene from ``Psycho.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Everything old is new again. Think bell bottoms, Tony Bennett
and ``Psycho.''
 &HT;    That's right, the granddaddy of all slasher flicks is back and
looking to make another box-office killing on Dec. 4.
 &HT;    But this isn't your mother's ``Psycho'' or, for that matter,
Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 black-and-white classic. It's in color, for
one thing _ think lots of red.
 &HT;    And the actors are some of today's hottest young stars. Vince
Vaughn steps into Anthony Perkins' shoes as Norman Bates, the
Oedipus wreck who bloodies the cutlery. Anne Heche takes Janet
Leigh's place in the shower, with Viggo Mortensen as her beefcake
boyfriend, Julianne Moore as her concerned sister and William H.
Macy as the detective on the case.
 &HT;    And the man behind it all is Joseph Stefano, sitting in his home
office right under an original ``Psycho'' poster given to him by
Hitchcock. Four decades back, Stefano _ who also co-created
television's ``The Outer Limits'' _ wrote the screenplay for
``Psycho,'' basing it on Robert Bloch's novel, itself based on a
real case.
 &HT;    And, as far as the script is concerned, this is still your
mother's ``Psycho.'' Stefano fine-tuned his original script to help
director Gus Van Sant deliver his version, reportedly an almost
line-for-line and scene-for-scene, but not necessarily
shot-for-shot, remake.
 &HT;    ``It's strange and other than fascinating to see the posters and
to hear the buzz again,'' Stefano says. ``I'm oddly removed from
it, but also re-entrenched in `Psycho.'
 &HT;    ``People were starting to forget about `Psycho,''' he says, ``or
they only knew it through shower jokes on `Saturday Night Live.' It
was just something I enjoyed talking about with students and with
people at seminars, but I must say I never truly got used to the
idea that `Psycho' was the film people said it was.''
 &HT;    The original ``Psycho'' ranked near the top of the American Film
Institute's recent list of America's 100 greatest films. A sly
smile crosses Stefano's face as he considers whether the film's
success is more attributable to his script, Hitchcock's direction
or some alchemical combination of the two.
 &HT;    ``It was both, and I say that without conceit,'' says Stefano,
who's fit, robust and sharp as a knife at 76. ``I don't think
`Psycho' would've been the same movie without my script.
 &HT;    ``If the movie had been closer to Robert Bloch's book, I don't
think it would've worked,'' he adds. ``Adapting the book as it was
would have been impossible.''
 &HT;    For all his reputation as a control freak, Stefano says,
Hitchcock gave him surprising latitude.
 &HT;    ``Hitch and I had a strange thing going, because I don't know
that he'd ever been concerned about the characters' motivations and
emotions,'' he recalls. ``He didn't pay much attention to those
things, because he felt that was the writer's job.
 &HT;    ``So I think I gave each character in `Psycho' a life that made
what happened, storywise, more important and more powerful to the
audience.''
 &HT;    Hitchcock requested few script changes, the writer recalls, and
in fact paid Stefano his highest compliment.
 &HT;    ``He said, `Alma loved it,''' Stefano says, laughing loudly,
referring to the influential Mrs. Hitchcock.
 &HT;    ``Psycho'' was the only script he wrote for Hitchcock, Stefano
says, but they nearly made a second film together.
 &HT;    The director had bought the rights to the novel ``Marnie'' with
Grace Kelly, his leading lady from ``Rear Window'' (1954), tapped
to star. He turned to Stefano for a film script.
 &HT;    ``It was going to be a big deal, Princess Grace of Monaco
returning to the screen for Hitch,'' Stefano says, a tinge of
sarcasm in his voice. ``Hitch and I started working much the same
way we did on `Psycho,' beginning with a treatment.
 &HT;    ``Right about then, Hitch was told by Miss Kelly's people that
she was not going to do it. I never saw Hitch so pissed as he was
at that moment, or so hurt.
 &HT;    ``He eventually did `Marnie' with Tippi Hedren, but I couldn't
write it because I was deep into `Outer Limits' at that point,''
the writer says. ``I wish `Marnie' had worked out because, while it
was another Hitchcock movie, it might have taken the rub off my
`Psycho' association.''
 &HT;    Typecast by ``Psycho'' nearly as much as star Anthony Perkins
had been, Stefano managed to carve himself another piece of
entertainment history with the classic science-fiction anthology
series, ``The Outer Limits.''
 &HT;    He co-created and co-produced the series with the late Leslie
Stevens, and wrote a dozen of the first season's most acclaimed
episodes. The show's alien setting allowed him to take on
government deception, the CIA and other intriguing topics, all
under the guise of allegory.
 &HT;    ``I don't even like sci-fi,'' the writer says, ``but to this day
I prefer the reactions I get from people about `Outer Limits' to
the reactions I've gotten about `Psycho.' We got away with a lot,
and I couldn't have gotten away with it had it not been sci-fi.''
 &HT;    During the 1970s Stefano struggled with clinical depression, but
in the 1980s he staged a comeback. He penned ``The Kindred''
(1987), ``Psycho 4: The Beginning'' (1990) and the Al Pacino drama
``Two Bits'' (1996). He also agreed to serve as executive
consultant for Showtime's ``Outer Limits'' revival, a position he
still holds in the series' fourth season.
 &HT;    ``Many other projects didn't get made,'' Stefano adds. ``But I
was active and open to trying different things. Right now, I don't
feel any different than I did when I was first out there.''
 &HT;    Then Van Sant called. The independent-film favorite, riding high
on his unprecedented mainstream success with the Oscar-studded
``Good Will Hunting'' (1997), was finally able to realize a
long-cherished ambition: He was going to remake ``Psycho.''
 &HT;    Van Sant asked Stefano to tweak the script, bringing it up to
date with a few minor changes. Heche now steals $400,000 from her
boss, for example, rather than the $40,000 Leigh took. The director
also welcomed Stefano to the set several times and let him view
dailies and a few assembled scenes.
 &HT;    ``Gus's plan was to do it the way Broadway plays are revived,
which is pretty much as written,'' Stefano says. ``I can't think of
another writer who has had the chance to see his screenplay
performed by actors different from those of the original
production.
 &HT;    ``Vince, Anne and the others are fine actors,'' he adds, ``and
they're interpreting the old dialogue their way, which will make
the film both old and new. That's fascinating.''
 &HT;    Rumors abound, however, that Van Sant deviates from the original
after the famed shower sequence. Stefano has not seen the finished
film, and can't confirm or deny anything.
 &HT;    ``As involved as I was and based on what I saw, I don't expect
anything will be much different,'' he says. ``On the other hand, it
concerns me that I've not been asked to see the movie cut together.
 &HT;    ``But I won't call Gus and ask to see the film,'' the writer
adds. ``I don't do that. Gus, it seems, is just getting an extra
charge out of the secrecy element _ which Hitch did, too.''
 &HT;    Stefano is currently talking with several producers about
various projects, and has a script or two finished. He hopes that
``Psycho'' will prove successful and spur those prospects into
production.
 &HT;    He doesn't expect any future efforts to change his place in
Hollywood history, however.
 &HT;    ``When I die,'' he says, laughing, ``my tombstone will read:
`Joe Stefano, Wrote ``Psycho'' and Created ``The Outer Limits.''' I
know that, and it's OK.
 &HT;    ``It just makes me think I should have tried a little harder, so
I could get a longer headline on the obituary.''

 Includes a color slide of LeVar Burton with Patrick Stewart in a
scene from ``Star Trek: Insurrection.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's been 11 years since LeVar Burton first stepped on the set
of the television series ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' as Lt.
Cmdr. Geordi La Forge of the starship Enterprise.
 &HT;    ``In the beginning it was a one-note joke,'' Burton recalls. ``A
black, blind man flies the ship with the help of electronic
implants and that high-tech visor he wore. I thought, `Well, that's
good for about five minutes, and then you have to create a
character.'
 &HT;    ``It wasn't easy to play Geordi with my eyes covered all those
years,'' he says. ``I kept telling the producers it's a sin to take
away an actor's eyes, they're one of his tools. Geordi lives in the
age of sophisticated 24th-century technology. He doesn't need a
visor.
 &HT;    ``Finally, in the last `Star Trek' movie, they went along with
it. You finally could see my eyes, even if they were bright blue
while mine are really brown.''
 &HT;    Now the character takes an even bigger leap in ``Star Trek:
Insurrection,'' opening Dec. 18, in which Capt. Picard and his crew
discover a strange world where a mysterious fountain of youth
changes them all. La Forge regains his sight.
 &HT;    ``His optic nerve begins to spontaneously regenerate,'' Burton
says. ``For the first time in his life he can see things like any
other human. And his eyes turn from blue to brown.''
 &HT;    Does La Forge end up blind again? Burton is cagy, but admits
that there's a logic to his doing so.
 &HT;    ``I likened it to a hypothetical experiment,'' he recalls. ``I
told the producers, `It's as if you'd give LeVar Burton the
opportunity of walking around in the skin of a white man for a
week. He would probably take you up on it. But I guarantee that at
the end of the week he would want to go back to being a black man.
Why? Because that's who he is.'''
 &HT;    It's an appropriately philosophical thought for
``Insurrection,'' which Burton says is more cerebral than recent
installments of the series, including 1996's ``Star Trek: First
Contact.''
 &HT;    ``I think this deals with more issues than the last `Star Trek'
movie, which was just a big action picture in which the Borgs were
the bad guys,'' Burton says. ``In this film, when everyone is
confronted with that sort of fountain-of-youth idea, they start
fantasizing about how they'd like to change themselves. I guess,
when you look at the youth culture in our own society, it couldn't
be more relevant _ especially in Hollywood, where you find that
pursuit of eternal youth.''
 &HT;    At 41, Burton seems to have found it, looking hardly older than
the 19-year-old actor who made his Emmy Award-winning debut as
Kunta Kinte in the acclaimed 1976 television miniseries ``Roots.''
 &HT;    ``I guess I'm genetically blessed,'' he says. ``My mother still
looks incredibly young, so I guess that bodes well for my future.
 &HT;    ``But I've earned some maturity along the way which I didn't
have when I started out,'' he says more seriously. ``I've covered
some distance, and I've learned some things along the way.''
 &HT;    Burton was a drama student at the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles when ``Roots'' made him an overnight
celebrity. A string of television movies and feature films
followed, including ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' (1977), ``Billy:
Portrait of a Street Kid'' (1977) and ``The Hunter'' (1980).
 &HT;    The fast money quickly vanished into fast living, as Burton
became a fixture on the Hollywood party scene.
 &HT;    ``Those days were a real test of my character,'' he says. ``I
felt like I was at the center of some sort of vortex of energy that
was out of control.
 &HT;    ``But it's like Nietzsche said: `What doesn't kill me makes me
stronger,''' he says. ``I wouldn't give up or trade those
experiences I had for anything. I take full and complete
responsibility for all of them, so I'm not going to look back and
feel sorry for myself.''
 &HT;    Burton's career rebounded with ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' which was a science-fiction fan's dream.
 &HT;    ``Growing up I loved the sci-fi genre,'' he recalls. ``But for a
young black kid it was pretty hard to find any heroes who looked
like me, which is why I loved `Star Trek.'
 &HT;    ``I had a lot of respect for (series creator) Gene
Roddenberry,'' the actor adds, ``because I think he was ahead of
his time in bringing other races and cultures to the screen. In
fact, I think `Star Trek' had the first interracial kiss on
television. I always saw Gene as a visionary in that way.''
 &HT;    His preparations to play a blind man involved some unusual
research.
 &HT;    ``I was in Oklahoma, taking this challenge course in which we
were presented with all sorts of physical obstacles,'' he recalls.
``One of them was to jump from the top of a telephone pole and grab
a trapeze that was a few yards away. I did it, and then the
instructor said she'd show me something about being blind. She put
a blindfold on me and told me jump off the pole again. I was
terrified, but I jumped anyway and grabbed the trapeze.
 &HT;    ``Her point was that the memory of that first jump lived in my
mind and I was connected with it,'' Burton says. ``It was one of
the highest moments I've ever experienced. I felt a tremendous
sense of power.''
 &HT;    Some ``Star Trek'' actors have been uncomfortable with the
obsessive Trekkers _ don't call them ``Trekkies'' _ who flock to
``Star Trek'' conventions, often dressed as their favorite
characters. Burton takes the phenomenon in stride, however.
 &HT;    ``I can't knock them,'' he says, smiling. ``They demonstrate a
fierce and loyal love for something that I love dearly too. I put
on costumes and play make-believe for a living. These people live
out their `Star Trek' fantasies for fun _ I frankly think it's
probably a very healthy tool for stress reduction.''
 &HT;    Outside of ``Star Trek,'' the enduring passion of Burton's
career has been the PBS children's series ``Reading Rainbow,''
which he has hosted for 14 years. He doesn't believe that living in
the age of computers makes it any less important for children to
learn to love books.
 &HT;    ``It's pretty hard to navigate the Internet without being
literate,'' he says. ``I don't see an adversarial relationship
between the written word and the World Wide Web. You can't surf the
Net if you can't read.''
 &HT;    Burton, who has an 18-year-old son from a previous relationship
and a 4-year-old daughter from his current marriage, practices what
he preaches.
 &HT;    ``I read to my daughter every night,'' he says. ``Bedtime
stories are a family ritual. I guess my daughter likes to hear me
read. She used to call the show `Daddy Rainbow.'''
 &HT;    Now heading his own production company, Burton has directed
numerous episodes of ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' and ``Star
Trek: Voyager,'' and recently was behind the camera for a
television movie, ``The Tiger Woods Story.''
 &HT;    ``I love directing, even thought it's harder than being an
actor,'' he says. ``I consider acting a vacation.''
 &HT;    Given the chance, what would the 41-year-old actor tell the
19-year-old kid who was about to star in a major miniseries? Burton
pauses in thought.
 &HT;    ``I'd say, `You're going to be all right,''' he says finally.
``No matter how scary it gets, no matter how much you feel like
you're moving on quicksand, you're going to be all right. You've
got what it takes to hang in there.'''
 &HT;    He grins.
 &HT;    ``You know what I'm saying? I'm still here. I think I've done a
pretty good job of re-inventing myself.''

 Includes a color slide of Charlize Theron with Bill Paxton and a
huge gorilla in a scene from ``Mighty Joe Young.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's midnight on a movie set in Laguna Beach, Calif. Explosions
are being rigged, makeup is being applied and Charlize Theron is
learning what the star treatment is all about.
 &HT;    ``For God's sake, don't let a spark hit the talent,'' yells a
grip.
 &HT;    ``Please, let's keep the smoke to a minimum for as long as
possible,'' a producer implores. ``Think safety!''
 &HT;    Not Theron's safety, of course. The star they're fretting about
is a 2,000-pound stuffed gorilla, the title character in ``Mighty
Joe Young.''
 &HT;    ``I can see it now,'' Theron says. ``My mother will get a call
and the producers will say, `We're sorry, but we had to save
Joe.'''
 &HT;    In jeans and a T-shirt, the 23-year-old South African actress
folds about six miles of legs underneath her on a makeshift bench
and looks nervous, running an unsteady hand through her short,
spiked blonde hair.
 &HT;    The movie is an unorthodox love triangle, in which an orphaned
nature expert (Theron) is torn between human life with the man she
loves (Bill Paxton) and jungle life with the huge ape she grew up
with.
 &HT;    ``It really is a tough choice,'' Theron says, ``because Joe is
so cute. He is also a rising star.''
 &HT;    So is Theron, for that matter. ``Mighty Joe Young,'' opening on
Dec. 25, isn't the only chance for people to see Theron these days.
The former dancer and model also appears prominently in Woody
Allen's current ``Celebrity'' and will co-star with Johnny Depp in
1999's ``The Astronaut's Wife.''
 &HT;    In ``Celebrity,'' she plays a beautiful-but-vapid supermodel who
drags Kenneth Branagh around for a fast-paced tour of Manhattan
hotspots after dark.
 &HT;    ``I don't play a nice person, which was part of the fun,''
Theron says.
 &HT;    The entire project was typical Woody Allen, she adds.
 &HT;    ``I didn't get to see anything called a script,'' the actress
recalls, ``and I never knew how the hell I would fit into the
movie. But you trust Woody Allen. I would have been the girl whose
image flashes over the end credits to work with him.''
 &HT;    Appropriately enough, however, what she calls ``the ape film''
remains the biggest item on her agenda. Its subject matter was
particularly resonant to Theron, an animal lover who has two dogs
prowling her Los Angeles home.
 &HT;    ``The fact is that there are 400 mountain gorillas left on this
planet,'' she says. ``That's very staggering, when you think in a
couple of years they might be gone. That's why I love this film. It
begs us to just leave nature alone.''
 &HT;    Which doesn't mean that ``Mighty Joe Young'' isn't also a
monster movie, complete with a mechanical ape built by effects
master Rick Baker.
 &HT;    ``It's rough because my co-star is 15 feet tall, which is not
exactly King Kong size, but still ... '' Theron says. ``The ape
that Rick built really was another actor on the set. There are over
20 points in his face that move. He pouts, he lifts his brow. He
has a move where it looks like he will burst into tears.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe I'm here,'' she says, looking around at the
hubbub of activity on the set. ``Ever since I can remember I've
been acting, and now I'm getting paid to do it _ which is pretty
amazing and breathtaking. It baffles me.''
 &HT;    An only child, Theron was raised on a farm in Bononi, South
Africa.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have any friends,'' she says. ``I didn't have any
brothers and sisters. My mom and dad ran a construction company, so
they were in an office all day.
 &HT;    ``They basically just threw me in the back yard with 10 dogs and
a goat and cows,'' she says. ``All I can remember is getting
dressed up and swinging from trees playing Sheena, Queen of the
Jungle. It was great, because the movie always went my way. I was
the only one who could change the script _ the dogs had to do what
I said.''
 &HT;    At age 4, Theron started to learn ballet, displaying a natural
flair for dance. But her heart was elsewhere.
 &HT;    ``I remember that movies were always my secret love,'' she says.
``I saw `Splash' (1984) at 9 years old at the drive-in in Africa,
and I experienced my first jealous moment. I'm going, `Who is that
blonde?' In my imagination, I was the girl who broke every guy's
heart.''
 &HT;    She remembers playing with old checkbooks given to her by her
mother.
 &HT;    ``I would pretend that I was married to famous movie stars and
sign their names to my checks,'' she recalls, laughing.
 &HT;    At age 16, Theron won an international modeling contest and
found herself in Italy.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to give the industry a bad rap,'' she says. ``I'm
very grateful that modeling was there for me. It made me an
independent woman at a very young age, but it was so boring.''
 &HT;    Modeling was her way out of South Africa, but it was dancing
which took her to New York, where she spent six months with the
Joffrey Ballet.
 &HT;    ``I loved it,'' she says, ``but then one night I tore the
muscles away from my kneecap. It was a horrible, horrible injury.''
 &HT;    At 18, Theron was washed up as a dancer.
 &HT;    ``When I hurt myself, I basically had two choices,'' she says.
``I could either call my Mom and say, `You know that ticket you
always promised me if I had trouble and needed to come home? Could
you send me that ticket and let me come home?'
 &HT;    ``Or I could just stick it out.''
 &HT;    The aspiring actress chose the latter opton, and soon afterward
found herself in Hollywood, virtually destitute.
 &HT;    ``When I first arrived in L.A.,'' she recalls, ``I lived in a
little motel called The Farmer's Daughter, which is a place to
visit if you're planning on having an affair. It's actually rented
by the hour.''
 &HT;    A modeling job got her a desperately needed paycheck, but she
found that she couldn't cash it because she didn't have a permanent
address.
 &HT;    ``Let's just say I threw a little dramatic scene in the bank,''
she says. ``Then this guy behind me touches my arm and says, `Miss,
I will show you how to get to the post office, where you can set up
an address.'
 &HT;    ``He gave me directions and then said, `By the way, I'm a
manager. I don't know if you're an actress, but here is my card.'
 &HT;    ``My friend was waiting in a rental car outside _ which was,
naturally, double parked,'' she adds. ``I got in hyperventilating
and said, `Oh my God, a manager just gave me his card.' I was super
excited. My friend said, `Throw that away, because every creep on
Hollywood Boulevard will try to make you a star.'''
 &HT;    Two weeks later, another friend found the business card buried
in the seat of the rental car.
 &HT;    ``This friend said, `The manager is legit. You should call
him.''' Theron shakes her head. ``He's got almost everything to do
with what is happening to me today.''
 &HT;    What happened was her big break as a sexpot assassin in ``2 Days
in the Valley'' (1995). Then came ``That Thing You Do'' (1996),
``Trial and Error'' (1997) and ``The Devil's Advocate'' (1997),
with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves.
 &HT;    ``My whole life so far has just been amazing,'' she says. ``I
have such high goals and, for some reason, I've always been
provided with what I needed. I feel very blessed in that way, and
I'm very thankful.''

 Includes a color slide of Dylan McDermott in a scene from ``The
Practice.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's high noon on the set of ``The Practice,'' and nobody's
blinking.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer David E. Kelley watches in dead silence as
Dylan McDermott and Lara Flynn Boyle shoot an intense courtroom
scene. Directly in Kelley's line of vision, placed atop a video
monitor, is the Emmy Award the show won several weeks earlier as
best drama series, but he isn't distracted.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle's character, district attorney Helen Gamble, is going
after a negligent mother, and the scene has to be reshot several
times before Kelley gets the take he wants. When the buzzer goes to
indicate lunch, the cast and crew already have been shooting seven
hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the break, most of the actors, including guest stars Tony
Danza and Kathy Baker, wander off to eat or make calls on their
cell telephones.
</P>
<P>
   But McDermott immediately retires to his dressing room to review
that morning's scenes on video. Seven hours or not, he's still
focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on, I just want to see this again,'' he says, already
intent on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In person, McDermott is even better looking than on television.
And that's saying something, because he's ``The Practice's'' main
drawing card, a ruggedly handsome movie star who made the move to
television to play Bobby O'Donnell, a crusading but fallible lawyer
running a Boston law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Since debuting at midseason in 1996, ``The Practice'' has
steadily built an audience in its now-permanent time slot on Sunday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Emmy was all the sweeter for us because the
struggle was so tough in the beginning,'' McDermott says. ``It gave
us legitimacy. We were a midseason show, airing in `NYPD Blue's'
time slot. We had a lot going against us. At the Emmys, I think a
lot of people expected `The X-Files,' `ER' or `Law &AMP; Order' to win.
We were definitely the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to ``The Practice,'' the 36-year-old McDermott had built a
solid reputation as a leading man in films such as ``Till There Was
You'' (1996) and ``Home for the Holidays'' (1996). His decision to
move into a television series stemmed from his desire to work with
Kelley, who also created ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first signed onto the show I trusted David to take me
to great places, and he's certainly done that,'' McDermott says.
``His talent as a writer is undeniable, and he has the ability to
come up with remarkable story lines every week and still keep it
fresh. And the production values are right up there _ every week it
looks like a little movie to me.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's own life story might make a pretty interesting
movie. Born in Westbury, Conn., he is the son of a New York saloon
owner. The notion to go into acting occurred to McDermott in his
teens. Blame it on Eugene O'Neill, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I became an actor,'' he says, ``was due to O'Neill,
because he spoke to me. I was 15, and I couldn't put his stuff
down.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying drama at Fordham University in New York,
McDermott was ready to take on the acting world. The only problem
was that it was a tough world to break into, which meant a
succession of menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God,'' he says, wincing. ``I worked on a conveyor belt in
a hospital, putting mashed potatoes on the assembly line. Mopped
floors. Waited tables. Worked construction. Cleaned toilets. I
mean, I had the worst jobs you could possibly have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from poverty, and I had absolutely no ties to show
business,'' he says, ``so this is a Horatio Alger story for me. It
was all the more gratifying when I did make it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's break came in 1985, when a New York agent spotted
him in the Broadway production of ``Biloxi Blues'' and signed him
to a contract. Almost immediately, he started popping up in movies
such as ``Hamburger Hill'' (1987), ``The Blue Iguana'' (1988) and
``Steel Magnolias'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   His biggest exposure came in 1993, when he played Clint
Eastwood's Secret Service partner in the hit thriller ``In the Line
of Fire'' _ a part he'd won only after losing a role in that year's
``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically Hollywood has cast McDermott as a good guy, although
there were a few exceptions, such as ``The Cowboy Way'' (1994),
with Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, no one saw it,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   These days, McDermott is a good guy every week on ``The
Practice.'' But, while he's devoted to the show, he sees no reason
to curtail his big-screen ambitions. Most recently, he was in
Toronto filming the romantic comedy ``Three to Tango'' with Matthew
Perry of ``Friends'' and Neve Campbell of ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there are certain movies I have to pass on because
I have to be here,'' he says. ``But the reason I took `The
Practice' in the first place was to get a higher profile as an
actor and get better movie roles. When you're on TV, you're out
there every week.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also some pretty cool perks to starring in ``The
Practice,'' such as last season's crossover in which McDermott
guested on two episodes of the mega-hit ``Ally McBeal.'' Calista
Flockhart's popular courtroom comedy is shot on a soundstage right
next door to ``The Practice's'' set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, pretty easy for me,'' McDermott says, chuckling. ``I went
across the street, hung out with them, got to kiss Calista, then I
came back here and threw some guy out a window, all in the same
day. It was the best of both worlds, and the exposure on `Ally'
really helped our show.''
</P>
<P>
   Another perk: Those smoldering sex scenes with Boyle, which in
the past have included a raucous romp in the kitchen that at one
point had McDermott imploring his sexy courtroom opponent to
``Baste me!''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott squirms slightly when those scenes come up in
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they were tastefully done,'' he says. ``It wasn't
like they do on daytime TV. But our audience is largely
18-to-49-year-old females, so if we can get more women to watch,
I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another perk occurred in October when McDermott's real-life
wife, actress Shiva Rose, guest-starred on ``The Practice'' as a
client who had been ousted from her job and filed a
sex-discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she did a great job and looked beautiful,''
McDermott says, beaming proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The actor will become even more involved in ``The Practice''
later this year, when he directs his first episode. But even so, he
makes no predictions as to how long it will run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I just don't know,'' he says with a shrug. ``I was just
asking myself that question the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of new in the television business,'' he adds, ``so I
really can't tell what our lifespan is here. It may be a couple
more years, it may just go until next year. I guess it depends on
how valuable we are to the network, and how long David wants to
keep writing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's really the best situation I could be in on
television.''

   CHANGSHA, China _ Thousands of Chinese exporters are scrambling
to destroy a tree-chomping beetle, amid hints that America's new
regulation to fight the bug may provoke Chinese trade retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese customs official condemned as ``unfair and
discriminatory'' the rule that takes effect next month mandating
that all wooden packaging materials from China must be treated to
prevent more Asian long-horned beetles from migrating to America.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. agriculture experts say the new demands only aim to defang
a threat capable of causing $138 billion in damage and wiping out
entire forests _ if not species _ of maples, poplars and other
hardwood trees.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be a trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Here in China's Southern heartland lie the reasons for
government wrath: local exporters warn the expense of treating
wooden crates and packing materials to kill the pest will cost them
contracts and jobs, especially since the United States is not
making other Asian exporters comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been doing business with an American company for 10
years, and we never had this beetle problem,'' said Li Zhi Guo,
deputy general manager of the Hunan Province machinery export
company.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did America have a problem with the black, white-spotted
beetle, not until infestations of bugs believed from China were
discovered this summer near New York and Chicago, leading to the
quarantine, cutting and burning of several thousand trees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture within weeks issued demands
that China treat its wooden packaging to kill the beetle, which
cannot be felled by pesticides and has no known predators in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Factories such as Li's client, which produces 30,000 casters a
month for American garbage dumpsters, must comply, whether or not
the Asian beetle ever has poked its 2-inch antennae from their
packing crates. Without a government certificate of treatment, any
Chinese wood-packed goods shipped as of Dec. 17 risk being denied
U.S. entry.
</P>
<P>
   As a state exporter, Li sent staff to demand that the factory
subject its wooden shipping materials to heat and chemical
treatment specified by the Americans. He estimates the process will
add 5 percent to expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These casters already are sold very close to cost,'' Li said.
``We have to compete with a Korean company, and the Korean company
doesn't have to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Li's company recognizes America's environmental concern as
valid, but he said he worries what will happen to the caster
company, already operating on a narrow profit, and its 2,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of thousands of such Chinese exporters has brought
protests from Beijing officials such as Wang Feng Qing, deputy
chief administrator of the agency that issues export certificates,
the State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine
of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Wang had a list of complaints attacking virtually every aspect
of the American regulation. She found the 90-day deadline for
compliance unjustifiably short and the treatment methods specified
by the American side both expensive and environmentally hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is ``unscientific and unreasonable'' for America to
subject all wooden packaging from China to the regulation, when the
beetle is found only in limited geographic areas and feeds only on
certain trees.
</P>
<P>
   Wang and Chinese trade officials have expressed particular
irritation that the regulation targets only China, when the Asian
beetle also is found in other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is unfair and discriminatory. It goes against
international practice and against WTO (World Trade Organization)
principles,'' Wang said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wang also disputed American claims that the U.S. infestations
came from China. She said a Chinese expert delegation visited
America to discuss the issue in October, and ``concluded that the
American side did not have direct proof'' that the beetles found
there originated in China.
</P>
<P>
   The notice distributed by the U.S. Embassy here flatly charged
that the Asian beetles were discovered in 22 locations ``and in
every instance they were traced back to wood packing materials from
China.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the embassy, the U.S. sites where beetles were
found in warehouses are in Los Angeles, Hawthorne and South Gate,
Calif.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Martin Grove, Ill.; Indianapolis and
Porter Counter, Ind.; Lansing and Warren, Mich.; Camden, Cream
Ridge, Linden, Mahwan, New Brunswick and Secacaus, N.J.; Jamestown
and Rochester, N.Y.; Charlotte, N.C.; Cincinnati; Lycoming County
and Sinking Springs, Pa.; Charleston, S.C.; Houston; Bellingham and
Seattle, Wash.; Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to eradicate the beetle once it has been
established except to kill every tree where it lives,'' an embassy
circular says.
</P>
<P>
   American traders involved in the lumber industry said they have
heard murmurs of retaliation from Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the hint of a threat,'' said Larry Frye, member of a
recent trade delegation from the American Hardwood Export Council.
``I understand the ramifications. I'm with the veneer industry, and
we bring a lot of our material over in wooden crates and wooden
pallets. We may have to change to plastic or something else because
of this. It could cost us a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye, a forester, called it ``unfortunate'' that some Chinese
officials regard the beetle regulation a trade issue, rather than
an environmental concern based on scientific evidence. He cited
both the chestnut and elm as species destroyed in America by
foreign intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get this (beetle) in a 30- to 100-acre forest, it's
going to wipe our forest out. We'll have to go in and bulldoze and
burn everything,'' he said. ``It's a terrible situation if it gets
out of control. And it may already be close to being out of
control.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 22, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds STARR-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   (`a' category) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at The Case Against Kenneth
Starr. The main arguments about the behavior and approach of Starr
and his associates concern how they have treated witnesses, notably
Monica Lewinsky, and whether they leaked confidential grand jury
proceedings. Critics have also raised other issues, including
whether Starr was involved improperly in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-EQUIPMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With thousands of new tools
and techniques introduced into medicine each year, doctors face
constant pressure to stay abreast of technology. And savvy patients
shop around for those who will perform the latest procedures
advertised in newspapers or discussed at dinner parties. But what
most patients don't know is how skilled their doctors are with the
new equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first
time, may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or
chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative. By Susan
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have always had
second acts. They have been immigrants beginning anew. They have
left behind families and scrawled ``Gone to Texas'' on the walls of
their houses. They have moved like gypsies and even in the most
conventional lives, have left their familiar world behind for a new
life at La Boca Vista in the Florida sun. What is new is that so
many Americans are now having third and fourth and fifth acts, they
are having them later in life and numerous trends may be making
them unavoidable. By Peter Applebome. (There is also an abridged
version of this story, EXP-LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW (Undated) _ For ``Star Wars''
enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview
announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into
theaters around the country to watch it over and over again. It was
the two-minute trailer for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the
``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May
21, 1999. By J.D. Biersdorfer. (There is also an abridged version
of this story, EXP-STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Despite an overall tightening of
welfare, the federal government is prodding many state and local
governments to encourage poor people to apply for food stamps and
Medicaid. The fear is that governments may be blocking access to
such aid programs, which are considered vital entitlements that
keep working people off welfare and the newly-employed from
slipping back on. By Rachel L. Swarns. (There is also an abridged
version of this story, EXP-WELFARE-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REACTIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The market is made up of two
voices. One that votes with its funds, another that worries over
the economic data. The gulf between these two voices is wider now
than it has been in a long time. By Gretchen Morgnson.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBER-THREAT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What to do when a bomber calls:
a checklist from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco abnd Firearms.
(This will be sent only as a GRAPHIC and will only be posted to the
data bases, not sent via AP.)
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Diplomatic etiquette,
though, has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies list
from the White House rooftop. But last week, driven by frustration,
or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the
Clinton administration yelled out loud, twice. In dramatically
different situations, in opposite corners of the world, the U.S.
spoke loudly because it can't find a stick. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ARABS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ For many decades, the
political contours of the Zionist movement and Israel have been
defined by a division between those who are prepared to share the
Biblical Jewish homeland with the Arabs, and those who claim it
all. Last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal

   CHILE-REVIEW (Santiago) _ The controversy here over Britain's
arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet represents what may well be the
most serious test of Chile's transition to democracy since Pinochet
left the presidency eight years ago. But the fact that the reaction
was not as explosive as it might have been suggests how much Chile
has calmed in recent years, after decades of inflamed passions. By

THE JURY IS OUT ON `JAG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS was desperate, but the network successfully figured out a
way to lure men back to an audience that was predominantly women.
</P>
<P>
   First: Buy back NFL football.
</P>
<P>
   Second: Heavily promote a show originally aired, then dumped, by
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``JAG'' was once rightly dismissed as a mindless action show
with pretty faces, a ``Baywatch'' in uniforms, strictly for guys.
But today, the drama finds itself not only looking good, but smart.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the military/legal program (Tuesday at 8 p.m.
Eastern) netted its highest Nielsen rating ever, 11th place among
all shows for the week, as 11.3 million homes tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   ``JAG,'' the acronym for Judge Advocate General, centers on a
team of military lawyers who investigate cases. Initially a ``Top
Gun'' knockoff during its one season on NBC (1995), the show has
evolved _ thanks to its writing _ into a pretty intelligent show.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is Navy Lt. Cmdr. Harmon ``Harm'' Rabb (David James
Elliott) just a vacuous flyboy-turned-lawyer charming his way
through life on just a perfect smile. His partner, Marine Corps
Maj. Sarah ``Mac'' MacKenzie, is a worthy equal and sometimes
adversary, on par in rank and brains.
</P>
<P>
   The show divides action with intrigue, personal interactions and
courtroom dramatics. This is the balance that spreads the appeal
beyond the macho crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons it works so well is that we are equal in
rank, and my character is written very smart,'' Bell said during an
interview just before the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott added: ``It's a guys and chicks show. It's old and
young. The audience seems to be everybody. This is a show that is
really growing. It's like a band _ it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   The show has been aided by a couple of breaks, with the first
being stability. ``JAG'' has been anchored in the lead-off
prime-time slot on Tuesdays the past two seasons. ``Today, there
are so many shows and so many programs, they don't know what is
on,'' Elliott said. But with the heavy promotion CBS has been
giving the show, it would be pretty hard for anyone who has ever
tuned into the network to miss the time and day.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the chemistry between the two leads: It works.
Both characters respect each other, but beneath the surface, well
beneath, is a sexual tension that the viewers, cast and writers
know must NEVER be sated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically it tended to kill shows,'' Elliot said of male
and female antagonists hooking up. ``You do that and the show
dies.''
</P>
<P>
   And, believe it or not, ``JAG'' has become too smart for that.

 &HT;    EDITORS: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A new member of the Family of Dog
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several months ago my wife brought home a little lost puppy,
blind and deaf. We took her to the vet, but he wasn't very
optimistic. It appeared she was suffering from distemper, or a
similar virus that attacks the brain.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he'd do his best.
</P>
<P>
   That he did, and then some! Within a week or so the little puppy
had totally recovered.
</P>
<P>
   My wife named her Beauty. That's how ugly she is _ sort of a
Desert Storm dog, such are her dark and light brown markings.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, she has taken her place among the Family of Dog
that makes up our household. And Beauty makes eight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she's beginning to grow on us. And grow ... and grow
... and grow.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told she's what you call a cow dog. That's about the size of
it. She'll grow to about the size of a cow.
</P>
<P>
   The breed, I'm told, is a Catahoula, which is considered the
national dog of South Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   You can certainly discern a measure of Louisiana heritage in her
makeup and demeanor. Got a snout on her like an alligator, she
does. If there's anything she can't gnaw through, she hasn't come
to it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Catahoula, indeed, are very expensive dogs. So far she's chewed
up two pairs of my eyeglasses. She'd sneak into our bedroom during
the night and snatch a pair from my bedside table.
</P>
<P>
   Now when I go to bed I stow everything _ keys, billfold, glasses
_ in the drawer of the table. But that's a temporary measure. The
other night I woke up to find her puzzling over the handle of the
drawer. It's only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't be surprised if she figures out how to open the
refrigerator as well. Heaven knows she's hungry all the time.
</P>
<P>
   She's a smart thing. We have a swing set out back for the
grandchildren, and, as it turns out, for Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   She lies across the seat of the swing on her belly and pushes
herself with her dangling paws. Next thing, I imagine, she'll be
going down the slide.
</P>
<P>
   The other dogs don't know quite what to make of Beauty, but they
know trouble when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the others _ Lamb Chop, the miniature poodle; Jag Wire,
the schnauzer; Buster, the rat terrier; Peanut Patty, the little
border collie mix; Maggie, the big shaggy dog; and John, the old
yellow dog _ choose to ignore her whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Only Lily, a black-mouth cur and the biggest of the bunch, has
taken to Beauty. I think Lily sees her as one of her own kind,
canine kinfolks of some sort. I expect Beauty will grow up to be at
least as large as Lily, 80 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   All of our dogs have come from the pound or the side of the
road. It's not that we go looking for them. Just the opposite. They
seem to come looking for us.
</P>
<P>
   My standing rule is that you take all the dogs God sends you.
</P>
<P>
   But how many, oh Lord, how many?
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping eight is enough.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Whose millennium is this, anyway?
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes typo in fourth graf.)
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, Nov. 25, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was with wry curiosity that I read, last weekend, of yet
another cult that believes the days of our existence are fatally
linked to the end of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Calling themselves the Concerned Christians, they are a band of
about 75 that originated in Denver but have disappeared from there,
picking up children, selling houses, cars and furniture. About 10
have shown up in Israel, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, remembrances of Jonestown and other suicide cults
come to mind, and already the Israelis have expressed displeasure
at the arrival of some of the Concerned Christians, whose original
theory that Denver would fall to an earthquake last October failed
to materialize. (In fact, Denver is still unbeaten.)
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the sect, Monte Kim Miller, having failed at one
prophecy, has issued another, or maybe two. He says he will be
killed on the streets of Jerusalem in December 1999, and this will
signal the coming of the end of us all. This puzzles me because
another of his prophecies claims only he and his followers will
survive the millennium turn and all the destruction it brings.
</P>
<P>
   As one never can be too sure which established or fringe
religion is the one above all else, and since there has been talk
among other religious groups of closure come the end of the
millennium, I did a little studying about this millennium stuff, as
I am sure you have.
</P>
<P>
   Let us discard as insoluble the brouhaha over whether the
millennium turns on Jan. 1, 2000, or Jan. 1, 2001. Let us accept,
as it was done by Hallmark Cards or whomever, that it will turn at
the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   What so many have forgotten to take into consideration are all
the calendars of all the religions. Let us take Jerusalem, for
example, as this is where Mr. Miller believes he will meet his
maker at the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   That possibly will happen, but only in the Christian Quarter of
the Old City. If he or any of his followers are in the Jewish
Quarter, a millennium will not occur for another 241 years, as this
is the year 5759 in the Jewish calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be in the Muslim Quarter, he's got 580 or so years to
go, as the Muslim world presently is observing the year 1420, or
1421 _ I cannot determine which, for which I apologize to all
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Is my tongue deep into my cheek? Yes it is. And why shouldn't it
be? All this millennium and apocalypse material is a byproduct of
Christian belief, not necessarily traditional. The present Western
World calendar is based on religion. The A.D. after each year
stands for the Latin ``Anno Domini,'' meaning in the years since
the beginning of the Christian era.
</P>
<P>
   And it's been tinkered with. Let us not forget that in 1582,
Pope Gregory XIII decided the old Julian calender was not taking
scientific realities into consideration and dropped 10 days out of
it. The day after Oct. 4, 1582 became Oct. 15, 1582.
</P>
<P>
   Let us also consider the Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Shintos and
countless other religions of the world who are not bound, or
influenced, by proclamations of persons such as the Bishop of
Oxford, the Rt. Rev. Richard Harries, who said the millennium was
primarily a celebration of the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Western influence has vaulted the Gregorian calendar
to everyday worldwide usage. But there are other calendars hanging
on the walls of mosques, synagogues and sundry temples _ calendars
that do not relate to an immediate millennium. If frenetic
followers of fringe Christianity want to believe that the upcoming
advertised millennium is going to be doomsday, lots of luck to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, I'll be at the Orange Bowl football game that day.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Democrats should save Clinton, then bury him
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes typos in fourth graf to Judiciary.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that it looks as though they'll be able to save their
president from impeachment, and with the general concurrence of the
public, the next task for congressional Democrats is to figure out
how to distance themselves from him in ways that same public
notices and credits.
</P>
<P>
   For while most Americans do not want President Clinton
impeached, neither do they want him absolved.
</P>
<P>
   Instinctive senses of fair play and proportion have kept most
Americans away from the ultimate sanction of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most are uneasy with the way the Starr investigation of
Whitewater _ a bust, we now know _ inexplicably inflated into a
permanent investigation of the Clintons and the Clinton
administration. The prosectors' treatment of Monica Lewinsky and
her mother as if they were mafia dons was repelling. (An impression
cemented by Kenneth Starr's dismissal of Monica in his
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee testimony as simply a ``felon.'')
</P>
<P>
   And while Americans recognize lying under oath as reprehensible,
most can see shadings among lies. At the light end are lies about
sex, especially in circumstances that in part had been manipulated
in hopes of producing the lies. Impeachment strikes most as
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, it also remains clear, in every poll and most
conversations, that the president's misbehaviors appall just about
everyone except the small rump of actual hedonists among us. Far
from being the moral slugs the religious and cultural right
mistakes them for, most folks are as repulsed by Clinton's
errancies as they are by the Republican drive to politicize and
cash in on them.
</P>
<P>
   The public can be forgiven if it did not get a sense from the
first impeachment hearing that the committee's Democrats share
their revulsion. The relentless Democratic attack on Starr made it
seem as though the Democrats were defending Clinton across the
board, not just against impeachment and against Starr's
inappropriately prosecutorial, instead of properly factual, manner.
</P>
<P>
   (A guess: The concentration on Starr and his means was, at least
in part, laying the groundwork for arguing, should Clinton be
indicted after he leaves office, that the whole Lewinsky
investigation was so legally amiss any evidence arising from it is
inadmissible.)
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be an increasingly tricky problem for Democrats
as the president comes closer to slipping through the impeachment
net. Even as they keep the pressure on against impeachment,
Democrats will need, too, to begin signaling that in doing so, they
are not giving Clinton a bye on his sexual adventuring or his
lying.
</P>
<P>
   Just buying into a congressional censure, if it comes to that,
won't be enough. A Democratic caucus vote or leadership statement
sharply rebuking Clinton is needed. That would be a bitter pill to
Clinton, but then he has earned his medicine, hasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   An electorate that punished Republicans this year for not
recognizing that it didn't think the president's misbehaviors were
impeachable is as likely in 2000 to punish Democrats if they don't
recognize that the electorate also didn't like those misbehaviors
one little bit.

 &HT;    RENO TO RULE ON GORE, CLINTON FUND-RAISING PROBES
 &HT;    Eds: Repeats and updates a story first moved Friday for Monday
release.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An off-again, on-again controversy heats up again
this week, as Attorney General Janet Reno decides by Tuesday
whether to seek an independent counsel to probe Vice President Al
Gore's fund-raising from his White House office.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is just one of several moves that will bring the
1996 Democratic fund-raising back into focus during the next two
weeks. Reno is considering seeking two more independent probes, one
into President Clinton's fund-raising and another into whether
former senior aide Harold Ickes misled a Senate committee about his
dealings with the Teamsters Union.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Federal Election Commission early next month is
expected to take up a Clinton-Gore re-election audit that raises
questions about whether the campaign violated federal spending
limits and should repay $13.4 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gore case, investigators have been examining whether he
misled government officials when they asked about the funds he
raised on his office telephone in the 1996 campaign. Reno cleared
Gore on a related question earlier, but she ordered a
re-examination after new information surfaced on the question of
whether he was raising unregulated ``soft'' donations or regulated
``hard'' money for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though the issue appears to be highly technical, the appointment
of an independent counsel would put Gore in the center of ethics
controversies he has successfully avoided until now. A probe could
possibly complicate his pursuit of the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman said Friday of the Reno decision: ``Wherever it
takes us, ultimately we are confident that it will show that
everything the vice president did was legal and proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Simon, vice chairman of Common Cause, a private group that
favors tough campaign finance laws, said the Gore matter is
overshadowed by Reno's decision, due by Dec. 7, on whether to seek
a probe into Clinton's role in overseeing $44 million in Democratic
National Committee ``issue'' ads for the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge those ads were directly tied to the Clinton
campaign and therefore violated the federal spending limit for
presidential campaigns that accept public funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a very serious matter,'' Simon said. Unless
Reno launches a probe of this matter, the law becomes
``meaningless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said if Reno were to trigger a probe of Clinton's
fund-raising, an independent counsel would almost certainly delve
into explosive issues, such as foreign contributions, that have
been simmering since the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On yet another front, the House Judiciary Committee, in its
impeachment inquiry of Clinton, has subpoenaed an internal Justice
Department memo that urged Reno to appoint an independent counsel
for the fund-raising issue.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has resisted that advice for more than a year and a
half, has yet to allow Congress to see the entire memo, written by
Charles LaBella, who formerly headed up a task force to investigate
possible campaign fund-raising abuses. A House committee voted to
find the attorney general in contempt for refusing to turn over the
document, but the full House has never taken up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now in limbo,'' said John Williams, spokesman for the
sponsor of the contempt citation, House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind.

SPIRIT OF `GOD'S FOOL' STILL PERVADES ASSISI

<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ We stood reverently gazing down at the brown
robe inside a glass case. The garment, made of coarse material and
patched in several places, had a familiar look, perhaps because it
is said to have been worn by the beloved St. Francis of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors to the city are genuinely moved by the sight of
this simple robe, symbolic of the remarkable life of St. Francis, a
man born to an affluent family who gave up material wealth and
became known as ``God's Fool.''
</P>
<P>
   After a journalists' conference in Rome, three of my fellow
religion writers and I had taken a sleek train to Florence. Once
there, we checked into $50-a-night rooms at the Sisters of St.
Francis of the Immaculate Conception convent.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters of the convent told us this inexpensive rate included a
curfew of 10:30 p.m. Sunday through Friday. On Saturdays, people
staying in the convent are allowed to stay out until 1 a.m. We were
also invited to attend the prayers and church services in the
convent.
</P>
<P>
   We spetn our first afternoon in Florence walking to attractions
such as the Duomo or St. Maria del Fiore, the great domed
cathedral. Nearby is the oldest building in the city, the
Baptistry, believed to date to the 11th or 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   Rising early the next day, we rented a car and drove south on
modern highways cut through green Umbrian hills to the medieval
hilltop town of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   Innumerable pilgrims are expected to pour into Rome, Assisi and
other Italian cities in 2000 to take a millennial look at the
places where St. Peter, St. Paul and more modern saints, such as
Francis, made their contributions to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Rome, especially, is expected to be a place of pilgrimage at the
beginning of the new millennium. Many will visit the Mamertine
prison near the Forum where Peter and Paul were said to have been
imprisoned before their martyrdom. Nearby are the ruins of the
Colosseum, the Roman stadium where many Christians perished.
</P>
<P>
   Other Rome pilgrimage sites include catacombs where early
Christians secluded themselves and St. Peter's Basilica, believed
to have been built over St. Peter's tomb and the center of
Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has been calling for a major celebration of
Christian unity; millions are being spent to tidy up St. Peter's
and other buildings in the Vatican in preparation for the expected
flood of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Italy has places of pilgrimage other than Rome that were
important in early Christian history. There is Turin, where the
famous Shroud, thought by many to bear the image of the crucified
Christ, is housed in its cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   To many, though, Assisi is the most important point of Italian
pilgrimage outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Although he died at age 44, St. Francis left an eternal legacy.
He is remembered for his blessing of the animals and for the
eloquent prayer that begins ``God, make me an instrument of thy
peace.'' He traveled on foot through much of Italy, Spain and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Order of St. Francis he founded has missionary priests
serving in far-flung places such as the Amazon, South Africa and
even in all likelihood your city. Of course, his name and legacy
dominate the city of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   In Assisi, the Basilica of San Francesco is built on the side of
a hill once known as the ``Hill of Hell'' because it was a place of
Roman executions. During our trip, the church's simple architecture
was partially obscured by scaffolding as workmen made repairs after
the devastating earthquake last year that seriously damaged the
basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism slowed in Assisi after the earthquake but has recently
begun to pick up. During our visit, dozens of pilgrims were inside
the basilica lighting candles or kneeling before the tomb of St.
Francis behind its wire grate.
</P>
<P>
   The basilica is open daily for tourists from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
most of the year, but is closed from noon to 2 p.m. for lunch from
November through March. Only those attending worship services are
admitted on Sunday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in late afternoon, and guards already were preparing
to close a lower room, where we saw the brown robe, shirt and
sandals believed to have been worn by St. Francis. Also, a lock of
his hair was on display. No admission fees are charged, but
contributions are encouraged for upkeep of the basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a place of pilgrimage, the basilica contains some
of the most famous masterpieces of religious art in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the dimly lit lower church, we discovered the most famous
depiction of St. Francis. He is shown in the ``Madonna and St.
Francis'' fresco by Cimabue. The barefoot saint is presented
wearing a brown robe and with his hands bearing stigmata, marks
resembling the bloody wounds in the palms and feet of the crucified
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The basilica also includes the Chapel of St. Nicholas, the saint
from whom the legendary Christmas figure of ``St. Nick'' was
derived. Above the archway leading to the chapel is a large fresco
of St. Francis and St. Nicholas with Christ between them.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites connected with St. Francis can be visited in the
Assisi region. About two miles away is the Convento di San Damiano,
where St. Francis, at age 27, had his life changed. He ventured
into the church and later said a wooden crucifix talked to him,
telling him to ``repair the church.''
</P>
<P>
   That crucifix is now displayed in the Basilica of St. Clare,
just down the hill from the Basilica of San Francesco. It serves as
headquarters for the Poor Clares, an organization that aids the
impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   Another St. Francis pilgrimage site is about 21/2 miles outside
Assisi. The Eremo delle Carceri (Prison's Hermitage) is the spot
where Francis and some of his disciples cloistered themselves. A
gnarled holm oak tree there believed to be 1,000 years old is said
to be where birds came to listen to the sermons of St. Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Although we drove to Assisi from Florence, there are many ways
to undertake a pilgrimage. Day trips from Rome and Florence are
operated by tour companies. One-way bus tickets between Assisi and
Rome or Florence are under $20. One-way train tickets from either
city to Assisi are about $15.
</P>
<P>
   There are several hotels in Assisi starting at about $50 a night
for a single, and 20 religious organizations also have convents,
monasteries and religious-run hostels open to visitors. The
religious-run dwellings range in price from $30 to $50 for a
double.

WHAT THEY REALLY DO AT THOSE GUN SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If what President Clinton said in his Nov. 7 radio address to
the nation has a sliver of truth in it, then I'm the criminal, not
him.
</P>
<P>
   How so, you ask? Because I've been known to frequent those
hotbeds of illegal activity, gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what the president would have you believe, gun shows
are not populated by neo-Nazis and militia members bent on
overthrowing the government and slaughtering innocents in their
beds. What you do see is a lot of normal people looking at the
latest product lines available for the shooting sports, from scopes
and grips to gun locks and safes.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen spookier characters at Renaissance festivals.
</P>
<P>
   But in his latest move against the dragon he would most love to
slay after Kenneth Starr, Clinton vowed to use every means possible
to tighten the Brady law to stop gun shows around the nation from
becoming ``illegal arms bazaars'' for criminals and gunrunners.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton bases this baseless theory on a flat-out lie: that
background checks and waiting periods do not apply to gun show
purchases. He's ordered the Treasury and Justice departments to
recommend executive action by early January that will close a
``loophole'' in the gun-control law.
</P>
<P>
   One big hole in the Prince of Perjury's argument is that gun
show purchases from licensed dealers are NOT exempt from applicable
local and federal laws. The last time my police-officer husband
purchased a firearm at a gun show, he was subjected to a waiting
period.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't entirely accurate. The last time my husband wanted to
buy a new firearm at a gun show, I purchased the gun and gave it to
him as an anniversary present. In a quirk that is truly
characteristic of Texas law, certified police officers were not
exempt from the five-day waiting period prescribed by the Brady
law, but anyone with a concealed-carry permit was.
</P>
<P>
   The same will apply after Nov. 30, when the national instant
background check goes into effect. Texans with concealed-carry
permits won't have to go through the screening; everyone else,
including certified peace officers, will. Gotta love the Texas
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is attempting to change a federal law on the sly by
invoking executive action instead of properly going through
legislative channels. That's not legal, you understand, but then,
that's never stopped him before. Has this country reached the point
where it will sit back and let one man _ particularly this one man,
for heaven's sake _ run free rein over the Constitution? My copy
says Congress makes the laws, not the executive branch of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Korwin, author of ``Gun Laws of America: Every Federal Gun
Law on the Books, with Plain English Summaries'' wrote in a recent
column that any illegal gun dealing that might take place at a gun
show is just that, illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any people involved are subject to immediate arrest,'' Korwin
wrote. ``Do they know of such crimes? Are they making arrests
yet?''
</P>
<P>
   If truth be told _ and don't expect it from Clinton _ the target
of the president's recent proclamation wasn't gun purchases from
licensed dealers. He wants to stifle transactions between private,
law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In this great land of ours, citizens have the right to do what
they will with their private property. (Please, no letters from
ranchers or developers. I know y'all are getting hammered from
environmental zealots, but that's a different column.) If you want
to sell Grandpa Woody's old .22 squirrel rifle to the next-door
neighbor so his kid can plink cans off the fence post at the deer
lease, you have every right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the venue of the transaction from your garage to a gun
show, or to the want ads in the newspaper, does not negate your
right to sell or trade your property.
</P>
<P>
   The president would have it otherwise. Toward that end, Clinton
and his ilk have fabricated great dangers being fomented in the
5,000 gun shows that take place in America each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these gun shows have become illegal arms bazaars for
criminals and gun traffickers to buy and sell guns on a
cash-and-carry, no-questions-asked basis,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really, Mr. President? How about providing the hard
statistics to back that claim up? If your little army of federal
agents knows this for a fact, then prosecute the criminals and gun
traffickers under existing law. Any transfer of a firearm with
criminal intent is already a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the feds don't have the will to actually weed
out the small percentage of people with bad intent. It's much
easier to just restrict the rights of everyone.

KIDS ARE BUG-EYED OVER THESE `BUG'S LIFE' TOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so your kids haven't even seen the movie yet. But they're
probably already bugging you about the toys from ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The animated film, opening this week, is a variation on the old
grasshopper-and-ant fable. The lead grasshopper (Hopper, voice by
Kevin Spacey) demands a hefty portion of the ants' harvest (sort of
like an Insect Revenue Service). The humble ant-hero Flik (Dave
Foley of ``NewsRadio'') rounds up a motley crew of bugs to help the
ants confront the grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   This being Disney, opportunities abound for tie-in toys.
</P>
<P>
   But the star? Probably the Electronic Talking Hopper Room Guard.
The oversize plastic grasshopper is a talking toy that you _ uh, we
mean, your kids _ can program to respond to motion. Think of it as
a bug security system. Walk near the thing, and it will spout more
than 40 phrases like, ``Stop! This is grasshopper territory!'' and
``Hey! Welcome back, buddy! Did you bring me my food?'' It's by
Think Way and is about $20 at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   Other early favorites:
</P>
<P>
   _ The cuddly Talking Princess Dot doll says more than 30 phrases
in her smart-alecky young antlette way. Tweak her nose, hand or
tummy for lines like: ``I'm a princess, but you can call me Dot!''
By Mattel, $30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Action Flik moves his head and blinks his eyes while saying 30
different things like, ``Let's kick some grasshopper abdomen!'' By
Mattel, $30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hungarian pill bugs Tuck &AMP; Roll do just that; these bugs tuck
themselves into tight balls. They come with their own spider-webbed
trampoline. By Mattel, price varies.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giant Light-Up Anthill play set is the perfect home for
the complete ``Bug's Life'' line of action figures. Kids can fire
acorns and toadstools at attacking grasshoppers or use the
roller-coaster catapult to bash 'em with berries. By Mattel, $20.
</P>
<P>
   _ In another variation on the talking-doll theme, there's plush
Giggle Dot, who giggles, wiggles and says things like, ``I (giggle,
giggle) guess my nose is sort of ticklish.'' By Mattel, $30.

RULES OF GRAMMAR ARE GOING, GOING ... GONE, ALL BUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grammar ain't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, teachers whacked us on the knuckles when our subjects
and verbs didn't match up. College professors shamed us for not
never showing up for class. At least we knew right from wrong back
then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, anything goes. They tell us it's OK to knowingly split
infinitives. They say a preposition is a fine thing to end a
sentence on. And they say we can start a sentence with ``and.''
</P>
<P>
   And even ``but.''
</P>
<P>
   But only if we don't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   Linguists, lexicographers and grammarians disagree on what is
proper grammar these days. We who want to say it right (say it
correctly?) find ourselves tongue-tied by conflicting opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the rules, says ``The Grammar Doctor,'' Sue Coffman.
As a former high school English teacher, former college English
professor and now a Dallas-based writing consultant, Coffman has
guided generations through the rules of grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman says there are two sets of rules _ real and artificial _
and the problem comes because we break them. First, there are real
rules we follow and real rules we break. Then there are artificial
rules. There are some we break and some we don't _ but we should,
Coffman says.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Blame it on your ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial rules that cause the most problems can be traced
to the first grammar guides of the late 18th and early 19th
centuries. The guides came at a time of scientific enlightenment,
when scholars deemed Latin the perfect language.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a time of social upheaval, when the wealthy sought
to separate themselves from the growing lower classes by using
language as a social determinant, says ``The Grammar Lady,'' Helen
Moody, who helps scientists and engineers improve their writing.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, we're stuck with the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Take the split infinitive rule. The rule came when intellectuals
took Latin grammar rules and applied them to English. But Latin
verbs are made of one word, and English verbs are made of two. So
Caesar couldn't split infinitives, but Shakespeare could. To split
or not to split. That is the infinitive.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was surprised when two new Oxford Press dictionaries
recently OK'd it for modern writers to consciously split their
infinitives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've long regarded it like wearing white shoes after Labor
Day,'' she said of the rule. ``If you want to get concerned about
it, of course you can. It's not critical to understanding. It's
mostly a matter of style.''
</P>
<P>
   Society has debated style for 100 years, and Bryan Garner is
amused every time split infinitives make news. He's a Dallas-based
lawyer and author of Oxford's new A Dictionary of Modern American
Usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts in usage have long rallied against these superstitions
as arrant nonsense, yet they retain a firm grip _ if not a
stranglehold _ on the average person's mind when it comes to
writing,'' Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   Take the rule that you never end a sentence with a preposition.
Garner says it came from Latin, when prepositions were the one word
a writer could not end a sentence with.
</P>
<P>
   Garner reminds us that we're talking about English, not Latin.
He cites Winston Churchill's quip about ending a sentence with a
preposition: ``That is the type of arrant pedantry up with which I
shall not put.''
</P>
<P>
   Another artificial rule that stuck with us _ and one that won't
go away _ is the double negative. Coffman says there's no reason we
don't never do that.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer wrote with double negatives, and nobody harassed him
until an 18th-century minister questioned the logic behind the
construction. The minister asked whether two negatives canceled
each other and made a positive instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why these stick and why they don't, there's no explanation for
it,'' Coffman said. ``It sounded great to 18th-century ears, and
those people tended to be intellectuals and it made logical sense.
But of course, it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody, Coffman and Garner agree that clarity should be the
writer's goal, and they agree that most of the rules that
tongue-tie us are disappearing, slowly. Among those they predict to
fall:
</P>
<P>
   _ The who/whom rule. ``Who'' is the subject and ``whom'' is the
object, but when they are misused, neither affects a sentence's
meaning. For example, ``Who are you going to the movies with?''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule that you can't use ``since'' in the place of
``because.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule that you can never split a verb phrase. Example: ``I
am now going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule that you have to use ``shall'' instead of ``will''
with the subject ``I.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule that you can't write a one-word sentence paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense!
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   Right.

LATIN SCHOOL RULING RENEWS OLD QUESTION OF EDUCATION MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The federal court that struck down Boston Latin
School's policy regarding race in admissions has reopened not just
a long-running debate over the value of diversity but a much older
struggle over the primary mission of public education.
</P>
<P>
   That struggle can be traced back to 1845, when a black girl
named Sarah Roberts lost the first recorded fight against racial
discrimination in the Boston schools, through last week, when a
white girl named Sarah Wessmann won a battle her partisans say was
similar. In the intervening 153 years, some basic questions about
public education have remained unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Should the priority of the school system be to offer equal
opportunity to all, or to offer a shot at maximum achievement to a
relative handful of high-performing students? At what grade level,
and on what basis, should performance be evaluated and special
assistance distributed?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the school desegregation battles of the 1970s, some
whites, particularly in poor enclaves of South Boston and
Charlestown, have been saying that they are discriminated against
because of their low socioeconomic status.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with race-sensitive admissions policies in deep, possibly
fatal, trouble here and across the country, some say the time may
be at hand for linking individual students' socioeconomic
disadvantages, rather than their ethnicities, to the amount of help
and special consideration they receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never understood ... why supporters of affirmative
action think it needs to be tied to racial or ethnic quotas,'' said
John R. Silber, chairman of the state Board of Education and
chancellor of Boston University. ``There are many ways to achieve
that objective without violating the Constitution, without
discriminating on the basis of race.''
</P>
<P>
   He said schools could, and should, evaluate a student's test
performance in the context of the educational disadvantages that
child has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   By doing this, Silber said, ``one can then fully justify
admitting to an exam school a person who scores lower on the exam
but comes from a disadvantaged background, in comparison to
students who score higher'' and are economically and educationally
privileged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts couldn't lay a glove on you if that's what you
did,'' Silber said.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions among whites over affirmative action and diversity in
schools have long been apparent. It is less widely recognized that
differences among blacks on these issues also are deep and
longstanding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1845, the father of Sarah Roberts tried to have his daughter,
a 5-year-old who walked past five all-white schools to get to her
all-black school, admitted to classes closer to home. The school
committee and the courts rejected his request. Even then, some
blacks had their doubts about whether their top priority should be
integration or autonomy, according to ``Black Bostonians,'' a book
by James O. and Lois E. Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is still alive that minorities may be better off with
equal resources to whites but in schools they control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back and forth,'' said the Rev. Jeffrey Brown, pastor of
Union Baptist Church in Cambridge and an activist in Boston's
communities of color. ``On the one hand, I want to say this (court
ruling) is bad, because I think there is a compelling government
interest in figuring out how to live with one another'' _ a
proposition asserted by the Boston School Committee and rejected by
the Court of Appeals. ``On the other hand, I have a protectionist
reaction; I want to make my children get a quality education, an
education that does not penalize them because they are of a
different culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the best way to do that is creating your own
schools and having people in there who reflect your own culture,''
Brown said. ``If you talk to folk in the black community, you'll
find a split over that, the integrationist model on one end and the
cultural autonomy model on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is more nuanced even than that.
</P>
<P>
   Lillia Cooper, chairwoman of the Urban Edge Development Corp.
board of directors, the community group that has led the
resurrection of long-depressed Egleston Square, has a granddaughter
at Boston Latin School and a grandson waiting to learn whether he
will be admitted for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children should get in on merit, but not all schools give them
the chance,'' the retired physical therapist said. ``I don't think
the exam is the problem. It's the preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quality of preparation are widely
acknowledged. A tiny number of the city's 73 elementary schools
supply most of the system's successful applicants to Boston Latin,
whose diploma is of great value when applying to colleges and to
employers in the metropolitan area. Most schools do not have
enriched programs for bright students, but all of the most
successful nurturers of Latin School candidates do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case (decided Thursday) and the controversy regarding
Boston Latin are a proxy for a much broader issue,'' said Harvard
Law School professor Lani Guinier, whose nomination to head the
civil rights division of the US Department of Justice was blocked
by Republicans enraged at her views on minority voting rights.
``The court is offering the school board the opportunity to
identify the mission of Boston Latin, of public education in Boston
_ and then to link admissions to that mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston School Committee is unlikely to shift to
socioeconomic-oriented policies; it would be too radical a change.
More likely, if last week's ruling stands, the exam schools will
admit students in the future based on test scores alone.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, support for better preparation of
disadvantaged students at younger ages is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long term,'' said Silber, ``the solution is programs for those
children at ages 2, 4, and 5 that make sure they come to school
ready to learn.''

<P>
   The McMurdo Dry Valleys OF Antarctica, 800 miles from the South
Pole, are among the harshest places on Earth. The temperature never
climbs more than 4 degrees above freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this frigid desert, biologists have found a remarkable
community of microbes clumped into temporary pockets of water
several feet beneath the surface. Researchers believe that these
organisms, which survive where no one had expected to find any
living things, provide a model for what life might be like on other
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   During the austral summer, beginning in December, the sun shines
24 hours a day on the valleys. Although the air temperature never
rises much above freezing, that steady solar heating provides
enough energy to melt some surface ice.
</P>
<P>
   As the ice melts, its top layer of gravel and sediment _ blown
in from across the continent by the strong Antarctic winds _
filters down through the ice until it settles into a layer some six
feet below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Within that buried sediment a complex community of organisms was
discovered by microbial ecologist John Priscu of Montana State
University and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Priscu and his team found the microbes after years of drilling
through the sediment layer. They had been studying one of
Antarctica's mysterious ice-covered lakes. To reach the lake, they
had to penetrate about 20 feet of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In drilling through the ice over the past 15 years, we'd
always hit a gravel layer,'' Priscu says. ``It slowed us down and
dulled our bits.''
</P>
<P>
   At first the researchers regarded the layer as a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, starting in 1993, I began studying gases produced by
bacteria, to see what their flux was from the lake up through the
ice. When I did a profile of nitrous oxide _ an important gas for
global warming _ I saw a big peak associated with the sediment
layer,'' Priscu says.
</P>
<P>
   Other measurements of bacterial activity _ chlorophyll levels,
for example _ also peaked in the layer. Clearly, the sediment
housed more than bit-chewing gravel.
</P>
<P>
   When Priscu took cores from several other McMurdo lakes, he
identified in similar sediment layers numerous species of
cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), including a filamentous species
that helps bind the gravel particles into a matrix.
</P>
<P>
   He also found nitrogen-fixing bacteria and other bacteria,
called heterotrophs, that decompose dead algae. The organisms
aren't lake species but are instead related to terrestrial
microbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When material is blown onto the surface of the ice, it must
carry spores and attached organisms,'' Priscu says.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of species, Priscu thinks, is necessary to keep the
entire community alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a consortium of organisms,'' he says, ``with
different metabolic traits that complement each other for the good
of the whole system. You have cyanobacteria, which photosynthesize
and so bring carbon dioxide. Then they leak some of that out, and
the heterotrophic bacteria eat up the carbon. The hererotrophs then
respire and recycle C02 and nutrients back to the cyanobacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer the temperature in the sediment layer is about
34 degrees, just warm enough to prevent the water from freezing.
Priscu believes that the organisms secrete some sort of cellular
antifreeze into the water.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny pools, he estimates, last for 150 days, from November
to February. For the rest of the year the layer is frozen and the
organisms exist in a suspended state.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes have some unique characteristics that aid their
survival. Their cell membranes, for example, are less elaborate
than those found in most microbes and are not as easily damaged by
regular cycles of freezing and thawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organisms don't grow quickly at those temperatures but
they do eke by. It is really life at the edge,'' Priscu says. ``I
think that if you are looking for life on other worlds _ Mars or
Europa, for example _ then the kind that we are seeing in the ice
is what you are going to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Priscu, like many other scientists, believes that 4.5 billion
years ago Mars was a warm, wet world, with oceans and perhaps life.
Much of Mars' ancient water may lie frozen beneath its surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now we have shown that you can have life and liquid water
under ice, so we might have an environment on Mars where similar
organisms could still exist.''

 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In 1946, when my father was in his formative years, he purchased
500 shares of stock in a company then known as Haloid.
</P>
<P>
   As my father remembers it, the stock cost $9 a share, which
meant my father was out $4,500, a significant sum at the time. He
held the shares for two years while the stock climbed slowly to
$16.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1948, Haloid announced the existence of a
photocopying process that would later become known colloquially as
Xeroxing after Haloid changed its name to Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to all reasonable expectations (including my father's)
the announcement did not send the price of Haloid stock skyward.
Indeed, by January 1949 it had dropped to $14 a share and my father
sold out. He made a tidy profit of $2,500, but had he held those
500 shares until, say, 1969, they would have been worth about $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   My father's failure to predict the behavior of the market, or
even of a single stock, cannot be held against him, however I might
feel about now having to work for a living. Indeed, the question of
whether the prices of stocks, bonds and other financial commodities
can ever be predicted is one of the great scientific controversies
of our time.
</P>
<P>
   According to orthodox wisdom, financial markets go up and down
with no more predictability than a coin toss, and no amount of
historical knowledge, intuition, tips or analysis will tell you
with any certainty what will happen today, next month or next year.
</P>
<P>
   This paradigm goes by the name of the Efficient Market
Hypothesis (EMH) or the Random Walk Hypothesis, a name derived from
the suggestion that the price of a stock stumbles around a given
value like a drunk around a lamppost.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy rages because of the unavoidable implication of
the hypothesis: if it's true, then traders who make money
speculating in stock movements _ George Soros, for instance, or
Warren Buffett _ are neither brilliant nor intuitively gifted, but
only lucky.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers have collected scientific evidence supporting
the hypothesis, there is also copious evidence to the contrary _ in
particular, everyone who has ever made money in the market.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the last decade has seen a wave of scientists
migrating to Wall Street and applying powerful computers and
sophisticated mathematical tools to the stream of data pouring out
of the world's financial markets. And they have founded a handful
of companies _ Renaissance Technologies, for instance, run by
mathematician Jim Simons, or D. E. Shaw &AMP; Company, run by computer
scientist David Shaw _ that are doing remarkably well placing
wagers on the behavior of financial commodities.
</P>
<P>
   But why? According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the
activity of countless traders competing to buy and sell stocks at
what they think are their proper values forces the market to
instantaneously adjust the price of each stock to what it's really
worth.
</P>
<P>
   When the market moves in response to any relevant news or
information, so the theory goes, it will move so quickly that no
one will be able to make money reliably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (the EMH) says is that the more people who try to
forecast markets, the less forecastable markets tend to be,''
explains Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the Efficient Market Hypothesis, says Lo, comes with the
kind of paradox that offers scientists an opportunity to find a new
truth: If the market is truly efficient, then it leaves no
incentive for anyone to learn new information because they can't
possibly profit from it. But if no one is out there learning it,
then the information will never make it into the market to be
instantaneously absorbed. ``Clearly that's an absurd premise,''
says Lo.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, says Lo, is that the market is efficient, but not
instantaneously so. Small inefficiencies can exist long enough for
traders to take advantage of them, at which point they will be
competed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine out of ten times, the guy who says he can beat the market
is probably wrong, because he doesn't have anything new,'' Lo says.
``All he's observed is a statistical fluctuation, pure luck. But
every once in awhile somebody comes up with a genuinely new idea
for either forecasting the market or assessing information better,
or being able to put all the pieces together in a more
cost-efficient manner. He will make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Because every new technology also makes the market more
efficient, Lo explains, traders must continuously adapt to stay
ahead. They do it by developing or enlisting new technologies, most
of which come from various fields of scientific research: financial
engineering, mathematics, statistics, computer science.
</P>
<P>
   That's what David Shaw and Jim Simons have done. Both figured
out how to mathematically model the behavior of financial markets
so that a computer can predict the direction of stocks, currencies
or other financial commodities, at least for long enough that they
can bet on the knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But those predictions have to be thoroughly tested to make sure
they're based on reality and not luck. The advantage scientists
bring to the game, says Simons, is less their mathematical or
computational skills than their ability to think scientifically.
They are less likely to accept an apparent winning strategy that
might be a mere statistical fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just take a bunch of data and grind through it and
find patterns,'' Shaw says. ``Rather, we formulate hypotheses and
build up models of a lot of mechanisms that we believe are
operating out there. And then we validate those models in the same
way any scientist would. We will do experiments looking at
historical data, and in some cases we actually have to move large
amounts of money through the system and see what happens. In a
given experiment we might pump billions of dollars through the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But this business of scientific trading, says Shaw, is not the
future of finance, because the efficient market will eventually
triumph. If everybody gets into the game, the game vanishes. Both
Shaw and Simons say that it's harder to find profitable
inefficiencies now than it was when they started.
</P>
<P>
   So when Shaw talks about the future of his business he sounds
less like a scientist and more like a Wall Street sage. The most
important people in finance are still those who make money the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people who can analyze companies,'' he says, ``who
understand what products the companies make: whether the chief
executive officer seems to be a good chief executive officer;
whether their business plan makes sense; whether it's a growth
industry or a shrinking industry; and so forth. Those are the kinds
of things we do not believe are amenable to mathematical or
computational analysis.''

<P>
   In 1946, when my father was in his formative years, he purchased
500 shares of stock in a company then known as Haloid.
</P>
<P>
   As my father remembers it, the stock cost $9 a share, which
meant my father was out $4,500, a significant sum at the time. He
held the shares for two years while the stock climbed slowly to
$16.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1948, Haloid announced the existence of a
photocopying process that would later become known colloquially as
Xeroxing after Haloid changed its name to Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to all reasonable expectations (including my father's)
the announcement did not send the price of Haloid stock skyward.
Indeed, by January 1949 it had dropped to $14 a share and my father
sold out. He made a tidy profit of $2,500, but had he held those
500 shares until, say, 1969, they would have been worth about $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   My father's failure to predict the behavior of the market, or
even of a single stock, cannot be held against him, however I might
feel about now having to work for a living. Indeed, the question of
whether the prices of stocks, bonds and other financial commodities
can ever be predicted is one of the great scientific controversies
of our time.
</P>
<P>
   According to orthodox wisdom, financial markets go up and down
with no more predictability than a coin toss, and no amount of
historical knowledge, intuition, tips or analysis will tell you
with any certainty what will happen today, next month or next year.
</P>
<P>
   This paradigm goes by the name of the Efficient Market
Hypothesis (EMH) or the Random Walk Hypothesis, a name derived from
the suggestion that the price of a stock stumbles around a given
value like a drunk around a lamppost.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy rages because of the unavoidable implication of
the hypothesis: if it's true, then traders who make money
speculating in stock movements _ George Soros, for instance, or
Warren Buffett _ are neither brilliant nor intuitively gifted, but
only lucky.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers have collected scientific evidence supporting
the hypothesis, there is also copious evidence to the contrary _ in
particular, everyone who has ever made money in the market.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the last decade has seen a wave of scientists
migrating to Wall Street and applying powerful computers and
sophisticated mathematical tools to the stream of data pouring out
of the world's financial markets. And they have founded a handful
of companies _ Renaissance Technologies, for instance, run by
mathematician Jim Simons, or D. E. Shaw &AMP; Company, run by computer
scientist David Shaw _ that are doing remarkably well placing
wagers on the behavior of financial commodities.
</P>
<P>
   But why? According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the
activity of countless traders competing to buy and sell stocks at
what they think are their proper values forces the market to
instantaneously adjust the price of each stock to what it's really
worth.
</P>
<P>
   When the market moves in response to any relevant news or
information, so the theory goes, it will move so quickly that no
one will be able to make money reliably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (the EMH) says is that the more people who try to
forecast markets, the less forecastable markets tend to be,''
explains Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the Efficient Market Hypothesis, says Lo, comes with the
kind of paradox that offers scientists an opportunity to find a new
truth: If the market is truly efficient, then it leaves no
incentive for anyone to learn new information because they can't
possibly profit from it. But if no one is out there learning it,
then the information will never make it into the market to be
instantaneously absorbed. ``Clearly that's an absurd premise,''
says Lo.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, says Lo, is that the market is efficient, but not
instantaneously so. Small inefficiencies can exist long enough for
traders to take advantage of them, at which point they will be
competed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine out of ten times, the guy who says he can beat the market
is probably wrong, because he doesn't have anything new,'' Lo says.
``All he's observed is a statistical fluctuation, pure luck. But
every once in awhile somebody comes up with a genuinely new idea
for either forecasting the market or assessing information better,
or being able to put all the pieces together in a more
cost-efficient manner. He will make money.''

NOTED CHANTER COLORS STORIES WITH SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ Charles Ka'upu Jr. makes music with just three
notes. They can be any three notes, but three is all he gets.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the premier Hawaiian chanters on the island of Maui,
Ka'upu intones stories that are centuries old and stories he
composed only yesterday. By tradition, no chant, no matter how
complicated the story line, can contain more than three notes.
Otherwise it's considered singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chanting is somewhat like singing, only your options are more
limited,'' Ka'upu said after stepping down from the stage after a
recent performance that included drumming and dancers. ``It can be
fluid. It can be poetic. But you don't have that much room to
explore as you do with do, re, mi.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limitations, Ka'upu makes melodic, rhythmic music
with his voice, sometimes a capella, sometimes accompanying himself
on a tall, tan gourd shaped like a bowling pin or on a drum made
from the trunk of a coconut tree. During the performance, he closed
his eyes, stretched out his arms, and by elongating some notes and
clipping others, turned lyrics that few in his audience could
understand into lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chanting is our record keeping,'' he said. ``It affords us our
history. It's about life, outlook, love. It's our folk music. It's
our rap.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ka'upu, 41, chants in the language of the islands _ a language
he said his parents intentionally did not pass on to their children
in hopes of giving them a better chance at mainstream success.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is more or less fluent in Hawaiian, and considers
himself part of the resurgence of interest in native Hawaiian
heritage. As a chanter, and a teacher, Ka'upu called it his
obligation to keep the culture and traditions alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation and younger people are into discovering their
Hawaiianness,'' he said. ``For my parents' generation and my
grandparents' generation, it wasn't cool to be a Hawaiian.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ka'upu fell in love with chanting the first time he heard
it, in the third grade. Freshman year in high school he took his
first class. By college, he was majoring in Hawaiian studies at the
state university and chanting on the side. But Ka'upu wanted more.
He dropped out and began studying full time with a hula master.
</P>
<P>
   As he explained it, hula encompasses Hawaiian culture, history,
and chanting, as well as the dance associated with the word. Hula
masters, or ``kumus,'' are often older men and women. Considered
the keepers of the culture, they are revered by their students.
</P>
<P>
   His formal hula studies lasted four years, many of them filled
with classes than ran eight to 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
Graduation ceremonies culminated with the consumption of a pig's
brain, a ritual known as ``ailolo,'' which means ``eat brains'' in
Hawaiian. The ritual, which harks back to the days when only kings
ate pork, is meant to imbue the feaster with power and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was nearly two decades ago. Since then, he has worked in a
variety of tourism-related jobs, starting with carrying visitors'
luggage. For years, Ka'upu, who wears his long, wide hair tied back
in a ponytail, hosted a popular local radio show under the moniker
``Bushman.'' People learned his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a good chanter is knowledge because knowledge is
power,'' said Boy Kanae, a radio disc jockey who is Ka'upu's first
cousin by marriage. ``Chanting has made Charles knowledgeable, and
his knowledge has made him one of the best chanters.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ka'upu lectures, teaches, and consults on Hawaiian
history, culture, and religion. But his love is performing with a
hula group named Hapa, which translates into ``ethnically half,''
as islanders of mixed heritage are called.
</P>
<P>
   Born on the Big Island, Ka'upu has lived in Hawaii for all but
three years of his life. Hapa gives him a chance to see America, he
said. Recently he judged a hula competition in San Diego, watching
and listening for the sounds that separate an average chanter from
a potential master. Although there are different styles and
dialects, most could be expected to perform using only three notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is done as a commitment to who we are,'' said Ka'upu, who
teaches for free but charges to perform. ``We have to let others
know and we have to make sure we know ourselves.''

RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR FLEET: ARMED AND DANGEROUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ One day last May, harrowing reports spread to
Murmansk from the naval base 15 miles up the fiord, leaving panic
in their wake: A Delta-class nuclear submarine, armed with 12
ballistic missiles, had suffered a serious accident and was on fire
somewhere in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sketchy and the authorities were eerily silent. But
many of the 500,000 residents of this arctic port city on the Kola
Peninsula had heard enough and begin preparing for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Police received orders to take iodine tablets to protect against
radiation sickness. Radio stations told Murmansk residents to do
the same, and drugstores quickly sold out their iodine supplies.
Schools closed. Children were sent home and told not to open their
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Home to the huge Russian Northern Fleet, which at its height in
the 1980s had about 150 atomic submarines, the region around
Murmansk for decades was a certain target for a massive Western
strike in the event of nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   But now those aging submarines are falling apart, improperly
maintained by an increasingly poor and hungry Russian Navy. They
are floating Chernobyls, nuclear catastrophes waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   And for a few nerve-wracking hours on May 6, it looked as though
Murmansk had survived the Cold War only to face nuclear doomsday
from one of its own subs. People knew that Soviet-era evacuation
plans assumed a third of the population would die during a nuclear
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was panic,'' recalled Lena Vasiliyeva, a Murmansk
environmental activist. ``People were calling me asking what to do,
how much iodine they should take.''
</P>
<P>
   Calm was restored only after the Russian Navy announced on May 7
that the whole thing had been a training exercise. Russian and
foreign environmental groups countered that an accident really had
occurred, probably a fire in one of the submarine's missile shafts.
They pointed to Western military data documenting that a submarine
suddenly surfaced on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole story of an `exercise' was a cover-up,'' the
Norwegian environmental watchdog Bellona, which monitors nuclear
activity in the region, concluded in a report. As if to confirm
this theory, no Northern Fleet submarines went on patrol for the
next three months.
</P>
<P>
   The incident highlighted concerns in Russia and abroad about the
safety of the Kola Peninsula, where 270 military and civilian
nuclear reactors are located, 18 percent of the total number of
reactors on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union did a poor job of disposing of the deadly
radioactive waste from these reactors. Thousands of barrels of
waste and at least 13 reactors were dumped into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says it has stopped dumping its waste in the ocean. But
its storage facilities for nuclear waste are widely acknowledged to
be in horrible shape, often located in the open or in leaky
containers that Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry conceded recently
``do not provide the required level of safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these facilities are run by the military. They are
cloaked in secrecy and off-limits to most civilians, including
local government officials and nuclear safety inspectors. The
secrecy has also prevented a coherent study on the effect of the
radiation on people's health, according to Igor Korolyov, head of
the Murmansk regional government's health committee.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who tries to learn more runs afoul of the authorities.
Alexander Nikitin, a former submarine captain, was charged with
treason after he co-authored a Bellona report on environmental
hazards caused by the Northern Fleet. Last month Nikitin won a
battle in court when a judge suspended his trial, but he remains
under investigation. Vasilyeva says she has received death threats,
and her young son was beaten, by people she described as security
agents trying to frighten her away from her investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst sites are located for all to see, minutes from
downtown Murmansk. The cargo ship Lepse, a 50-year-old vessel
moored in the harbor not far from the city center, looms as a
monument to the dangerous practices of storing Russian nuclear
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Once used as a service ship for Russia's civilian
nuclear-powered icebreakers, Lepse was converted in the early 1980s
into a floating waste bin for spent nuclear fuel. Some of the fuel
rods jammed into its hold are damaged and cannot be removed safely
because the ship's surface is highly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   A European Union-funded project to clean up Lepse is under way.
But a far larger threat is posed by subs that cost more than the
post-Soviet economy can afford or that have been decommissioned
because of arms reduction agreements or old age.
</P>
<P>
   Of the former Soviet Union's 250 atomic submarines, about 160
have been decomissioned. Only about 50 have had their nuclear fuel
removed, according to Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry. There are
104 more that still contain fuel that cannot be scrapped, Those
subs are rotting at their docks. To prevent them from sinking and
avoid problems with their reactors, the submarines have to be
maintained by small crews and require costly shore support.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 of these decommissioned submarines are moored at bases
and shipyards around the Kola Peninsula. The rest are part of the
Pacific Fleet in the Russian Far East.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is helping to pay for the scrapping of
submarines by supplying Russia with the guillotines and presses
that turn vessels into scrap metal, once their reactors and nuclear
waste have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Senator Richard Lugar, a sponsor of the Nunn-Lugar
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which has provided more than
$2 billion to former Soviet states since 1991, vowed continued
support after watching Delta class submarines being chopped up with
American equipment at the Zvezdochka shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States is not involved in financing the defueling
of the submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The reactors of decommissioned submarines are supposed to be
deactivated and removed and the liquid and solid radioactive waste
sent off to the Mayak reprocessing plant outside of Chelyabinsk, a
city in the Ural Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Russia has no money and inadequate facilities to
transfer the fuel. So it has a growing backlog of poorly stored
nuclear waste. The only way to get it out of Murmansk is on a
special train that takes it to Mayak. But this train has only made
two trips this year. At that rate, it will take at least 50 years
to dispose of the waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the technology to solve the probem,'' said
Andrei Zolotkov, chief engineer at Atomflot, the Murmansk
enterprise in charge of maintenance of civilian nuclear-powered
ships. ``We just put the'' waste ``in containers and fill them up
and fill them up some more. There is no storage site where all of
this can be sent forever. As long as we don't have this, there will
be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   What can go wrong on the decommissioned subs? For one thing, the
removal of their fuel requires dangerous transfers of radioactive
materials, much of it by sea. During refueling in 1985, a submarine
reactor exploded near the Pacific port of Vladivostok. The
resulting lethal radioactive cloud missed the city only because the
wind was blowing in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a decommissioned sub in the Pacific fleet sank after
it was hit by another vessel, according to a January report in
Jane's Navy International, a leading naval periodical. The magazine
said reactors kept in floating storage had also been briefly lost
at sea during foul weather.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the human factor. ``A human mistake can lead
to serious consequences,'' Zolotkov said. ``We know subs don't have
food and that it's cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the Northern Fleet are indeed dire. Officers go
months without pay, forcing them to forgo vacations and even basic
food items. From all accounts, the situation on the subs themselves
is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a sailor killed eight of his fellow crewmates and
briefly hijacked a nuclear-powered attack sub. The sailor,
Alexander Kuzminikh, an 18-year-old draftee from St. Petersburg,
threatened to blow up the ship's nuclear-tipped torpedoes. The
drama ended when he took his own life.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy spokesman quickly assured horrified Russians that the
Alfa-class sub was unarmed and that its titanium hull was
impervious to any harm the sailor might have tried to inflict. But
the spokesman's dismissive explanation that Kuzminikh had ``just
gone mad'' seemed to underscore the fleet's morale problem.
</P>
<P>
   The military has done little to clean up the mess left by its
submarines. To expedite the process, the Russian government in
August transferred the job to the Atomic Energy Ministry. But it is
unclear how the cash-strapped ministry, already unable to pay its
workers at closed nuclear-research facilities and nuclear power
plants, will find the money to conduct the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped Nikolai Melnikov, director of the Kola
Peninsula's Mining Institute, who is in charge of developing safe
underground storage facilities for the waste. His plans look good.
But no one in the Murmansk region or neighboring Arkhangelsk wants
the facilities built in either area. Besides, there is no money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technical engineering problem of building the sites is
solved,'' Melnikov said. ``The social, political and financial
problems remain.''

FOR BBC'S COOKE AT 90, REPORTING IS AGELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ He is the Dorian Gray of journalism, looking today
almost as he did 25 years ago, when he was 65 and first entitled to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   But with Alistair Cooke, age is irrelevant, because it was
always the voice, the delivery, the inflection, and the mind that
mattered, all of which are extraordinary and seemingly immune to
age.
</P>
<P>
   For 52 years, he has sought out and often found the nuance of
his adopted country, the United States. Nov. 20, Cooke turned 90
and that night delivered his 2,597th ``Letter from America,'' his
signature radio dispatch for the British Broadcasting Corporation.
It is heard in more than 50 countries, and is the longest-running
radio show in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke is Walter Winchell, Walter Cronkite, and Walter Mitty
rolled into one. He revered H.L. Mencken, idolized Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, and wrote a biography of Douglas Fairbanks. Humphrey
Bogart and Lauren Bacall were among his best friends.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he describes himself simply as a reporter. If the
standards of journalism have changed, he has not. In an age when
even the prim and proper BBC is marketing its reporters as
personalities, Cooke continues to put his stories, not himself, on
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is the world's best-known Englishman who isn't
in a rock band. Most Americans know him as the man who sat in an
armchair and introduced ``Masterpiece Theatre'' on PBS for 22
years. His history of America, also broadcast on PBS, informed as
many Americans as it did Britons.
</P>
<P>
   For some Americans, his was the first and maybe only foreign
accent they heard with regularity. It hinted at the strange and
wonderful world that lay out there. Some thought him stuffy, and in
1993 he was replaced as ``Masterpiece Theatre'' host by the New
York Times columnist Russell Baker, who promptly declared he would
have preferred to have been the host who replaced the host who
replaced Alistair Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   But while he loves America, Cooke never sought American-style
fame, and when he retired from his PBS gig, he simply continued
doing what he began in 1946: his ``Letter from America,'' which
wryly describes for Britons a place he and they regard with equal
measures of awe, admiration, and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Through more than a half-century of work that was remarkable for
its simultaneous simplicity and erudition, Cooke became America's
most admired Englishman and England's best-loved American,
peppering observations about the mundane with literary flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   As the BBC experiments with going hip, hiring beautiful women to
deliver the TV news, Cooke is a throwback, a journalist whose
flawless delivery in the King's English made him and his program an
institution here. Last month, BBC listeners voted him the best
living speaker of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   He has outlasted 11 US presidents, 17 British prime ministers,
65 armchairs on the set of ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' and countless
producers at the Beeb who assumed he would go long before they did.
While PBS dumped him for a younger man, the Brits would never dream
of putting Cooke out to pasture. Like Thurgood Marshall, one of the
Supreme Court justices he admired, Cooke has vowed to go out only
in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke was famous for delivering his ``Masterpiece Theatre''
introduction from memory, without a teleprompter. Most people
assume he sent his American dispatches back with similar
spontaneity. But those who have seen him in action tell a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   True, Cooke pecks out his script on an antiquated Royal
typewriter on Thursdays in his modest, rent-controlled apartment on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, using a pen to make a change here or
there. But after taking a taxi to the BBC studios, he is, as a
perfectionist, prepared to do take after take.
</P>
<P>
   John Humphrys, who hosts the ``Today'' program on BBC Radio 4,
which broadcasts Cooke's ``Letter from America'' here, met Cooke 30
years ago when he became the BBC's first TV correspondent in New
York. Humphrys watched in awe one Thursday afternoon as Cooke taped
his broadcast for Friday night, repeating the process until it was
just right.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has what some say are aristocratic airs, Cooke was
born and raised in Manchester, a working-class city in northern
England, and was the son of a Methodist preacher. He displayed an
academic talent that broke through England's stifling class system,
and won degrees at Cambridge, Yale, and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He got his start in journalism by penning a theater review for
the Manchester Guardian in 1929. He soon became the BBC's film
critic. But a fellowship to the United States in 1932 changed
everything. He was spellbound as he watched Americans work their
way out of the Depression under Roosevelt's New Deal. He moved to
the United States permanently in 1937 and became a US citizen in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Cooke began what was supposed to be a 13-week radio
series on America. As his biographer, Nick Clarke, put it: ``At the
start his brief was to get away from the grim seriousness of
wartime reporting, and concentrate on the springs of American life,
whose bubbles are the headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 minutes, he could talk about anything that caught his
fancy. But Cooke was more than a pundit. He was a dogged reporter
who lost 15 pounds covering the foundation of the United Nations in
San Francisco, writing for several newspapers in addition to his
BBC work. His 1950 book, ``A Generation on Trial,'' about the Alger
Hiss trial, hinted early on that McCarthyism was on the horizon. He
was there, in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, when Robert F.
Kennedy was shot, and his handwritten notes became the basis of one
of the most evocative accounts of the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the gabble of the television,'' he wrote, ``there was
suddenly from the direction of the kitchen a crackle of sharp
sounds. Like a balloon popping. An exploded flash bulb maybe, more
like a man banging a tray several times against a wall. A half
dozen or so of us trotted to the kitchen door, and at that moment
time and life collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was without faults. Like George Frazier, the late,
great Boston columnist, Cooke was a bane to his editors. In a 1968
editorial, the Guardian observed: ``Cooke is a nuisance. He
telephones his copy at the last moment, so that everything else has
to be dropped to get it into the paper. He says that he will be in
Chicago and turns up in Los Angeles. He discards the agreed subject
to write about something which has taken his fancy, news of the
moment or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' the editorial concluded, ``we think he's worth it, and
we love him just the same.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Cooke reminisced about his favorite ``talks,''
as he calls his ``Letter from America.'' He recalled San Francisco,
the source of so many subjects, and how its suspension bridge makes
music in the wind, ``like a harp, played by the witches in
`Macbeth.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said the story that provoked the most mail was broadcast in
1950. He called it ``A Baby is Missing.'' It told of a child who
was born premature in New York City. The baby was put in an
incubator but soon went missing. It turned out the baby was
abducted by a deranged teenager, grief-stricken after giving birth
to stillborn twins. Detectives were alerted to the baby when they
heard what Cooke described as ``a thin broken wail, like the
complaint of a powerful kitten.''
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, the baby thrived under the care of a
``forlorn, half-crazy girl,'' who had in her seedy apartment the
books and equipment for infant care one might find in a wealthy
home. On Friday night, Cooke closed with the same script that
reassured his listeners 48 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is, at this writing, a year old, and very fit, and
laughing its head off,'' Alistair Cooke said. ``Good night.''

RECORD-SETTING LAUGHTER ALONG THE NILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Egyptians are having a good laugh at themselves these
days.
</P>
<P>
   In movie theaters from Cairo's most elegant neighborhoods to
remote farming villages along the Nile, a classic coming-of-age
tale has broken box-office records. It focuses on a country boy
from the backwater town of Sohag who comes to the very Westernized
American University of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper ads for the movie titled ``Saeedi fil
Gama Al-Amrikiya'' (An Upper Egyptian at the American University) 2
million people flocked to see it in the first five weeks after it
was released in August. To date, 6 million _ or one in 10 Egyptians
_ have seen the film, according to one reviewer. It is by all
accounts the highest grossing film in the history of Egyptian
cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a film like it in decades, perhaps ever,''
said Tarek Atia, a writer on film and entertainment for Egypt's
respected Al Ahram Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acting is fresh and done by largely unknown, young actors
who are rebelling against the more stodgy industry actors in
Egypt's cinema,'' Atia added. ``But what makes it unique is its
popularity. It just seems to have struck a perfect balance, making
a serious comment on the pervasive American influence without
offending or threatening anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Mohamed Heneidy, who plays the central character, may
be Egypt's answer to Jerry Lewis. He is hilarious in poking fun at
the ubiquitous American influence _ in everything from Pizza Hut to
MTV _ in this proud and traditional country.
</P>
<P>
   He arrives at the sophisticated college campus of American
University dressed in a loud yellow suit with an even louder purple
tie. The classic country hick is clearly out of step with his
Americanized classmates, who are clad in Gap and Banana Republic
outfits, some sporting a suburban hip-hop look of baggy pants and
New York Yankee caps turned backward.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack is also a big hit. In one scene the Heneidy
character's friends take him to a shopping mall to reform his lack
of style. As he tries on ridiculously American outfits, he breaks
into a song titled ``Casual-oo.'' Roughly translated from the
Arabic, the lyrics behind a disco beat are ``Make me casual. Make
me trendy. Make me American.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the movie also takes on some more serious clashes of Western
society within Egypt. One student radical urges his classmates to
join him in a protest against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and American support of Israel. At first Heneidy declines but then
reluctantly joins.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Heneidy's character is the one to put a lighter to a
gasoline-soaked Israeli flag. As it burns, theaters throughout
Egypt burst into applause _ a chilling example of just how cold the
peace between the two nations is even 20 years after the signing of
a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   When arrested he explains his actions to university
administrators this way: ``It had nothing to do with politics, it
just happened. And to tell you the truth, it felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Heneidy's character goes beyond politics and
beyond Western influence. In his valedictory speech to his
classmates, he says, ``It's what's inside you that counts.'' (Who
says a comedy needs a profound final message?)
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Odeon Theater in downtown Cairo, moviegoers
delivered similar sidewalk reviews. Naila Hamdy, an associate
professor at American University, said, ``The political message is
weak. They could have dropped the whole flag-burning scene but
there is an obsession in Arab films to deliver a moral. For me it
was just a simple, funny movie. And sometimes that is all you
need.''

(Repeating for all needing.) 
 WASHINGTON: her lawyer.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under Rule 4.2 the American Bar Association Model Rules of
Professional Conduct, lawyers, including prosecutors, may not talk
directly to someone who might be involved in litigation or an
investigation if they know that person is represented by a lawyer.
A separate bar association manual on criminal matters makes it even
clearer that prosecutors should step aside immediately when they
learn someone they are interviewing is represented by a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened there was very improper,'' said Professor
Geoffrey Hazard of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. The
issue was so basic, he said, that even people whose only
information comes from television shows know that prosecutors are
not supposed to talk to subjects of an investigation once it's
clear they have a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Professor Bob Tuttle of the George Washington University Law
School said the situation is far from clear and that Starr may not
be bound by those guidelines. The manual for prosecutors is only
advisory, he said, and the Justice Department has long resisted
efforts to make the model code apply to its prosecutors. Congress
has approved legislation requiring the Justice Department to adhere
to the model code, he said, but it takes effect late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr is independent from the Justice Department, the
law authorizing his appointment provides that he must adhere to
department guidelines whenever possible. But Starr made clear that
he believed the guidelines were not an issue because Ms. Lewinsky's
perception that she was being threatened was inaccurate, and
because she had been free to leave the hotel at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used traditional law enforcement techniques,'' he said in
response to charges that the prosecutors threatened Ms. Lewinsky
with 27 years in jail and her mother's imprisonment. In fact, such
threats are common in the hard-edged world of modern prosecutors.
And he said his prosecutors did not have to allow Ms. Lewinsky to
contact her lawyer because he represented her in a civil matter,
the Paula Jones case, not a criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   On only one point did Starr give some ground. He conceded that
his agents may have gone too far if, as alleged, they went to the
school of a 16-year-old in Arkansas to serve a subpoena on him.

THE CASE (IF ANY) AGAINST THE PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Judiciary Committee hearing wore on into the
night last Thursday, Kenneth Starr came to resemble not so much a
congressional witness as a defendant in the dock. It was a display
of how much President Clinton's supporters have succeeded in
turning the issue before the nation from the impeachability of the
president to the behavior of Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   When David Kendall, the president's lawyer, questioned him near
the end of the hearing, Starr was goaded into shedding his Mr.
Rogers-goes-to-Congress-to-explain-things manner. Instead, he was
briefly reduced to indignant denials. And, although Kendall is the
president's defense lawyer, he did not spend a moment of his
allotted hour defending the president.
</P>
<P>
   There was really only The Case Against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The main arguments about the behavior and approach of Starr and
his associates concern how they have treated witnesses, notably
Monica Lewinsky, and whether they leaked confidential grand jury
proceedings. Critics have also raised other issues, including
whether Starr was involved improperly in Paula Corbin Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to portray Starr as vindictive and
unprofessional, Democrats have hinted darkly that Starr broke some
rule or violated some law. But the rules that govern prosecutorial
conduct are, for the most part, vaguely worded exhortations and
proscriptions in bar association manuals and Justice Department
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Charles Wolfram of the Cornell Law School, an
authority in legal ethics, said the rules about prosecutorial
misconduct are inherently vague and have been intentionally left
that way by the courts. ``Courts continually say that it is not the
behavior of the prosecutor that should be put on trial unless
there's something really extraordinary that happens,'' he said.
Moreover, he said, ``you never get a sharp definition of what these
vaguely orded guidelines mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Starr have been lobbed in the highly
specialized and partisan context of an impeachment proceeding, an
atmosphere with the subtlety of, say, Monday Night Football. In
such a proceeding, Wolfram said, the nuances of Starr's behavior
matter far less than broad impressions about whether he is fair.
``He can't just be another prosecutor playing fast and loose with
the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for perceptions, Starr suffered a blow Friday when
Samuel Dash abruptly resigned as his ethics adviser. The presence
of Dash, who was counsel to the Senate Watergate committee in 1973,
lent an air of rectitude to Starr's operation. Dash praised Starr's
overall conduct, but said that he had overstepped his bounds by
becoming an advocate for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But just as everyday prosecutors are rarely punished for
wrongdoing, Starr and his deputies are largely immune from penalty
even if some of the charges against them prove true. As an
independent counsel, he is chiefly the judge of his own behavior,
although he could be fired for misconduct by Attorney General Janet
Reno. She has shown little interest so far in complaints from the
White House about Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The area in which the guidelines are the most explicit and the
issue that may pose the greatest threat to Starr is the allegation
that his office improperly leaked grand jury information. The
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure flatly prohibit prosecutors
from disclosing grand jury matters.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that 24 news
accounts about the investigation of President Clinton appear to
show that prosecutors in Starr's office discussed grand jury
matters with reporters. The judge described the articles and
broadcasts as ``serious and repetitive'' evidence that Starr and
his staff may have violated the law. As a result, Starr now has to
prove that his office was not responsible for any of those 24 news
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue produced the liveliest moments in the Starr-Kendall
confrontation Thursday night. Kendall read from some of the news
accounts, noting that they included phrases like, ``sources in
Starr's office tell us,'' ``sources near Starr,'' and ``prosecutors
suggest.'' He then asked, ``Does the media make up these quotes,
Mr. Starr?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr replied, ``I'm not here to accuse the media of anything,''
adding that the matter was under litigation and it was unfair to
raise it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall countered, ``Mr. Starr, in fact, there has been no case
remotely similar to this in terms of the massive leaking from the
prosecutor's office, and I think we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr replied: ``I totally disagree with that. That's an
accusation and it's an unfair accusation. I completely reject it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Johnson were to find that Starr or his deputies
improperly disclosed grand jury materials, they could face
sanctions. The Judge could formally censure anyone in Starr's
office found to have violated the law, a significant blow to a
legal career.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also defended himself against charges that Ms. Lewinsky
was mistreated when his prosecutors first confronted her in a
suburban Virginia hotel last January. She told a grand jury she was
threatened, detained and discouraged from calling her lawyer or her
mother. ``You're 24, you're smart,'' she said a prosecutor told
her. ``You're old enough. You don't need to call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   However heavy-handed those comments might have been, the issue
that might run afoul of ethics guidelines is whether the
prosecutors tried to engage her as a witness after she asked to
speak to her lawyer.

<P>
   By better than 3 to 1, Connecticut residents support Governor
John Rowland's plan to use state funding to bring the New England
Patriots to Hartford, according to a new Globe poll.
</P>
<P>
   However, a majority of those surveyed doubt that the proposed
taxes on tickets and incomes levied on Patriots players and
officials will cover the $350 million-plus cost of a new stadium,
and two-thirds say the money would be better used for education and
other public priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, 27 percent say they would attend Patriots games in
Hartford ``often.'' If that proportion holds up when the proposed
stadium opens in 2001, it easily would produce sellouts for its
68,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The results come from a KRC Communications Research telephone
survey of 400 Connecticut adults Friday evening and Saturday,
before details became widely known of the extraordinary perks and
benefits being offered by Rowland to Patriots owner Robert Kraft,
including state guarantees to pay him up to $175 million over 10
years for unsold luxury seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the deal can be paid for the way they say it can be
paid for, Connecticut's arms are wide open,'' Gerry Chervinsky of
KRC said of the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think there's serious concern that, even in the current
excitement that people feel about this deal, the revenue stream
that's been identified won't cover the cost,'' Chervinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Chervinsky said some results indicate that ``if Connecticut
residents are made aware of some of the benefits Kraft gets from
the deal, it may give them cause for concern, but I don't believe
that many people are aware of them yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they support or oppose the use of state funding to
bring the team to Hartford, Connecticut residents back the plan 69
percent to 21 percent. Just under 90 percent of those surveyed say
the stadium is very likely or somewhat likely to spark
redevelopment of downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether they believe the proposed taxes will
cover all the costs of the stadium and related improvements, 56
percent say they will not, and 34 percent say they think the taxes
will cover the costs. Skepticism was markedly higher among people
over 65.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven percent say the state funds ``would be better used
for other priorities like education,'' while 23 percent disagree.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the fact that Kraft would receive all parking
and concession revenues from stadium events, excluding University
of Connecticut football games, 50 percent say this made them more
opposed to the plan, and 27 percent more supportive.
</P>
<P>
   A majority, 53 percent, say they believe Kraft intends to move
the team to Hartford, while 24 percent think he is using the deal
``as leverage for a deal in Massachusetts'' for a new or renovated
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's promise to keep the team in Connecticut for 30 years,
move all its offices and training facilities there, build a hotel
and entertainment pavilion, and share the stadium with the
University of Connecticut team all lead large majorities of
residents to express more support for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The responses to several questions offer good news for the
Patriots as they face trying to sell tickets in Connecticut: 67
percent of Connecticut residents call themselves football fans, 54
percent say that moving the team to Hartford would make them more
interested in pro football generally, and 55 percent say having the
team in Hartford would make them more likely to be Patriots fans.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 percent say they attend Patriots games at Foxboro often,
while 25 percent say they attend ``once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   If the team moves to Hartford, 27 percent say they would attend
Patriots games often, and 43 percent say they would attend once in
a while. (The question did not mention the expected $50 average
ticket price.)
</P>
<P>
   Even if the enthusiasm level wanes dramatically, it still
suggests a huge pool of potential ticket buyers within Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimated the state's 1996 population at 3.2
million, including 2.4 million who are 18 or older. If 27 percent
of the adults want to attend games in Hartford often, that would
translate to 668,000 potential ticket buyers _ about 11 people
seeking every one of the planned 61,000 non-luxury-box seats.
</P>
<P>
   However, tickets for Connecticut residents could be hard to come
by. Kraft has said the team's 57,000 current season ticket holders,
just 12 percent of whom are from Connecticut, will have first
chance to purchase tickets once the team moves. Although some
current holders are likely to give up their seats, Patriots
officials say there already is a waiting list of 10,000 names for
season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   From a business perspective, that will serve to keep demand high
and probably guarantee frequent sellouts. At any rate, the Globe
poll indicates that even if the Patriots become a losing team, 20
percent say they still would attend games in Hartford often, and 38
percent ``once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong support for the deal may reflect the popularity of
Rowland and Kraft. Rowland is seen as favorable by 69 percent,
while 13 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. For Kraft, the
figures are 42 percent favorable and 10 percent unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   While some observers have speculated that Connecticut largely is
New York Giants territory, 25 percent of the residents call the
Patriots their favorite NFL team, compared to 17 percent who name
the Giants and 7 percent the New York Jets. Both the Giants and
Jets play home games in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the results in Connecticut resemble those from
Massachusetts on the value and importance of having an NFL team in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   In an October 1997 poll, Massachusetts residents favored using
state funding to keep the Patriots by 51 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a February 1995 poll, when asked how important it is ``to the
image of Massachusetts'' to have a pro football team, 37 percent
said very important, 38 percent said somewhat important, and 24
percent said not important.
</P>
<P>
   Those results are similar to the new Connecticut poll: 38
percent of Nutmeg State residents called a professional football
team very important to the state's image, 40 percent somewhat
important, and 20 percent said it is not important.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll's margin of error is plus-or-minus 5 percent,
meaning that 19 times out of 20 such a poll was conducted, the
results would not vary by more than 5 percent from the actual
opinions of all Connecticut residents if they could be surveyed.

FOR BBC'S COOKE AT 90, REPORTING IS AGELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ He is the Dorian Gray of journalism, looking today
almost as he did 25 years ago, when he was 65 and first entitled to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   But with Alistair Cooke, age is irrelevant, because it was
always the voice, the delivery, the inflection, and the mind that
mattered, all of which are extraordinary and seemingly immune to
age.
</P>
<P>
   For 52 years, he has sought out and often found the nuance of
his adopted country, the United States. Nov. 20, Cooke turned 90
and that night delivered his 2,597th ``Letter from America,'' his
signature radio dispatch for the British Broadcasting Corporation.
It is heard in more than 50 countries, and is the longest-running
radio show in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke is Walter Winchell, Walter Cronkite, and Walter Mitty
rolled into one. He revered H.L. Mencken, idolized Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, and wrote a biography of Douglas Fairbanks. Humphrey
Bogart and Lauren Bacall were among his best friends.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he describes himself simply as a reporter. If the
standards of journalism have changed, he has not. In an age when
even the prim and proper BBC is marketing its reporters as
personalities, Cooke continues to put his stories, not himself, on
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is the world's best-known Englishman who isn't
in a rock band. Most Americans know him as the man who sat in an
armchair and introduced ``Masterpiece Theatre'' on PBS for 22
years. His history of America, also broadcast on PBS, informed as
many Americans as it did Britons.
</P>
<P>
   For some Americans, his was the first and maybe only foreign
accent they heard with regularity. It hinted at the strange and
wonderful world that lay out there. Some thought him stuffy, and in
1993 he was replaced as ``Masterpiece Theatre'' host by the New
York Times columnist Russell Baker, who promptly declared he would
have preferred to have been the host who replaced the host who
replaced Alistair Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   But while he loves America, Cooke never sought American-style
fame, and when he retired from his PBS gig, he simply continued
doing what he began in 1946: his ``Letter from America,'' which
wryly describes for Britons a place he and they regard with equal
measures of awe, admiration, and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Through more than a half-century of work that was remarkable for
its simultaneous simplicity and erudition, Cooke became America's
most admired Englishman and England's best-loved American,
peppering observations about the mundane with literary flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   As the BBC experiments with going hip, hiring beautiful women to
deliver the TV news, Cooke is a throwback, a journalist whose
flawless delivery in the King's English made him and his program an
institution here. Last month, BBC listeners voted him the best
living speaker of the English language.
</P>
<P>
   He has outlasted 11 US presidents, 17 British prime ministers,
65 armchairs on the set of ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' and countless
producers at the Beeb who assumed he would go long before they did.
While PBS dumped him for a younger man, the Brits would never dream
of putting Cooke out to pasture. Like Thurgood Marshall, one of the
Supreme Court justices he admired, Cooke has vowed to go out only
in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke was famous for delivering his ``Masterpiece Theatre''
introduction from memory, without a teleprompter. Most people
assume he sent his American dispatches back with similar
spontaneity. But those who have seen him in action tell a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   True, Cooke pecks out his script on an antiquated Royal
typewriter on Thursdays in his modest, rent-controlled apartment on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, using a pen to make a change here or
there. But after taking a taxi to the BBC studios, he is, as a
perfectionist, prepared to do take after take.
</P>
<P>
   John Humphrys, who hosts the ``Today'' program on BBC Radio 4,
which broadcasts Cooke's ``Letter from America'' here, met Cooke 30
years ago when he became the BBC's first TV correspondent in New
York. Humphrys watched in awe one Thursday afternoon as Cooke taped
his broadcast for Friday night, repeating the process until it was
just right.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has what some say are aristocratic airs, Cooke was
born and raised in Manchester, a working-class city in northern
England, and was the son of a Methodist preacher. He displayed an
academic talent that broke through England's stifling class system,
and won degrees at Cambridge, Yale, and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He got his start in journalism by penning a theater review for
the Manchester Guardian in 1929. He soon became the BBC's film
critic. But a fellowship to the United States in 1932 changed
everything. He was spellbound as he watched Americans work their
way out of the Depression under Roosevelt's New Deal. He moved to
the United States permanently in 1937 and became a US citizen in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Cooke began what was supposed to be a 13-week radio
series on America. As his biographer, Nick Clarke, put it: ``At the
start his brief was to get away from the grim seriousness of
wartime reporting, and concentrate on the springs of American life,
whose bubbles are the headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 minutes, he could talk about anything that caught his
fancy. But Cooke was more than a pundit. He was a dogged reporter
who lost 15 pounds covering the foundation of the United Nations in
San Francisco, writing for several newspapers in addition to his
BBC work. His 1950 book, ``A Generation on Trial,'' about the Alger
Hiss trial, hinted early on that McCarthyism was on the horizon. He
was there, in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, when Robert F.
Kennedy was shot, and his handwritten notes became the basis of one
of the most evocative accounts of the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the gabble of the television,'' he wrote, ``there was
suddenly from the direction of the kitchen a crackle of sharp
sounds. Like a balloon popping. An exploded flash bulb maybe, more
like a man banging a tray several times against a wall. A half
dozen or so of us trotted to the kitchen door, and at that moment
time and life collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was without faults. Like George Frazier, the late,
great Boston columnist, Cooke was a bane to his editors. In a 1968
editorial, the Guardian observed: ``Cooke is a nuisance. He
telephones his copy at the last moment, so that everything else has
to be dropped to get it into the paper. He says that he will be in
Chicago and turns up in Los Angeles. He discards the agreed subject
to write about something which has taken his fancy, news of the
moment or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' the editorial concluded, ``we think he's worth it, and
we love him just the same.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Cooke reminisced about his favorite ``talks,''
as he calls his ``Letter from America.'' He recalled San Francisco,
the source of so many subjects, and how its suspension bridge makes
music in the wind, ``like a harp, played by the witches in
`Macbeth.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said the story that provoked the most mail was broadcast in
1950. He called it ``A Baby is Missing.'' It told of a child who
was born premature in New York City. The baby was put in an
incubator but soon went missing. It turned out the baby was
abducted by a deranged teenager, grief-stricken after giving birth
to stillborn twins. Detectives were alerted to the baby when they
heard what Cooke described as ``a thin broken wail, like the
complaint of a powerful kitten.''
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, the baby thrived under the care of a
``forlorn, half-crazy girl,'' who had in her seedy apartment the
books and equipment for infant care one might find in a wealthy
home. On Friday night, Cooke closed with the same script that
reassured his listeners 48 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is, at this writing, a year old, and very fit, and
laughing its head off,'' Alistair Cooke said. ``Good night.''

 ANCHORAGE: ... future growth.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   However, Stephen Haycox, a historian at the university, says
other Americans have changed their view of Alaska far more than the
Alaskans have. The state, home to an astonishing two-thirds of the
nation's parkland, has become a battleground &UR; , &LR;  pitting Alaskans
who want to log, mine and otherwise develop the state against
national environmental groups trying to slow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 30 or 40 years, Alaska has gone from being the
last frontier to the last wilderness'' in the national
consciousness, Haycox explained. Frontiers, he said, are there to
be developed, while the public wants wilderness preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's current identity crisis dates to the construction of
the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline in the mid-1970s, a project that
brought tens of thousands of people and untold wealth to a state
that previously had provided only a hard scrabble existence to many
residents. Today, Alaska has the highest median income in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Spaulding remembers a much more rough &UR; - &LR; and &UR; - &LR; tumble place
before oil became king and Alaska became ``a welfare state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the wild, wild West up here,'' he said. ``To be a
New England kid and go into a bar like Chilkoot Charlie's and see a
guy take a side piece and lay it on the bar, and the bartender put
it away for him, it was like `Whoa.' I had probably seen a pistol
once in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   With the oil pipeline came high-rise offices and money for
public buildings such as the Center for the Performing Arts in
Anchorage, which hosted the broadway play ``Cats'' last month.
Anchorage became a city of well-paid white collar workers, many of
them serving the oil boom.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alaska profitted from a growing national concern for
the place, such as a 1980 act of Congress that turned 100 million
acres of the state into national parks, forests &UR; , &LR;  and refuges.
Though Alaskans resented the federal intrusion, it was accompanied
by huge investments, including the smart row of federal buildings
on Anchorage's C Street. Federal spending amounted to $7,719 per
Alaskan in 1997, more than any other state but Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the ``wild, wild West'' is largely for commercial
consumption. Chilkoot Charlie's, for instance, capitalizes on its
frontier image with a rough-hewn log exterior and a bearded
prospector logo. But the gun slingers are long gone, replaced by
live bands, beer-tastings, and swing dance lessons.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are complaints that the state's $1 billion
tourist industry has created a kind of ``Alaskaland'' theme park of
gold rush towns, bear-viewing stands, and souvenir shops that have
little resemblance to the real Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment could be moved to _ an Alaska-theme hotel in
Vegas, say _ and the experience would be much the same'' for many
tourists, wrote Anchorage Press columnist Ed Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Anchorage is the brains of Alaska, providing much of
the expertise in medicine, computers, telecommunications &UR; , &LR;  and
other fields that allows the rural areas to survive. Though
Alaskans talk a lot about ``The Bush,'' &UR;  &LR; or rural areas, few
professionals, it turns out, want to live there.
</P>
<P>
   The real Anchorage is also the shopping capitol of Alaska, with
more than twice as much retail space as the national average for a
city of its size. In a sign that Anchorage is a true shoping hot
spot, The Gap opened an outlet this summer, completing the
youth-oriented clothing company's quest for stores in all 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   But the surge of retail activity is pulling down average wages
long buoyed by the high-paying oil industry. Alaskans still have
the country's highest median income, $50,829 a year, but it has
fallen by $1,255 over the last two years as companies such as
Wal-Mart overtake oil and seafood companies as leading employers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, residential growth has filled in open space so
that, from the air, south Anchorage looks much like any other
suburban cluster of cul de sacs, except that yards have trampolines
instead of pools.
</P>
<P>
   Anchorage is plagued by rush hour traffic jams _ and more than
100 vehicle-moose collisions a year. Freshwater is increasingly
contaminated by runoff from private septic systems, and there are
few signs of a slowdown. The developers of Sahalee, a 116-home-lot
project in south Anchorage, say customers are lining up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a name on every lot ... Sometimes, there are two or
three names,'' said Wendy Mikowski of the Real Estate Co.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes have had a cumulative effect on the Anchorage
psyche, frustrating people who thought they came to Alaska to get
away from the madding crowd. Kevin Waring, director of physical
planning, says the city's growth has made many people realize that
government can help preserve quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just grown up. We are not a frontier town any more,''
said Waring.
</P>
<P>
   But some want more proof that times are changing in a state
whose three members of Congress are among the most conservative &UR; , &LR; 
and at the height of their power.
</P>
<P>
   True, Gov. Knowles, a Democrat known for developing a trail
system in Anchorage when he was mayor, won a landslide victory
early this month, but that has more to do with his opponent's
weakness than with Knowles's vision for managing growth. In fact,
the governor has closely allied himself with the oil industry and
generally keeps quiet on issues such as suburban &UR;  &LR; sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts native Spaulding says the Alaska he loves is a
victim of the same demoraphics that make it such an interesting
place. Though current population growth is mostly children born in
Alaska, the state remains a society of transients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't thinking of staying here their whole
lives,'' he said. ``I don't think they have the same values about
the land, because they aren't thinking about passing it on.''

   CLINTON PLEDGES TO HELP GUAM TOWARD SELF-GOVERNMENT
</P>
<P>

<P>
   C.1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   HAGATNA, Guam _ Ending a five-day Asia swing where America's day
begins, President Clinton pledged Monday to help Guam, the
westernmost territory of the United States, transform itself from a
Cold War sentry post to a 21st-century gateway to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to assist Guam in its journey toward increased
self-government, should the territory's 150,000 residents opt for
change in their status through a referendum 13 months from now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want Congress to act to help the people of Guam meet their
challenges and give you more effective self-government,'' Clinton
told an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people gathered in a
tropical public park. ''We will also respond seriously if the
people of Guam seek a different political status. It is your
decision to seek that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his remarks in the final speech of an Asian trip
that took him to Japan and South Korea before a stopover on this
south Pacific island en route back to Washington. He left Guam on
Monday morning aboard Air Force One and was scheduled to arrive at
Andrews Air Force Base Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Because Guam is 15 hours ahead of Washington, folks here boast
that this is where the day begins for the United States.

   Just 30 miles long and 8.5 miles wide, Guam has been a strategic
outpost since it was discovered by Spanish explorer Ferdinand
Magellan in 1521. In 1898, the Spanish ceded the south Pacific
island to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan occupied Guam during World War II, but U.S. troops took it
back in three weeks of bitter fighting in 1944 that left 1,300
Americans dead.
</P>
<P>
   In their memory, Clinton laid a large wreath of exotic red,
white, yellow and purple flowers at the Pacific National Historical
Park overlooking the sparkling blue waters of Asan Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He later paid tribute again to their sacrifice and to the
thousands of Guamanians who lost their lives during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though 15 time zones and a vast ocean separate you from the
mainland, you have played an important role in the history of
America and in humanity's fight for freedom,'' Clinton said.
''Fifty years later, I want to say, on behalf of every American,
thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Guam served U.S. security interests again throughout the Cold
War, when steely Stratofortress bombers, Starlifter cargo planes
and Navy attack helicopters stood guard against the Soviet threat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 50 years, U.S. air and naval stations here were
major staging grounds for American operations in wars in Korea,
Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. The military facilities here were
again pressed into service just two years ago, when the United
States evacuated 6,000 Kurdish rebels from northern Iraq, bringing
many of them here temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The Andersen Air Force Base remains an important point in the
Pentagon's global strategy, a remote way station that can be used
for refueling, stockpiling weapons or humanitarian supplies, and
giving the United States rapid strike capability across the western
Pacific rim and into the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With the Soviet threat gone, however, the Pentagon is turning
over thousands of acres of facilities here for use as factory
sites, ports and distribution centers that Clinton said can help
turn Guam into a crossroads in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to help speed the return to local control some
10,500 acres of U.S. military facilities and to provide federal
assistance to help officials and developers here convert that
property for commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must work together to ensure that Guam reaps all the
benefits of the post Cold War world, beginning with the timely
return of lands no longer needed by our military,'' Clinton said.
''In the global economy, Guam can be an important gateway to Asian
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon owns 44,800 acres in Guam _ 23 percent of the
entire island _ and accounts for nearly a third of the territory's
$3 billion a year economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress approved the transfer of 3,213 acres back to
local control, but the handover has yet to occur. Clinton vowed to
work to speed that transfer and to work for the release of another
7,300 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Land use has been a bone of contention in U.S. relations with
Guam, where many residents feel as if their island is treated as an
American colony.
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. territory, Guam is bound by the laws passed in the
Congress _ nearly 9,000 miles away _ though its residents have no
say in writing those laws.
</P>
<P>
   Guamanians are U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote in U.S.
elections and are represented in Congress only by a non-voting
delegate to the House, Robert Underwood, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 11 years, Guam has been lobbying Washington to
attain commonwealth status, which would enable the Pacific island
community to conduct its own immigration policy, for instance, and
to decide whether it would adopt future U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
   With little progress on the commonwealth question, voters will
go to the polls on Dec. 12, 1999, for a referendum on three
possible future paths: independence, U.S. statehood or a loose
affiliation called free association.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in Guam's status would be contingent upon action by
the Congress, but the island-wide referendum could help to build a
consensus for change.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are rich opportunities within our grasp, if we are able
to move from our colonial past into a future partnership that sets
free the economic vitality locked up in land that must be
returned,'' said Guam's governor, Carl T.C. Gutierrez, in
introductory remarks before Clinton's speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a brighter future for our children and
grandchildren,'' Gutierrez said, ''if we maximize our commercial
and strategic potential as 'America in Asia,' a potential that can
only be realized if the political and economic constraints that
inhibit us are removed.''

FLY MCGREW HAS THE LAST (HORSE) LAUGH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>

<P>
   Things didn't turn out as planned with our horse, Fly McGrew.
But, as I've learned over the last year, things seldom turn out as
planned with racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   Fly is the 4-year-old gray gelding who earlier this year, some
readers may recall, was taking swimming lessons, readying himself
aerobically for his return to the racetrack. Our little group of
investors hoped that under the guidance of trainer Carlos Figueroa,
the legendary equine reclamation expert, Fly would make us rich, or
at least earn back part of the staggering sum we were investing in
his upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Fly refused to cooperate. He'd break out of the
gate like a shot, run the first three furlongs or so, then slow
down and lope in a leisurely fashion to the finish line, far behind
the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, my husband, had all sorts of theories about why Fly
wouldn't run. Fly was a smart horse, he said. He didn't like being
whipped. But even without the whip, Fly wouldn't run. Fly didn't
like his stall, Michael said. He kept kicking holes in the walls.
Carlos moved Fly to a different stall. Fly kicked holes in the new
stall. And still he wouldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing physically wrong with Fly, but he wasn't a
happy horse. He snapped at other horses and at people, too, except
for Carlos's wife, Pearl, who fed him gingersnaps. They had to put
an orange traffic cone in front of Fly's stall to warn everybody to
give him a wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   Michael refused to give up on Fly. The horse's breeding was
excellent. His sire and dam were winners. Michael was sure there
was something he could do to get the horse to run. He even managed
to persuade Monty Roberts, author of the best-selling book ``The
Man Who Listens to Horses,'' to make a stall-call during a visit to
Rockingham Park to publicize various equine-related charities.
Roberts looked and listened as Carlos led Fly out to an open field.
Carlos tried to make Fly run in a circle on a long rope. Fly tried
to bite Carlos. Then he tried to trample him. Roberts turned to
Michael and said, ``That's a very angry horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Michael wouldn't listen, not even to Monty Roberts. Nor
would he listen to Bruce Zagnit, the house handicapper at
Rockingham Park, who had taken to poking fun at Fly in the program
notes, once writing, ``The genes must have skipped a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael remained convinced he could find something to motivate
Fly. He was certain Fly could win in August at the Great Barrington
Race Course. But he was wrong. Watching Fly cruise past the finish
line several lengths behind the other entries, Michael said, ``It's
almost as if he doesn't want to hurt himself by running too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The investors met and everyone, even Michael, agreed that Fly
had to go. But where? Vicki Hengen, a Globe copy editor who trains
show horses, said she'd take a look at him. We weren't optimistic.
But she liked him. More important, he liked her. He stood calmly
while she saddled him. He was a perfect gentleman when she rode
him. Vicki bought him and moved him to a stable in Falmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Vicki entered Belgian Belle, the horse she'd
been training for over a year, in a show. Heather Adamson, 17, who
works at the stable, asked if she could enter Fly, just so he'd
have the experience. Belgian Belle finished fourth in the Road Hack
class. Fly finished first. He brought home a blue ribbon his first
time out. Two weeks after that, Vicki entered him in another show
and he won four more ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said he was a smart horse,'' Michael said, on hearing
the good news. We had no idea just how smart Fly was, a lot smarter
than his former owners, that's for sure. He kept trying to tell us
he didn't want to be a racehorse, but we wouldn't listen.

 &HT;    FAMILIES OF LONG-HELD HOSTAGES IN COLOMBIA SEE GLIMMERS OF HOPE
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Nov. 28 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Nancy Mankins, the biggest sadness is realizing her
husband has no way of knowing their two grown children have married
and that one just had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   This sadness continues week after week, year after year _ and
with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very, very bittersweet to have our first grandchild
and not be able to share it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mankins' husband, Dave, was one of three missionaries with the
Florida-based New Tribes Mission who were kidnapped from their
homes in a tiny Panamanian village on Jan. 31, 1993, by armed men,
presumably leftist guerrillas fighting the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
   If still alive, the missionaries, who also include Mark Rich and
Rick Tenenoff, would be the longest-held Americans who are still
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Their wives, who have seven children among them, have lived a
life in limbo, full of dashed hopes and one setback after another.
</P>
<P>
   But a flurry of activity in recent months has lifted the spirits
of the families to their highest levels in some time.
</P>
<P>
   In March, one of the wives, Tania Rich, testified before the
House International Relations Committee, which led to a
congressional resolution passed in September calling on the U.S.
State Department to raise the kidnapping with the Colombian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Oct. 27 in Washington, the wives met with new Colombian
President Andres Pastrana, himself a previous victim of a political
kidnapping, who promised to press the rebels during peace talks for
information about the men, even if it meant hearing of their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Also in late October, a rebel who defected to the Colombian
government revealed that he was told the three men are still alive,
though the report has not been substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to hear, although I do have to step back and
remember that this is really just a rumor,'' said Patti Tenenoff,
one of the wives. ``We've heard many rumors over the years, both
good and bad, that have created a lot of ups and downs for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, privately, many U.S. and Colombian officials have
expressed fears that the men are no longer alive. Their pessimism
has grown since 1995, when two other U.S. missionaries for New
Tribes Mission, Tim Van Dyke and Steve Walsh, were found killed
after being held a year and a half by Colombian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Tenenoff, Mankins and Rich have traveled to
both Colombia and Capitol Hill to ask for help in finding their
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   They've tried to keep memories of the men alive for their
children, who ranged in age at the time of the kidnappings from 9
months to 23 years, with old stories and photos.
</P>
<P>
   They've been interviewed in newspapers and on television;
ABC-TV's ``20/20'' plans to air a segment on the kidnappings in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mankins and Rich live in Sanford, Fla. Tenenoff lives in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about visiting different heads of state across
Latin America to ask for their assistance,'' Tenenoff said. ``We'll
keep doing everything we have to until I see my husband and he
comes home to me and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The three families were sent to live and work with the primitive
Kuna Indians in the tiny Panamanian village of Pucuro, about 15
miles north of the Colombian border, by New Tribes Mission in
Sanford.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1942, the Protestant group claims 3,200 missionaries
in 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Mankinses moved to Panama in 1986, followed by the Tenenoffs
two years later. Mark and Tania Rich arrived in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The families led peaceful, fulfilling lives, translating the
Bible into Kuna and proselytizing to more than 300 Indians.
</P>
<P>
   They had no clue of any future danger.
</P>
<P>
   But kidnappings are a normal part of life in much of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 885 people have been kidnapped for ransom in
Colombia, a practice that's become a $120 million-a-year industry.
Two-thirds of the kidnappings are by rebels, who seek out
foreigners, knowing they usually yield larger ransoms.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the missionaries were kidnapped, more than 150 men
dressed in jungle camouflage and waving submachine guns burst into
their town.
</P>
<P>
   The wives were ordered to pack their husbands' clothes _ enough
for three days _ before being assured they'd see the men again
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the men told us to have faith, and I heard my husband
tell him that 'we do have faith, and it is in the Lord Jesus
Christ,' which is the last thing I ever heard my husband say,''
Mankins said.
</P>
<P>
   Within nine days, New Tribes Mission received a demand via
shortwave radio for a $5 million ransom.
</P>
<P>
   But New Tribes Mission doesn't pay ransoms, and the kidnappers
abruptly ended contact in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, countless attempts to re-establish communication
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   In April, so-called ``celebrity hostages'' Terry Anderson and
Terry Waite, both kidnapped in Lebanon, traveled to Colombia where
they demanded that the kidnappers free the men or reveal what
happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   But attempts such as these have run up against a brick wall _ so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Pastrana's promise to push for information and the
indication from a former rebel that the men might still be alive,
New Tribes Mission has taken new actions to find them.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 6, New Tribes Mission used an airplane to drop more than
22,000 leaflets over Colombia near the Panamanian border bearing
the pictures of the men and a plea for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged that we may be close to a resolution,'' said
Scott Ross, a spokesman for New Tribes Mission. ``We found the
rebel's information to be quite credible.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next may depend on how well peace talks in Colombia
progress, because these give New Tribes Mission its only direct
conduit to the rebels through Pastrana and his negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Colombia's largest rebel group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, agreed to
negotiate an end to that country's long-lasting civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the group's sincerity has been in question since Nov. 1,
when rebels launched one of their fiercest attacks in 34 years,
killing 50 people as they overtook the southern village of Mitu.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's sure what FARC is going to do next, whether it will
fight or negotiate peace,'' said Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for
Amnesty International in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government officials say they will urge the Colombian
government to do all it can to assist American hostages, adding
that the last indication they've had that the three missionaries
are still alive came in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the three women can't help but hold out hope their
husbands will come home to them, even after nearly six years of not
knowing their fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the holidays come, I can't understand how everybody
can be so happy when my life feels so empty,'' said Tenenoff, whose
children now are 14, 9 and 7. ``Still, not a day goes by that I
don't wonder whether that day will be the one when Rick comes home
to us.''

STARR'S IMPEACHMENT CASE WITHERS UNDER QUESTIONING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in microcosm, it's the same story _ a case that can't
survive cursory inspection and depends on the tortured inferences
of a prosecutor the country neither likes nor trusts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case that can be argued, screamed about, and spun, but
never actually presented via witnesses because the omniscient
prosecutor has the arrogance to dispute important elements of his
own witnesses' contentions in order to protect his precious
inferences.
</P>
<P>
   As three quite different guys from Massachusetts showed during
what might be the only public hearing ever held on this matter, the
utter madness of this situation is apparent no matter how the thing
is sliced. And they showed it in ways that anticipated the
hilariously subversive resignation of Ken Starr's ethics adviser,
Sam Dash of Senate Watergate Committee fame, with a blast that his
boss has unlawfully usurped the House's impeachment power.
</P>
<P>
   William Delahunt gave insight into ridiculous process, tortured
precedents, and crucial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Barney Frank was one of the first to demonstrate that away from
his prepared text, Starr can't deal with specific questions about
conduct that colors and undercuts his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin Meehan, as he did from the instant he got a look at
Starr's impeachment referral in September, left Starr speechless by
showing the multitude of direct conflicts that leave the
prosecutor's inferences with only partisan credibility.
</P>
<P>
   These three are not natural, visceral, or even cerebral clones
of President Clinton. Frank is often to his left; Meehan and
Delahunt are notoriously independent New Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that they ended up offering different elements of
the overwhelming case against impeachment is a function not of them
so much as the wretched excesses of Starr and the nonleadership of
their Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry Hyde. Consider, in
sequence, what the Massachusetts 3 did.
</P>
<P>
   _Delahunt, right out of the box, was the guy who proposed
letting Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, question Starr for the
same two hours the prosecutor got to argue.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Norfolk County DA is also the Democrat Hyde likes
most on the committee, one of the least vocal of Starr's critics
and one of the first on the committee to try to reach across party
lines to attempt something better than a partisan charade.
</P>
<P>
   But here he was leading the charge, because Hyde had rigged his
big show, and was opposing the equal time request, even though his
kind heart actually granted Kendall more than a hour of questioning
that night.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the House, it mattered that Delahunt was slamming the
committee for sitting there and publishing preelection Starr Stuff
while abdicating its responsibility to carefully examine the
material dumped on it.
</P>
<P>
   _Barney Frank is not simply a quote machine. Behind the staccato
is an illuminating mega-bundle of synapses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the press leaks Starr used to try to undermine
the president for the jury pool in Congress and the country, Frank
bore in on the 24 instances currently under investigation by US
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson's special master as prima
facie violation of presumably sacred grand jury rules.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that Starr _ like the president on sex _ disputes the
court's definition of grand jury material and therefore of the
rules, Frank asked him a simple question: Which of his prosecutors
has violated the rules as the court defines them.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to answer, Starr called the question unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also bore in on the only legitimate news of the hearing,
that Starr has no referrals to make on any of the other matters he
has probed for more than four years _ not Whitewater, the FBI
files, or the White House Travel Office firings.
</P>
<P>
   He got Starr to admit he had reached this dead end on the FBI
files ``some months ago.'' When he fudged on the Travel Office
judgment, saying he couldn't give a date certain, he earned a
vintage Frank one-liner, ``I'll take a date ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's point, of course, was that Starr couldn't somehow
disclose his exculpatory information _ blowing all the ``pattern of
practice'' baloney out of the water _ until after this month's
elections, but managed to get his impeachment argument in just as
the campaign was heating up in September.
</P>
<P>
   _Marty Meehan made the connection between Starr's case, in which
the prosecutor's connection of the dots through inference is more
important than the dots themselves and Starr's multitude of
ideological and economic conflicts which impeach that subjective
judgment. He even quoted an earlier Sam Dash line that his boss's
conduct ``does have a certain odor to it.''
</P>
<P>
   _And then Delahunt, in his turn, made a critical precedent point
while correcting a colleague to note that his committee had refused
in 1974 to approve an impeachment article against Richard Nixon for
the ``private'' act of filing fraudulent tax returns. Judges, by
contrast, have been impeached for exactly this kind of perjury
because of their additional, constitutional burden of holding
un-elected, lifetime offices in ``good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Delahunt showed Starr fudging truth. Last
June, he flatly denied his agents had pushed Monica Lewinsky to
wear a wire and go after Clinton and others; Lewinsky and FBI
reports say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted, Starr said his agents told her ``at a high level of
generality'' what cooperating with them would mean, including
wearing a wire. Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Dash resigned 12 hours later, but the Massachusetts 3 had
already helped make much the same point he did _ the ``case'' is
too much about what Ken Starr thinks and not at all about direct,
cross-examined evidence in a constitutional setting designed by the
House.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE _ Yellow backhoes dig the foundation for another
``Alaskan dream'' house on a hill where streets get historic
Russian-sounding names even though they were cut through the woods
just months ago. Below this new neighborhood, Wal-Marts,
McDonald's, and other national chains crowd the avenues, bathing
rush hour traffic jams in colorful neon.
</P>
<P>
   The license plates say ``The Last Frontier,'' and, in the
American imagination, Alaska remains a wilderness where caribou
herds and grizzly bears still rule. In a state twice the size of
Texas, the 611,000 residents could disappear into the vastness _ if
they spread out enough.
</P>
<P>
   But Alaskans increasingly are caught between their frontier
image and a more urban reality that residents are only beginning to
grapple with. The state's population has ballooned by 50 percent in
20 years, nearly all of it in urban areas, creating such seemingly
un-Alaskan problems as suburban sprawl, air pollution, and hundreds
of car-moose collisions in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Anchorage, home to 42 percent of the state's residents, still
has its ``frontier'' moments, from the black bears that break into
homes to tough guy-bar Chilkoot Charlie's where ``we cheat the
other guy and pass the savings on to you.'' But, in many ways, it
could be any growing western city &UR; , &LR;  from the pricey homes under
construction to the 2,500 young people living on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely big city living. I could be in Boston. I live
in a downtown condo,'' said David Ramseur, press secretary for Gov.
Tony Knowles, in his office next to a downtown shopping mall. ``I
sometimes kick myself for living in Alaska and not taking advantage
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many residents of America's largest state don't want to
believe they live in an urban society; they project a self-image of
gold miners and frontiersmen even as they talk on cell phones and
shop at The Gap. To them, they're on the frontier, a colder,
snowier, tougher place than ``the Lower 48.''
</P>
<P>
   And they chafe at the rules and regulations of urban life,
preferring their government weak and planning minimal. Weak zoning
regulations in Anchorage, for example, have allowed unchecked
growth of sprawling commercial strips and large-lot homes over the
past decade, eating up most developable land in the central city.
Now, the city has burst its seams, as hundreds of houses go up on
the steep hills beyond the reach of public water and sewer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the conflict has to do with the way Alaska has grown,
until recently relying on waves of newcomers drawn by various booms
such as the discovery of oil on the North Slope. Many left the
strictures of ``the Lower 48'' behind, from the chef in remote Cold
Bay who fled gang life in Somerville, Mass., to Knowles' spokesman
Ramseur, who came from South Carolina for the adventure of working
on a Fairbanks newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska is still attractive to people who are trying to run
away from normal civilization,'' said Chuck Spaulding, a
Massachusetts native who came to Alaska on a lark 26 years ago and
today runs a river rafting company north of Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   However, as ``normal civilization'' has come to Alaska, the
state is ill-prepared to manage mundane urban issues such as mass
transportation, a growing school-age population, or other problems
that call for long-term planning and investments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Alaska is run something like the boom towns that have
shaped it _ with as little government interference as possible, and
a lot of Alaskans will tell you they like it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no government here. There's no mayor. There's nobody
to tell me I have to have my house a certain way,'' said Rachel
Babitt, 21, a waitress in tiny Glenallen, 177 miles north of
Anchorage. ``If government came here, we'd probably move north.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaskans don't even pay state income taxes, instead receiving an
annual ``dividend check'' _ $1,540 for every permanent resident
this year _ from the state's enormous oil wealth. Civic leaders
have tried for years to put a limit on the dividends so that some
money can go toward other programs, but no major politician dares
champion the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the dividend largesse may have been fine during the
1980s oil boom, but the government has absorbed $238 million in
budget cuts since 1995 because of a falloff in oil revenues. In
fact, Alaskans received a record dividend check in 1997 even as the
magazine &UR;  &LR; Education Week gave the state an ``F'' for the condition
of its schools, almost half of which had major maintenance
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an echo of the age of abundance. When things were
abundant, you didn't have to make discriminating choices,'' said
Lee Gorsuch, chancellor of the University of Alaska at Anchorage,
whose state funding is stuck at mid-1980s levels. ``It's easier to
complain about the government and keep collecting your dividend and
not pay taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Below the political radar screen, Alaska is showing signs of
change. Activists put up a display at the state fair in Palmer
objecting to the willy-nilly development of scarce farmland, while
Gorsuch and other leaders have pushed to increase funding for
education, transportation, and other needs. In Anchorage,
meanwhile, 2,000 residents are helping the city draft a
comprehensive plan for future growth.

SMOG-REDUCING `REFORMULATED GAS' FOUND TO POLLUTE WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new ingredient in gasoline that was supposed to make the air
cleaner is rapidly polluting water from Maine to California,
forcing the closure of wells and prompting at least three lawsuits
over contamination from ``reformulated gas.''
</P>
<P>
   The ingredient, called MTBE, has been added in large quantities
to gas sold in most of New England since 1995 to reduce smog, and
in smaller amounts for a few years before that. Already, the US
Geological Survey has found MTBE in 20 percent of its monitoring
wells where reformulated gas is sold.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where the new gas is sold statewide, MTBE has
been detected in 23 public water supplies, including unsafe levels
in three wells. In addition, an undetermined number of private
wells may be contaminated, including two in New Marlborough that
were shut down this month due to high MTBE levels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the US Environmental Protection Agency and state officials
who once trumpeted reformulated gas face a growing revolt led by
the governors of Maine and California, who have asked that their
states no longer be required to use MTBE. They say the tainted
water far outweighs the air pollution benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is outrageous. (EPA officials) were so focused on the
fact it may be cleaning up the air that they didn't look at the
impact it could have on the whole ecosystem,'' said Dr. John
Meinhold of the Sierra Club in New Hampshire, who is pushing his
state to drop the additive. ``This is a major threat to water.''
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is a slightly
turpentine-scented chemical that largely replaced an even more
toxic chemical, benzene, in reformulated gas. Still, the EPA
considers MTBE a possible human carcinogen, and, once swallowed,
MTBE metabolizes into toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   However, the hazard of MTBE is so new that neither EPA nor many
states, including Massachusetts, even have a binding limit on MTBE
in drinking water. In fact, regulators strongly disagree over what
the limit should be.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE defenders say the fuel additive, while admittedly toxic,
has been unfairly targeted for criticism when the real problem is
preventing gasoline spills in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is being found in drinking water, which is a problem, but
that is indicative that gasoline is somehow leaking into drinking
water supplies,'' said David Conroy, manager of air quality
planning at the EPA's Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   But, once spilled, MTBE travels through soil and other barriers
more swiftly than other chemicals in gas, allowing it to travel
farther. A Maine study found MTBE in 15 percent of private wells
and public water supplies, a far higher percentage than other
chemicals in gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study revealed you can literally dump over your lawnmower
and spill a half a gallon and (MTBE) can end up in your well and
even your neighbor's well,'' Maine Governor Angus King told the
Portland Press Herald recently.
</P>
<P>
   In response to such criticisms, the chairwoman of the New
England Governors Conference, New Hampshire Governor Jeanne
Shaheen, has asked a regional consulting group to study
alternatives, such as a more expensive corn-based additive called
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that it would be environmentally
preferable to maintain the benefits of reformulated gas without the
risks of MTBE,'' said Jason Grumet, executive director of the
Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, which will do
the study.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over MTBE is a case study in the law of
unintended effects. Congress was so sure about the benefits of
reformulated gasoline that members required it for some areas,
including Connecticut, in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
States such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and
Maine quickly asked for the fuel because they saw an inexpensive
way to reduce smog-causing emissions in car exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Over activist objections, most states chose to add MTBE, an
oil-derived chemical, to the reformulated gas to ensure that the
gas burned thoroughly and released less carbon monoxide. MTBE had
been present in New England gas at lower levels since the 1980s,
but the new gas would be 11 to 14 percent MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   True to the predictions, reformulated gasoline reduced air
pollution. Air concentrations of benzene, one of the most
cancer-causing chemicals in gas, dropped by 40 percent in areas
where reformulated gas was sold, Grumet said, while overall
smog-causing vehicle emissions fell by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But, very quickly, MTBE began showing up in water. To the
surprise of US Geological Survey researchers, they found more MTBE
in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts groundwater from 1993 to
1995 than other chemicals in gasoline, dry cleaning fluids, and
other common pollutants called ``volatile organics.''
</P>
<P>
   Other regions with reformulated gas had similar results, said
John Zogorski, US Geological Survey chief of a national study of
groundwater contamination involving 2,500 wells. MTBE levels were
mostly low in the roughly 125 wells where it was detected, he said,
but 10 had levels above the EPA threshold of concern.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the most severe MTBE pollution may be in South
Tahoe, Calif., where 35 percent of the wells are closed due to
contamination up to 15,000 times above safe limits. The local
utility district last week sued the companies that make MTBE,
hoping to recover cleanup bills that have reached $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, DEP officials found last July that MTBE had
been detected 73 times from 1990 to 1998 in 23 public water
systems, including three where the MTBE exceeded Massachusetts'
proposed drinking water limit. The MTBE-tainted wells in Berlin,
Tyngsborough, and Sturbridge were shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other pollutants, known MTBE contamination isn't
widespread in Massachusetts, according to Dave Terry, director of
DEP's drinking-water program. However, the state doesn't know the
extent of MTBE contamination among private wells used by about
400,000 Massachusetts residents _ and the hazard may be
substantial. Maxine LaBrecque of New Marlborough lost use of her
family's well this month when a minor gas spill on a neighboring
property contaminated it with MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some regulators are looking for a way out of the MTBE
controversy. Maine has EPA permission to drop reformulated gas
altogether in favor of other pollution reductions, while
California's Legislature received a report last week urging the
phaseout of MTBE, and the Connecticut Academy of Science and
Engineering soon will report on MTBE alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials aren't changing the gas recipe yet, but
they are watching closely. And they are quite aware that MTBE
carries a cost they hadn't anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The water contamination ``is not something we would have chosen
to do, but ... the choice we made was the good one at the time,''
said Nancy Seidman, deputy DEP director for planning and
evaluation.

CLINTON'S EXEMPTION FROM THE LAWS ON PERJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, in conferences rooms and offices all across America,
men and women are deposed in civil cases and criminal
investigations. And every day, each and every one of those men and
women raise their right hands and swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And every
day, all these people are informed that if they do not tell the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, they will have
committed a felony crime, punishable by up to five years in prison.
That's the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   What was most remarkable about the opening day of the
impeachment hearings was that no one contested the central facts of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's prepared testimony, nor did
anyone tangle with his interpretation of the law. It was more or
less agreed by all concerned that President Clinton had indeed
``made a series of premeditated false statements under oath in his
civil deposition on Jan. 17, 1998'' in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case. It was agreed that the preponderance of ``evidence
suggests that, apart from making false statements under oath, the
president engaged in a pattern of behavior during the Jones
litigation to thwart the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   There was complete agreement that the ``the president
participated in a scheme at his deposition in which his attorney,
in his presence, deceived a United States district judge in an
effort to cut off questioning about Ms. Lewinsky.'' And there was
no doubt that the president ``made false statements under oath to
the grand jury on Aug. 17, 1998.'' Democrats and Republicans alike
did not contest that ``on at least six different occasions _ from
Dec. 17, 1997, through Aug. 17, 1998 _ the president had to make a
decision. He could choose truth, or he could choose deception. On
all six occasions, the president chose deception ...''
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared statement, Starr noted that on Jan. 21, 1998,
President Clinton had an opportunity to set the record straight. In
an almost perfect metaphor for Clinton's presidency, the
independent counsel described what happened next. ``According to
Dick Morris, the president and he talked on Jan. 21. Mr. Morris
sugggested that the president publicly confess. The president
replied, `But what about the legal thing? You know, the legal
thing? You know. Starr and perjury and all.' Mr. Morris suggested
they take a poll. The president agreed. Morris called with the
results. He stated that the American people were willing to forgive
adultery but not perjury or obstruction of justice. The president
replied, `Well, we just have to win, then.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having neither the law nor the facts on his side, Clinton chose
instead to argue prosecutorial process and to amplify an already
unprecedented attack on the character of the independent counsel.
Incredibly enough, this two-pronged strategy has worked. It is now
likely that the House of Representatives will not approve articles
of impeachment for the Senate's consideration. Assuming that no
articles of impeachment are approved, the matter will then be left
to the discretion of the Office of the Independent Counsel, which
would be unlikely to seek indictments until after President Clinton
has finished his term.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such an outcome are as disturbing as they
are profound. There is no doubt that the president is guilty of
perjury. Even his closest political allies concede this point. New
York Senator-elect and House Judiciary Committee member Charles
Schumer has said that ``it is clear that the president lied when he
testified before the grand jury.'' There is no doubt that the
president obstructed justice. And there is no doubt that the
president failed to uphold the Constitution he was sworn to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee argue that Clinton's
conduct does not meet the impeachment test of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' because it arose out of circumstances relating to
his private, not public, life. This argument is specious, but it is
a necessary prelude to the second Democratic argument, which is
that Starr's investigation was itself a miscarriage of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Ranking Minority member John Conyers of Michigan
called Starr a ``federally paid sex policeman'' and ``rogue
attorney'' ensnared by so many ethical conflicts that his
investigation was fatally compromised. But even if one was to agree
with Conyers's hysterical assessment, the matter of Clinton's
conduct remains the paramount concern.
</P>
<P>
   That conduct has been nothing less than illegal. Sanctioning
such conduct would mean that the laws which all the rest of us must
obey do not apply to Bill Clinton. That's a very dangerous
precedent to establish. That's exactly the precedent that Democrats
like John Conyers, William Delahunt, and Martin Meehan propose be
established. It is to Ken Starr's and Henry Hyde's everlasting
credit that they have resisted such an outcome and continue to do
so.

A DIVIDED AMERICA REFLECTED IN A JUDICIARY PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it was Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's long,
meticulous and rather bland presentation before the House Judiciary
Committee that drew some television watchers' attention to the
makeup of the committee itself.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Starr's presentation, and the questions asked of him
by committee Democrats and the president's counsel, produced no
new, explosive disclosures. But what was new was the public's
opportunity to scrutinize Starr's manner, his style, as well as
that of the entire Judiciary Committee. And what viewers saw may be
more relevant than what was said at the hearing. The difference in
appearance between the committee's GOP members and its Democratic
members provides a clue as to why Republicans are out of touch with
the electorate _ a shortcoming that cost ex-House Speaker Newt
Gingrich his job and resulted in five more Democrats elected this
year to the House.
</P>
<P>
   To those voters watching at home, it was clear that the
Democratic members of the committee are more representative of the
nation's racial, gender, and religous makeup than the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   As one viewer commented, the vast majority of the GOP members of
the Judiciary Committee are white, Protestant males. Specifically,
the GOP membership on the committee consists of 20 white,
middle-aged men and one white woman, Mary Bono, wife of the late
Congressman Sonny Bono. In short, the GOP's all white, almost-all
male membership on the committee certainly does not reflect what
America is about.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the committee's Democratic membership is as
diverse as America itself. The 16 Democrats include one white
female, two African-American females, three African-American males,
and 10 white males, including six Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic membership on the committee gave most televsion
viewers someone they could relate to, at least in a general way.
The GOP membership offered very little of this variety. The two
prominent Democratic members of the committee from Massachusetts,
Rep. Barney Frank and Rep. William Delahunt also reflected the
sentiments of much of the nation when they challenged the
GOP-created hearing format that gave Starr two hours to speak, but
unfairly allowed the President's counsel, David E. Kendall, only a
half-hour to ask Starr questions.
</P>
<P>
   After the Democratic members blistered Rep. Henry Hyde, a
Republican from Illinois and the panel's chairman, for allowing
Kendall so little time, Kendall was eventually allowed an hour. But
that small concession did little to close the wide gulf between the
committee's Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The wide cultural, racial and gender gaps between the Democratic
and GOP members on the committee have not gone unnoticed. No doubt
the ascent of a Republican African-American, JC Watts, to the
leadership team was at least partly due to the recognition among
Republicans that people of color were glaringly absent at the
party's top levels. As one television news commentator suggested,
given the dearth of African-Americans in Congress, the GOP probably
wished it could clone Watts and have him serve on the Judiciary
Committee, too.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, among Democrats' five Arican-Americans on the
committee is ranking member John Conyers of Detroit, a former
committee chairman. They can point to how another of the five, Rep.
Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, kept Starr's feet to the fire during
the hearings. Her eloquence reminded some viewers of another black
woman in a similar context _ Rep. Barbara Jordan, who rose to new
heights with her eloquence during the Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP members of the committee have their supporters, as does
Starr himself, among the nation's populace. The nation's split
views on the Starr probe are reflected in various national polls.
It's not hard to recall how easily our nation can polarize _ the
vast majority of whites on one side and the vast majority of the
nation's black on the other _ if one thinks back to the
predominantly black jury's acquittal of OJ Simpson on murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious differences in appearance between the Democrats and
the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee demonstrate that a wide
cultural gap still exists in this country. But the times are still
changing. The more moderate leaders of the GOP know that the party
hierachy may be too white, too male, and too conservative for most
of the nation's electorate.
</P>
<P>
   They know they cannot survive by continuing to reflect the faces
and views of a certain segment of the electorate. They know they
have to reach out, as did two GOP governors this year: George Bush
of Texas and Jeb Bush of Florida, both of whom won strong support
from Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if there is anything to be learned from the Judiciary
Committee's hearing last week, it may be that America saw itself
mirrored in this committee _ divided not merely by ideology, but by
race, gender, religion and class.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope that America will someday be, as pledged, one
nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

SOME FIND STADIUM PERKS TOO GENEROUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Details of Connecticut Governor John Rowland's extraordinarily
generous offer to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft to move
the team to Hartford are raising eyebrows among government
officials on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like getting the team more than I like the details,''
Connecticut House Majority Leader David Pudlin, a New Britain
Democrat, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, like most people, we are going to have to spend money
if we want the Kraft family to move their football team from
Foxborough to Hartford. There are issues, however, that we are
going to have to work out'' _ especially involving proposed
spending on non-stadium aspects of the $350-million-plus deal,
Pudlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William R. Dyson, a New Haven Democrat who chairs
the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, expressed particular
concern about Rowland's promise to have the state guarantee Kraft
as much as $175 million or more over 10 years for unsold luxury
boxes and premium seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm not too keen on that idea,'' Dyson said. ``I
don't see why we should be guaranteeing anything to him or anyone
else. We just have other priorities that are probably more
important than the coming to town of a football team.''
</P>
<P>
   As first reported in the Globe on Saturday, Connecticut's offer
to Kraft contains some unusually lavish perks, even by the
standards of recent deals to lure National Football League
franchises to Baltimore, Nashville, and St. Louis and to fund
stadium improvements elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Legislature plans a special session before
Christmas to act on the deal. Besides the promise to pay Kraft up
to $17.5 million a year for 10 years for unsold luxury seats, a
figure that would rise according to NFL-wide averages for such
seats, Rowland also proposed in a memorandum of understanding he
signed with Kraft on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   _$200 million or more of state money over 30 years for
renovations to the stadium, which Kraft would occupy rent-free.
</P>
<P>
   _A state-funded $15 million training facility.
</P>
<P>
   _Tens of millions of dollars for stadium site preparation, new
parking, and highway access.
</P>
<P>
   _Covering all the liability and property insurance for the
stadium, even though Kraft would reap all the profits from games,
concerts, and events he sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Representative Joseph C. Sullivan, a Braintree
Democrat who served on a 1995 commission that investigated a
proposed ``megaplex'' football stadium and convention center, said:
``This package that Connecticut has put together is far and away
the most lucrative that I have ever seen. The revenue streams
guaranteed are just beyond anybody's expectations when you delve
into these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut state Senator William Nickerson of Greenwich,
ranking GOP member on the Finance Committee, which handles bond
deals, said Rowland's plan is ``reasonable, and it does look like a
good deal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson said he doubts the state will be on the hook for much
if any of the proposed payments to Kraft because ``the reaction
I've had from people I've seen since the deal was announced is,
`Bill, where do I get tickets?'''

A WAR OF WORDS IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle over civil rights has spread from the political arena
to the new frontiers of cyberspace. As it rages, it is spinning off
perplexing and intriguing questions about freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, groups that advocate intolerance _ hate
groups, as they are known _ have used the Internet to spread their
message. For the most part, their cyber-efforts have received less
attention than, say, pornography sites _ although that changed
briefly with the recent murder of a New York state doctor who had
been targeted on line by abortion foes.
</P>
<P>
   But as hate groups' cyber-campaigns have heated up, so have the
efforts to counter them, resulting in a full-scale _ and
increasingly sophisticated _ war of words on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for instance, the Anti-Defamation League
introduced HateFilter, a noncommercial software package that blocks
specific hate sites and redirects browsers to the ADL's education
site.
</P>
<P>
   Filtering tools have been controversial since they first came on
the market a few years ago; one of the first packages was so
primitive it unintentionally blocked the site for the National
Organization for Women, alarming First Amendment activists. But ADL
officials contend they are not advocating outright censorship of
certain sites but simply providing parents with a choice on how
their children receive information.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, civil rights groups are getting increasingly
savvy in cyberspace. A typical search for the Ku Klux Klan will
direct users to a site where it's possible to purchase a Klan robe,
complete with blood-drop shoulder patch, for a mere $85, but the
search results will also lead browsers to Klanwatch, a civil rights
site operated by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is clear: The same technology that provides a
forum for extremists enables civil rights groups and individuals to
mobilize a response in unprecedented ways.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hate on the Net is only a mouse click away. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _A Web site called Aryan Female Homestead lambastes
intermarriage and preaches racial purity.
</P>
<P>
   _The Web page for the World Church of the Creator declares a
``racial holy war'' against its ``mortal racial enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   _Another site known for its vicious attacks against gays and
lesbians features a letter condemning the parents of Matthew
Shepard, the young gay man who was tortured and murdered in Wyoming
last month.
</P>
<P>
   _And an infamous Web page called the Nuremberg Files declares
that ``legalized abortion is war'' and lists the names, addresses,
and telephone numbers of doctors who provide abortion services.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up in opposition are such people as David Goldman, a
35-year-old law librarian who runs a site called HateWatch.org out
of a modest office in Cambridge, Mass. With a small budget and a
tiny staff augmented by volunteers all over the world, Goldman
offers the most extensive on-line resource available to monitor
hate on the Internet. It ferrets out &UR;  &LR; sites that advocate violence
or ``unreasonable hostility'' toward groups or individuals based on
race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or
disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give a fool enough rope, he'll hang himself,'' said
Goldman, who started the site a few years ago when he was a
reference assistant at the Harvard University Law Library. ``I have
no fear that a rational, thinking person is going to be swept up by
these hate sites. I always say, `Don't believe me. Don't believe
HateWatch. Don't believe the ADL. Go in, take a look at the
information and judge for yourself.' I don't fear bigots. I fear
apathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sites similar to HateWatch are emerging all the time:
Anti-Semitic sites are countered by the Nizkor Project, an
exhaustive on-line resource center that challenges Holocaust
denial. And while users can easily download white power computer
games for free, they can also play an on-line interactive game
about hate on the Internet sponsored by the Canadian Human Rights
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While some groups are lobbying Congress to pass blanket
legislation that would censor the Internet (primarily to block out
pornography), other groups are urging Internet service providers to
subscribe to a voluntary code of conduct that prohibits hate sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some providers, including America Online and Bell Atlantic,
include such provisions in their service agreements. But Rick
Eaton, senior researcher at the Simon Weisenthal Center in Los
Angeles, said that when his organization sent out a voluntary code
of ethics to hundreds of service providers two years ago, he
received only a handful of responses.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, after all, is in its infancy, both in terms of
ethics codes and criminal justice. There is almost no legal
precedent that specifically addresses free speech on the Internet,
and existing First Amendment statutes concerning other media have
yet to be tested in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   There are two principles that distinguish protected speech from
speech that incites violence, according to Nadine Strossen,
president of the American Civil Liberties Union. First, the speech
must be proved to be a ``true threat'' that goes beyond political
rhetoric and hyperbole. Second, it must be deemed to constitute an
intentional incitement to imminent violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Nuremberg Files, legal experts and FBI
officials alike contend that it is impossible to prove that its
founder, Neal Horsley, actually incited the killer of Dr. Barnett
Slepian, who performed abortions, to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley, a self-taught computer consultant and a graduate of the
Westminister Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania who runs the site
out of Carrollton, Ga., is unrepentant. ``Until the babies stop
getting killed, more and more people are going to get shot or
bombed,'' Horsley warned in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The recent publicity resulting from Slepian's murder in his home
near Buffalo, N.Y., has only increased the Nuremberg Files site's
notoriety: In October, it received more than 400,000 hits, double
its usual count.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley said he has been visited by officials from the FBI and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Bill Carter, an FBI
spokesman in Washington, would not comment on whether Horsley had
been investigated. But he said, ``No matter how abhorrent a
particular person's beliefs might be, we still live in a free
country, and free speech is a constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Justice Department has only prosecuted two cases
concerning threatening speech on line. A few years ago, a Federal
District Court judge in Michigan dismissed charges against a
student indicted for threatening other students by violent,
pornographic fantasies via e-mail. In February, a former college
student in California was convicted of a felony for e-mailing
racist death threats to 59 Asian students and staffers at the
University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pennsylvania attorney general Michael Fisher sued a
Web site operator named Ryan Wilson, along with his service
providers, for allegedly threatening two civil rights activists who
are members of the Reading-Berks Human Relations Council and the
Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. The site, which was called
ALPHA HQ and has since been shut down, included a photograph of one
of the employees and a message saying, ``Traitors like this ...
will be hung from the nearest tree or lamp post.'' The site also
featured an image of an office building blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   That suit is being watched closely in on-line circles,
particularly since it also names the primary service provider and
the secondary service provider, a man named Don Black who operates
a white supremacist site called Stormfront out of West Palm Beach,
Fla. ``It's a precedent-setting case for sites such as mine, but
also for all ISPs (Internet service providers),'' Black said of the
Pennsylvania case. ``It makes them liable for content of sites that
they don't even host.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet service providers would blanch at that connection,
for it was Black who posted the first white supremacist site back
in March 1995. At the time, the World Wide Web was just emerging,
and Black, an ex-Grand Dragon of the Alabama KKK who learned
computer science while he was incarcerated for conspiring to
overthrow the government of a Caribbean island, inaugurated the use
of the Internet as a tool for extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are able to reach millions of people that we never had
access to in the past,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``The
Internet is becoming an alternative news media for those who have
an alternative point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Black defines what he calls white nationalism as ``the idea that
whites may need to create a separate nation as a means of defending
themselves.'' In addition to providing links to the Aryan Nation,
KKK groups, and Holocaust denial sites, Stormfront includes a
library, an on-line chat room, and a white-singles dating service.
His site has inspired many others like it, including a site
operated by David Duke, the former KKK leader and occasional
political candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have ruled the information media have been
people with fantastic amounts of power and money, and finally, the
Internet makes it possible for different points of view to be
heard,'' said Duke, whose slick, multimedia site features the
manifesto ``The Coming White Revolution _ Born on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many lament that such views are available on the Net,
activists like Goldman contend that bringing hate into the on-line
mainstream may actually defuse its potential power. ``They can spew
all the filth they want, but as long as they're spewing it, someone
like HateWatch is going to be out there watching what they do and
educating the public about what they can do about it,'' Goldman
said. ``We'll be there, shining the light on the cockroaches.''

WHY DO HUMANS HAVE DIFFERENT BLOOD TYPES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why have humans developed different blood types?
</P>
<P>
   S.L., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We don't know, says Dr. George Garratty, scientific adviser
to the American Red Cross and a leading authority on blood types.
He says we're just starting to realize that the antigen molecules
that distinguish one blood type from another have a lot of other
important jobs elsewhere in our bodies.
</P>
<P>
   An antigen is a molecule that will set off the forces of the
immune system to get rid of things that may be bad for us.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. All our cells have numerous molecules on
the surface that, like little billboards, announce, `This cell is
part of us. It's supposed to be here. Do not attack!'
</P>
<P>
   Immune system cells traveling around in our blood are trained to
recognize self molecules and pass right by. But if our immune
system inspects a foreign cell in our blood and doesn't recognize a
molecule on the surface, it treats that molecule as an antigen and
attacks. That attack often involves creating a molecule called an
antibody designed specifically to fit the unique shape of the
foreign antigen. The antibody attaches to the antigen and, like a
chemical loudspeaker, summons other components of the immune system
to come destroy the invader.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901 Karl Landsteiner of Austria noticed that some red blood
cells had one kind of molecule on their outer surface, which he
labeled simply A, and some had a different one that he labeled B.
</P>
<P>
   Some didn't have either, and he called those O (as in zero, not
the letter ``o''.) Those molecules turned out to be antigens. The
discovery made transfusions possible and earned Landsteiner a Nobel
prize. Since then, we've discovered nearly 300 different antigens
on red blood cells, with names like Duffy, Lutheran, Dombrock,
Kidd, Diego, P, Yt, and Kx. &UR; if,,1 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They're mostly named for the people whose blood carried unique
antibodies. Like Mr. Duffy, the English patient who got sick after
a transfusion. He received the right ABO type. But there was
another antigen on the transfused blood that his immune system
didn't like. It made a special antibody cell nobody had ever seen
before to fit onto and attack that antigen. That antigen was named
Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   Rh is another well-known red blood cell antigen. Rhesus monkeys
experimentally transfused with human blood made the antibody this
time, thus the Rh.
</P>
<P>
   If you have this antigen (there are actually 40 antigens in the
Rh family) you're Rh positive. If you don't, you're Rh negative. Rh
and ABO antigens are the most important ones determining whether a
transfusion will work.
</P>
<P>
   But nature didn't put antigens on our red blood cells to make
sure transfusions would work. Transfusions are not a natural
occurrence. So what's going on?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that these molecules are involved in many other
biological processes. &UR; if,,0 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Remember Duffy? Well, many Africans and African-Americans don't
have a Duffy antigen. As a result, they can survive a form of
malaria that infects the cell only if it can attach to Duffy. No
Duffy antigen, no P. vivax malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the P antigen? One species of E. coli bacteria needs
that molecule to attach to tissue cells in the urinary tracts of
children. Some children have that molecule. Some don't. Those
without it don't get that kind of urinary infection.
</P>
<P>
   The molecule that the bacterium H. pylori attaches to in the
stomach lining to cause ulcers is an antigen when it's on red blood
cells.
</P>
<P>
   On some non-blood cells, antigens appear, or disappear, or
change, as tumors go from benign to cancerous. Some antigen
molecules appear to play a role in helping cancer spread through
the body. Some help blood cell membranes maintain their shape. Some
help cells process proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical associations, which don t automatically prove cause
and effect, show that A's have more cancers than O's and that O's
bleed more than A's. B's defecate the most. O's have the best
teeth, but suffer more than other blood types from plague
infections. A's have the worst hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   There are wide racial, ethnic, and geographic differences in
blood types around the world. There are twice as many O's among
native Australians as among Japanese. Eskimos in Greenland are 25
times more likely to be B's than Navajos in North America. Citizens
of India are four times more likely to be B's than residents of
England.
</P>
<P>
   All the findings suggest that molecules that distinguish blood
types probably developed differently in different people as part of
the random processes of mutation and evolution. As nature tests
which ones are best, some will offer advantages, some
disadvantages, in ways that immunohematologists like Garratty are
only beginning to understand.

AG STAYS REAL ON TOBACCO SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began five years ago with a longshot crusade against a
cigarette-smoking cartoon character. It ends with the largest civil
court settlement in United States history.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad legacy for an attorney general who mounted the first
assault on Joe Camel in 1993 and who just accepted a $206 billion
agreement with the tobacco industry that will settle the claims of
46 states seeking to recover the cost of treating smoking-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The antismoking purists will grouse that Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger sold out by abandoning the state's lawsuit against
cigarette manufacturers that was scheduled for trial in February.
But they will remember him in March when the tobacco industry makes
the first $98 million deposit on the $7.6 billion due Massachusetts
under terms of the national pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the easiest thing would have been to play the
hero, to make a big rhetorical show and promise to fight on, to
never compromise,'' Harshbarger says of his last-minute decision to
sign on to the national accord. ``I had to look at reality. Could I
guarantee that Massachusetts would do better in court? Could I risk
everything, as some advocates wanted, or should I accept a
substantial settlement that gets us going in the right direction?
If you do this job right, you can't make everyone happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of being pilloried for his pragmatism is not lost on
Harshbarger. He narrowly lost a campaign for governor earlier this
month in which his candidacy was characterized as ``too risky'' by
Republican Governor Paul Cellucci and his politics as too ``looney
left'' by Democratic House Speaker Thomas Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Harshbarger has always been a realist. His antitobacco
stance was less a case of ideological zealotry than political
prescience. He was ahead of the pack in recognizing both the policy
implications of the health hazards posed by cigarettes and the
taxpayers' willingness to take on the tobacco interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, if we had said we'll get the tobacco industry
to turn over $7.6 billion to Massachusetts, people would have said
`you're crazy,''' he says. ``Is this more than we expected then?
Yes. Is it everything we want today? No. We were closer before
Congress let greed get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, the state attorneys general crafted a
broader agreement with cigarette makers that would have paid the
states $368.5 billion. The pact, which required congressional
ratification, was doomed by additions that raised the total to $516
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what is still to be accomplished in tobacco control can
only be achieved at the federal level. Only Washington can take the
next logical step and declare nicotine a drug to be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   The states are still not off the hook, however. There is the
matter of how this settlement money is to be spent. In
Massachusetts, that is an especially critical question.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Cellucci last week urged Harshbarger to accept the
tobacco settlement to ``assist and expand our public health
programs'' but the agreement makes no restrictions on how these
funds can be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's record on tobacco control should give every public
health advocate pause. As lieutenant governor, he opposed a
cigarette tax designed to extend health care coverage to 160,000
uninsured children. (The bill passed over then-governor William
Weld's veto.) He and Weld repeatedly tried to raid the state's
tobacco control fund for purposes other than public health
education and smoking prevention. He even sat out the debate on
making the State House nonsmoking.
</P>
<P>
   Money that is not designated for particular use is always a
temptation on Beacon Hill. The tobacco settlement funds could be
used to reduce the state debt, to finance a tax refund, even to
help finance a professional football stadium. The burden is on the
public health community to remind Governor Cellucci the source and
intended purpose of this windfall.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Harshbarger is drafting legislation to earmark the
settlement funds to expand health care to the underinsured and to
mount more smoking prevention efforts. Under his plan, a 15-member
commission of public health experts and state officials would make
recommendations about how best to spend the annual payments of
about $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   A lame duck attorney general does not have much political
leverage on Beacon Hill. But, given the role Scott Harshbarger
played in winning this tobacco settlement, the Massachusetts
Legislature should cement his legacy _ and its own _ by acting to
guarantee that those funds are committed to the antismoking cause.

GROUPS PLOT THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Capitol Hill, business groups gather each Friday
to plot the next move in their campaign to overhaul Social
Security. From his office across town, lobbyist Gerald Cassidy
advises clients on how a Social Security debate might play out.
Pollster John Zogby says groups on all sides of the issue want his
help testing how voters view different proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after President Clinton called for a discussion on
how to fix the financially troubled Social Security program, the
debate is stalled. There is no business consensus, no Republican
consensus, and no White House plan.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, there is a great deal of scurrying
these days by the ad firms, the lobbyists, and the pollsters:
Washington's permanent political infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people who, for a fee, will create an instant
lobbying campaign to push for a cause. Through polling and focus
groups, they will shape a client's ideas into a public relations
effort. And for them, a fight over remaking the nation's popular
retirement program could mean millions of dollars in billings _ if
the battle ever occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't an ad firm, Republican or Democrat, in this city
that hasn't been looking at this,'' said Marty Regalia, chief
economist at the US Chamber of Commerce. ``Everyone wants to know:
Is this the next big campaign issue, with every interest group
spending thousands of dollars on every side of it, or is this
nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised the prospect of big changes to the program early
this year. In his State of the Union address, the president called
for a yearlong public discussion on the future of Social Security,
which will watch its $655 billion reserve fund disappear in about
2032 as baby boomers settle into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say the program's finances would improve if workers
could pay a portion of the 12.4 percent Social Security tax into
their own, private stock accounts, rather than to the government.
Others say the government should try to get higher returns on its
Social Security reserves by investing in stocks rather than in the
Treasury securities it now buys. A third set of proposals includes
no stock investing but relies on a higher retirement age, higher
taxes, or benefit cuts to put the program on solid financial
footing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked the nation to debate these ideas through 1998, and
the White House sponsored three regional forums to encourage
discussion. Clinton or Vice President Al Gore attended each one. A
White House conference is scheduled for Dec. 8-9.
</P>
<P>
   All that talk was to culminate in January, when Clinton promised
to ``convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan
legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation _ a Social
Security system that is strong in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But both political parties face risks as they develop plans to
change the program. Clinton is considering private accounts, but
faces opposition from organized labor, which helped the Democrats
make gains in the last election. By endorsing private accounts,
Clinton might anger groups loyal to him and to Gore, soon to be a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, tend to favor private accounts, but
pushing too hard might anger older people, who voted
disproportionately for the GOP but are less enthusiastic about
private accounts than younger voters. Republicans also fear that by
promoting private accounts, they will be vulnerable to political
attacks from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we announced a plan on Tuesday,'' said Representative Scott
Klug, a Republican of Wisconsin, ``then by Thursday the president
would be standing in the Rose Garden with 42 Democratic senators
saying, `The Republicans want to take our Social Security and bet
it on the roller coaster stock market.' So we are pointing fingers
at the White House and saying, `You put down a plan first.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the Republicans' weekly radio address Sunday, House Ways and
Means Committee chairman Bill Archer of Texas urged Clinton to
offer a proposal. ``Without a specific plan from the president,
this very difficult job will become much, much harder,'' Archer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The business community also has not rallied behind any plan.
Many businesses support the idea of private stock accounts, but
some don't want to push too hard for fear of angering their unions.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that most of the players in Washington are eyeing
each other warily, unsure whether to propose a plan or hold back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever watched a sumo match?'' asked Regalia of the
Chamber of Commerce. ``This is the precursor, where they all go
into the corner, stamp their feet, and throw salt in the air.
Everyone is wondering if one or two wrestlers is going to step into
the ring. And are they going to be on offense or defense?''
</P>
<P>
   Also confusing the situation is a lack of public consensus _ or
even public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thoroughly discouraged,'' said Richard Thau, director of
Third Millennium, a group of young political activists that has
devoted much of the last year to Social Security. Referring to the
Oval Office sex scandal, he said: ``We spent the year talking about
a stained blue dress. In terms of reaching out to 265 million
Americans, this year was pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Washington is acting as if a big political brawl is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Deaver, the public relations man who helped shape
President Reagan's image, has been taking potential clients to
lunch and picking their brains on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   At least three advertising firms have sent unsolicited proposals
to the Alliance for Worker Retirement Security, explaining how to
build a public relations campaign to back private accounts. The
group includes the National Association of Manufacturers, the
National Retail Federation, and several other groups that favor
private accounts. The public relations firm Burson-Marsteller and
others have drawn up proposals to pitch their services to clients.
</P>
<P>
   As various interest groups sort out their positions, early
skirmishes have developed for control of the debate. The points of
tension so far include:
</P>
<P>
   _Is Social Security broken?
</P>
<P>
   Groups that want big changes push the idea that the program is
in crisis and bound to collapse. But the AFL-CIO notes that even
after the program's reserves are gone in about 30 years, payroll
taxes will be enough to cover 80 percent of benefits. That argues
for only moderate changes to the program, the union says.
</P>
<P>
   _Is the stock market the right tool for improving Social
Security?
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for private stock accounts, some groups have focused on
rates of return. For an average household of two 30-year-old
workers, each dollar paid in taxes will produce only a 1.23 percent
annual return in benefits, the Heritage Foundation says. The same
dollar invested half in stocks and half in bonds would produce at
least 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of private accounts also say they are preferable to
other painful solutions such as a higher retirement age or lower
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of stock accounts say that Social Security is not an
investment but an insurance plan that also pays benefits for death
and disability. Keeping seniors from poverty is too important a
goal to leave to a jittery stock market, they say.
</P>
<P>
   _What happens to blacks, Hispanics, and women?
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are careful to pitch their plans to minorities and
women. Third Millennium, for example, has held separate forums on
how private accounts would help blacks, women, and Hispanics.
Heritage argues that the program is a particularly bad deal for
some minorities, especially black men, because their life
expectancies are shorter than are whites'. But others say that
argument overlooks the disability benefits in the Social Security
program, which is a significant aid to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the lobbyists, pollsters, and consultants are waiting
for Clinton or Congress to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to put a plan on the table, because as soon as
you do you get attacked,'' said Klug, the congressman from
Wisconsin. ``Whether anyone actually has the political guts to step
forward and do that is the trillion-dollar question.''

THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN 
Stories 
By Alice Munro. Knopf. 339 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice Munro is so revered for her stories _ her perfect gardens
sculpted from the Canadian provinces, from the wilds of the human
heart _ that it's easy to overlook how macabre she can be. In spite
of all that sweet clover serving as ground cover, this is a writer
who waxes steely and composed in the face of betrayal, ignominy,
terrible accidents, violent death. The question is not whether
something awful might happen to her characters _ it will, unless
they die in their sleep at an early age _ but how they will face it
down. In the deceptive quiet of her stories, such ill-fated
consequences are made to appear normal, even domestic; more
tellingly, they're camouflaged by the labyrinths of plot she
erects, and by the cool (but never cold) authority with which she
relays her tale. So it is that a murder may be introduced as a
merely eccentric town legend, discovered by three innocent boys; a
woman's near-fatal inattention to her infant daughter is made to
seem like a pothole on an otherwise pristine country road. Life
itself is the thing to watch out for, says our dispassionate
Cassandra, its twists and turns offering remarkable bedlam posing
as civilization.
</P>
<P>
   This rough-hewn lay of the land may partly explain Munro's
classically desultory point of view: Her long, novelistic stories
are like day-trips to another country, rarely embarking anywhere
near where they're eventually headed. It's as though the world is
too complex _ too dependent upon the past, on random events that
wouldn't seem to matter _ simply to choose a protagonist or set of
circumstances and begin. Chekhov would have admired this humble
acknowledgment of the world's confusion, and indeed the
wrought-iron weight of Munro's fiction is directly descended from
the Russian master. But the abundant stories of ``The Love of a
Good Woman,'' each more than 40 pages long, also possess a Gothic
ambience that calls to mind the likes of William Faulkner and
Flannery O'Connor. If Munro can envision a scene where the town
optometrist is found drowned in his car in the local pond, she can
also make his waterlogged corpse into something comically grotesque
and revelatory at once. ``Son of a gun,'' the boys say when they
find Mr. Willens. ``With gathering energy and a tone of deepening
respect, even of gratitude. `Son of a gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's from the opening pages of the title story (which may take
its name from the Misfit, in O'Connor's ``A Good Man is Hard to
Find''). And though poor Mr. Willens, drowned in the Peregrine
River in 1951, may have got what he had coming, that stern justice
is hardly the point of Munro's tale, which is full of casual
cruelties and half-intentioned prayers. Enid, the young woman at
the center of the story, has been a good girl all her life _ that
is her asset and her curse _ and yet what she longs for may wind up
a version of O'Connor's dark grace, or what another of Munro's
characters, in a tale of similar homage, thinks of as ``relieved of
consequence.'' Of course, there's only one lasting way to achieve
that state, and Mr. Willens got there first.
</P>
<P>
   The path away from the miseries in ``The Love of a Good Woman,''
whether commonplace or extraordinary, is often a literary one.
Munro's women _ and here, most of her protagonists are female _ are
introspective, reclusive sorts. They read too much or play the
violin and aren't good for much else; they work in libraries, or
leave their husbands, or have bittersweet, piecemeal relationships
with their children. Motherhood is less a blessed, intuitive state
than a way station of surprise; we learn in the last story, ``My
Mother's Dream,'' that such compromises are part of women's love,
of choosing ``survival over victory.'' And yet these are not
long-suffering heroines, drooping from too much poetry or unspent
rage. Alienated and perplexed by their lot of sacrifice, they have
pagan fantasies where sex and death lie entwined; then they get up
and put on the tea kettle, or walk out on their families. There
isn't a happy ending in sight in this collection _ that's part of
its brutal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   To Munro's credit, we usually don't find out what happens to
these people. Her endings are unresolved without being coy; they
nod at the idea of a future without succumbing to its imposed
order. In ``Save the Reaper,'' a discontented woman, on an outing
with her grandkids, finds herself in danger, then ups the ante _
what matters is not the result of her actions, but the yearning and
psychic complexity that takes her on that cliff walk. If character
isn't destiny in Munro's world, it surely steers the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Only one story in this collection feels weak; it's an
irony-laden tale told in the epistolary form by a physician's
daughter to her ex-lover, and it seems heavy-handed next to Munro's
exquisitely deft other constructions. Three in particular are
outstanding: the title story, the scarily enchanting ``Rich as
Stink,'' and the last story, ``My Mother's Dream.'' Munro's
shifting point of view makes her fiction oddly suspenseful; it is
only near the end of all these stories that we realize where (or
upon whom) the action actually centers. In ``Rich as Stink,'' an
11-year-old girl has returned to her mother after a year of living
with her father and his ex-wife; the eccentric triangle the mother
is involved in, with a Svengali-like writer and his wife, forces
the child into the role of caretaker until disaster strikes. And in
``My Mother's Dream,'' the ghostly narrator leads us through a
mother-daughter war where casualties seem certain, but it's the
resolution of the story _ who lives, who suffers the most _ that
will dictate its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   This is more complicated in execution than it looks, which is
one reason Munro has few peers. For all her grand chambers of
understanding, she is in fact an architect of the form of fiction:
undaunted by misery or greed, concerned foremost with the blueprint
of life's crimes and misdemeanors. She is not a kind writer; she is
a deeply moral one. The seamless display of that trait is apparent
throughout ``My Mother's Dream,'' which boasts among its characters
a woman recovering from shock treatments, the alcoholic wife of a
doctor 25 years her junior, and a grandmother suffering from
dementia. Those are three of the saviors in the story; thanks to
Alice Munro's evenhanded brilliance, they all seem perfectly normal
_ just part of the parade, in humanity's onward march.

A SEASON OF MODERN ART RICHES IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a breathtaking autumn to be a modern-art lover
in New York. Sprawled out in midtown, at the Museum of Modern Art,
is the largest exhibition ever of Jackson Pollock paintings. A mile
north, at the Whitney, the largest display ever of Mark Rothko. A
few blocks up, at the Guggenheim, 150 of the most celebrated
masterpieces from Paris's Pompidou Centre.
</P>
<P>
   To have three such monumental shows of 20th-century art going on
at the same time, within walking distance of one another, is _ even
for the world capital of modern art _ a pretty amazing coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Pollock, which runs through Feb. 2, is the jaw-dropper, a
suitably gargantuan feast for a painter of famously gargantuan
appetite and output: nearly 200 works, filling &QC; 
MoMA's third floor. Not only should it leave even Pollock-skeptics
spinning, it also adds up to that rare thing: a museum show that,
by the comprehensiveness of its collection and the logic of its
layout, enriches an understanding of the artist.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight comes toward the end, where simply by pivoting on
your heel and taking a few steps you can see ``Lavender Mist,''
``Autumn Rhythm,'' ``Number One,'' ``Number 31,'' and ``Number 32''
_ in short, all of Pollock's massive ``drip paintings'' from 1950,
which usually hang in four separate museums in three different
cities.
</P>
<P>
   These paintings have always struck me as tapping into some
secret rhythm of the universe. Viewing them all together feels like
being let in on the grand symphony of the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   We learn from this exhibition (and its eminently readable
catalog by curators Kirk Varnedoe and Pepe Karmel) that Pollock
himself saw his paintings as the expression of subconscious streams
and cosmic streakings. When an unenchanted critic once asked him
why he never painted from nature, Pollock replied, ``I am nature.''
It seems he wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock started out, by his own admission, with little apparent
talent. His drawings from the 1930s and early '40s are stunningly
bad, and his paintings from that era ooze with the Jungian totems
and stick figures that had already fallen into cliche among his
Surrealist mentors.
</P>
<P>
   His breakthrough comes in 1943 with the 8-by-20-foot ``Mural,''
a swirling funhouse of color and motion that he painted for the
foyer of Peggy Guggenheim's apartment but that has rarely been seen
because it's been hanging in the art museum of the University of
Iowa in Iowa City. Pollock said he wanted to get ``inside his
paintings,'' and here, for the first time, you can see he's
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   So begins the era of Pollock's vast ``all-over'' canvases, which
he would lay on his studio floor and dance and weave around, while
pouring, dripping, and splattering paint with incredible energy
and, even more, precision.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could walk through this show with any care and come away
thinking that Pollock's creations were random splatter jobs. (Well,
almost nobody. Hilton Kramer, in the New York Observer, still
dismisses him, repeating Time's crack from the early '50s about
``Jack the Dripper.'')
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Pollock's works involved a great deal of randomness,
but like a jazz musician improvising on a chord pattern, he knew
what he was after, had a structure in mind, and could tell when the
piece was done.
</P>
<P>
   After 1950, perhaps realizing he'd exhausted the genre he
invented, Pollock returned to stick figures and brash colors _ a
development seldom noted before this show, because the works from
this period have rarely been seen. The painting often called his
last great work, the 1952 ``Blue Poles'' (which usually hangs in
the National Gallery of Australia and hasn't appeared in the United
States for a quarter-century), fuses his old and new approaches. He
piles on layer after layer of garish splashes, crisscrosses, and
night mists, wilder than anything he'd ever done, but then creates
order by swathing, on top of it all, eight bold, blue vertical
lines: the ``blue poles.'' Pitched at slightly odd angles, they
undulate across the canvas, like Matisse's abstract ``Jazz''
cutouts, riotously dancing amid the galactic haze.
</P>
<P>
   A roomful of Rothkos doesn't carry the punch of the Pollocks.
Seen from afar, or in art books, they don't seem to carry much of
anything. But stared at up close, the best of them shimmer with an
inner life. It's a spooky sensation, because, unlike Pollock's
slashing strokes, Rothko's technique is invisible; it's a mystery
how he achieved his effects.
</P>
<P>
   Rothko was a contemporary of Pollock's who also found his style
in the late '40s (and, like Pollock, seemed a fairly hackneyed
artist until then). For the remaining two decades of his life, he
painted nothing but rectangles; most of the big ones, along with
some of his earlier works, take up the third and fourth floors of
the Whitney through Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Confining himself to such limited shapes, Rothko poured all his
passions into color, and the rectangles from the mid-'50s, in
particular, glow with it. His reds blaze with fire, his whites
shine, his blues seem as transparent as the sky or as deep as the
ocean, and the borders between the colors smoke and smolder.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Rothko grew darker. In some paintings, he mixes
blacks, grays, browns, and maroons so densely that it's hard to
distinguish any color or light. Still, somehow, they remain
striking works; Rothko meant them to evoke his vision of God or the
universe, and evidently he did not like what he saw. (He committed
suicide in 1970.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the exhibit's last room holds a surprise, a group of
works that Rothko painted in his final year, borrowed from his
family's private collection. They're light, airy paintings, swathed
with soft washes of turquoise, salmon-pink, and other pastel
shades. They form a soothing coda to a crescendo of gloom.
</P>
<P>
   After all this intensity, the European masterpieces at the
Guggenheim exhibition, which struck their first observers 50 to 90
years ago as so revolutionary _ works by Picasso, Matisse,
Malevich, Kandinsky, Duchamp, Dali, Calder, Miro, and so forth _
now feel utterly accessible and familiar. Seeing them is like
listening to Charlie Parker after a boxed set of Ornette Coleman or
late Coltrane.
</P>
<P>
   These are works from the Guggenheim's own collection, placed
next to similar or contrasting pieces from the Pompidou, which is
currently closed for renovation. The exhibition, which runs through
Jan. 24, is called ``Rendezvous,'' and it is fascinating to compare
Picasso's ``Woman with Yellow Hair'' (from the Guggenheim) with
Matisse's ``The Dream'' (from the Pompidou), both of which portray
women sleeping; or to see Kandinsky's ``Landscape With Tower''
(Pompidou) next to the study that preceded it (Guggenheim); or to
discover the intimate interplay between Calder's murals and Miro's
``Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   But mainly, it's a pleasure buzz, a greatest-hits parade of the
20th century, and you're strolling right alongside it.

DEBUNKING MYTHS ABOUT THE NORTHAND SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ Before slavery was eliminated in New England
at the time of the American Revolution, virtually every family with
a comfortable income owned at least one slave in Boston and other
major seaports in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves once accounted for 20 percent of the population of New
York, and even after the Northern states became ``free'' in the
early 19th century, blacks remained locked in bondage by racial
codes enacted by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The abolitionist movement, hailed by some historians as New
England's gift to liberty, was actually a minor element in Northern
society until the Civil War, and Northern merchants supported the
slave system in the South with capital investments and shipments of
farm animals, food, and technology that maintained the plantations.
</P>
<P>
   These assertions about the institution of slavery in the North
are from Ira Berlin's new book, ``Many Thousands Gone,'' a sweeping
history that indicts North and South for enslaving hundreds of
thousands of black workers over two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we take the institution of slavery in the
North particularly seriously,'' Berlin said in an interview at the
University of Maryland, where he is a professor of history. ``But
the first thing to say about slavery in the North is that it was
not a trivial part of Northern life. It was a very significant
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we think about it in terms of numbers in the middle of
the 18th century, the numbers in the North are not radically
different from the Chesapeake, in Maryland, and parts of
Virginia,'' he said. Berlin described the Hudson Valley in New York
and New Jersey as a ``heartland of slavery'' where slaves made up
one-third of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Thousands Gone'' was praised last month as a ``masterly
work'' by George M. Frederickson, a Stanford University historian
writing in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by the Belknap Press/Harvard University
Press, discusses the practice of slavery during different eras in
four regions of the country: the Northeast, the Chesapeake, the
Carolina lowcountry, and the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we tend to think of a 19th century where the North is
free and the South is slave,'' Berlin said. ``I think it may be
more useful to think of the entire United States as a slave society
in which one part of the United States is undergoing a transition
from slavery to freedom, and to think of the North as an area which
is still part of the slave society, but is becoming a base from
which people are launching attacks on slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But many white Northerners didn't think of identifying with
freedom until really very late. You didn't get an active
anti-slavery movement until the 1830s. It's clearly a minority
movement that did not grow into the abolitionist movement until
right up to the American Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians make an important distinction, he said, between
abolitionists, who wanted to end slavery, and ``free-soilers,'' who
were merely interested in limiting its spread. ``Generally, we tend
to identify abolitionists with some kind of commitment to racial
equality,'' Berlin said. ``Certainly, that was not a commitment
which most white Northerners had in 1860. And maybe they didn't
have it in 1960.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Crispus Attucks, a black victim of the Boston Massacre
in 1770, is held as an example of an integrated American effort to
gain independence from Great Britain, Berlin said slaves were
confronted with conflicting loyalties during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to figure out which side might benefit them.
For many blacks, the British offered the best deal,'' Berlin said.
``To the extent that most slaveholders were patriots, many blacks
thought the enemy of your enemy has to be your friend. There was a
struggle going on. Sometimes it paid to be the friend of the king;
sometimes it paid to be friend of the Continental Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Some blacks enlisted with British units; others were attracted
to the patriots' cause by the language of the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Although slaves were liberated in northern New England following
the Revolutionary War, slavery was still practiced in Rhode Island
and Connecticut into the 19th century. Black codes were instituted
in some Northern states to deny freed slaves the right to vote,
attend schools, and eat in public diners.
</P>
<P>
   After winning freedom in the North, blacks were still consigned
to menial jobs. ``Most black people in the North were pushing
brooms or lifting shovels,'' Berlin said. ``The North was not
willing to share skilled jobs with black people.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a small number of passionate abolitionists
and a few articulate former slaves, the North helped perpetuate
slavery in the South. Until the Civil War, Berlin said,
``northerners were engaged in the slave trade. They sent goods to
the South, cheap clothes for the slaves, cheap shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Berlin writes in the book's epilogue:
</P>
<P>
   ``Barred from the workshops and factories that enriched white
Northerners, black people seldom benefited from capitalism's
expansive cornucopia. The mixing of white and black in the
workshops and farms of the 18th century and the large role black
people played in the colonial economy dissipated as they exited
slavery. Competition from newly arrived immigrants further
undermined the position of former slaves. Free black men and women
sank to the base of Northern society, marginalized, impoverished,
and despised.''

CHRISTOPHER REEVE: MAN OF ACTION ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Christopher Reeve and
Daryl Hannah in ``Rear Window.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For the first time since the horseriding accident in l995 that
left him paralyzed and unable to walk, Christopher Reeve is back in
the starring spot in a movie- ABC's ``Rear Window,'' airing Nov.
22.
 &HT;    In this remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic l954 thriller,
Reeve plays architect Jason Kemp who has been left a quadriplegic
after a catastrophic car crash. He shares the spotlight with
gorgeous Daryl Hannah, (reprising the role made famous by Grace
Kelly) as a man who, though confined to his room, witnesses what he
believes is a brutal murder.
 &HT;    Last year Reeve went behind the camera to direct the HBO movie
``In the Gloaming,'' a gem that brought him an Emmy nomination for
best director.
 &HT;    In the l997 TV film, ``Snakes and Ladders,'' he played a small
role as a quadriplegic who becomes a mentor to young man paralyzed
in a diving accident.
 &HT;    But this time he's back as the star, above the title, the
position he occupied before a balking horse changed his life
forever. Reeve was Superman on and off screen. The man who could
leap tall buildings in a single bound was in real life a real man
of action, flying gliders as well as jets, sky diving, sailing and
skiing, until, in the cruelest of ironies, he fell during a
relatively simple horse show, breaking the top two vertebrae of his
spinal column.
 &HT;    His courage has been challenged as never before. And ``Rear
Window,'' he says, allowed him to incorporate into the character
many of the terrifying things he himself has experienced. ``I
wanted to do this film because many times disabled people are shown
in a somewhat pathetic light or they're bitter or angry,'' he
explains. ``But this character is really more positive _ a
resourceful man who has been through the ringer. This movie shows
how far someone can come in reclaiming his life.''
 &HT;    Speaking from his home amid the woods of Bedford, N.Y., Reeve
has made incredible progress since the accident. Many thought he
wouldn't live out the year let alone have a career.
 &HT;    Now as an actor he has a unique opportunity to show an audience
at least a small part of what being a quadriplegic really entails.
For him this is not just acting.
 &HT;    ``Jason's experiences are very close to mine,'' he says. ``For
example, he experiences a 'pop off.' This means that some part of
the hose he depends on for breathing becomes separated from the
vent, or a hole develops in the hose. That's happened to me a
number of times. I stopped getting air and had absolutely no
breath.
 &HT;    ``And when we did that scene in the movie we did it for real.
The poor actor playing the nurse was terrified, but I told her it
was perfectly safe. There were actually nurses around and others
who could reconnect the vent in a second. I can also breathe off
the vent for short periods of time, so there was no real danger.
But when you see the pop-off on the screen, it's real. I'm actually
not breathing.''
 &HT;    It certainly takes Hitchcock's concept of the thriller a step
beyond. ``I think audiences will see what it's really like to go
through some of these very anxious moments,'' says Reeve. ``They
will see how those moments can be lonely and frustrating when
someone is just learning to cope with the situation.''
 &HT;    In the original film James Stewart played a photographer who was
sidelined with a broken leg. ``Our movie updates the story. The
idea is to raise the stakes,'' says Reeve. ``To do the same story
but with a ... quadriplegic puts the lead character in so much more
jeopardy. We wanted to create something exciting that forges new
ground.''
 &HT;    Hannah says Reeve was a joy to work with. ``He has a sparkle in
his eye that is sort of hypnotic and it kind of shoots out across
the room and tantalizes and hypnotizes you. He's got so much energy
and life it's just intoxicating.''
 &HT;    In his own life of course, Reeve has become a hero to millions
around the world since his accident. Besides directing, he has
narrated the film ``Without Pity,'' a plea for the disabled to
enjoy more rights in society. He's also penned a best-selling
autobiography, ``Still Me,'' which has helped ease his huge medical
bills.
 &HT;    In between he crisscrosses the country campaigning for a
national spinal cord registry and other legislation to help further
rights for the handicapped. His 37 year old wife Dana, (``my
rock'') is now rehearsing for a Broadway show, ``More to Love,''
and their son Will, 6, is at school. He also sees a lot of his
children from a previous relationship, Matthew l8, and Alexandra
15.
 &HT;    Reeve says of his wife: ``We're very much in love. Whether I
have zero recovery or full recovery our relationship will
survive.''
 &HT;    Progress, he says, is slow but perceptible. When he turned 43,
just four months after the accident, he couldn't blow out his
candles. Now when they wheeled in a cake for his 46th birthday he
proudly blew out the lot.
 &HT;    Through practice, he can now breathe without the ventilator for
up to 30 minutes a day. He exercises for three hours daily and is
now able to sneeze _ something he couldn't do a couple of years
ago.
 &HT;    But he still loses his cool when people, some of them doctors,
describe his quest as futile. And he insists he doesn't worry about
his medical insurance running out. ``By that time,'' he says,
``I'll be up and walking.''

   RICHMOND, Calif. _ Here, in an unremarkably utilitarian
single-story building in an industrial park you wouldn't look at
twice, is a high-tech screening room filled with old sofas. It's
cutting-edge, accessorized with funk. That's Pixar Studios, where
the finishing touches are being put on ``A Bug's Life,'' Pixar's
follow-up to 1995's ``Toy Story,'' the first full-length
computer-generated animated feature. It was successful enough to
compel a sequel, ``Toy Story 2.'' But that comes next year. Right
now _ we are talking late July _ the Pixar team is giving a final
once-over to ``A Bug's Life,'' which its partner, Disney, will open
nationwide on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Toy Story'' was mostly an indoor film, ``A Bug's Life''
is an outdoor one. What Pixar couldn't know as its four-year effort
to make ``A Bug's Life'' was coming to a close was that DreamWorks,
headed by onetime Disney studio chief and now rival Jeffrey
Katzenberg, was going to beat ``A Bug's Life'' into theaters with
``Antz,'' complete with a similar story line about a misfit ant
making a last-ditch effort to save the colony. But just as
DreamWorks' killer comet movie, ``Deep Impact,'' didn't keep
Disney's later and similar ``Armageddon'' from cleaning up, ``A
Bug's Life'' figures to enjoy its day in the sun, and at the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   While ``A Bug's Life'' doesn't have the clever Woody Allen
one-liners of ``Antz,'' it's skewed to a younger and therefore
broader audience. Its strength is its more elaborately drawn
natural world through which the characters move. Steven Jobs, Pixar
chairman, describes it as a luminous canopy of green. The creative
strokes of the Pixar folks are presided over by two-time Oscar
winner John Lasseter, the laid-back, jeans-wearing director of
``Toy Story'' and ``A Bug's Life.'' You could call him the
Spielberg of computer-generated animation, except that he's also
the coming millennium's throwback to Walt Disney in his ability to
make animated technique go Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' took 12 times the computer power that ``Toy
Story'' took, Lasseter says, when asked, although he soon makes it
clear that he'd just as soon not emphasize the computer aspect of
computer animation, even though he's one of its fathers. Cal Arts
grad Lasseter began as a Disney animator, who, upon seeing the
early stages of ``Tron'' in 1981, never looked back. When Jobs
bought what had been filmmaker George Lucas's computer division in
1986 and set it to work making computer-generated films, Lasseter
was one of the first aboard. He won his first Oscar for the short
animated film ``Tin Toy'' in 1988. ``What excited me in 1981 was
the dimensionality,'' Lasseter says. ``I realized, `This is it! You
can do it!' I was hooked completely. Part of it was that this
technology gives you the ability to make worlds even more
believable than hand-drawn animation.'' Still, he says, people
mistakenly regard the computer as the latest Aladdin's lamp, out of
which animation springs magically. Not so, he quickly adds.
Although the computer is a tool that shortens work and can increase
effectiveness, animation still is a labor-intensive process.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that the computer creates the animation is like saying
the pen writes the novel,'' Lasseter says. ``What's most important
are characters and story. Before the computer enters the picture,
there are many drawings. Models are built. We work out all the
lighting and shading. You have to come up with the creative vision
of what the film should look like. The computer is really pretty
stupid. It won't do anything, or anything good, unless you tell it
what to do, and be very specific about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a great animator, to make a drawn character come to
life, you need two skills. One, drawing. Two, the ability to act.
The best you're gonna get is a great animator who is too shy to be
on the stage, but you'll get their acting techniques. So it really
is handcrafted, you know. But computers are our tools. You model
three-dimensional models of the characters within the computer.
Three-dimensional models of the ground plan have to be built within
the computer, too. Then, along with building the arms, the legs,
the body, the antennae, you have to indicate where the characters
move, the rotations of the elbows and the neck, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we go for the animation, we have figured out the story.
Then the animators are given the shots. They work frame by frame.
But they can move ahead 10 frames, and the computer can fill in the
intermediate stages. We have lots of control over that, so the
motion won't be robotic-looking. The last thing the animator does
is put in the lip-sync (in this case, to the voices of Dave Foley,
Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis Diller, and Denis Leary,
among others). So you create the character, hand it over to a
person who works on a computer to create the model of the
character, then hand it over to an animator who moves the computer
model around and basically makes it come to life, then animates the
dialogues.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait. That's only half the job. The characters, when
completed, move on undulating grids in the computer. The grids must
be built up into the backgrounds, too. ``Toy Story'' mostly used
simple geometric surfaces as backgrounds. ``A Bug's Life'' uses
waving blades of grass, constantly shifting landscapes, and effects
like rain. This explains why ``A Bug's Life'' required a lot more
work. New technology was developed in response to specific needs,
says supervising technical director Bill Reeves. This, he adds, is
an old Pixar tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Later, executive vice president, chief technology officer, and
Pixar founder Edwin E. Catmull explains over a lunch of sushi and
sprouts that Pixar couldn't just go to a computer store to meet the
needs that arose as its projects proceeded. Pixar has a unit that
has developed approximately 85 percent of the software used over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the rain,'' Catmull says. ``We had to develop the whole
fluid dynamic to make it look good. And the wind. One of our guys
worked just on the wind system. We do a lot of our stuff ourselves
because we have to change it all the time, we have to fix it, we
have to make it specific.'' ``Geri's Game,'' directed by Jan
Pinkava, won a 1997 Oscar for best animated short. That film, about
an old man playing chess, came about because Pixar needed to solve
the problem of rendering cloth and skin, Catmull adds.
</P>
<P>
   A walk around the Pixar building reveals the expected nest of
cubicles and work stations, walls and computer surfaces festooned
with cartoons, drawings, postcards, and, appropriately enough,
toys. The screening room with the funky couches (``We basically had
a casting call for couches,'' Lasseter says. ``Anybody wanted to
get rid of a couch, we'd come pick it up on a weekend. The only
thing is they were all brown and all from the '70s!'') turns out to
be mission control. ``Here we can access every work station,
project the work on the big screen,'' Lasseter says. ``When an
animator is working on a little piece of the film, he or she needs
to see what comes before and after, so we're always accessing it
and seeing how it fits into the overall film.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Pixar is going full tilt _ it has a contract with
partner Disney for five films in five years _ its work force is
still under 1,000. A more standard animation _ ``Hercules'' or
``Mulan,'' say _ requires between 500 and 800. Approximately 135
people were needed for ``Toy Story.'' For the height of production
on ``A Bug's Life,'' the number was 200, including some borrowed
from the ``Toy Story'' sequel. One advantage of computer-generated
animation, Lasseter says, is that you can store all the images
digitally. This means the ``Toy Story'' sequel will cost less than
the first one. And, of course, the images are there to be used for
merchandise, theme parks, and other spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pixar team spent time studying National Geographic and
Discovery Channel specials on insects, and were already in
production when ``Microcosmos,'' another source, was released. We
studied the nature film ``Microcosmos,'' Lasseter says. ``When
Disney did `Mulan,' they went to China. When they did `Hercules,'
they went to Greece. We got to go to the planters out in front of
the building. I love working at this company because it is a
company of geeks. They saw us out there and a couple of the guys
went and built for us this tiny little video camera that's on the
end of this stick _ very low-tech _ and it was on little wheels and
we just rolled it around under plants and into the grass and we
videotaped lots of insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw things we were familiar with, but we saw it in new
ways. Clovers are like sequoias. Grass and leaves on the ground are
like huge hallways. The rules of physics are different. Surface
tension counts for as much as gravity. But the one thing that
inspired us more than anything else is how translucent the world is
at this level. It's like a world of stained glass. Drops of rain
are like giant Volkswagens landing on the ants. Really spectacular.
The hard exoskeletons of the various bugs and things like the
translucency of their wings lent themselves to computer
techniques,'' Lasseter adds. If William Blake found the world in a
grain of sand, Lasseter hopes he's found Pixar's next blockbuster
in a planter.

SOON 
Tales from Hospice 
By A.G. Mojtabai 
Zoland, 190 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Soon'' is a book everyone should read because it is about a
subject no one wants to think about. But A.G. Mojtabai's theme _
terminal illness and death _ is a universal one, and she approaches
it with sympathy, humor, and an educated heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago Mojtabai, one of America's most gifted and
sensitive novelists, went to Amarillo, Texas, to do research for a
magazine article that evolved into her great nonfiction book,
``Blessed Assurance,'' a study of apocalyptic religion in the town
dominated by the final assembly plant for American nuclear weapons.
Up until that time, Mojtabai had led an unconventional but
cosmopolitan life in New York, Iran, and Cambridge, where she held
an appointment at Harvard; in Amarillo she unexpectedly found home.
For several years she has been a volunteer worker in the hospice at
St. Anthony's Hospital in Amarillo, and the 17 miraculous stories
in ``Soon'' come out of that experience.
</P>
<P>
   The stories circle around the experience of death no one can
describe from within, so they are stories about the living _ about
the staff and volunteers of the hospice, who appear and reappear
throughout the cycle of the story; about friends and families; and
about the dying patients. The title of one of the stories, and the
substance of all of them, remind us that the dying are ``still
here.''
</P>
<P>
   They have reached the seventh of Shakespeare's ages of man,
although they are not all old _ there's a child, not frightened by
the grim fairy tale of ``The Juniper Tree''; there's a young man,
dying of AIDS, alone. They are not even sans everything, though
their belongings don't amount to much. ``Ruthie's mother held
tightly to the possessions in her lap, all she would ever need at
this, or any, time: comb and brush, cup, tooth swabs, a cake of
soap, and a small, kidney-shaped basin _ they filled a pink plastic
tub, not much bigger than a bread box. ... Waiting for the hospice
admission procedure to begin, Ruthie would catch her consulting her
empty wrist. It was hard, Ruthie guessed, to put aside such an old
habit as time.'' These people are beyond wardrobe; they are without
any remaining public manifestation of ``identity''; they are
without hope, as most people understand that emotion; many of them
can no longer speak, or don't make sense when they try. But
Mojtabai's special grace is to show us that none of them is without
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   There are details and anecdotes embedded in ``Soon'' that have
the ring of experienced truth. Mojtabai knows the exceptional
routine of daily activity in a hospice, and she knows the anecdotes
they tell the tour groups _ and the ones they don't. One delights
in the little tale of the cowboy reunited, briefly, with his
beloved horse, and the story of the baptism in the whirlpool bath.
One shudders at the father who shouts into the room where his son
is dying of AIDS, ``It's your own fault.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the stories Mojtabai has had to invent, because the
people she writes about were past being able to tell her anything,
and as a volunteer she had no access to official medical or family
information. She saw things, felt them, and wondered. A woman,
keeping up appearances, a turban piled atop her head, exhausts her
remaining strength writing letters; to find out what was in them,
Mojtabai had to write the letters herself. A patient lay with an
orchid pinned to her pillow. Mojtabai imagines how it got there,
what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are utterly lucid and concrete, but mysterious. They
are divided into two groups _ ``Looking On'' and ``Trying to See.''
Some patients die with the consolations of religion; others do
without. All of them seem to understand and accept things their
friends and relatives do not, even the ones who are not prepared to
give up the fight. Children play while a grandparent dies. (```Kids
help a lot,' (Amy) said, `at times like this, but there won't ever
again be anybody like my father. The new doesn't cancel out the
old.' `No,' Louellen agreed, `no, it doesn't.''') The stories are
beyond description as ``upbeat'' or ``downbeat,'' though one
patient is wheeled into the chapel to bear witness to the wedding
of her favorite granddaughter, and another rides triumphantly out
of the hospice in his wheelchair, ready for a hot night out on the
town.
</P>
<P>
   But that happy ending, or happy postponement of the ending, is
not the miracle of the specific story ``Spring Me'' or the miracle
of the entire collection. Mojtabai has all the gifts of a great
writer _ the observant eye that misses no nuance of expressions;
the ear that hears the music and the poetry behind the plain
cadences of common speech; the willingness to confront her own
primal fears. It isn't even the educated heart that can write. ``I
(marvel) how strong families _ mine is not _ draw in at times like
this. It's like the closing of an open wound, or the mending of a
rip in a fabric, the threads drawing tighter around the tear,
keeping the fabric whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The miracle is the willingness to accept what is unknowable,
which is the only way to understand it. Hospice, Mojtabai reminds
us in her preface, is ``as much a mode of practice as a place. ...
Help comes through a mutual unfolding. And, happening to be present
at a graced moment, sometimes I am startled to find _ this side of
death _ the old barriers rolled away, stranger turning towards
stranger with no other strangeness than the ease of turning.''

 &HT;    Got turkey trauma? Help's just a click away
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody remembers their first time. The first time you're
eyeball to gullet with a turkey that is bigger than some of the
kids you know and it's your singular responsibility to have it
camera-ready (just like in the magazines) to say nothing of
mouthwateringly delicious for a table full of out-of-town
Thanksgiving guests. At best, it's a bit intimidating. (How can all
the instructions to cook this thing be on that little sticker?) At
worst, the insecurity, the anxiety, the downright panic that can
ensue can shred the confidence of any novice cook facing their
first turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The oven could conk out. The dog could make waste of it. You
could drop it or you could hear on CNN that there was a last-minute
recall of all turkeys sold by your supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   But take heart. First of all, even experienced chefs sometimes
seek help to deal with a recalcitrant turkey, and secondly, the
Internet is so chock-full of advice, Q&AMP;As, tips and general
information that you just need to log on and relax.
</P>
<P>
   Here is but a sampling of some of the turkey problem-solving
sites on the Net.

   Marinate First
</P>
<P>
   Marinades are seasoned liquids in which meats are soaked both to
absorb flavor and to tenderize. Most marinades contain an acid such
as vinegar, citrus juice or wine, and herbs or spices. One of the
easiest ways to marinate a turkey is by using a needle-like
injector. Injectors can be purchased at kitchen supply stores and
range in price from $10 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   To marinate a turkey without an injector, simply use a fork to
make random holes over the entire bird. Place the turkey in a
large, plastic cooking bag or clean plastic trash bag, pour in the
marinade, close the bag securely and let it marinate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey should always be marinated in the refrigerator. Before
cooking, be sure to scrape off excess marinade and discard. Do not
re-use marinade to baste the turkey. Then Cook!
</P>

`DR. DOLITTLE' DOESN'T; `DEATH' STANDS UP WELL

   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Dr. Dolittle''  &LR; _ Whatever happened to the sly,
slightly dangerous Eddie Murphy of ``48 Hours''? Whatever happened
to the Murphy of the wildly funny ``Trading Places''? He's not bad
in this watchable remake of the Rex Harrison 1967 flop, but he's
not good, either. There are a few comic moments with the animals,
but all the charming elements that made the Hugh Lofting character
fascinating are gone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Death Takes a Holiday''  &LR; _ Fred-ric March stars in the 1934
movie that ``Meet Joe Black'' was based on. As death, he's much
better than Brad Pitt, and the movie, while a little old-fashioned,
stands up pretty well. (Not to be confused with the Melvyn Douglas
TV movie of 1971, which is dreadful.)

   &UR; ``The Hours''  &LR; by Michael Cunningham (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,

to the original.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Life of Thomas More'' &LR;  by Peter Ackroyd (Nan A.

of the founder of Christian Science, from hardscrabble farm to
international triumph, seems to exemplify the principle that the
Lord helps those who help themselves.

novelist's alter ego, sallies forth to confront his own mortality.

recollections of a woman on her deathbed, this novel casts a clear
light on a long life and a lost love.

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 !! 1/2 ``Celebrity''  Woody Allen's hit-and-miss Manhattan update
of Fellini's ``La Dolce Vita.'' Glitz-addicted journalist Kenneth
Branagh is the Allen surrogate who divorces his wife to chase
entree onto the A list when he isn't chasing women. Allen certainly
knows how to tee off on celebrity-driven silliness. Leonardo
DiCaprio is fun, too, as a bratty hotel-room-trashing star, but
Branagh's uncanny impersonation of Allen becomes an almost fatal
distraction. (R)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ! 1/2 ``The Cruise''  &LR; A cross between documentary and performance
art as motormouthed Manhattan tour bus guide Timothy ``Speed''
Levitch plays to the camera. He's interesting when he's dishing out
arcane New York factoids, but quickly turns tedious when his jokes
about rejection turn into whining. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; (FR)!!!! ``Elizabeth''  &LR; Cate Blanchett is extraordinary as
Elizabeth I, from her first tentative moves into a treachery-filled
court to her final reinvention of herself as the Virgin Queen.
Geoffrey Rush, as Walsingham, the first modern spy, who enjoys his
lethal work in a sinister way, leads a strong supporting cast. And
the film is boldly executed by Indian director Shekhar Kapur, with
plenty of contemporary resonance in its theme of female
self-empowerment. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``Enemy of the State'' &LR;  By pacing this thriller to the beat of
the high-powered surveillance equipment clicked up on a succession
of computer screens, director Tony Scott keeps the paranoia
crackling. He's aided by sympathetic performances from Will Smith,
as an Everyman pursued because he has incriminating evidence, and
especially from Gene Hackman, as a grizzled spook who knows all the
moves in this high-tech chess game. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! 1/2 ``Gods and Monsters'' &LR;   &UR;  &LR; What could have been a memorable
film about the last days of James Whale, the British director of
``Frankenstein'' and other '30s horror classics, turns pedestrian
when it lurches into psychodrama between the elegant Brit and his
hunky, homophobic gardener. As Whale, Ian McKellen is brilliant,
but you keep wishing he had more to work with. (Unrated)

   What is it about Coach handbags? They're conservative yet
fashionable. They're a status symbol yet affordable. They're
ubiquitous yet women keep buying them. It's gotten so bad at
parties these days that guests are grabbing the wrong Coach bags on
their way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   In banking, accounting, and law circles, Coach briefcases set
the standard. And even in popular culture, L.L. Cool J has rapped
about Coach.
</P>
<P>
   Just what does Coach have over Dooney &AMP; Bourke, Gucci, Fendi,
Prada, and Louis Vuitton?
</P>
<P>
   Reed Krakoff.
</P>
<P>
   As Coach's executive creative director, he's the one who keeps
coming up with fresh designs like backpacks in neoprene;
leather-encased vanity mirrors in purple and apple green; satchels
in fashion-conscious colors like gray; and, for pampered canines,
expensive leather collars and leashes.
</P>
<P>
   When he came on board two years ago, it was his idea to bring
back the Coach cocktail bag. (A relic from the 1960s, it was placed
in stores Nov. 1.) Krakoff also pushed for Coach to introduce its
own furniture line. (Look for it in stores like Bloomingdale's in
April.) Luggage was next, followed by scarves and ties. There are
also men's and women's shoes, leather jackets, gloves, and watches.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are huge for a company that just 10 years ago was
producing _ frankly _ rather staid merchandise fit for a soccer
mom. Its marketing campaign back then focused on _ ahem _
descendants of famous Americans like George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In its new ad campaign, the hot young model Alek Wek is the face
of Coach, along with author and activist Gloria Steinem, actress
Lara Flynn Boyle, and novelist John Irving. ``The whole concept is
to reflect the diversity of the product,'' Krakoff says. ``We're
trying to satisfy what people want.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough job for a 34-year-old who not long ago didn't know
what he wanted. The son of a publishing and media executive and a
legal-placement consultant, Krakoff grew up in Weston, Conn. The
future handbag business guru spent his early 20s studying guitar at
the Berklee College of Music and economics and art history at Tufts
University. ``I'm a failed musician,'' he says. ``I wasn't good
enough.'' And economics? He says, ``I was the worst economics
student in the history of Tufts.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Krakoff packed up and moved to Italy after
graduation in 1986. ``Originally, he went to Italy to learn to
speak Italian,'' says his mother, Sandra Krakoff of the Back Bay.
``He wanted to work in an art gallery. ... When he came home, we
were a little surprised when he said he wanted to be a fashion
designer.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's a creative mind for you. In Italy, Krakoff fell in
love with design. He returned to the United States to attend
Parsons School of Design in 1988 while he interned for no salary at
Anne Klein. There, he sketched some clothes but mostly fetched a
lot of his colleagues' dry cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   After Krakoff graduated, his career took off. First Ralph Lauren
hired him to design women's sportswear for Polo. Then Tommy
Hilfiger hired him as head sportswear designer, and later creative
director. Lunching with Hilfiger daily and working seven days a
week, Krakoff helped put the giant Hilfiger logo on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Then Coach called in 1996 with a request to come add
``dimension'' to the 57-year-old brand, he says. He couldn't
resist.
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan resident, Krakoff lives in an apartment so striking
that Elle Decor devoted eight pages to it in its May 1998 issue.
Six-feet-two with a soft voice, he's married to Amy Jedlicka, a
corporate real estate attorney who has access to all the Coach bags
she wants (she owns about 10). Jedlicka is also a part-time fashion
critic. When Krakoff brings home sketches, ``she's really honest,''
he says. ``She'll tell me `I don't like it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Krakoff, who's usually in the office six days a week, spends his
free time with Jedlicka and Sophie, his 3 1/2-year-old daughter,
often going to the zoo or the museum. His typical work-day starts
at 7:45 a.m., when you'll find him wandering around the Coach
sample room examining handbags, wallets, briefcases, and belts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his days are spent in meetings with art directors, store
managers, and advertising mavens. ``I work till 7 or 8. Then I
sometimes go to fashion magazine parties _ Vanity Fair, Cosmo or
Glamour,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Krakoff is on the road. In the ever-changing fashion
business, he works hard to stay plugged in. He says, ``In the last
five weeks, I've been to Japan once and Europe twice.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer _ who is constantly sketching ideas on scraps of
paper or his calendar _ often finds himself inspired while riding
in a taxi or walking through a store. ``I look at what people are
wearing and buying,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On Nantucket last summer, Krakoff noticed that ``everyone had
great canvas bags for the beach,'' he says. ``I thought `That's
such an American icon, that bag. Wouldn't it be great to have a
leather version?' We're developing one now.''
</P>
<P>
   Krakoff is also moved by furniture. An avid collector of '30s
and '50s French and American designs, he often attends auctions. He
says, ``I like to flip through House Beautiful to see the
coloration and mood of things _ the kinds of shapes that are in.
Like now you're seeing stainless steel and nickel finishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Krakoff believes design possibilities for Coach are broad.
``There are so many uses for handbags now ... Even with briefcases,
people have gotten more demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Krakoff and his design team are busy creating
a whopping 1,000 designs a year of various products. Some sketches
don't makes the cut. Coach asks consumers directly at various
stores what they think of prototypes and how much they would pay.
</P>
<P>
   So 1,000 designs become 200 to 300 new products. (Not every
store carries every item.) And an equal number of styles are then
retired. ``It's a fun job,'' he says. ``It keeps you always
engaged. And like school, you get to start all over again next
season. ... It's nice to work for a company where you can envision
your wife or mother in the product. I'm always thinking, `Would
they like it?'''

wealthy Democratic Party contributor Nathan Landow in closed-door

   ABERNATHY-ARRAIGN _ Ralph David Abernathy III is scheduled to be
arraigned on 35-count indictment that covers theft by taking,
making a false statement, violating his oath of office, forgery and
influencing a witness. Abernathy, a Democrat who represents
portions of the metro Atlanta area until January, is accused of
pocketing at least $13,000 in state funds by forging the names of
office volunteers and falsely claiming expenses, such as the cost
of speechwriters. He also is accused of offering a staffer $2,700
after the GBI investigation had begun so she could say she had been

<P>
   STATE-MASTERCARD-MISUSE _ With state charge card in hand,
workers at the Texas Department of Health went shopping for
computer printers. They charged so many to the state budget that
almost every cubicle in some regional offices had a private
printer. And computer scanners? Those were charged, too, even when
they weren't needed. Eight months later, some were still in their
original boxes. The purchases were made on Mastercards used by
state employees but billed to the State of Texas. Just after state
officials cracked down on misuse of American Express cards by state
employees, new documents show similar abuse of Mastercards by state
employees. A recent audit at the state health department found that
nearly one quarter of all Mastercard purchases violated rules.
Auditors found that employees, who are limited to $1,000 a
purchase, were swiping the card several times in order to buy
things that cost $6,700, and using the card to get around General
Services Commission contracts. The misuse of Mastercards more
directly affects taxpayers because the state picks up the tab,
unlike the state-issued American Express purchases, which are
billed to the employees. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman).

REGULATORS, PHYSICIANS CONCERNED ABOUT MAIL-ORDER VIAGRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Call a toll-free number and have Viagra delivered
to your door, without the embarrassment of seeing a physician or
having a physical exam.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials and physicians say that's a prescription for
serious problems and are warning consumers not to buy into ``M.D.
by Phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad medicine and it's dangerous medicine for the
consumer,'' said Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman for the New York
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New York are looking into the Arizona-based
company, operating under the apparent umbrella of the Advanced
Vascular Clinic in Phoenix. ``We're trying to figure out exactly
what this operation entails and whether we have any jurisdiction,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the physicians involved are licensed to practice
medicine in New York, Smith said the department would very likely
``open a direct investigation.'' Practicing medicine over the phone
could be considered negligence and falls short of current state
standards of care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Advanced Vascular Clinic in Phoenix, a man who gave his name
as Dennis, but who would not state his last name, said the company
asks questions of its customers that adequately guard against side
effects or complications from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, who said he is not a physician, maintained that medical
organizations criticize things like mail-order Viagra to protect
doctors' from competition by non-doctors. Consumers need to
question whether mail-order Viagra is ``terrible because it's
non-traditional, or terrible because it's ineffective,'' he said,
adding that the drug is very effective.
</P>
<P>
   Since the popular impotency pill hit the market in April,
there's been growing concern about an underground prescription
market on the Internet and via mail-order for the $10 tablet.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for medical and legal problems has prompted
numerous physicians, and medical experts, including the American
Medical Association, to speak out against on-line or mail-order
prescription services that don't require a physical examination by
a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an emerging area of medicine,'' said Eric Nickell, a
spokesperson for the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners in Phoenix.
``The laws and institutions of state medicine have not caught up
with the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few states currently have laws in place to regulate
on-line or mail-order prescriptions. Both California and New
Jersey, for example, do not allow physicians to prescribe
medications without a physical examination first, Nickell said.
</P>
<P>
   Though unaware of any consumer complaints against ``M.D. by
Phone,'' Nickell said Arizona is bringing its first formal
complaint against a doctor for prescribing medicine through an
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is going to help set the precedence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut on April 10, Viagra has been linked to some 69
deaths, including 12 men who took the drug without being under a
physician's care, according to Pamela Gemmel, a spokesman for the
drug manufacturer Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, highlights the importance of getting an
examination by a physician, who can rule out other underlying
medical problems, like diabetes or heart problems, and avoid
potentially fatal interactions with other drugs. For example, men
who are taking nitroglycerin should not take Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's bad medicine,'' she said about anonymous on-line
and mail-order sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Finn, an Albany urologist, agrees. ``I can think of
two men I've seen in the recent past,'' he said. ``Their complaint
was erectile dysfunction and in both of them I found prostate
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Erectile dysfunction affects an estimated 30 million men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a general and vascular surgeon from New
Orleans and spokesman for the American Medical Association, said
the AMA ``believes that prescriptions should be written after
taking a proper history and physical examination. You need to have
a patient-physician relationship.''

<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ It's not surprising that only 18 percent of
the American people believe a conspiracy was not involved in the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy 35 years ago in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, everybody loves a mystery, and the Kennedy assassination
fits nicely as the mystery of the century. In some deep, almost
unfathomable way, we want to believe that a cabal of evil men cut
down the dashing prince of Camelot who could've saved us from
Vietnam and Watergate.

   Well, brace yourselves folks. The cold, bitter truth is that
Oswald did indeed fire the shots that terrible day, that he did it
alone and that he did almost exactly as responsible investigators
have claimed for years.
</P>
<P>
   As a baby boomer who was stunned to the core by the news I heard
that November afternoon in my sixth-grade class, I've studied the
Kennedy assassination on and off, sometimes casually, sometimes
obsessively. I do not claim to be an expert, but I have books and
videotapes at home and thick files of clippings at work. I've
roamed Dealey Plaza, and as a journalist I covered an assassination
symposium in Dallas on the 30th anniversary of JFK's murder.
</P>
<P>
   But the more I pursued this goal, the more elusive it became.
Slowly but surely, one after another, the intriguing theories
crumbled away. In the end, I was left with irrefutable evidence
that the only conspiracy involved in JFK's death was with the
unstable and irresponsible people who continue to exploit it.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic finale to my quest was the 1993 book by Gerald
Posner entitled ``Case Closed.'' In an exhaustive 600-page
treatise, the highly respected author walks step-by-step through
every aspect of JFK's murder, painstakingly examining all the
evidence and carefully exposing all the hoaxes and myths that have
evolved since Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of many reviewers, Posner's book proves Oswald's
singular guilt so conclusively that you're almost embarrassed you
thought anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Of course this topic is too vast to be covered in one newspaper
column, but consider a few of the more obvious facts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Several major conspiracy theories have emerged, but even if
one of them is true, that means that other five or six are complete
nonsense. In other words, if the Mafia did it then the Cubans or
the Pentagon didn't. Yet we still have elaborate _ and preposterous
_ plots detailing precisely how the Cubans or the Pentagon did do
it.
</P>
<P>
   _ In any large group of people, eyewitness accounts will never
match perfectly. But most folks in Dealey Plaza on Nov. 22 heard
three shots from the School Book Depository (and one man even
looked up in time to see Oswald fire the fatal rounds). If there
had been a second gunman on the grassy knoll, several people nearby
would have seen or heard him. Abraham Zapruder himself was standing
only about 50 feet away from the picket fence where conspiracists
love to place a second gunman.
</P>
<P>
   _ The wounds on Kennedy's body and that of the wounded Texas
Gov. John Connolly do correspond to the Warren Commission's
findings. Oswald's first shot, fired when the limousine had just
turned in front of his sixth-floor window, missed completely,
probably because the bullet was deflected by a tree branch. His
second shot went through JFK's neck and then into Connolly's body,
and it wasn't deformed very much because it struck bone only on
glancing blows after it was tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The third bullet _ the infamous fatal ``head shot'' _ did indeed
come from behind, and the president's apparent bodily jerk backward
was in reality a convulsive neuromuscular response to a traumatic
head wound. People are not billiard balls whose reaction to force
can be confidently predicted. Haven't you ever seen a boxer fall
forward after getting a knockout punch, and doesn't that seem to
defy the laws of physics?
</P>
<P>
   _ Most laughable of all is the contention that Jack Ruby was
sent to make sure that Oswald, the presumed patsy, never talked.
How many hit men do you know who would murder someone in a roomful
of cops and cameras? Ruby had even stopped nearby to send a routine
business telegram just before he shot Oswald _ hardly the work of a
stalking killer _ and wouldn't have even been in the building at
the same time if Oswald's transfer to another cell hadn't been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   As galling as it may seem, the crime of the century was pulled
off by a lone nut with a cheap, mail-order rifle. A surreal chain
of events put him in the window of the building where he worked on
the same day that Jack Kennedy was visiting Dallas, and Oswald had
about eight seconds (not just four or five) to squeeze off three
shots at a fairly close target with a telescopic sight.
</P>
<P>
   It's bizarre and frustrating and tragic, but things like that
have happened throughout history. We don't have to like it, but we
should accept it. This case is closed, and we shouldn't waste any
more time on the Oliver Stones of this world who refuse to accept
that reality.

A GENERATION BURDENED BY THE SOCCER COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Soccer is bad for parents. The facts are in.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer leads to endless shuttling of children to and from games
and practice. Soccer leads to Jeep Cherokees.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer leads to prolonged sitting on sidelines with people who
shout at their kids and referees. Soccer leads to being stereotyped
by political consultants who want parents' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is bad for children, too. Organized soccer, anyway. So is
Little League, T-ball and all sports controlled by adults for the
enhancement of children's self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, drive them to and from a field for exercise, and then yell
at them while they run around in knee socks. That'll enhance their
self-esteem. And give each kid an award while you're at it.
</P>
<P>
   Then ask yourself this: When was the last time you saw some kids
playing in a vacant lot? Remember vacant lots? They weren't vacant.
They were stadiums for the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of children's play has been documented by the
Michigan Institute of Social Research. Researchers there did a
diary study of how 1,300 children, ages 3 to 13, of all races and
social classes, spent their nonschool time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last study in 1981, sandlots have become condominiums
and soccer leagues have boomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of time children spend in organized sports, such as
soccer, including travel time, increased overall by 50 percent,''
said sociologist Sandra Hofferth, who conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   Kids also are spending more time in school. Their free time has
declined from 40 percent of the day to 25 percent, much of it spent
watching television. The time spent in old-fashioned, unstructured
play has declined by about 30 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   Touch football, tag, board games, building forts and fooling
around are becoming lost arts.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are as pressured as their parents. They're in a rat race,
especially on weekends, when they race around in jerseys emblazoned
with the names of local merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents, I think, are over-involved with their children,''
said Madeline Levine. ``I write a lot about how play is the work of
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine is a child psychologist in Marin County, Calif., and
author of ``See No Evil,'' a book about children and television
violence.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd. Americans let children watch all kinds of mayhem on
television, but don't let them play by themselves. Levine finds
that children with lives over-organized by adults tend to become
passive and unmotivated. The transition from childhood to
adolescence, and from play to work, becomes very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, children with hectic schedules become teen-agers
with nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think teen-agers have a role. They're not needed,''
Levine said. ``I had a kid (as a patient) from a wealthy family and
I suggested he get a job. He said, `I'm not going to go to work at
McDonald's for chump change.'''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I might have exaggerated by saying that soccer destroys
childhood. Maybe kids survive anything, even the rich kids who
never played anything without a coach, and have lives unsullied by
work until they graduate from the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't know how they'll support us when we get old.
</P>
<P>
   As all adults know, their generation grew up the right way. We
baby boomers learned how to play hard and work hard _ or play hard
at working anyway.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a kid, six of us could play baseball in our
neighborhood vacant lot and get hundreds of at-bats, instead of the
four at-bats a kid might get in Little League. We'd go rowing on
our small, brackish river, and it was the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally got around to playing my first organized sport,
high school baseball, my parents didn't feel obliged to come and
watch. That was good. I would have dropped even more fly balls in
right field.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I didn't learn how to play ball all that well in the
vacant lot. But I got to play.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we all had paper routes and mowed lawns. As
teen-agers we were forced to have summer jobs for our own good.
Summer jobs built character. Right. They kept us from getting into
trouble at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather made me putty windows in the skylights of his
cotton mill for $44 a week. The phrase ``chump change'' wasn't
invented then, and we'd never heard of McDonald's. Yes, those were
primitive times when we had to eat hamburgers made of real meat.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to tell you that life was tough when I was a kid, but
it wasn't. We didn't turn out all that good, either. We later tried
to overthrow the government, some of us as radical students, and
some of us as Gingrich Republicans. We all failed.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but we had a grand time, even though I had to listen to my
grandfather talk about having to go to work in the mills when he
was 8. That was a really over-organized childhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, adults will torture children with stories of
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you have it tough. Why, when I was a kid, my mom and
dad made us put on funny shorts and run around kicking each other
in the shins ...''

PARTISANSHIP ON IMPEACHMENT WOULD LEAVE BITTER LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Without question, the best aspect of last week's
impeachment hearings in the House Judiciary Committee was that
television coverage gave all Americans the opportunity to watch it
from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   The people could get a crack at what happened without the pluses
or minuses that come from having the information refracted through
the news media's prisms.
</P>
<P>
   Extracting the full benefit required sitting through 10 hours or
more of questions and answers that quickly became predictable.
Nevertheless, rewards were there for those who had the time and
patience.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings underscored what already had been plain to see.
This impeachment process is a strictly party-line affair.
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's two-hour direct presentation
and his interminable responses to invariably challenging questions
provided the public a long look at the man whose investigation has
dominated the national agenda for so long.
</P>
<P>
   It is not likely that Starr's appearance in such a public forum
changed a lot of minds. Republicans undoubtedly believe that his
testimony raised his public credibility, which opinion polls
consistently have shown to be extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, will point to his frequently
meandering responses as reflecting evasion and obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   But what was inescapably beyond dispute was the hearing's stark
partisanship. All Republicans defended the independent counsel and
attacked President Clinton. All Democrats attacked Starr, without,
however, spending time defending the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side chose to use the hours of testimony to explore the
legal validity of the charges against the president to determine
whether they constituted offenses meriting impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most interesting was the revelation that Starr had concluded a
long time ago that his lengthy investigations of Whitewater,
Travelgate and Filegate did not warrant any charges against the
president. As the Democrats gleefully pointed out more than once,
Starr, a supposedly independent prosecutor, withheld those findings
from the public until after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   So the elected representatives of the American people,
considering impeachment, are left with Monica Lewinsky and nothing
but.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's Republicans relentlessly depicted Bill Clinton's
actions in trying to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky as
qualifying for impeachment. They tried to get Starr to testify that
some of Clinton's behavior constituted bribery, which could be
impeachable. But the independent counsel carefully skirted saying
that himself, obviously pleased that his questioners nevertheless
persisted with their implications.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, with the Republicans' iteration that Clinton committed
perjury before the grand jury. Time and again, Starr meticulously
walked around that allegation, saying instead that the president
lied under oath, which in legal terms is a distinction with a real
difference. But Starr did not seem unhappy as his GOP questioners
played the game of equating the two offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In all those hours of statements, questions and answers, much
was said about perjury before the grand jury, but nothing, or
almost nothing, about what constituted that perjury. That seems to
the crux of the case against Clinton, seeing that he has admitted
an inappropriate relationship with the White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   It is now obvious that if the Republicans on the committee get
to have their way, they will vote for articles of impeachment. In
all likelihood, all committee Republicans will vote for the
articles and all the Democrats against.
</P>
<P>
   The entire House of Representatives, in another clearly partisan
vote, could send the articles of impeachment for trial in the
Senate. The election returns suggest that the Republican leadership
is inclined to seek another solution, seeing that public opinion
has already punished the party for pushing impeachment and not
permitting the nation ``to put the matter behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   But that could change if the blood of partisanship is up and
Starr's performance energizes the hard-core ideologues in their
impeachment drive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the odds are the president would not be
convicted, again along party lines. And that underscores what has
been wrong from the beginning. The charges against Clinton have
been immersed in political partiality. No impeachment should
succeed as a partisan venture. A president should be removed from
office only when there is broad political support, across party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   A strict party-line vote will not be accepted by the people and
would leave a bitter legacy undermining the presidency and the
people's confidence in their government.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-CRYSTALS (Undated) _ A team of physicists has found evidence
that a new kind of atomic jigsaw puzzle, in which the puzzle pieces
are allowed to overlap each other to form complex structures, may
explain why a peculiar class of compounds exists in defiance of
long established geometric rules. Their demonstration, reported
this month in the journal Nature, strengthens a theory that was
dismissed as nonsense when it was announced 14 years ago. By
Malcolm Browne. (1275 words)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRIEF-THEARPY (Undated) _ The increasing use of brief

</P>
<P>
   SCI-HUBBLE-GALAXIES (Undated) _ A new astronomical core sample

Noble Wilford. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TEACHING-EVOLUTON (Undated) _ The unrelenting push to teach
creationism played a huge role at the National Association of
Biology Teachers, where members recently launched a high profile
effort to change the way Americans view evolution. In surveys,
roughly half of Americans reject the basic tenets of evolution. The
biology teachers want to change that by putting evolution at the
center of teaching about science. By Jon Christensen. (1700 words)
</P>

   SCI-WATCH (UNdated) _ Shorts on science: Iron in plankton, an
environmentally safe dyeing technique from medieval times and a

   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENDER-DIFFERENCES (UNdated) _ For our children, the
categorical distinctions we make between male and female remain
inviolate, more so, in a sense, than ever before. After a brief
period in the 1970s and early 1980s of questioning infant apartheid
by pink and blue, the world has ''rediscovered'' just how different
boys and girls really are. And if you're a parent, you can't get
away from the drumbeat of La Difference. By Natalie Angier. (1500
words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH &AMP; FITNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Since the mid-1960s, the average
annual intake of added sugars has increased by about 24 pounds, for
a grand total of 152 pounds a year, even as artificial sweeteners
were rising in popularity. That's a whopping 760 calories a day of
added sugars that are expanding American waistlines and crowding
out far more nutritious and less calorically dense foods. To make
matters worse, there is growing evidence that the overly sweetened
American diet is contributing directly to such health problems as
heart disease and diabetes. By Jane E. Brody. (1220 words)

new numbers showing significant increases in incidence of AIDS
worldwide. By Lawrence K. Altman. (650 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-ACTIVE-SEX (Undated) _ As AIDS changes from an
inevitably fatal condition to one people can live with for years,
patients are struggling to readjust _ and doctors are, too. The
fast-paced tragedy and heroics of dealing with catastrophic illness
are fading from their workdays, which are filling instead with the
less dramatic but often far more difficult tasks of helping
patients with a chronic but treatable illness craft normal lives.
And integrating sexual activity into those lives is probably the
most complex job of all, for patients and doctors alike. By Abigail
Zuger, M.D. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health:
</P>
<P>
   _ In any 24-hour period, married women are 50 percent more
likely to complain of being in a bad mood than their y-chromosomed
counterparts, says a study in which 166 middle-class couples
maintained a diary of their emotions for 42 days. The reason:
Because married women juggle several roles, they have more
opportunities for problems to occur, explained co-author Dr. Ronald
C. Kessler, a sociologist in the department of health care policy
at Harvard Medical School. (330 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ It seems that sometimes even doctors refer to a higher
authority. Eighty percent of 438 family physicians who participated
in a University of Kansas survey say that at one time or another
they have advised their patients to seek religious counsel. Given
recent studies that have linked spirituality and prayer with good
health, the researchers set out to identify how often and under
what circumstances physicians refer their patients to pastoral
care. The findings were published in the current issue of the
Archives of Family Medicine. (330 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Pro and Con: Should babies be breast-fed for at least one year
and beyond ``for as long as mutually desired,'' as a major
pediatric group recommends? (335 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Indiana research indicates that not only do people talk with
their hands, they also think with them. (250 words)
</P>

   SCI-FITNESS-SURF (Undated) _ A woman over 40 shares her
experiences at surf camp, where she aced out all but on of the
20-year-olds in a week-long intensive training program. By Louise
Rafkin. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MINI-MED-SCHOOLS (Undated) _ Mini medical schools, community
education programs offered by medical schools and biomedical
research institutions to give laypeople insight into the world of
medicine, are drawing crowds all over the country. In New York,
2,200 people vie for the 600 seats available each night. In Denver
it sells out every year. On eight consecutive Tuesdays this fall,
over 500 people attended the mini medical school at Emory
University to listen to lectures by medical school professors on
topics such as the mind, the musculoskeletal system, and cancer. By
Christine Day. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SIDS (Washington) _ Scientists have begun to find real clues
to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a medical condition that has
killed millions of apparently healthy infants while leaving no
detectable trace. By Holcomb B. Noble. (500 words)

MONICA LEWINSKY IS MORE VICTIM THAN VIXEN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The question came from an old college pal who
knew me in my nascent days of organized feminism.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Chelsea, I think the most wronged person in the Clinton
scandal has been Monica Lewinsky,'' he said. ``Have you written
about that? I haven't seen any strong feminist essays in her
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   I told my friend that this might be because official feminist
voices have been kept busy trying to articulate the difference
between their support of Bill Clinton's public policies and their
condemnation of Clarence Thomas. But the more I thought about his
question, the more I realized that a clear, impassioned feminist
cry for Monica is no easy feat.
</P>
<P>
   This is not because the former White House intern isn't a victim
deserving of pity and possibly outrage. Rather, it is because she
is the victim of a diverse set of forces, only one of which fits
the classic ``sexism'' category.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: Overtly sexual, promiscuous females have never
engendered much public sympathy. (Unless, like Marilyn Monroe, they
kill themselves.) The times we live in are especially dismissive
and unforgiving of the complex realities of all human sexuality. As
usual, it's worse for women.
</P>
<P>
   Already a borderline cartoon character in American consciousness
_ since January, she has been the target of dirty jokes and
personal slurs _ Lewinsky achieved full cartoon status with her
grand jury testimony. Once it became clear that she was not a
sexual victim, she was labelled a sexual predator and lost her last
slim hope for public compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually experienced at 21 and ``the other woman'' in a previous
extramarital affair, she had vowed to go to Washington and win her
``presidential kneepads.'' In a mere eight months, thanks to thong
underwear, Clinton's sexual Achilles' heel and her own intrepid
nature, Lewinsky made good on her promise.
</P>
<P>
   By the time millions heard her actual voice this past week on
Linda Tripp's secret tapes, she had been stripped of her humanity.
Typical of the coverage was a caption in the San Francisco
Examiner: ``Monica Lewinsky: She talks, cries, coos.''
</P>
<P>
   From the evidence of her 25-year-old life, a case could be made
that Monica Lewinsky is a victim of several other phenomena: A
selfish, ugly, hate-filled divorce by her parents. A childhood and
adolescence in which her family's primary religion appears to have
been the acquisition of expensive things. Ineffectual psychotherapy
_ her parents' divorce documents reveal that Monica, her brother
and mother averaged $1,120 a month in shrink bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is also a victim of the ego-centric myopia that tends
to inflict sex-hungry men and render them incapable of
distinguishing a vixen from a troubled young soul.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of these destructive forces comes close in virulence to
the three-headed monster that is Kenneth Starr, Congress and the
news media. Together _ for individual, customized gain _ they
entrapped, intimidated, exploited, humiliated and damaged one
already screwed-up young lady.
</P>
<P>
   Although we do not yet know the dates of Monica Lewinsky's
menstrual cycle or what words she is inclined to utter upon orgasm,
that is about all we don't know about her. Never before in history
have so many people so invaded the privacy of one ordinary citizen.
I say ordinary because she has never run for or held public office,
never acted in a movie, written a novel, sung or played sports in
an outdoor arena or managed to get herself arrested for a
misdemeanor, let alone a felony.
</P>
<P>
   All Lewinsky did to ``deserve'' hideous national scrutiny and
cruel objectification was to engage in a very one-sided affair with
the wrong married man and blab about it to the wrong friend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a British publisher confirmed that Lewinsky finally
has agreed to do a book with Princess Diana's biographer, Andrew
Morton. It will net her a minimum of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   I say that's the least she has coming to her. No amount of money
can buy back what has been taken forever from Monica Lewinsky: the
chance to work out her personal problems in privacy and lead a
half-way normal life. I say this as a feminist, a woman and a plain
old human being.

<P>
   When leaf-peeping northeasterners begin retiring their
binoculars for the year, Hawaii residents start dusting theirs off.
November opens the unofficial season of rubbernecking, a time when
migrating whales and big-wave riders turn the ocean into the site
of the islands' favorite spectator sports.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the economy and the weather, the humpback whales can be
counted on. They return in late November and stay until April or
May, breaching, spouting, mating and calving spectacularly in the
island waters that serve as their refuge from the icy ones they
have left behind in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   As for surfing, winter is its zenith, a time when ``pray for
surf'' is the prevailing mantra and waves aren't big unless they're
15 feet or higher. On the north shore of Oahu, the coastline
becomes theater: no wave is too large for the world's most daring
and accomplished surfers, who look like specks in the winter swell.
</P>
<P>
   These attractions are free, a considerable plus in a state
reeling with economic woes. The disappearance of Japanese
investment and the decline in tourism have come on the heels of
widespread plantation shutdowns, calling upon the adaptive spirit
of Hawaii's people.
</P>
<P>
   Attractive rates in hotel, air fare and travel packages can be
found in November and the first three weeks of December. In this
shoulder season (high season begins around Christmas and lasts
until mid-April), the islands are less crowded and the weather, as
in late spring, is at its best, averaging in the mid-70s _ although
several degrees warmer on the Kona-Kohala coast.
</P>
<P>
   With events from ``The Nutcracker'' to the Hawaii International
Film Festival, culture addicts, like surfers and luau aficionados,
have a full plate in the weeks to come.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Josef Albers, Sol Lewitt, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Frank
Stella, Richard Diebenkorn, Roy Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg
are among the 40 artists represented in ``First Decade: Highlights
from the Contemporary Museum's Collection,'' which runs through
Jan. 3 at the Contemporary Museum, 2411 Makiki Heights Drive,
Honolulu. Robert Motherwell's ``Elegy With Rice Paper and Blue,''
from his series ``Elegies to the Spanish Republic,'' is among the
works not previously shown here.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is set in a garden in the hills overlooking the city.
Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission: $5. (808)
526-0232.
</P>
<P>
   A storm in the Aleutians would be great news for big-wave riders
and spectators hoping for epic El Nino-generated surf at this
year's Vans G-Shock Triple Crown of Surfing Series, from Nov. 5
through Dec. 20 at Haleiwa Beach, Sunset, and Pipeline on Oahu's
North Shore. Top professional surfers will compete for $1 million

the American Ballet Theater. Admission: $15 to $35; (808) 591-2211.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good timing, powerful binoculars and quick reflexes (to pull
over if you're driving, or to drop whatever you're doing if you're
not) are useful when humpbacks appear, most reliably along the west
and south Maui shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable vantage points along the west shore include Pap awai
Point, McGregor Point scenic overlook, Launiupoko State Wayside and
Wahikuli State Wayside; on the south shore, Wailea Beach Park and
the dining rooms of the deluxe Wailea resorts. On Oahu, Makapuu
Point, Waikiki and the Kaena Point Trail on the leeward coastline
can be center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Whale Foundation, 101 North Kihei Road, supports its
research with daily whale-watching cruises beginning Dec. 1 on
Maui, $22 to $31; (800) 942-5311.
</P>
<P>
   At the Maui Ocean Center, a new five-acre marine park at 192
Maalaea Road, life-size whale models are part of the 60 exhibits.
Jaws drop during shark feeding and in the 54-foot walk-through
tunnel aquarium. Admission: $17.50, $12 for children; open daily 9
a.m. to 5 p.m., (808) 270-7000.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of a 22.5-mile network of ditches, flumes and tunnels
built in 1906 to irrigate sugar plantations have been transformed
into an easy, meandering waterway for kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   Guides with the Kohala Mountain Kayak Cruise explain the
region's history while gliding in the narrow outdoor flumes that
traverse rain forest and stands of wild ginger. Headquarters are in
Hawi, at the junction of Highways 270 and 250. Cost for the
75-minute paddle: $75, $55 ages 5 to 18; (808) 889-6922.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Lahaina Luau on Maui _ in moving to a larger oceanfront
site, 1251 Front St. in Lahaina six months ago _ has reinvented
itself authentically in a genre rife with cliche.
</P>
<P>
   At sunset, guests sit at tables or on lauhala fiber mats on the
ground in front of a grass-mound stage. The program offers
intelligent narration and excellent ancient hula (the absence of
fire dancing is noted but not lamented). There are no watered-down
mai tais and, like the atmosphere, the food is authentic Hawaiian,
and delicious. Admission: $65, $30 for children; (808) 667-1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Oahu, Pearl Harbor's newest resident, the 887-foot Missouri,
where Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender, is being
scrubbed, buffed and prepared for its opening in January as a
national memorial and museum. It is moored near the Arizona, sunk
during the Pearl Harbor attack. Guided tours will be $14; (808)
545-2263.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new Waimea Brewing Company, at Waimea Plantation Cottages,
9400 Kaumualii Highway, Waimea, may seem out of character in a
retro-historic plantation village, but in the dusty, dry plains of
this west Kauai town, there's something to be said for cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   The 48 authentic plantation cottages from the early 1900s were
moved from a nearby plantation and faithfully restored and equipped
with verandas and full kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   For those heading for the Waimea Canyon and Kokee State Park,
this is the last hostelry before the 4,000-foot ascent. Rates: $170
to $500; (808) 338-1625, fax (808) 338-2338.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hana coast in east Maui, a three-hour drive from Kahului
Airport, the once musty Heavenly Hana Inn, 4155 Hana Highway,
reopened in June behind its signature bamboo gate as a sleek,
stunning Japanese-style hostelry of three suites under one roof but
each with separate entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Lush gardens surround the studio and suites and the grand dining
room, featuring exotic woods and impressive craftsmanship. Rates:
$100 to $235; (808) 248-8442.
</P>
<P>
   Shipman House Bed and Breakfast Inn, 131 Kaiulani St., Hilo, on
the Big Island, won the 1998 Historic Preservation Award from the
Historic Hawaii Foundation. It recently completed the renovation of
its conservatory, which will serve as the meeting room in this
100-year-old Victorian mansion. Rates in the three rooms and a
guest cottage with two units are $130 to $150; (800) 627-8447, fax
(808) 934-8002.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Scarcely a year old, the Old Wailuku Inn at Ulupono,
2199 Kahookele Street, Wailuku, helps make central Maui a viable
destination on this shoreline-crazy island. Situated near Iao
Valley, the Hawaii Nature Center, a block of antiques shops, and
mom-and-pop restaurants, this two-story, seven-room inn, built in
1924, is filled with vintage Hawaiiana. Notable features include
the original ohia and eucalyptus floors. Rates: $120 to $180; (808)
244-5897, fax (808) 242-9600.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: With lava from an 1801 flow as its foundation, it was no
surprise that Hualalai Resort, Kaahumanu Highway, Kaupulehu, Kona,
on the Big Island, which contains the 243-room Four Seasons Resort
Hualalai, has added hot stone therapy to its spa offerings. Smooth
stream rocks are heated and placed on massage points.
</P>
<P>
   The low-rise, bungalow-style resort's educational programs for
guests, including celestial navigation, are firmly anchored in
Hawaiian culture. Room-car or room-breakfast packages are available
for $390 to $930; (808) 325-8000, fax (808) 325-8100.
</P>
<P>
   With all 191 guest rooms and three suites fully renovated last
fall, Kapalua Bay Hotel, 1 Bay Drive, Kapalua, Maui, has awakened
from a long slumber. Eco-tourists love the hiking and environmental
programs of the Kapalua Nature Society, based in this quietly
luxurious resort. Rates from $275; (800) 367-8000, fax (808)
669-4694.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those expecting attitude at the newly opened Neiman Marcus
restaurant, Mariposa, 1450 Ala Moana Blvd., Honolulu, will be
pleasantly surprised _ efforts to integrate casualness with fine
dining have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Lanai seating offers great views of park and beach, and the

</P>
<P>
   Hoku's at the Kahala Mandarin Oriental Hotel, 5000 Kahala Ave.,

Wayne Hirabayashi, formerly of the Halekulani Hotel.
</P>
<P>

misoyaki vegetables with taro gnocchi and deep-fried whole island
fish. Dinner for two with wine, $130; (808) 739-8777.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a stellar lobster season on the north shore of
Kauai, where Roadrunner Bakery and Cafe, 2430 Oka St., Kilauea,
also features organic local vegetables, 30 types of chilies, and
pork, fish and free-range chicken. Lobster fajitas ($16.95) and
tacos prove that lobsters can be fresh, good and cheap. Dinner for
two (bring your own wine) is about $35; (808) 828-8226.
</P>
<P>
   Sansei Seafood Restaurant and Sushi Bar, 115 Bay Drive, Kapalua,
Maui, has turned the formerly moribund Kapalua Shops into a

669-6286.

   The new Waimea Brewing Company, at Waimea Plantation Cottages,
9400 Kaumualii Highway, Waimea, may seem out of character in a
retro-historic plantation village, but in the dusty, dry plains of
this west Kauai town, there's something to be said for cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   The 48 authentic plantation cottages from the early 1900s were
moved from a nearby plantation and faithfully restored and equipped
with verandas and full kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   For those heading for the Waimea Canyon and Kokee State Park,
this is the last hostelry before the 4,000-foot ascent. Rates: $170
to $500; (808) 338-1625, fax (808) 338-2338.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hana coast in east Maui, a three-hour drive from Kahului
Airport, the once musty Heavenly Hana Inn, 4155 Hana Highway,
reopened in June behind its signature bamboo gate as a sleek,
stunning Japanese-style hostelry of three suites under one roof but
each with separate entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Lush gardens surround the studio and suites and the grand dining
room, featuring exotic woods and impressive craftsmanship. Rates:
$100 to $235; (808) 248-8442.

   Shipman House Bed and Breakfast Inn, 131 Kaiulani St., Hilo, on
the Big Island, won the 1998 Historic Preservation Award from the
Historic Hawaii Foundation. It recently completed the renovation of
its conservatory, which will serve as the meeting room in this
100-year-old Victorian mansion. Rates in the three rooms and a
guest cottage with two units are $130 to $150; (800) 627-8447, fax
(808) 934-8002.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Scarcely a year old, the Old Wailuku Inn at Ulupono,
2199 Kahookele Street, Wailuku, helps make central Maui a viable
destination on this shoreline-crazy island. Situated near Iao
Valley, the Hawaii Nature Center, a block of antiques shops, and
mom-and-pop restaurants, this two-story, seven-room inn, built in
1924, is filled with vintage Hawaiiana. Notable features include
the original ohia and eucalyptus floors. Rates: $120 to $180; (808)
244-5897, fax (808) 242-9600.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: With lava from an 1801 flow as its foundation, it was no
surprise that Hualalai Resort, Kaahumanu Highway, Kaupulehu, Kona,
on the Big Island, which contains the 243-room Four Seasons Resort
Hualalai, has added hot stone therapy to its spa offerings. Smooth
stream rocks are heated and placed on massage points.
</P>
<P>
   The low-rise, bungalow-style resort's educational programs for
guests, including celestial navigation, are firmly anchored in
Hawaiian culture. Room-car or room-breakfast packages are available
for $390 to $930; (808) 325-8000, fax (808) 325-8100.
</P>
<P>
   With all 191 guest rooms and three suites fully renovated last
fall, Kapalua Bay Hotel, 1 Bay Drive, Kapalua, Maui, has awakened
from a long slumber. Eco-tourists love the hiking and environmental
programs of the Kapalua Nature Society, based in this quietly
luxurious resort. Rates from $275; (800) 367-8000, fax (808)
669-4694.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those expecting attitude at the newly opened Neiman Marcus
restaurant, Mariposa, 1450 Ala Moana Blvd., Honolulu, will be
pleasantly surprised _ efforts to integrate casualness with fine
dining have succeeded.

   Lanai seating offers great views of park and beach, and the
American and regional menu highlights local ingredients. The
excellent wine list (38 by the glass) has good prices. Dinner for

</P>
<P>
   Hoku's at the Kahala Mandarin Oriental Hotel, 5000 Kahala Ave.,

formerly of the Regent Hotel in Hong Kong, and executive sous-chef
Wayne Hirabayashi, formerly of the Halekulani Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   They have been luring new diners to the elegant ocean-view
dining room, and keeping the faithful, with favorites like grilled
misoyaki vegetables with taro gnocchi and deep-fried whole island
fish. Dinner for two with wine, $130; (808) 739-8777.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a stellar lobster season on the north shore of
Kauai, where Roadrunner Bakery and Cafe, 2430 Oka St., Kilauea,
also features organic local vegetables, 30 types of chilies, and
pork, fish and free-range chicken. Lobster fajitas ($16.95) and
tacos prove that lobsters can be fresh, good and cheap. Dinner for
two (bring your own wine) is about $35; (808) 828-8226.
</P>
<P>
   Sansei Seafood Restaurant and Sushi Bar, 115 Bay Drive, Kapalua,
Maui, has turned the formerly moribund Kapalua Shops into a
culinary hot spot. Dishes include Asian rock shrimp cake,
shrimp-nori ravioli and tradition-defying sushi with tangy sauces
and unorthodox pairings. Dinner for two with sake, about $50; (808)
669-6286.

<P>
   Santa Claus, the most famous of all mature travelers, is getting
ready to load his sleigh for his annual jaunt. He's asked us to
help out by answering the one question he hears so often at this
time of year: What would be the perfect holiday present for my Mom
and Dad, who love to travel?
</P>
<P>
   Consider these gift suggestions for mature travelers in your
household _ not only for Christmas but for all those other
gift-giving occasions throughout the year, from birthdays to
anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The gift of a trip is special in itself, but you can always
enhance any excursion that your mature travelers will be taking by
adding thoughtful extras. If they're on a cruise, consider buying
them wine each night to go with dinner. Or pop for a wedding-vow
renewal package for up to $400, depending on the amenities you
select.
</P>
<P>
   If Hawaii or Alaska is their chosen destination, just as it is
for so many mature travelers, underwrite the cost of a helicopter
flight over the volcanoes in Hawaii or to the Mendenhall Glacier in
Juneau, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground you can see the creeping lava on the Big Island of
Hawaii, but from the air you can see INTO the crater. And you can
actually touch down atop the Mendenhall Glacier and walk around on
5,000-year-old ice. Such helicopter trips usually cost $120 to $150
per person.
</P>
<P>
   If your travelers are headed for England, give them a day-trip
on the historic Venice-Simplon Orient Express, (800) 524-2420, from
Victoria Station to Folkestone and back for $250.
</P>
<P>
   They will experience the true meaning of elegant, Old World
travel as they board the restored Orient Express, enjoy lunch or
afternoon tea and watch the British countryside roll by.
</P>
<P>
   You can always cater to your travelers' special interests _ and
there is a host of special interests that go well with travel.
Golf, scuba or ski lessons at their vacation destinations would be
highly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Golf lessons from John Jacobs' Golf Clinics, (800) 472-5007,
include a 10 percent senior discount at many of the branches. How
about tickets to a senior golf tournament? The Senior Skins Game is
held at the end of each January at the Mauna Lani Resort, (808)
885-6655, on the island of Hawaii. A three-day ticket purchased
before Jan. 1 costs around $80, or $100 if bought closer to the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to theatrical performances where the marquees gleam _
like Dublin, London, New York or Toronto _ will enhance anyone's
visit to a big city.
</P>
<P>
   City passes are another way to make sure your travelers can see
as much as they want for one small price. City passes in Boston
($20.50), New York ($18), San Francisco ($19.95) and Seattle
($19.25) include senior discounts in their pricing and can be
purchased at visitor centers, leading museums, attractions or
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   If pampering your parents tops your agenda, think about gifts
from a spa. With spas now an integral part of many cruise ships and
resort destinations, it's easy to get a gift certificate for a
massage, wrap, aroma therapy or facial.
</P>
<P>
   To shop for these kinds of extras, a call to the cruse line, spa
or travel agent handling the traveler's arrangements takes minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to indulge a loved one is to give the gift
of peace of mind by purchasing travel insurance for their next trip
to cover trip cancellation and, more importantly, medical
emergencies. Prices will vary, depending on the price of the trip
being insured, but the average is around 5 percent of the tour
price.
</P>
<P>
   Discounts that make travel dollars go farther come in all
shapes, sizes and prices. Entertainment Publications, (800)
445-4137, publishes directories of hotel/restaurant discounts that
range from 20 percent to 50 percent off regular rates for specific
regions and areas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the National Hotel and Dining Directory ($44.95)
lists 2,000 restaurants and 3,500 lodging establishments that offer
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   A membership in Hilton Hotels' Senior HHonors Club, (800)
432-3600, costs $55 a year or $290 for a lifetime, supplies
discounts of up to 50 percent at all Hiltons and includes perks
such as car rentals and restaurant discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Do Mom and Dad like to ski? Place a call to the Over The Hill
Gang, (719) 389-0022, a group that specializes in hunting down
discounts for skiers ages 50 and older at both ski and non-ski
destinations. A one-year membership costs $65 per couple, $40 per
individual.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines' special coupon books for airfare discounts that range
in price from $548 to $596 can be purchased through a travel agent
or from the airline with the best service from your mature
traveler's home airport.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in United's Silver Wings Plus Travel Club, (800)
720-1765, costs $75 for two years and $225 for a lifetime
membership that results in great value travel packages and member
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If your mature travelers like to take treks in their RV,
consider buying them a KOA Value Card, (406) 248-7444, that costs
just $10 and provides 10 percent discounts for stays at KOA
Kampgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   A gift certificate for a travel package at a national park
enables your travelers to see the beauty of America's rugged
landscape while enjoying the comforts of some romantic extras. For
example, the Romance Package at Grand Canyon National Park combines
one night at the El Tovar Hotel (a Grand Canyon crown jewel) with a
bottle of El Tovar wine, a fruit basket and a champagne dinner for
two for $249 plus tax.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations for this or other packages to national parks can be
made by calling (303) 297-2757, the Amfac reservations number. You
can do some on-line shopping at www.amfac.com.
</P>
<P>
   And being mature travelers ourselves, we feel comfortable saying
your Mom and Dad's eyesight probably ain't what it used to be:
Think about stuffing their Christmas stockings with an atlas that
has reasonably easy-to-read type _ both on the maps and in the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   One such atlas that is better than most is ``Rand McNally's
Easy-to-Read Travel Atlas'' ($9.95 in most bookstores), which
features maps that are about 40 percent larger than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is that the map's index is right beside the map so
you don't have to flip back and forth in the book. There are fewer
listings per state to make up the space, but it's so easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for other stocking stuffers, consider a
telephone card in any denomination that matches your pocketbook.
They are wonderful to use in overseas phone booths and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   One of our favorite travel accessories is an inflatable pillow
that fits around the neck. The Cloud-Soft inflatable pillow from
Magellan's, (800) 962-4943, provides an extra measure of comfort on
a plane or motorcoach and costs only $9.85 plus shipping.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to books for travelers, we always recommend those
that set the scenes they'll be visiting. For example, ``Undaunted
Courage'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1996), by Stephen Ambrose, about the
Lewis &AMP; Clark expedition, is an easy read, yet it provides historic
insights into areas that visitors now explore as they follow the
famous paths of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Other good tomes: ``A Year in Provence'' (Knopf, 1990) by Peter
Mayle, or ``Midnight In The Garden of Good and Evil'' (Random
House, 1994) by John Berendt. Any of Tony Hillerman's works give a
new appreciation for New Mexico and its culture.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for a guidebook, check the copyright date to make
sure it's reasonably current. One of our favorite series is the
``Eyewitness Travel Guides,'' which feature many helpful graphics,
from charts and maps to photos and cutaways.
</P>
<P>
   So now you know what to tell Santa when he asks for gift ideas
for the mature traveler.

 &HT;    New Year's Eve, 1998? Think of it as practice.
 &HT;    Most serious party lovers already have their eyes on the bash of
the century, Dec. 31, 1999. Many of them have already made their
plans, and plenty of hotels have been booked for ages.
 &HT;    But for travelers who haven't decided what to do, here's a
selection of travel-related parties that should make it easy to
welcome in the millennium with a bang. Prices are based on
double-occupancy unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;    The Big Apple looms large for party-goers on the ultimate New
Year's Eve, and the Rhiga Royal Hotel (151 West 54th St., New York,
N.Y. 10019; 800-937-5454) has a deal for couples from Dec. 31 to
Jan. 2, 1999.
 &HT;    Chauffeur-driven limousine transportation brings guests to one
of the hotel's Grand Royal Penthouse suites that overlook Central
Park and the Hudson River.
 &HT;    On New Year's Eve, each couple is brought by limousine to the
Rainbow Room to ring in the millennium with a dinner dance. New
Year's Day starts with breakfast en-suite and continues with a
Broadway show of the couple's choice.
 &HT;    The final day brings brunch and the bill _ just $10,000 per
couple.
 &HT;    Down in the Caribbean, the Bitter End Yacht Club (North Sound,
Virgin Gorda, BVI; 800-872-2392) has cozy hillside and beachfront
villas, a sailing school and a recipe for a party.
 &HT;    The BEYC 2000 Celebration is a 10-day package that includes a
millennium bash with 15 different bands from Virgin Gorda playing a
12-hour session on New Year's Eve. The partying will take place on
shore and on boats, with a fireworks display at midnight.
 &HT;    The package includes accommodations, transfers, all meals,
beverages, use of boats, all entertainment and theme dinners. The
cost is $10,800 per couple, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    Perhaps the tranquility of the English countryside beckons on
this special New Year's? The Lygon Arms (High Street, Broadway,
WR12 7DU, England; 800-63-SAVOY), located in the Cotswolds, has a
three-night package that will mark the millennium as well as its
own 500 year anniversary.
 &HT;    The millennium package at this Savoy Group hotel includes a
helicopter tour of the Cotswolds, a New Year's Eve ball and the
services of both a graphologist and a psychic on New Year's Day to
help everyone peer a little bit farther into the future.
 &HT;    Accommodations and most meals are included in the price, which
is $1,411 per person.
 &HT;    The Broadmoor (Box 1439, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80901;
800-634-7711) which dates from 1918, is one of the grandest hotels
in the West.
 &HT;    This Rocky Mountain treasure will have ``A Celebration of the
Centuries,'' an all-inclusive weekend party that offers activities
ranging from a dinner dance to a New Year's Eve show with
Bernadette Peters and the Temptations.
 &HT;    New Year's Day will feature Bloody Mary ``First Aid Stations.''
Such classic Colorado pleasures as horse-drawn sleigh-and-carriage
rides will be available during the quieter moments. The cost starts
at $2,500 per person.
 &HT;    Both Royal Caribbean International (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami,
Fla. 33132; 800-327-6700) and Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean
Way, Miami, Fla. 33132; 800-437-3111) have announced ambitious
millennium plans for cruisers.
 &HT;    For example, Royal Caribbean's ``Voyager of the Seas,''
``Enchantment of the Seas,'' ``Grandeur of the Seas,'' ``Sovereign
of the Seas'' and Celebrity's ``Century'' will convene at midnight
on New Year's Eve off Coco Cay in the Bahamas for a fireworks
display in the midst of individual millennium itineraries. Contact
a travel agent or cruise-only agent for prices.
 &HT;    The Ritz-Carlton (3414 Peachtree Road N.E., Suite 300, Atlanta
Ga. 30326; 800-241-3333) has the Ultimate Experience. Reserved for
just one couple at each of the Ritz-Carlton hotels, the package
includes three nights in the Ritz Carlton Suite, the premier suite
in each hotel, which includes a private dining room and butler.
 &HT;    Men receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Chronograph while ladies
receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Quadrato.
 &HT;    The two lucky guests also receive a magnum of Taittinger
champagne, two Baccarat flutes, limousine transfers and a Jaguar at
their disposal all weekend. All meals and parties are included.
 &HT;    For example, conductor Peter Duchin will be on hand at the
Ritz-Carlton, Boston, while Lou Rawls will hold court at The
Ritz-Carlton, Naples (Fla.).
 &HT;    The price for the Ultimate Experience is $100,000 per couple.
For those who aren't prepared to part with that kind of change,
there are packages with three-night minimum stays that start at
$450 per room, per night. Contact Ritz-Carlton for a Millennium
Experience brochure.
 &HT;    Finally, for those who absolutely must be together with their
closest friends in New York City on New Year's Eve, the Fitzpatrick
Manhattan Hotel (687 Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022;
212-355-0100) is prepared.
 &HT;    This midtown New York hotel with an Irish flavor is offering one
enterprising celebrant and 181 of their closest friends the chance
to take over the entire 17-story hotel for three nights. That's 51
suites and 40 rooms, with a two- person limit per room.
 &HT;    All food, alcohol and entertainment are included, as are a New
York Harbor cruise with a Swing Band on board and a New Year's Eve
extravaganza with a Motown Band and a Medieval Banquet.
 &HT;    The cost? A cool $1 million. Well, it only happens once a
century.

SOME BILLS WELL-INTENTIONED, SOME ARE SILLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At the risk of being overly kind, I am willing
to give most state legislators credit for being well-intentioned
when they file proposed laws. Some of their proposals are even
worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   But we taxpayers could do without most of the 5,000 or more
bills that will be introduced before and during next year's
five-month legislative session. Many will be unneeded. Others will
be misguided, and some will be downright silly.
</P>
<P>
   We already are getting a preview with the bills that lawmakers
started pre-filing the week after Election Day. And, so far, their
offerings are definitely mixed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sillier bills in the early going was offered by state
Rep. Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas. It would require Texas college
athletic teams to wear the state seal on their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   This unnecessary bill may give a few Texas sports fans an extra
shot of pride when they see their state's emblem displayed on
national television. But the proposal _ coming from a Republican,
no less _ certainly flies in the face of the traditional
conservative philosophy that the less the government meddles, the
better.
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, Goolsby pre-filed another bill that was
so controversial that he has already withdrawn it. It would have
required drivers 75 and older to pass a special test to prove they
can still safely operate a car.
</P>
<P>
   Improving traffic safety may be one of those areas in which
government should do more meddling, and special safety tests for
older drivers may be worth some debate. But senior citizens
shouldn't be unfairly singled out without a more comprehensive look
at the overall safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is not clear from state records that older
drivers are involved in a disproportionate number of accidents. And
it is usually not an elderly face that I see (in my rearview
mirror) behind the wheel of the car that is almost on top of my
back bumper when I am driving the speed limit _ or slightly faster
_ in the ``slow'' lane.
</P>
<P>
   Tailgating, speeding and alcohol use by drivers younger than 75
cause more accidents than elderly drivers do, but those problems
are much more difficult _ perhaps impossible _ for the Legislature
to satisfactorily address.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the early legislative wish-list, of course, are
several anti-crime bills, the first of hundreds that are sure to
follow. Crime statistics may be dropping in Texas, but crime, as a
political issue, is about as popular as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Three legislators have even pre-filed bills to require inmates
to pay for at least part of their incarceration expenses. It may be
easier to pass one of those bills than to collect a ``housing''
bill from the indigents that many prisoners are. But the politics
of fighting crime sometimes seeks a reward simply in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   And, you guessed it, some term-limit proposals already have been
pre-filed. The only thing more predictable than the introduction of
measures to limit the number of terms that elected state officials
can serve is that most state officials won't serve enough terms to
reach the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits are essentially unnecessary for state government
offices. They also unnecessarily limit voters' choices. Voters
should be allowed to continue re-electing an officeholder they like
as long as that officeholder wants to seek re-election and can keep
winning their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Washington, where many U.S. senators and members of
Congress have stayed in office for almost forever, only a handful
of Texas legislators remain in office longer than 12 years, which
is the limit proposed in a constitutional amendment pre-filed in
Austin a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The average tenure in the Texas Senate at the beginning of the
1997 session was less than 10 years and in the Texas House, less
than seven years. And several veteran House members voluntarily
didn't seek re-election this year. Even without term limits, most
retirements from the Legislature are voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Also, only a handful of statewide, executive officials in Texas
serve much longer than most lawmakers in any one office. The
longest tenured of the current group, by far, is Garry Mauro, who
will end 16 years as land commissioner after unsuccessfully
challenging Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Both Attorney General Dan Morales and Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock are
voluntarily stepping down after only two, four-year terms in their
current offices, although Bullock had been a fixture in state
government for years in other offices.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now can become one of the longest-serving governors in
Texas history, but only if he completes the second, four-year term
to which he was just elected.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is a big ``if,'' and it has nothing to do with
any term limits bill.

   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-REDWOODS-FOG (Undated) _ More than just picturesque, fog
mixing with redwoods may be key to the well being of these rapidly
disappearing forests and an answer to the long-pondered question:
why are redwoods the tallest trees on earth? (1450 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CRYSTALS (Undated) _ A team of physicists has found evidence
that a new kind of atomic jigsaw puzzle, in which the puzzle pieces
are allowed to overlap each other to form complex structures, may
explain why a peculiar class of compounds exists in defiance of
long established geometric rules. Their demonstration, reported
this month in the journal Nature, strengthens a theory that was
dismissed as nonsense when it was announced 14 years ago. By
Malcolm Browne. (1275 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRIEF-THEARPY (Undated) _ The increasing use of brief
therapy, as opposed to lifetime therapy, is having profound effects
on the field. By Erica Goode. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HUBBLE-GALAXIES (Undated) _ A new astronomical core sample
of the southern sky taken from the Hubble telescope gives
astronomers more spectacular views of galaxies never before seen
and probably new clues to the history of the universe. By John
Noble Wilford. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TEACHING-EVOLUTON (Undated) _ The unrelenting push to teach
creationism played a huge role at the National Association of
Biology Teachers, where members recently launched a high profile
effort to change the way Americans view evolution. In surveys,
roughly half of Americans reject the basic tenets of evolution. The
biology teachers want to change that by putting evolution at the
center of teaching about science. By Jon Christensen. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (UNdated) _ Shorts on science: Iron in plankton, an
environmentally safe dyeing technique from medieval times and a
silicon chip with tastebuds. By Henry Fountain. (515 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CONGRESSMAN-PHYSICIST (Undated) _ Conversation With Rep.
Rush Holt, a freshman congressman from New Jersey who is also a
Princeton physicist. He discusses politics and science. By Claudia
Dreifus. (1360 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENDER-DIFFERENCES (UNdated) _ For our children, the
categorical distinctions we make between male and female remain
inviolate, more so, in a sense, than ever before. After a brief
period in the 1970s and early 1980s of questioning infant apartheid
by pink and blue, the world has ''rediscovered'' just how different
boys and girls really are. And if you're a parent, you can't get
away from the drumbeat of La Difference. By Natalie Angier. (1500
words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH &AMP; FITNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Since the mid-1960s, the average
annual intake of added sugars has increased by about 24 pounds, for
a grand total of 152 pounds a year, even as artificial sweeteners
were rising in popularity. That's a whopping 760 calories a day of
added sugars that are expanding American waistlines and crowding
out far more nutritious and less calorically dense foods. To make
matters worse, there is growing evidence that the overly sweetened
American diet is contributing directly to such health problems as
heart disease and diabetes. By Jane E. Brody. (1220 words)

   SCI-AIDS-RATE (Undated) _ The World Health Organization releases
new numbers showing significant increases in incidence of AIDS
worldwide. By Lawrence K. Altman. (650 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-ACTIVE-SEX (Undated) _ As AIDS changes from an
inevitably fatal condition to one people can live with for years,
patients are struggling to readjust _ and doctors are, too. The
fast-paced tragedy and heroics of dealing with catastrophic illness
are fading from their workdays, which are filling instead with the
less dramatic but often far more difficult tasks of helping
patients with a chronic but treatable illness craft normal lives.
And integrating sexual activity into those lives is probably the
most complex job of all, for patients and doctors alike. By Abigail
Zuger, M.D. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health:
</P>
<P>
   _ It seems that sometimes even doctors refer to a higher
authority. Eighty percent of 438 family physicians who participated
in a University of Kansas survey say that at one time or another
they have advised their patients to seek religious counsel. Given
recent studies that have linked spirituality and prayer with good
health, the researchers set out to identify how often and under
what circumstances physicians refer their patients to pastoral
care. The findings were published in the current issue of the
Archives of Family Medicine. (330 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Pro and Con: Should babies be breast-fed for at least one year
and beyond ``for as long as mutually desired,'' as a major
pediatric group recommends? (335 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Indiana research indicates that not only do people talk with
their hands, they also think with them. (250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-SURF (Undated) _ A woman over 40 shares her
experiences at surf camp, where she aced out all but on of the
20-year-olds in a week-long intensive training program. By Louise
Rafkin. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MINI-MED-SCHOOLS (Undated) _ Mini medical schools, community
education programs offered by medical schools and biomedical
research institutions to give laypeople insight into the world of
medicine, are drawing crowds all over the country. In New York,
2,200 people vie for the 600 seats available each night. In Denver
it sells out every year. On eight consecutive Tuesdays this fall,
over 500 people attended the mini medical school at Emory
University to listen to lectures by medical school professors on
topics such as the mind, the musculoskeletal system, and cancer. By
Christine Day. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SIDS (Washington) _ Scientists have begun to find real clues
to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a medical condition that has
killed millions of apparently healthy infants while leaving no
detectable trace. By Holcomb B. Noble. (500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: Why can a dog
sense a storm coming? (300 words)

JAN. 1, 2000: A HAPPY NEW (OR OLD) YEAR FOR TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The power goes out; telephones fail; elevators
stop; bank cards are useless; paychecks never arrive.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the effects that even the most moderate
experts believe could happen when the Year 2000 computer bug hits.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports brush aside apocalyptic predictions of societal
chaos because of computer system failures when the millennium
clicks over. But analysts say the glitches, likely to be felt most
strongly around Jan. 1, 2000, are something everyone should prepare
for.
</P>
<P>
   People who know _ computer company executives, for instance _
will be keeping extra cash on hand and provide flashlights and
other supplies to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bomb shelter mentality is not called for,'' the GartnerGroup
consulting firm said in a risk assessment released last month.
``Preparing for the millennium should be more like preparing for a
storm that will last less than a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems ranging from power outages to erroneous bills arriving
in the mail could start popping up in 1999 and continue well into
2000. Most agree there will be some glitches, but city emergency
planners, power company executives and global economists all say
there is no way to predict exactly the effect on public services,
the business sector and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   When 2000 hits, if the software is not corrected, computers
reading the date 1/1/00 will think it is the year 1900. No one
knows for certain, but the computers could bill bank customers for
being 100 years late on loan payments or calculate that a senior
citizen receiving Social Security doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   And experts have come to realize that the problem goes far
beyond mainframe computer systems. Millions of devices, ranging
from the gadgets that open and close valves in sewer treatment
plants to toaster ovens, have tiny microchips that tell them how to
operate. Some have little date counters that tick away inside.
</P>
<P>
   While most of these embedded chips will sail into the millennium
without problems, some may not. Companies and government agencies
are having to go through their important computer systems chip by
chip to figure out which might cause important systems to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   When Chrysler Corp. moved the clocks forward in one plant to
test whether its systems were ready for the new millennium, the
security system went kaput and locked everyone in the building and
the employee time clocks no longer functioned.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies face tight deadlines to troubleshoot things
like the valves that keep local water supplies flowing, computers
that run emergency communications systems and security programs
that keep prison doors locked.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a study of the readiness of 15,000 worldwide
businesses, the Connecticut-based GartnerGroup consulting firm
predicts that 15 percent of U.S. companies will experience severe
enough computer failures to keep them from performing their primary
missions _ with small businesses being hit the hardest. However,
the firm predicts that 90 percent of those problems will last less
than three days.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts have said if there are power outages, water system
problems or other utility disruptions in the United States, they
will probably be localized events that can be repaired quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But most preparedness organizations recommend people keep the
same sort of emergency kit they should already have for earthquakes
or severe storms _ a few days worth of food and water, flashlights,
a radio and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling people they should be prepared to be
self-sufficient for 72 hours,'' said Jaime Arteaga of the
California Office of Emergency Services. ``We don't want to panic
people, but we don't want them to be complacent either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to have my cooler all set up? Yes I am,'' said Al
Jolly, vice president in charge of Year 2000 preparations for
California Bank &AMP; Trust. ``I expect some glitches.''
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   GartnerGroup recommends consumers keep careful records of
financial transactions. The firm also suggests people have some
extra money on hand when the new century strikes, in case automatic
teller machines and bank systems are on the blink.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has asked the U.S. Treasury to print about
$50 billion in extra cash this year, in case consumers want to
stock up for the new millennium. That's enough for every household
to keep about $450 beneath a mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for air safety reasons, Transportation Department
officials told a Senate committee last week that they may ban U.S.
airlines from flying in and out of certain countries that have not
proven their air traffic control systems are free of the Year 2000
bug.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is struggling to get the
nation's own air safety system ready for the date changeover. The
agency has announced that it will not meet its March 1999 deadline
for removing Year 2000 bugs from the air traffic control system,
but plans to finish by June.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yardeni, chief economist for the international banking firm
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, has predicted that the computer glitch
could trigger enough chaos in the business sector to spark a global
recession. But he said he hopes that some slow-moving companies and
government agencies are now taking action to avoid problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Year 2000 problem were starting tomorrow and we were at
the sorry state of preparedness we have now, I'd say treat it like
a hurricane was coming and was going to last for weeks, even
months,'' he said. ``But fortunately there is still some time.''

<P>
   The holiday season is almost at hand. And while many business
travelers catch a breath from a hectic schedule, others will take
to the road. Or the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Families plan cross-country reunions. Service personnel
celebrate homecomings. Teachers take a well-earned break from the
classroom. Kids pay a visit to Grandma and Grandpa.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will make a rare airplane trip. Some will board a
jet for the first time. Others will travel by train, bus or car
because they are afraid to fly.
</P>
<P>
   For novice fliers or anyone with the least bit of trepidation,
two new books may prove helpful. In ``The Fearless Flier's
Handbook'' (Ten Speed Press, $11.95), Debbie Seaman relates
strategies that have helped people head happily skyward. And in
``Your Flight Questions Answered by a Jetliner Pilot'' (Plymouth
Press, $9.95), John Cronin responds to queries he's received while
working for a major airline.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAFE TRANSPORTATION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   None of us should be scared to fly. Statistics show that
traveling around the world on a jetliner is much safer than driving
to the airport _ or to work. Seaman's book estimates that a
passenger has one chance in 8 million of being killed in an air
crash. Remember, too: The pilots want to get home to their families
as much as we do.
</P>
<P>
   But even many grizzled travelers are fidgety fliers. I know; I'm
one of them. Traveling at 35,000 feet used to seem so routine, and
I've been struggling to get a grip on why that's changed.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem no doubt involves the increased
pressures surrounding air travel. Airports are congested, security
is intense, planes are packed, and airline employees rush to meet
schedules. The environment is hardly conducive to easing nerves.
Nor is the extensive media attention accorded the rare major
accident.
</P>
<P>
   But I've been wondering if the main cause of my anxiety is that
I'm at a stage where I know _ or rather think I know _ just enough
to let my mind wander into trouble, but not enough to put it at
ease.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LISTENING FOR PROBLEMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I took my first flight 35 years ago, I didn't recognize (or
care) what type of aircraft was used. Now I try to convince myself
that I can recognize the distinct sounds a Boeing 737 makes
compared to an MD-80 during taxiing, takeoff, ascent and landing.
Any perceived aberration can lead to palm-sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I ask myself, is the pilot cutting back sharply on power
just after takeoff? Is a small plane in our path? Or turbulence?
No, pilot Cronin soothes in his book: Engines run more smoothly and
quietly on reduced power, and residential communities below
appreciate noise abatement.
</P>
<P>
   And Seaman tells me, ``Every time an aircraft noise or vibration
starts to set you off, remember that these noises are signs that
the plane is functioning exactly the way it is supposed to. Start
thinking of these noises as normal, not abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
   Both publications provide important reminders about air safety
and about the basics of modern-day air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin's book is shorter (111 pages) but also more wide-ranging,
with chapters on flight cancellations and delays, baggage handling,
weather, air-traffic control, airports, airlines and pilots.
</P>
<P>
   His answers to some of the book's 51 questions _ What makes an
airliner fly? How does a person become a pilot? _ constitute a
primer. He offers meatier discussions of wind shear and lightning,
bumps and noises encountered while proceeding down the runway,
engine sounds and the working parts of an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman's 198-page treatise strikes more at the heart of fear of
flying, which she says affects one in five people. She relies
largely on the expertise of pilots, air-traffic controllers,
psychologists, and instructors and participants in clinics
sponsored by Qantas, the Australia-based airline.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, she poses 20 questions to help travelers
determine whether they are fearful fliers. Among them: Do you get
separation anxiety before you leave on a trip? Does the safety
briefing by flight attendants get you imagining worst-case
scenarios? Do you think your plane is too big to get off the
ground? In bad weather or fog, do you worry about whether the pilot
will get lost? Do you make sure you have plenty of alcohol before
and during a flight?
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers can relieve anxiety by studying a ``checklist''
(in the book) before takeoff, Seaman suggests. It's important to
understand that turbulence cannot break a plane apart or cause it
to drop from the sky or injure a passenger whose seat belt is
buckled, that amid lightning passengers are as safe in an airplane
as they are in a car, and that even if something goes awry, the
aviation industry embraces backup systems.
</P>
<P>
   Among tips offered by Seaman, who describes herself as a
recovering fearful flier:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get to the airport early to help alleviate stress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Focus on where you're going, not how you're getting there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Snap yourself out of negative thoughts _ literally. Put a
rubber band around your wrist, and snap it when you become tense.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman also provides contact information for several
fear-of-flying clinics and recommends Internet sites that focus on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Area bookstores stock or can order these publications. Or call
800-350-1007 to order ``Your Flight Questions Answered by a
Jetliner Pilot'' and 510-559-1600 to inquire about ``The Fearless
Flier's Handbook.''

 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I was born into a modern American religious family on my
father's side. I was especially proud to be a fourth-generation
American Jew, played a great game of baseball, enjoyed reading the
Sunday funnies and celebrated American holidays.
 &HT;    My mother's family was the complete opposite. They all came from
Europe and had no appreciation for baseball or any American
pastimes.
 &HT;    Growing up in the '50s, I went to a small cheder, a Jewish
school. Almost all of my classmates were children of refugees.
 &HT;    One year I was introduced to a very strict, no-nonsense Jewish
teacher -- called a rebbe. This rebbe had very little patience for
me, as I was very different from his European students. I was an
American -- a Yankee boy.
 &HT;    According to my rebbe's thinking, all American customs were
taboo. They were considered traif, non-kosher. Easter, Halloween,
Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July were all jumbled into one big
no-no. They were American and were out of bounds.
 &HT;    He claimed that a Bible law forbids the Jewish nation to emulate
the ways of other nations. He would quote the biblical verse
Leviticus 18:3: ``Neither shall ye walk in their statutes; do not
follow their social customs.''
 &HT;    However, not all Jews think that way, as we shall see.
 &HT;    A week before Thanksgiving my father called up my European
grandparents and told them that he had received an 18-pound turkey
from his synagogue's caterer. This was a gift to our large family
for Thanksgiving. On Thursday we would have a Thanksgiving repast.
 &HT;    That Monday the rebbe made a speech. Thanksgiving is forbidden.
It is a pagan holiday. No Jewish boy is allowed to eat turkey.
 &HT;    Now I was in trouble. I thought that if I ate turkey my teeth
would fall out. What would I do?
 &HT;    I told my rebbe about the early Indians and the first
Thanksgiving. I thought he would realize that Thanksgiving could be
considered a good deed for both Jews and Gentiles. I tried to tell
him about the friendly Indians; how they saved the starving
Puritans; that the Thanksgiving meal reminds us of the foods the
Indians showed the settlers and it taught them how to survive
through the rough winters in the new world. This was a mitzvah, a
good deed, to share and give thanks to God.
 &HT;    ``Yingele (sonny boy),'' he said, ``I told you we don't
celebrate these holidays. It is forbidden to even listen to your
bubbemeises (tall tales).''
 &HT;    That night I told my dad that I wouldn't participate in a pagan
holiday. ``It's against the Bible,'' I said. He flew into a rage. I
thought he was going to clobber me.
 &HT;    ``You are an American, a fourth-generation American,'' he said.
Be happy that you have a country that believes in God. If anything,
Thanksgiving is a Jewish idea.'' He told my mother that if this
continued he would take me out of that cheder, the Jewish school.
 &HT;    For the next few years my father bought a large turkey for
Thanksgiving and we had two turkey meals: one on the American
Thanksgiving and one on the following Shabbos. We now celebrated
Thanksgiving on the Jewish holy day of Sabbath.
 &HT;    I thought that my dad had a point. Thanksgiving, indeed, was a
holiday that fit into the Jewish idea of remembering God's goodness
in providing us with our needs. Thus, we could have Thanksgiving
every Sabbath.
 &HT;    I don't remember if Thanksgiving became a kosher holiday or not,
but we solved our family dilemma.
 &HT;    When Abraham Lincoln signed the original Thanksgiving
Proclamation, he stated, ``We have been the recipients of the
choicest bounties of heaven; we have been preserved these many
years in peace and prosperity; we have grown in numbers, wealth and
power as no other nation has ever grown.
 &HT;    ``But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand
which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and
strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness
of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some
superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken
success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity
of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God
that made us.
 &HT;    ``It has seemed to me fit and proper that God should be
solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart
and one voice, by the whole American people. I do, therefore,
invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and
also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign
lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November as a
day of Thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who
dwelleth in the heavens.''
 &HT;    I think if my rebbe would have seen this wonderful proclamation,
then he might have joined us in prayer at the Thanksgiving meal.

C.S. LEWIS ON HIS 100TH: A FADED THEOLOGICAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    November 29 the centenary birthday of C.S. Lewis -- Oxford
scholar, lay theologian, and author of the ``Chronicles of
Narnia.'' Since his death in 1963, Lewis has achieved near-cult
status with legions of devoted fans as a defender of traditional
Christianity.
 &HT;    Lewis wrote 40 books, including the best-selling ``Mere
Christianity''; numerous posthumous volumes of his letters and
essays have appeared. In addition, scholars and fans have produced
more than a hundred books -- and numerous essays -- covering every
aspect of his work. Societies devoted to his memory hold yearly
conferences. In cyberspace, fans debate his ideas through websites
and discussion groups.
 &HT;    On his 100th birthday, C.S. Lewis lives. And the vast majority
of his admirers are conservative Christians -- mostly American
evangelicals and traditionalist Catholics.
 &HT;    Three summers ago in Oxford, I attended a Lewis conference with
an English friend. The conference comprised about 40 Americans --
mostly evangelical Protestants -- who listened in rapt adoration to
lectures on Lewis' relevance to modern culture.
 &HT;    During a break, I asked one of the British hosts, ``What do
English Christians think of C.S. Lewis?'' He replied, ``Honestly,
we don't think much of him. We're baffled by Americans who do.''
 &HT;    ``Thank goodness!'' I laughed, ``So am I.''
 &HT;    When I was a teenager, I enjoyed Lewis a great deal. However, as
I read theology and church history in college and seminary, his
work wore thin. Eventually I realized Lewis was an able popularizer
but not a very original Christian thinker. And I began to wonder:
What accounts for his popularity -- particularly among conservative
Christians?
 &HT;    Although these Christians most often praise his theology and
children's fiction, I believe that Lewis' fantasy books hold the
key to understanding their fascination with his ideas.
 &HT;    Lewis' friend, J.R.R. Tolkein, author of ``The Lord of the
Rings,'' suggested that the power of fantasy lay in the creation of
``secondary worlds'' analogous to our own. In these worlds, the
writer can tinker with reality -- thus changing its shape to
reflect truths or ideas hoped for in the real world.
 &HT;    If Tolkein is correct, then Lewis appeals to conservatives
precisely because he created a ``secondary world'' -- an
alternative theological world to that of the twentieth century.
Intended or not, Lewis expresses the longings of anxious people who
were culturally marginalized.
 &HT;    In doing so, he constructed an intellectually credible universe
-- giving his heirs a sense of authority and control. This world
was like their own with an important difference -- in it religious
conservatives win their crusade against modernity.
 &HT;    In spite of the intellectual changes of this century, Lewis'
beliefs reflected an earlier world -- one where the British empire,
Christianity, and white men reigned supreme.
 &HT;    For conservatives, Lewis models all they wish to be: like him,
they want to restore -- or escape to -- a tidy world of Victorian
virtue and belief.
 &HT;    An example of this may be found in a new book, ``The Pilgrim's
Guide: C.S. Lewis and the Art of Witness.'' The (mostly male)
contributors are evangelicals or conservative Anglicans and
Catholics -- many associated with traditionalist movements within
their denominations.
 &HT;    Throughout the book, they evoke Lewis against liberalism,
relativism, modernity, post-modernity, syncretism, nihilism and
world religions. In their collective vision, Lewis embodies ``mere
Christianity'' as the man who argues true faith against
contemporary error.
 &HT;    Although this appeals to those troubled by modern culture, it is
little more than fantasy. Whether Lewis liked it or not -- and no
matter how hard he tried to escape it -- the post-modern world
arrived in fullness in the second half of the twentieth century.
 &HT;    Even as he wrote, his dream Christian world faded even further
from historical memory. Lewis' cause was lost before it even began.
 &HT;    That is not to say Christianity lost. Rather, it changed. Today,
Christian theology is undergoing a profound transformation taking
account for this century's intellectual and political challenges.
Scholars are reinterpreting biblical texts, historical traditions,
liturgies, and ethics of Christian faith -- offering creative
visions of a global and inclusive faith. And, in my opinion, these
renderings of Christianity come closer to Jesus' message than those
of generations previous.
 &HT;    Lewis fans may think Christianity needs to be ``saved'' from
modern assaults. But faith should be a contemporary adventure -- a
life lived fully in our own days -- not some imagined world of late
Victorian Oxford or a place called Narnia.
 &HT;    So, Professor Lewis, I appreciate what you taught me when
younger, but I am not an adoring fan. You were a voice for your
time. As for me and my faith, however, we will take our own.

 &HT;    In doing so, he constructed an intellectually credible universe
-- giving his heirs a sense of authority and control. This world
was like their own with an important difference -- in it religious
conservatives win their crusade against modernity.
 &HT;    In spite of the intellectual changes of this century, Lewis'
beliefs reflected an earlier world -- one where the British empire,
Christianity, and white men reigned supreme.
 &HT;    For conservatives, Lewis models all they wish to be: like him,
they want to restore -- or escape to -- a tidy world of Victorian
virtue and belief.
 &HT;    An example of this may be found in a new book, ``The Pilgrim's
Guide: C.S. Lewis and the Art of Witness.'' The (mostly male)
contributors are evangelicals or conservative Anglicans and
Catholics -- many associated with traditionalist movements within
their denominations.
 &HT;    Throughout the book, they evoke Lewis against liberalism,
relativism, modernity, post-modernity, syncretism, nihilism and
world religions. In their collective vision, Lewis embodies ``mere
Christianity'' as the man who argues true faith against
contemporary error.
 &HT;    Although this appeals to those troubled by modern culture, it is
little more than fantasy. Whether Lewis liked it or not -- and no
matter how hard he tried to escape it -- the post-modern world
arrived in fullness in the second half of the twentieth century.
 &HT;    Even as he wrote, his dream Christian world faded even further
from historical memory. Lewis' cause was lost before it even began.
 &HT;    That is not to say Christianity lost. Rather, it changed. Today,
Christian theology is undergoing a profound transformation taking
account for this century's intellectual and political challenges.
Scholars are reinterpreting biblical texts, historical traditions,
liturgies, and ethics of Christian faith -- offering creative
visions of a global and inclusive faith. And, in my opinion, these
renderings of Christianity come closer to Jesus' message than those
of generations previous.
 &HT;    Lewis fans may think Christianity needs to be ``saved'' from
modern assaults. But faith should be a contemporary adventure -- a
life lived fully in our own days -- not some imagined world of late
Victorian Oxford or a place called Narnia.
 &HT;    So, Professor Lewis, I appreciate what you taught me when
younger, but I am not an adoring fan. You were a voice for your
time. As for me and my faith, however, we will take our own.

TACO CHAIN'S NEWEST OFFERING: A STUFFED CHIHUAHUA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taco Bell hyperbolizes when the company claims that its
talking-chihuahua stuffed animals will be ``the hottest new toy for
this holiday season,'' but forgivably so.
</P>
<P>
   The critters, 6-inch-tall plush versions of the dog in the
chain's popular television commercials, are in their own way as
quirkily cute as what will actually be the hottest toy, Furby. And
they're cheaper, too: The toys, available at Taco Bell restaurants,
cost $3 to $4. There are four styles of chihuahua in various poses,
each with its own phrase to utter when the dog's belly is squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the expressions: ``Here, lizard, lizard,'' ``Viva
Gorditas'' and ``Feliz Navidad, amigos.'' The chihuahuas are
competing directly with McDonald's stuffed-animal tie-ins from the
forthcoming movie ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIPID INSPIRATION: Tired of those peppy posters your boss puts
up to try to excite employees about how swell their jobs are? Get
revenge by entering your least favorite in a contest being
sponsored by Tompkins Press.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher is looking for ``the most trite, generic, hokey,
overused, cliched or unmotivating motivational slogan.'' Samples:
``Today is the first day of the rest of your life'' and ``There is
no `i' in `team.'''
</P>
<P>
   The contestant who submits the most underwhelming slogan will
win two round-trip airline tickets to any North American
destination, $1,000 cash and mention in Tompkins' book on the
subject, to be released late next year. Runners-up get copies of
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Enter by e-mailing slogans(at)tompkinsinc.com; visiting the Web
site, http://www.tompkinsinc.com/contest, or sending your slogan
idea by fax to 919-872-9666. Entries must be received by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ILLUMINATING INSECT: As a child, we used to smush fireflies by
running through overgrown fields and whacking the tall grass with a
tennis racket, creating translucent smears that waved in the night
wind. But we grew up and don't do that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we delight in all things firefly, such as the really
big firefly candleholder offered by the Blue River Trading Co. in
its catalog. The bug, about a foot long and 14 inches across the
wings, is made of a rust-finished metal and features a glass
abdomen that opens to hold a small votive or other inch-high
candle. The $65 firefly is among the many Southwestern-themed
items, from fringed suede skirts to antique pine furniture,
available from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Call 800-761-1197 to order the candleholder or request a
catalog.

C.S. LEWIS ON HIS 100TH: A FADED THEOLOGICAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)

Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative NIRDI

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    November 29 the centenary birthday of C.S. Lewis -- Oxford
scholar, lay theologian, and author of the ``Chronicles of
Narnia.'' Since his death in 1963, Lewis has achieved near-cult
status with legions of devoted fans as a defender of traditional
Christianity.
 &HT;    Lewis wrote 40 books, including the best-selling ``Mere
Christianity''; numerous posthumous volumes of his letters and
essays have appeared. In addition, scholars and fans have produced
more than a hundred books -- and numerous essays -- covering every
aspect of his work. Societies devoted to his memory hold yearly
conferences. In cyberspace, fans debate his ideas through websites
and discussion groups.
 &HT;    On his 100th birthday, C.S. Lewis lives. And the vast majority
of his admirers are conservative Christians -- mostly American
evangelicals and traditionalist Catholics.
 &HT;    Three summers ago in Oxford, I attended a Lewis conference with
an English friend. The conference comprised about 40 Americans --
mostly evangelical Protestants -- who listened in rapt adoration to
lectures on Lewis' relevance to modern culture.
 &HT;    During a break, I asked one of the British hosts, ``What do
English Christians think of C.S. Lewis?'' He replied, ``Honestly,
we don't think much of him. We're baffled by Americans who do.''
 &HT;    ``Thank goodness!'' I laughed, ``So am I.''
 &HT;    When I was a teenager, I enjoyed Lewis a great deal. However, as
I read theology and church history in college and seminary, his
work wore thin. Eventually I realized Lewis was an able popularizer
but not a very original Christian thinker. And I began to wonder:
What accounts for his popularity -- particularly among conservative
Christians?
 &HT;    Although these Christians most often praise his theology and
children's fiction, I believe that Lewis' fantasy books hold the
key to understanding their fascination with his ideas.
 &HT;    Lewis' friend, J.R.R. Tolkein, author of ``The Lord of the
Rings,'' suggested that the power of fantasy lay in the creation of
``secondary worlds'' analogous to our own. In these worlds, the
writer can tinker with reality -- thus changing its shape to
reflect truths or ideas hoped for in the real world.
 &HT;    If Tolkein is correct, then Lewis appeals to conservatives
precisely because he created a ``secondary world'' -- an
alternative theological world to that of the twentieth century.
Intended or not, Lewis expresses the longings of anxious people who
were culturally marginalized.
 &HT;    In doing so, he constructed an intellectually credible universe
-- giving his heirs a sense of authority and control. This world
was like their own with an important difference -- in it religious
conservatives win their crusade against modernity.
 &HT;    In spite of the intellectual changes of this century, Lewis'
beliefs reflected an earlier world -- one where the British empire,
Christianity, and white men reigned supreme.
 &HT;    For conservatives, Lewis models all they wish to be: like him,

 &HT;    Although this appeals to those troubled by modern culture, it is

PAPA NOEL BRINGS CHRISTMAS THE BIG EASY WAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Papa Noel, New Orleans' answer to Santa Claus. He makes his
rounds in a pirogue, not a sleigh. And his running mates are
gators, not reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Papa Noel is just one of the traditions that jazz up the
holidays in the Crescent City. Second-line parades, historical
walking tours with costumed guides and countless carolers help this
lovely and lively city on the Mississippi River redefine the
``merry'' of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Two events herald the holiday season in New Orleans: Celebration
in the Oaks, and the Algiers Bonfire and River Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Celebration in the Oaks in pretty City Park kicks off Friday,
Nov. 27. Each evening through Jan. 3, hundreds of cars will inch
their way through a stunning two-mile driving tour of the park's
centuries-old oak trees hung bedecked with millions of twinkling
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors also can stroll through the Botanical Garden,
Children's Storyland theme park and an amusement area, where rides
such as the antique carousel and kiddie coaster await.
</P>
<P>
   Musical entertainment, children's activities and refreshments
are available. Events include a live Nativity (Dec. 18-22),
Radiofone's Snowland with 40 tons of artificial snow (Dec. 19) and
fireworks (Dec. 26).
</P>
<P>
   Driving-tour admission is $7 per car; walking-tour admission is
$3 per person. Call 504-483-9415.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, ``feaux de joie'' (fires of joy, or
bonfires) on the levees along the Mississippi guided Papa Noel on
his annual Christmas Eve journey. On Dec. 5, Algiers, the little
community just across the river from the popular Woldenberg River
Front Park, will host a bonfire and riverboat parade. Free concerts
will take place on both sides of the river.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where people live to eat, it should be no surprise
that one of the premier festivities is the Reveillon dinner.
Traditionally these elaborate meals followed attendance of midnight
Mass on Christmas Eve. This season, 32 restaurants will offer
Reveillon menus throughout December.
</P>
<P>
   Among participants are some of the city's most famous
restaurants, including Brennan's, Commander's Palace, Galatoire's,
Palace Cafe, Ralph &AMP; Kacoo's, Tujague's and Upperline Restaurant.
Menus have a fixed price and vary by restaurant. Seatings sell out
quickly, so you may want to make your dining reservations before
you book your hotel.
</P>
<P>
   At Mr. B's Bistro, on Rue Royal in the French Quarter, Chef
Michelle McRaney's Reveillon menu features a first course of Smoked
Rabbit Gumbo or Wild Mushroom and White Truffle Risotto; a second
course of Reveillon Salad with warm apple-smoked bacon vinaigrette
and roasted pears; and a third course of Beef Tenderloin Medallions
with fresh horseradish potatoes and fresh vegetable. Dessert is a
chocolate pate. Cost is $42 per person.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy Louisiana cooking, you may want to sample the
Chefs' Holiday Cooking Demonstrations at 3 p.m. daily Dec. 6-23 at
the Shops at Canal Place. The demonstrations are free. Among
highlights: Jamie Shannon of Commander's Palace cooking Oyster
Chowder and Homemade Crackers (Dec. 17); Christian Karcher of
Mike's on the Avenue creating Eggnog, Crab &AMP; Brie Soup; and Carmen
Provenzano of Pascal's Manale whipping up Shrimp Tre Fromaggi (Dec.
22).
</P>
<P>
   Several home tours offer visitors a peek into splendidly
decorated private residences.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Lestat and other fictional vampires should check out the
Preservation Resource Center's annual Holiday Home Tour Dec. 12-13.
The tour spotlights several homes in the Garden District, including
that of author Anne Rice. Tickets are $25. Call 504-581-7032.
</P>
<P>
   Two home tours will feature French Quarter residences.
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter Holiday Home Tour, Dec. 5, is sponsored by
the French Quarter Citizens for Preservation of Residential
Quality. Tickets are $10 to see four private homes. Call
504-523-3630.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 20, members of the Garden Club of the Vieux Carr will
open their homes and courtyards for a holiday home tour. Five
residences within walking distance of one another will be featured.
Tickets are $10. Call 504-522-5524.
</P>
<P>
   And for a true New Orleans holiday experience, stop by the
Fairmont Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Locals flock to this century-old institution to stroll its
blocklong lobby decked out during the holidays in a dazzling canopy
of angel hair and twinkling lights.
</P>
<P>
   Linger in the hotel's famous Sazerac Bar, which takes its name
from the world's first cocktail. The concoction was created by a
French Quarter pharmacist in 1859; it can still be ordered at the
Sazerac Bar, though it comes without one of its original
ingredients: absinthe.
</P>
<P>
   For information on holiday happenings in New Orleans, contact
the visitors bureau at 800-672-6124 or access
www.neworleansonline.com. Ask about Papa Noel room rates, which are
available at dozens of hotels around town.

LATE SOCIALITE'S WARDROBE CREATES A FASHION STIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ In line they stood, waiting with hands on
hips and toes tapping impatiently, for the most glamorous
secondhand clothing sale this upscale city has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   And what a spectacle it was, if only for the chance to peruse
the extravagant, and often flamboyant tastes of deceased newspaper
heiress Margaret Lesher, on sale to the public for the first time
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lesher, an heir to the Contra Costa (Calif.) Times newspaper,
mysteriously drowned at an Arizona lake last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit for everyone,'' said Janice Perkins, a
customer and occasional employee at Labels, a consignment boutique
in Walnut Creek. ``I compare this to something happening to the Bay
Area on the smaller scale of Princess Diana or Jaqueline Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was hardly on the order of a Sotheby's auction, but
the crowds did flood the 1,200-square-foot store to the point where
a store employee played fashion police at the door, telling eager
women, and a few men, when they could enter.
</P>
<P>
   The store's typical collection of clothing was thrown back into
storage so the space could be exclusively devoted to Lesher's
enormous collection of fine designer merchandise with labels like
Chanel, Oscar de la Renta, Escada, Scaasi, Versace, St. John and
Mondi. Even more impressive was that the hundreds of suits, evening
gowns, shoes and the like represented only half of the socialite's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The rest will hit the racks beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   Lesher's estate will get the bulk of the profits from the sale,
but some of the proceeds will go to one of her favorite charities,
the Battered Women's Alternative, a nonprofit organization for
victims of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Not all were impressed with the collection, and some got
downright catty in dissing the designer duds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely for an older socialite,'' said Stephanie
Douzos, 26, of San Leandro, spending less time in the store than
she did waiting in line because she didn't like a single thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is dated. It's like something you would wear on
Halloween,'' she said.
</P>

   Boutique owner Lynn Hayworth said she was delighted with the
busiest day ever in her store's eight-month history, and expressed
gratitude that Lesher's reputation could pack in customers. She
said she out-bid other competitors for the right to sell Lesher's
luxuries because she offered the family her entire store.

   ``I wanted it to attract a lot of attention and it seems to have

(Repeating for all needing.) 
 WASHINGTON: her lawyer.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under Rule 4.2 the American Bar Association Model Rules of
Professional Conduct, lawyers, including prosecutors, may not talk
directly to someone who might be involved in litigation or an
investigation if they know that person is represented by a lawyer.
A separate bar association manual on criminal matters makes it even
clearer that prosecutors should step aside immediately when they
learn someone they are interviewing is represented by a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened there was very improper,'' said Professor
Geoffrey Hazard of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. The
issue was so basic, he said, that even people whose only
information comes from television shows know that prosecutors are
not supposed to talk to subjects of an investigation once it's
clear they have a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Professor Bob Tuttle of the George Washington University Law
School said the situation is far from clear and that Starr may not
be bound by those guidelines. The manual for prosecutors is only
advisory, he said, and the Justice Department has long resisted
efforts to make the model code apply to its prosecutors. Congress
has approved legislation requiring the Justice Department to adhere
to the model code, he said, but it takes effect late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr is independent from the Justice Department, the
law authorizing his appointment provides that he must adhere to
department guidelines whenever possible. But Starr made clear that
he believed the guidelines were not an issue because Ms. Lewinsky's
perception that she was being threatened was inaccurate, and
because she had been free to leave the hotel at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used traditional law enforcement techniques,'' he said in
response to charges that the prosecutors threatened Ms. Lewinsky
with 27 years in jail and her mother's imprisonment. In fact, such
threats are common in the hard-edged world of modern prosecutors.
And he said his prosecutors did not have to allow Ms. Lewinsky to
contact her lawyer because he represented her in a civil matter,
the Paula Jones case, not a criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   On only one point did Starr give some ground. He conceded that
his agents may have gone too far if, as alleged, they went to the
school of a 16-year-old in Arkansas to serve a subpoena on him.

THE CASE (IF ANY) AGAINST THE PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Judiciary Committee hearing wore on into the
night last Thursday, Kenneth Starr came to resemble not so much a
congressional witness as a defendant in the dock. It was a display
of how much President Clinton's supporters have succeeded in
turning the issue before the nation from the impeachability of the
president to the behavior of Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   When David Kendall, the president's lawyer, questioned him near
the end of the hearing, Starr was goaded into shedding his Mr.
Rogers-goes-to-Congress-to-explain-things manner. Instead, he was
briefly reduced to indignant denials. And, although Kendall is the
president's defense lawyer, he did not spend a moment of his
allotted hour defending the president.
</P>
<P>
   There was really only The Case Against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The main arguments about the behavior and approach of Starr and
his associates concern how they have treated witnesses, notably
Monica Lewinsky, and whether they leaked confidential grand jury
proceedings. Critics have also raised other issues, including
whether Starr was involved improperly in Paula Corbin Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to portray Starr as vindictive and
unprofessional, Democrats have hinted darkly that Starr broke some
rule or violated some law. But the rules that govern prosecutorial
conduct are, for the most part, vaguely worded exhortations and
proscriptions in bar association manuals and Justice Department
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Charles Wolfram of the Cornell Law School, an
authority in legal ethics, said the rules about prosecutorial
misconduct are inherently vague and have been intentionally left
that way by the courts. ``Courts continually say that it is not the
behavior of the prosecutor that should be put on trial unless
there's something really extraordinary that happens,'' he said.
Moreover, he said, ``you never get a sharp definition of what these
vaguely orded guidelines mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Starr have been lobbed in the highly
specialized and partisan context of an impeachment proceeding, an
atmosphere with the subtlety of, say, Monday Night Football. In
such a proceeding, Wolfram said, the nuances of Starr's behavior
matter far less than broad impressions about whether he is fair.
``He can't just be another prosecutor playing fast and loose with
the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for perceptions, Starr suffered a blow Friday when
Samuel Dash abruptly resigned as his ethics adviser. The presence
of Dash, who was counsel to the Senate Watergate committee in 1973,
lent an air of rectitude to Starr's operation. Dash praised Starr's
overall conduct, but said that he had overstepped his bounds by
becoming an advocate for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But just as everyday prosecutors are rarely punished for
wrongdoing, Starr and his deputies are largely immune from penalty
even if some of the charges against them prove true. As an
independent counsel, he is chiefly the judge of his own behavior,
although he could be fired for misconduct by Attorney General Janet
Reno. She has shown little interest so far in complaints from the
White House about Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The area in which the guidelines are the most explicit and the
issue that may pose the greatest threat to Starr is the allegation
that his office improperly leaked grand jury information. The
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure flatly prohibit prosecutors
from disclosing grand jury matters.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that 24 news
accounts about the investigation of President Clinton appear to
show that prosecutors in Starr's office discussed grand jury
matters with reporters. The judge described the articles and
broadcasts as ``serious and repetitive'' evidence that Starr and
his staff may have violated the law. As a result, Starr now has to
prove that his office was not responsible for any of those 24 news
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue produced the liveliest moments in the Starr-Kendall
confrontation Thursday night. Kendall read from some of the news
accounts, noting that they included phrases like, ``sources in
Starr's office tell us,'' ``sources near Starr,'' and ``prosecutors
suggest.'' He then asked, ``Does the media make up these quotes,
Mr. Starr?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr replied, ``I'm not here to accuse the media of anything,''
adding that the matter was under litigation and it was unfair to
raise it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall countered, ``Mr. Starr, in fact, there has been no case
remotely similar to this in terms of the massive leaking from the
prosecutor's office, and I think we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr replied: ``I totally disagree with that. That's an
accusation and it's an unfair accusation. I completely reject it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Johnson were to find that Starr or his deputies
improperly disclosed grand jury materials, they could face
sanctions. The Judge could formally censure anyone in Starr's
office found to have violated the law, a significant blow to a
legal career.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also defended himself against charges that Ms. Lewinsky
was mistreated when his prosecutors first confronted her in a
suburban Virginia hotel last January. She told a grand jury she was
threatened, detained and discouraged from calling her lawyer or her
mother. ``You're 24, you're smart,'' she said a prosecutor told
her. ``You're old enough. You don't need to call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   However heavy-handed those comments might have been, the issue
that might run afoul of ethics guidelines is whether the
prosecutors tried to engage her as a witness after she asked to
speak to her lawyer.

PAPA NOEL BRINGS CHRISTMAS THE BIG EASY WAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Papa Noel, New Orleans' answer to Santa Claus. He makes his
rounds in a pirogue, not a sleigh. And his running mates are
gators, not reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Papa Noel is just one of the traditions that jazz up the
holidays in the Crescent City. Second-line parades, historical
walking tours with costumed guides and countless carolers help this
lovely and lively city on the Mississippi River redefine the
``merry'' of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Two events herald the holiday season in New Orleans: Celebration
in the Oaks, and the Algiers Bonfire and River Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Celebration in the Oaks in pretty City Park kicks off Friday,
Nov. 27. Each evening through Jan. 3, hundreds of cars will inch
their way through a stunning two-mile driving tour of the park's
centuries-old oak trees hung bedecked with millions of twinkling
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors also can stroll through the Botanical Garden,
Children's Storyland theme park and an amusement area, where rides
such as the antique carousel and kiddie coaster await.
</P>
<P>
   Musical entertainment, children's activities and refreshments
are available. Events include a live Nativity (Dec. 18-22),
Radiofone's Snowland with 40 tons of artificial snow (Dec. 19) and
fireworks (Dec. 26).
</P>
<P>
   Driving-tour admission is $7 per car; walking-tour admission is
$3 per person. Call 504-483-9415.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, ``feaux de joie'' (fires of joy, or
bonfires) on the levees along the Mississippi guided Papa Noel on
his annual Christmas Eve journey. On Dec. 5, Algiers, the little
community just across the river from the popular Woldenberg River
Front Park, will host a bonfire and riverboat parade. Free concerts
will take place on both sides of the river.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where people live to eat, it should be no surprise
that one of the premier festivities is the Reveillon dinner.
Traditionally these elaborate meals followed attendance of midnight
Mass on Christmas Eve. This season, 32 restaurants will offer
Reveillon menus throughout December.
</P>
<P>
   Among participants are some of the city's most famous
restaurants, including Brennan's, Commander's Palace, Galatoire's,
Palace Cafe, Ralph &AMP; Kacoo's, Tujague's and Upperline Restaurant.
Menus have a fixed price and vary by restaurant. Seatings sell out
quickly, so you may want to make your dining reservations before
you book your hotel.
</P>
<P>
   At Mr. B's Bistro, on Rue Royal in the French Quarter, Chef
Michelle McRaney's Reveillon menu features a first course of Smoked
Rabbit Gumbo or Wild Mushroom and White Truffle Risotto; a second
course of Reveillon Salad with warm apple-smoked bacon vinaigrette
and roasted pears; and a third course of Beef Tenderloin Medallions
with fresh horseradish potatoes and fresh vegetable. Dessert is a
chocolate pate. Cost is $42 per person.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy Louisiana cooking, you may want to sample the
Chefs' Holiday Cooking Demonstrations at 3 p.m. daily Dec. 6-23 at
the Shops at Canal Place. The demonstrations are free. Among
highlights: Jamie Shannon of Commander's Palace cooking Oyster
Chowder and Homemade Crackers (Dec. 17); Christian Karcher of
Mike's on the Avenue creating Eggnog, Crab &AMP; Brie Soup; and Carmen
Provenzano of Pascal's Manale whipping up Shrimp Tre Fromaggi (Dec.
22).
</P>
<P>
   Several home tours offer visitors a peek into splendidly
decorated private residences.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Lestat and other fictional vampires should check out the
Preservation Resource Center's annual Holiday Home Tour Dec. 12-13.
The tour spotlights several homes in the Garden District, including
that of author Anne Rice. Tickets are $25. Call 504-581-7032.
</P>
<P>
   Two home tours will feature French Quarter residences.
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter Holiday Home Tour, Dec. 5, is sponsored by
the French Quarter Citizens for Preservation of Residential
Quality. Tickets are $10 to see four private homes. Call
504-523-3630.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 20, members of the Garden Club of the Vieux Carr will
open their homes and courtyards for a holiday home tour. Five
residences within walking distance of one another will be featured.
Tickets are $10. Call 504-522-5524.
</P>
<P>
   And for a true New Orleans holiday experience, stop by the
Fairmont Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Locals flock to this century-old institution to stroll its
blocklong lobby decked out during the holidays in a dazzling canopy
of angel hair and twinkling lights.
</P>
<P>
   Linger in the hotel's famous Sazerac Bar, which takes its name
from the world's first cocktail. The concoction was created by a
French Quarter pharmacist in 1859; it can still be ordered at the
Sazerac Bar, though it comes without one of its original
ingredients: absinthe.
</P>
<P>
   For information on holiday happenings in New Orleans, contact
the visitors bureau at 800-672-6124 or access
www.neworleansonline.com. Ask about Papa Noel room rates, which are
available at dozens of hotels around town.

TOUCHING BASE WITH CUCKOLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We now inaugurate the Pundits Aid Society, committed to helping
distressed columnists in search of roots.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his occasional columns titled ``Ask Mr. Language
Person,'' the humorist Dave Barry purportedly received this
question: ``I am in the field of business, and people keep saying
they want to `touch base' with me. They'll say, `I just wanted to
touch base with you on the Fooberman contract' or `We need to touch
base on the rental sheep for the sales conference.' But my
understanding of the rules is that if you touch base WITH somebody,
at the same time, at least one of you is out. So my question is,
Who the heck is `Fooberman'?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer from Barry's Mr. Language Person: ``We decided to
consult with William Safire ... but his number is not listed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's my e-mail that's not listed. But I bought a copy of The
Sunday Washington Post, turned to Wit's End in the magazine (as the
Barry column is called there) and got the message.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shortening of the baseball rule  &UR; touch all bases &LR; . Paul
Dickson, whose New Dickson Baseball Dictionary is coming out in
February, off-season, says: ``The baseball term means you have to
make contact with the three bases in your way around the base path
to home plate. That's why coaches tell players to remember to
 &UR; touch all the bases &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   That was extended to the general language in the sense of ``to
get in contact with,'' as in ``I better  &UR; touch base &LR;  with my
mother; she gets sore when I don't call.'' The more frequent sense
is ``to obtain the approval of,'' as in `` &UR; touch base &LR;  with you on
the Fooberman contract.'' Because the metaphoric extension of the
baseball term is not yet in the Oxford English Dictionary, the
``approval'' sense seems relatively recent, with citations in the
late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable case of  &UR; base &LR;  non- &UR; touching &LR;  took place on
Sept. 23, 1908. With two outs in the last half of the ninth inning,
the game tied 1-1, the Giants had runners on first and third. The
Giant hitter singled, scoring the man from third and apparently
winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   The runner on first, Fred Merkle, age 19, turned and gleefully
headed for the clubhouse celebration. But the Chicago Cub second
baseman, Johnny Evers (of the famed Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance
double-play combination), spotted what he believed to be an
infraction of the rules. He called for a ball from the umpire and
stepped on second base, claiming to have retired Merkle on a
force-out.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd had poured onto the field, and play could not be
resumed; the game was called a tie. In the tie-breaking game two
weeks later, the Giants lost the game and the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   This popularized the slang term  &UR; bonehead &LR; , an American
alteration of the British  &UR; blockhead &LR; . The Chicago Tribune, on
Sept. 24, 1908, wrote, ``Then came the  &UR; bonehead &LR;  finish. ...'' The
errant player, an otherwise intelligent first baseman, went through
a 16-year career known as Fred `` &UR; Bonehead &LR; '' Merkle because he
failed to  &UR; touch base &LR; . It is a mild epithet for stupidity, one
that Al D'Amato probably wishes he had used against the new senator
from New York, Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   The second distressed syndicated columnist seeking help from the
free services of the Pundits Aid Society is Richard Cohen of The
Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am enclosing Evan Thomas' review of the Nina Burleigh book
on Mary Meyer. I direct your attention to the last graph
((punditese for ``paragraph'')) in which Evan says, `Writing in his
journal ... shortly after he had been both promoted at the CIA and
 &UR; cuckolded &LR;  by his wife ....' I thought it is the male lover, not
the wife, who  &UR; cuckolds &LR;  the husband. I have turned to the American
Heritage dictionary, but without success. (The derivation of
 &UR; cuckold &LR;  sure is interesting, though.) Please clear this up for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladly. The  &UR; cuckoo &LR;  bird is said to have the habit of laying
its eggs in another bird's nest, leaving them to be cared for by
the other, adoptive bird. That led to  &UR; cuckold &LR; , ``a derisive term
for a husband who has been the victim of adultery, the party
betrayed by an unfaithful wife.''
</P>
<P>
   All 29 uses of the word in Shakespeare are directed at the
husband betrayed, or at least believing his wife to be fooling
around. Othello: ``I will chop her into messes,'' he roars, when
the sly Iago unfairly accuses his wife, Desdemona. How dare she
`` &UR; Cuckold &LR;  me!''
</P>
<P>
   In most citations of this word in the OED, first used around the
year 1250 (this has been going on a long time), it is the wife who
 &UR; cuckolds &LR;  the husband. This is etymologically consistent: The
female  &UR; cuckoo &LR;  bird is the one who lays the eggs in the wrong
nest. Male  &UR; cuckoos &LR;  just fly around and make a distinctive sound
immortalized in clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the columnist Cohen has too narrow a focus: It is both the
unfaithful wife and the seductive paramour, her male lover, who do
the  &UR; cuckolding &LR;  of the husband.
</P>
<P>
   But this leads to two other questions that cry out for answers.
We know that the horns of the  &UR; cuckold &LR;  are worn by the deceived
husband, but why horns? One answer in mythology: that cheatin'
Actaeon, a hunter, was turned into a stag by Diana.
</P>
<P>
   The OED suggests that the horns come from the practice of
planting spurs of a castrated rooster on the excised comb of
another fowl, where they sometimes grew several inches long. This
free service to pundits does not cover research into why
16th-century poulterers did this, but the German for  &UR; cuckold &LR; 
originally meant ``capon.''
</P>
<P>
   The second question is more pertinent. Worldly-wise
lexicographers know that adultery is not a one-way street. Is there
a word to describe a wife who has been betrayed by her husband?
 &UR; Wronged &LR;  seems weak. What is the cheatin'-husband equivalent of
the noun  &UR; cuckold &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your reader was wrong about there being no word for a female
 &UR; cuckold &LR; ,'' Barry Rein of Azusa, Calif., wrote to the Los Angeles
Times columnist Jack Smith in 1989. ``It is  &UR; cuckquean &LR; . Look it up
in the OED.'' There it is: ``Ye make hir a cookqueane'' is the 1562
usage by John Heywood. In his 1922 novel, ``Ulysses,'' James Joyce
retrieved it from antiquity: ``her gay betrayer, their common
 &UR; cuckquean &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, English shows itself to be an equal-opportunity
language.

APL STEAMS AHEAD IN ASIA-PACIFIC CONTAINER BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ American President Lines has survived 150 years
of pell-mell commerce under a variety of names and owners, but is
capitalizing on its newly strengthened ties to the Asia-Pacific
region and its emphasis on technological change.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland-based APL has been a wholly owned subsidiary of
Neptune Orient Lines in Singapore since last year.
</P>
<P>
   The combined operation is now the fifth largest shipping company
in the world, with $4.3 billion in annual sales and 113 vessels.
With 11.5 percent of the market for cargo in the Asia-Pacific
region, APL competes with other jumbo-sized companies such as Sea
Land Service Inc., a subsidiary of Richmond, Va.-based CSX Corp.;
Evergreen Marine Corp., of Taiwan; and China's Costco.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Rhein, the company's president and chief executive, said
selling the company to the first foreign owner in its long history
was eased by the sweetness of the deal. NOL paid $825 million in
cash for APL, shelling out $33.50 a share _ a 56 percent premium
over APL's previous stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shareholders are kissing us on both cheeks,'' Rhein said
when the deal closed.
</P>
<P>
   Rhein said he was pleased with APL's ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't increase our market share because we have no space
(on ships),'' he said. ``We don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how APL has stayed afloat for so long, Rhein credits ``a
combination of innovation and consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred and fifty years in this business is almost unheard
of,'' he said. ``Part of it is being in the right place. The West
Coast of the United States has been the right place for the last 40
to 50 years. The trade with Asia has really been instrumental.''
</P>
<P>
   APL _ through one of its lineal ancestors, the Pacific Mail
Steamship Co. _ began it trans-Pacific trade by dispatching the
300-foot-long steamship Colorado from San Francisco to Yokohama and
Hong Kong in 1867. These days, APL transports cargo only on
superships some 1,000 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Mail also sent the steamship California to San Francisco
from Panama in 1848, carrying 50 Peruvian miners and American
gold-seekers. The California survived the desertion of its crew and
the serious illness of its captain to drop anchor in San Francisco
Bay on Feb. 28, 1849. Since then, the success of APL has kept pace
with the growth of California.
</P>
<P>
   At the 150th birthday party APL threw for itself recently at the
San Francisco Maritime Museum, California state librarian Kevin
Starr praised the company for its shrewd and prescient use of
technology. APL's predecessors, Starr said, were quick to use the
latest propulsion and navigation systems, setting the pace for the
rest of the shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
   These days, said Hans Shickler, APL vice president for
information strategy, APL has applied its expertise to computerized
information-technology systems.
</P>

   ``If I, as a client, want to track 24-7, I can do it. If I want

   He added that APL's reach _ which has expanded significantly
since NOL bought APL last year _ is a big selling point to clients

   With the Neptune merger, APL gained easy access to major dock
facilities in China, Taiwan, Singapore and elsewhere in East Asia.
In the United States, its major nerve center is in Los Angeles/Long

terminal. Last year, the company opened its second-largest U.S.

   Despite APL's present size and influence, it hasn't all been
smooth sailing for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after it was launched, the pioneering Pacific Mail line was
nearly scuttled by rivals such as the tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt,
who had his own shipping company. After a series of business
reversals in the Depression of the 1930s, the financially stricken
Dollar Line (which absorbed Pacific Mail in the '20s) was taken
over outright by the U.S. government, renamed APL and run by the
government for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Privatized in 1952, San Francisco-based APL was sold to oil
tycoon Ralph K. Davies, who moved the company into the age of
containerization. Davies and his successors embraced what the
shipping industry calls intermodal transportation, integrating
ships with trains and trucks. APL is known for its use of rail cars
that carry two layers of containers, greatly increasing capacity.

PHOENIX AREA JUMPS TO TOP 10 AMONG U.S. EXPORT AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - OK, so the nearest thing metro Phoenix has to a
seaport is the mostly dry Salt River. And the skyline here is
better known for bank buildings and sports palaces than for any
tony World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   It might not look like it, but slowly and surely the
metropolitan Phoenix area - the ``Valley of the Sun'' - has become
a national hot spot for, of all things, exports.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department released figures recently showing
that metropolitan Phoenix, led by high-tech manufacturing, ranks
10th in the nation among cities that export.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Valley had ever cracked the top 10,
leapfrogging past cities like brainy Boston and cosmopolitan San
Francisco. And, despite the impact of the Asian crisis, experts say
the Valley's international image will prove to be no aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural consequence of our growing industrial base,''
said Frank Woods, director of the U.S. Commerce Department's
Phoenix Export Assistance Center.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Elliott Pollack was impressed by the fact that metro
Phoenix surpassed Denver, Dallas and Boston in exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how much this whole place is growing up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area businesses shipped $11.1 billion worth of goods in
1997, the Commerce figures show. The flow was led by high-tech
manufacturing, whose goods rely on American innovation and tend to
be in big demand overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley had ranked No. 15 among exporting cities in 1996,
when companies shipped $7.9 billion worth of goods abroad. The leap
to No. 10 takes Phoenix past Portland, Ore., Boston, San Francisco
and Orange County, Calif., among key exporting areas.
</P>
<P>
   New York, traditionally a big export center, led the parade,
with more than $29 billion in exports. The only other Western
cities ahead of Phoenix were high-tech San Jose, major seaport Los
Angeles-Long Beach and Seattle-Bellevue-Everett, home of jetmaker
Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix also was one of 10 metro areas to expand its exports by
$1 billion or more during the year. Only the Seattle area, with a
$5.6 billion gain, surpassed Phoenix's $3.2 billion boom.
</P>
<P>
   That was a 40.4 percent gain in one year. Nationally, exports
rose 9.4 percent between 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has long shipped a higher percentage of the products it
makes overseas compared with other states, Woods said. The state's
exports as a percentage of personal income was 13.5 percent in
1997, compared with the national average of 9.2 percent, Pollack
reported in the latest ``Arizona Blue Chip Forecast'' published by
Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising, given our employment mix. We have more
high-tech manufacturing than other places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Harbor International Airport has seen its outbound cargo
shipments boom over the past two years with the addition of British
Airways service, said Warren Eales, supervisory customs inspector
at the U.S. Customs Service's Phoenix port of entry. In addition,
many more Arizona products are flown or trucked to Los Angeles and
exported from there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Gateway Airport ships some cargo from nearby businesses
like TRW Corp., though it's difficult to track how much ends up
being exported, marketing director Mary Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Both airports are hoping to expand cargo facilities and add
international carriers over the next several years, which would
further boost the export numbers attributed to the Valley, Eales
and Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding an Asian carrier would be especially attractive because
of all the business that Valley corporations do with the Pacific
Rim, Eales said.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's export evolution traces back to the 1970s, Woods
said, when defense-related companies started locating here rather
than California.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of bright young people broke away from those companies
and began their own,'' Woods said. ``These companies have begun to
grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   IMPRA Inc. of Tempe, for example, has grown from a small
research company in the '70s to a manufacturer of synthetic
arteries and other vascular prosthetics that does significant
business internationally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmakers also have been long present in the Valley, Pollack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Electric and electronic equipment and supplies accounted for
more than half of the Valley's 1997 exports. Non-electric
machinery, transportation equipment, medical and biotechnological
equipment, and environmental technology also contributed to the
export growth, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of
microcontrollers, and chipmaker Intel Corp. are big contributors to
the Valley's billion-dollar numbers. Honeywell Inc. and
AlliedSignal weigh in in the aviation and transportation areas,
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor products and silicon wafers are shipped around the
world from Motorola's automated warehouse at 52nd Street and
McDowell Road, spokesman Chuck Granieri said. A breakdown of
Arizona's contributions to the company's overseas sales wasn't
available, but ``virtually anything we make would be a candidate''
for export, either as a part or finished product, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies like Motorola aren't the only Valley businesses
exporting. Small companies with cutting-edge medical products and
environmental technology have international customers seeking them
out, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   International Water Technology Corp., a subsidiary of
Phoenix-based Water Resources International, is doing 70 percent of
its business internationally, mainly with the Philippines, Vietnam
and China, general manager Dennis Tharan said.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes water treatment equipment for residential and
commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend for us has been continued growth,'' Tharan said.
``What's driving it is their desire for American technology. . . .
The first country on their mind is the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The 253 metropolitan areas in the Commerce Department's export
performance report account for about 80 percent of all U.S.
exports.
</P>
<P>
   With its $11.1 billion generated, the Valley accounted for the
bulk of Arizona's exports. The state exported $13.5 billion worth
of goods in 1997, up 36 percent from the year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix wasn't alone, though, among Arizona cities hitting
milestones. Tucson added $260.5 million to its export sales during
1997 and joined the nation's billion-dollar club, exporting $1.06
billion worth of goods. Tucson ranked No. 56 among exporting
cities, up from No. 90 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The export report, however, doesn't reflect the Asian crisis
that only began to have an effect on U.S. exports late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona exports fell 21 percent in the first half of '98, mostly
due to a $1.1 billion pullback in buying by the state's 10 largest
Asian trading partners, the state Commerce Department said in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said he doubts the Asia crisis will have a serious
impact on Arizona in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``we know we are off this year,'' Woods said more
Valley companies are turning to Latin America and Europe as markets
for their goods. &QL;

PERSONAL HEALTH: DRUNK ON LIQUID CANDY, U.S. OVERDOSES ON SUGAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for a growth market to invest in during these
economically volatile times, try the soft drink industry.
Consumption of what the Center for Science in the Public Interest
calls ``liquid candy'' in a new report has outpaced that of every
other beverage, with per capita consumption of soft drinks by
Americans doubling in the last quarter century and increasing by 43
percent since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Neither coffee, milk, beer nor bottled water comes anywhere near
the 53 gallons of soda downed by the average American in a year.
And, as Coca-Cola, which sells a billion soft drinks daily, stated
in its last annual report, ``We're just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you're looking for a reason for the growth _
outward, not upward _ of Americans in recent decades, you need not
go much further than soft drinks and other increasingly popular
sources of added sugars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1960s, the average American has increased his or
her annual intake of added sugars by about 24 pounds, for a grand
total of 152 pounds a year, even as artificial sweeteners were
rising in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   That's a whopping 760 calories a day of added sugars that are
expanding American waistlines and crowding out far more nutritious
and less calorically dense foods while, at the same time, helping
to prevent heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension and
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, there is growing evidence that the overly
sweetened American diet is contributing directly to such health
problems as heart disease and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   You say you don't use sugar? Think again. Only about a quarter
of the sugar Americans consume is added by the consumer. More than
two-thirds comes from factory-made foods, snacks and drinks.
According to the latest government food consumption survey, soft
drinks now account for one-third of the caloric sweeteners we
consume, sweets and sugars account for 16 percent, sweetened
grain-based foods (cookies, cake, pastries, etc.) another 13
percent and fruit drinks nearly 10 percent, with breakfast cereals
and other grains, milk products (ice cream, yogurt, etc.),
vegetables and fruits and fruit juices making up the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition experts say the situation has gotten much more serious
in recent years as Americans have switched to low-fat and fat-free
foods as a means of girth control. This approach, notes Bonnie
Liebman, nutritionist for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a Washington-based consumer organization, has backfired
because too many people assumed that if a food was fat-free, it was
also low in calories and could be consumed with abandon. They
forgot that something had to take the place of flavorful fat, and
more often than not, that something was sugar that brought the
caloric value of the fat-free food near to that of its full-fat
counterpart. My own brother gained 15 pounds when Entenmann's
introduced fat-free cakes and cookies, prompting him to eat three
servings instead of one.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping in mind that each gram of sugar supplies the body with
four readily assimilated calories, note how many grams of sugar
there are in the following popular foods: 12 ounces of Coke
Classic, 40; a 3-ounce Mrs. Fields Double Fudge Brownie, 47; a
2.1-ounce Three Musketeers bar, 40; 1 cup of Snapple Pink Lemonade,
27, and one 7.5-ounce slice of Cheesecake Factory Lite Cheesecake,
52. Dairy-based foods, which include the sugar naturally in milk,
break the sugar barrier with 64 sweet grams in 1 cup of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's Low Fat Blond Brownie Sundae ice cream; 75 grams in a
9-ounce McDonald's McFlurry, and 131 grams in a 20-ounce Dairy
Queen Chocolate Malt.
</P>
<P>
   Also keep in mind that the body makes little distinction between
ordinary white refined table sugar and such sweeteners as raw
sugar, honey and fructose. Sugar is, well, sugar, a sweet source of
calories and little else. Most sweet processed foods are
calorie-dense and nutrient-deficient. In other words, you don't get
back in needed sustenance what you are paying in calories consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict an ever-worsening epidemic of osteoporosis as
American youths abandon milk in favor of soft drinks. In the
``Liquid Candy'' report, Dr. Michael Jacobson noted that in the
late 1970s, teen-age boys consumed more than twice as much milk as
soft drinks and teen-age girls drank 50 percent more milk than soft
drinks. However, by the mid-1990s, the statistics had flip-flopped,
with the average teen drinking twice as much soda as milk and
people in their 20s and 30s (who acquired the soft-drink habit in
their teen-age years) drinking three times as much soda as milk.
The result has been a serious decline in calcium intake at the very
time young people are building the bone mass that will have to
sustain them for life.
</P>
<P>
   More serious perhaps is a potential rise in the risk of
developing heart disease. Dr. Gerald Reaven, an endocrinologist at
Stanford University and Shaman Pharmaceuticals, has shown that in
some people a high-sugar diet raises blood levels of insulin,
triglycerides and and other factors that increase the risk of heart
disease. Such people are said to be insulin-resistant: They need
abnormally large amounts of insulin to get sugar out of the blood
and into cells where it can be used for energy.
</P>
<P>
   Although genetics plays the major role in insulin resistance,
the other causes of this problem are being overweight and inactive.
The treatment should be obvious: Eat more foods like fruits and
vegetables and plant-based proteins that are packed with needed
nutrients and fiber and relatively low in calories, and get regular
physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some diet mongers, insulin resistance is not the
cause of overweight and a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet is
not the cure. You will lose weight on such a diet because you will
have to refrain from the bread, cakes, cookies, ice cream, sodas,
candy and other high-calorie sweets that people tend to overeat.
But how long can you maintain this restraint, and what good can
come from omitting such nutritious foods as whole-grain breads and
cereals, fruits like bananas and apples and vegetables like
potatoes and carrots?
</P>
<P>
   While heavy-duty advertising has contributed importantly to
sales of sweet foods and drinks, more subtle factors are also at
work. One, says Professor Alice Lichtenstein, nutritionist at the
U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on
Aging at Tufts University in Boston, is ``a growing sense that I'm
allowed to drink something sweet with my meals and as a snack, that
it's the in thing to do, and that it's OK to eat as much ice cream,
cake and cookies as I want if they're fat-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is the burgeoning popularity of artificial
sweeteners, which have perpetuated and enhanced the American sweet
tooth, creating a desire for heavily sweetened foods, most of which
are made with the real, caloric stuff, not with artificial
sweeteners.

TOUGH LAWYER GIVES `ALLY MCBEAL' ACTRESS DREAM ROLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her high-horsepower first name and down-to-there blonde hair
seem to complement the take-no-prisoners toughness Portia de Rossi
brings to her role on ``Ally McBeal.'' But it's all an act.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   There are some similarities, de Rossi says, between her real
life and that of her TV character, Nelle Porter. ``For example,''
she says, ``my character loathes frogs, and I discovered from
filming the episodes that I do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the frogs. For those who are not regular viewers of the
hit Fox show, John Cage (Peter MacNicol) lost his pet tree frog,
Stefan, when it fell into a toilet bowl in the firm's unisex
bathroom and was swept away when John inadvertently made use of his
remote flusher.
</P>
<P>
   A replacement frog was brought in to assuage John's grief, but
Stefan re-emerged on a subsequent episode, startling Nelle and
Georgia (Courtney Thorne-Smith) into an impromptu game of
badminton, with frog as shuttlecock.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the episodes with the frog were truly horrible for me,''
de Rossi says, ``because when the frog jumped out of the frame,
they would replace it with another frog, so by the end of a
two-page scene there were six frogs hopping about on the floor. And
I had to stand there and deliver my lines, and half the time I was
delivering them off-camera because I'd just run out screaming. I
got a big-shot nickname after that. I was called Portia de
Froggi.''
</P>
<P>
   She's really glad that story line's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big one, Stefan, I could kind of deal with that,'' she
says. ``I mean, I didn't particularly like him crawling on my head,
but it was the little guy, the little tiny frog, that got to me. I
had this fear that it was going to leap at me. It was a leaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the nature of David E. Kelley's quirky and popular
television series that a conversation with a beautiful actress
about leaping frogs and remote-controlled toilets is Topic A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nelle Porter is really a dream role,'' says de Rossi, on the
phone from her home in Los Angeles. Her Maltese, Bean, barks in the
background. ``When I was a kid, I went to law school for a year.
Part of the reason why I wanted to become an attorney was because
of the character of Susan Dey on `L.A. Law' (a series for which
Kelley wrote). That was the only TV show I allowed myself to watch
while I was studying to get into school. Being an attorney on a
David Kelley show is my ultimate goal, so I really couldn't be
happier.''
</P>
<P>
   She attended law school at the University of Melbourne, modeling
part time to pay her bills. In 1994, a casting agent saw the
20-year-old Australian and decided she would be perfect for the TV
series ``Sirens.'' De Rossi, aka Mandy Rogers, got the part and
moved to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   She met Kelley three years ago while he was developing a
half-hour show called ``Mixed Nuts.'' He remembered her from that
meeting, and now here she is on one of television's
most-talked-about series.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nelle may be the toughest lawyer in the firm of Fish and
Cage, smart and snappy but not above displaying her feminine wiles
_ for example, by unpinning and letting down her long blond hair _
when it serves her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so typical of my character to not just to have hair but
also give it a job to do,'' de Rossi says. Her hair ``introduces a
softer side of Nelle's character and walks into court with her and
argues sex discrimination cases and works really hard for its
shampoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hair also falls when she's around the man she's attracted to
_ frog-loving, nose-whistling, moment-taking and diminutive John
Cage, aka the Biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have commented that it's an odd coupling,''
she says. ``But I actually think John is a very attractive
character because he voices his emotions as he experiences them.
It's very rare for men to admit to having emotions, much less
needing to take moments to allow them to pass so they can get on
with their daily routine. I know a lot of girls are very attracted
to that character and a lot of them envy me right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cage appears to be terrified of Nelle, ``but she's a very
persistent girl and not about to give up easily,'' de Rossi says.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond persistent, Nelle is an enigma. Sexy enough to have any
man, but stuck on one so insecure. Capable of mowing down her
enemies with a few well-chosen words, but friendly toward the nasty
Ling Woo (Lucy Liu).
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an oddball, she really is,'' she says.

ON WALDEN POND, A SEASON BETWEEN 
</HEADLINE>
 POND-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Four seasons may seem like enough to anyone used to
living in only two, but the fact is that the traditional four
hardly can contain the variety the year throws at them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most interesting moments of the annual cycle are
those that fall between the seasons, those moments that are neither
quite winter nor quite spring, or neither summer nor fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, my favorite has always been that slip in time between
autumn and the harder breath of winter _ when the color has passed
from the cheeks of the trees but not all the leaves have dropped to
gather in soft, brittle piles on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was like that near the end of October at Walden Pond in
Massachusetts, about 30 miles west of Boston. The Canada geese were
flying south in droves across the crisp sky, the alders at water's
edge were naked except for the tiny seed cone at the tip of each
branch. The pond water was beginning to chill, but not so much that
the fish lost their will to bite the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Walden Pond is a small kettle pond, left in place just south of
Concord by the glaciers that covered the land 10,000 years ago. It
is essentially a dimple left in the ground by the weight of the
ice. When the ice melted, the water remained in the depression.
</P>
<P>
   Around the pond, the land rises up in places something like 20
feet above the water level in formations the geologists call
``eskers,'' which are the loose junk left behind by the ice. The
twin tracks of the railroad run along the back side of the pond.
</P>
<P>
   On the October morning, before the sun arises, the temperature
is in the low 40s and desert-dry. You can see the light catch in
the tops of the trees along the heights of the eskers and slowly
descend into the water as the morning progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Walden is an oblong stretch of lake, with one shallow bubble
along its northeastern side. A bit of the lake is cordoned off by a
footpath causeway, leaving a shallow lagoon trapped in the
backwater.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trees' leaves have dropped, leaving only the maroon
of the red maple and the bright tan of the beech tree still
hanging. A huge number of the leaves have collected on the surface
of the lagoon, making it look as if it were paved in tree
droppings.
</P>
<P>
   On the water, about 50 yards out, I can see four ducks buzzing
along, with their necks held flat on the water and their faces
half-submerged as they wiggled their heads back and forth, gleaning
a meal from the detritus of the pond. As they swam this way and
that, moving like feathered zambonis, each left a wake behind it
cleared of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, what had seemed a randomly mottled pond surface of
tree-junk took on order and meaning as the old ``contrails''
remained, leaving the water scratched with a history of duck
dinners. Their names may have been ``writ in water,'' as Keats had
it, but those signatures had persistence.
</P>
<P>
   I crouched down at the mucky edge of the water and waited.
Patience pays off. The ducks slowly swam my way. Twenty minutes
later, they were so close I could have stroked their slick,
waterproof feathers. One started and flew off, leaving two females
and a single male mallard. They scooted in circles, clapping their
bills through the jetsam. One of the females came up to the water's
edge where I knelt down and began poking her beak into the mud. She
found something to eat and continued.
</P>
<P>
   A small boy approached on the path, calling back to his mother.
I looked at him, put my finger to my lips and pointed at the birds.
He looked briefly and walked right past. I wondered what he could
have been racing to find that wasn't right here: three ducks in
arm's reach.
</P>
<P>
   It was early on a Sunday morning and the path around Walden Pond
had perhaps 10 hikers on it. It is about a mile and a half to
circumambulate the pond, so it never seemed crowded.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were a dozen or so fishermen standing at the
eastern end of the pond with their poles anchored in the sand and
bobbing weights hanging like goiters from the poles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you catch?'' I asked one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trout. Rainbows and brookies,'' he said in that edgy Boston
accent. ``This is our second time out this year and we haven't
caught anything yet. There's a fellow down the way there who pulled
in a couple of them this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   When I got to him, he had them strung on a line and submerged
back in the water about three feet out. Each was about a foot long,
one was speckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty good eating,'' was all he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I made it all the way around the pond, the sun was
up and the temperature had climbed into the upper 50s. The light
gleamed on the bark of the tree trunks and glared on the remaining
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   A century and a half ago, when Walden Pond first became known to
a wider public, it was a quiet place, a few miles outside of town,
where only the muskrats and crows came for recreation.
</P>
<P>
   The silence was shattered only momentarily when the train to
Fitchburg came through. Nowadays, a road passes right by the pond,
and a divided highway sits only a quarter-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The sound as you walk across the far shore of the pond is a
constant but subdued roar of whizzing cars, mixed with an
occasional jet airplane and the same railroad commotion.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, as you walk around to the edge of the pond
nearest the highway, its noise becomes blocked by the esker and the
pond seems quiet once more.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism is a funny profession, because it is always more
interested in what happened yesterday, or what is happening next
week. It has little use for today.
</P>
<P>
   News stories rehash the previous day and feature stories make
promises for the concerts, art shows and resort vacations you might
want to enjoy in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But a day as distinct as this one on Walden Pond, in the cusp
between the seasons, speaks only of the deliberate now, the
specific and incandescent moment, as thin and sensuous as the
membrane of the water's surface as you stick your arm through it to
pick a pebble from the pond's bottom. &QL;

DE ROSSI STALLS ON SOME SCENES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she had her first scene in the law firm's unisex bathroom,
it became official: Portia de Rossi had joined ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it was not de Rossi's first encounter with unisex
facilities. When she was 14 and in Tokyo, she walked into a unisex
restroom that was like ``Ally's,'' but with a urinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you the effect that had on a young girl,'' she
said. ``It was quite horrible. There were four or five men at the
urinal, and stalls that were occupied by both women and men. So
believe me, given that experience and the one on the show, I'll
take the one on the show any day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an odd thing. Just watching (scenes shot in the
bathroom) is odd, but performing them is odd, too, because although
we're not doing what one usually does in a stall _ we're just
standing there trying to remember our lines _ it still is weird
that we all exit, putting on our jackets and pulling up our
pants.'' &QL;

   Making a pie crust isn't as hard as you think, or as it may
appear by the length of these instructions. And not only do we give
you as much information as possible for making a delicious crust,
but we also give you Rose Levy Beranbaum's innovative twists on
some classics, like pumpkin pie with a dash of gingersnaps and
apple pie with brandied raisins, all from her newly released ``Pie
and Pastry Bible'' (Scribner, $35).

</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20-25 minutes Chilling/standing time: 2 hours,
15 minutes to overnight Cooking time: varies; follow individual pie
recipe
</P>
<P>
   For 9-inch pie shell or 9 1/2- or 10-inch-by-1-inch tart shell:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold
</P>
<P>
   1 cup bleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cream cheese, cold
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ice water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   For 9-inch lattice pie, 9-inch deep dish, 10-inch regular or
12-to-14-inch free-form tart:
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups of bleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces cream cheese, cold
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons ice water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   For two-crust 9-inch pie:
</P>
<P>
   12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold
</P>
<P>
   2 cups bleached all-purposed flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 ounces cream cheese, cold
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons ice water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Food processor method:
</P>
<P>
   Cut the butter into small (about 3/4-inch) cubes. Wrap it in
plastic wrap and freeze until solid, at least 30 minutes. Place the
flour, salt and baking powder in a reclosable gallon-size freezer
bag and freeze for at least 30 minutes. Place the flour mixture in
a food processor with the metal blade and process for a few seconds
to combine. Set the bag aside. Cut the cream cheese into 3 to 4
pieces and add to the flour. Process for about 20 seconds or until
the mixture resembles coarse meal.
</P>
<P>
   Add the frozen butter cubes and pulse until none of the butter
is larger than the size of a pea. (Toss with a fork to see it
better.) Remove the cover and add the water and vinegar. Pulse
until most of the butter is reduced to the size of small peas. The
mixture will be in particles and not hold together. Spoon it into a
plastic bag. (For double-crust pie, it is easiest to divide the
mixture in half at this point.)
</P>
<P>
   Holding both ends of the bag opening with your fingers, knead
the mixture by alternately pressing it, from the outside of the
bag, with the knuckles and heels of your hands until the mixture
holds together in one piece and feels slightly stretchy when
pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap the dough with the plastic wrap, flatten it into a disc (or
discs) and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes, preferably
overnight. (For pie shell and lattice, divide it in a ratio of
two-thirds and one-third; flatten smaller portion into a
rectangle.)
</P>
<P>
   Crusts can be stored 2 days in the refrigerator, 3 months in the
freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Hand method:
</P>
<P>
   Place a medium mixing bowl in the freezer to chill. Cut the
butter into small (about 3/4-inch) cubes. Wrap it in plastic wrap
and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the flour, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl and
whisk to combine. Add the cream cheese and rub the mixture between
your fingers to blend the cream cheese into the flour until it
resembles coarse meal. Spoon the mixture, together with the cold
butter, into a reclosable gallon-size freezer bag. Expel any air
from the bag and close it. Use a rolling pin to flatten the butter
into thin flakes. Place the bag in the freezer for at least 10
minutes or until the butter is very firm.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the mixture to the chilled bowl, scraping sides of the
bag. Set the bag aside. Sprinkle the mixture with the water and
vinegar, tossing lightly with a rubber spatula. Spoon it into the
plastic bag. (For double-crust pie, it is easiest to divide the
mixture in half at this point.)
</P>
<P>
   Holding both ends of the bag opening with your fingers, knead
the mixture by alternately pressing it, from the outside of the
bag, with the knuckles and heels of your hands until the mixture
holds together in one piece and feels slightly stretchy when
pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap the dough with the plastic wrap, flatten it into a disc (or
discs) and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes, preferably
overnight. (For pie shell and lattice, divide it into portions of
two-thirds and one-third; flatten smaller portion into a
rectangle.)
</P>
<P>
   Crusts can be stored up to 2 days in the refrigerator, 3 months
in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling pie crusts:
</P>
<P>
   Remove the dough from the refrigerator (if frozen, it is best to
allow it to defrost in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or
overnight) and allow it to sit for about 5 to 10 minutes or until
it softens enough to be malleable. Keep the dough for a lattice or
upper crust refrigerated while rolling the bottom crust.
</P>
<P>
   Always work quickly so the dough doesn't have a chance to
soften. Use a floured pastry cloth and a rolling pin sleeve, or two
sheets of lightly floured plastic wrap on top of a counter, marble
block or other smooth surface.
</P>
<P>
   Use firm, steady pressure to roll the dough into a circle about
1/8 inch thick or slightly less. As the center tends to be the
thickest part, roll from the center out. Avoid the edges, as they
tend to become thinner than the rest of the dough. Lift and move
the dough occasionally to make sure it is not sticking, and flour
lightly under the dough only if it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If at any point the dough becomes too soft, slip it, still on
the cloth or plastic wrap, onto a baking sheet, cover it and
refrigerate or freeze until firm. If using plastic wrap, you can
lift the ends of it to reposition the dough so that you are always
rolling away from you, which is the most effective technique. Turn
over the dough, in the plastic wrap, and lift and replace the wrap
as necessary to be sure the wrap is not creasing and folding into
the dough.
</P>
<P>
   To cut the dough, it's easiest and most precise to cut out the
circle of dough before transferring it to the pie or tart pan. Use
an expandable flan ring or cardboard templates as a guide. Cut with
a sharp knife. For 9-inch pies, you usually cut a 13-inch circle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest decorative borders to make is using a fork to
make slash marks along the edges. You can leave the border plain
for a rustic look, or crimp or flute the border. It's best to chill
the crust in the pan for at least 1 hour before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, reroll the scraps, chill and cut out decorative
designs such as leaves. (Bake them separately on a small baking
sheet at 400 degrees for 6 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove to a rack to cool.)
</P>
<P>
   Pre-baking:
</P>
<P>
   Flaky pie crusts must be weighted if baked without a filling, or
the bottom puffs (especially when baking powder is used.) Place a
piece of parchment or a coffee filter over the bottom crust and add
rice or dry beans to weight crust down.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees at least 20 minutes before baking.
Bake for 20 minutes with the beans or rice, remove crust and then
remove the paper, rice or beans. Prick the crust all over with a
fork and return to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes more, until pale
golden brown.

   One of the first pies Beranbaum ever made was a pumpkin pie for
her husband. She simply opened up a can of pumpkin and baked it in
a crust. It was awful. She's perfected it since then. The special
touch here is pressing gingersnaps and pecans into the crust before
adding the filling.
</P>
<P>
   Pie crust for a deep-dish 9-inch pie, rolled, in pan and chilled
for at least 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   4 (2-inch) gingersnaps
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pecan halves
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups (one 15-ounce can) unsweetened pumpkin puree
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup packed light brown sugar, preferably raw
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2/3 liquid cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2/3 liquid cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs (scant 2/3 liquid cup)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees at least 20 minutes before
baking. Plan to bake directly on the floor of the oven, or set an
oven shelf at the lowest level and place a baking stone or cookie
sheet on it before preheating.
</P>
<P>
   Process the gingersnaps and pecans until finely ground. Sprinkle
them over the bottom of the pie crust and, using your fingers and
the back of a spoon, press them into the dough to coat the entire
bottom, going about 1/2 inch up the sides.
</P>
<P>
   In a small heavy saucepan, stir together the pumpkin, brown
sugar, spices and salt. Over medium heat, bring the mixture to a
sputtering simmer, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low and
cook, stirring constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes or until thick and
shiny.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the mixture into a food processor and process for 1
minute. With the motor on, add the milk and cream, processing until
incorporated. Scrape the sides of the work bowl. Add the eggs one
at a time, processing just to incorporate, about 5 seconds after
each addition; add the vanilla along with the last egg.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the mixture into the pie shell and set it directly on the
floor of the oven (or on the baking stone). Bake the pie for 50 to
60 minutes or just until a knife inserted halfway between the
center and the edge comes out almost clean. The filling will have
puffed and the surface dulled, except for the center. The filling
will shake like jelly when moved. If the crust appears to be
darkening too much on the bottom, raise the pie to the next rack.
After 30 minutes, protect the edges with a foil ring.
</P>
<P>
   Place the baked pie on a rack to cool. When cool, the surface
will be flat. If you have made decorative designs, place them on it
now.

minutes Standing time: 1 1/2 hours to 24 hours
</P>
<P>
   A pizza pan, some sugar, cranberries and a great crust are all
it takes to make this stunning, tart dessert for the holiday table.
</P>
<P>
   Pie crust for a 14-inch free-form tart
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar, preferably superfine, divided
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 cups fresh or frozen cranberries, picked over
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   At least 1 1/2 hours and no more than 24 hours ahead of baking,
in a medium bowl place the superfine sugar (reserve 1 teaspoon for
the border) and the light brown sugar and use your fingertips to
combine them and rub out lumps of brown sugar. Cut each cranberry
in half and add them to the sugar mixture. Stir the mixture well
and set it aside for 1 hour at room temperature or, preferably,
overnight in the refrigerator. Stir the cranberry mixture well,
then stir in the walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees at least 20 minutes before
baking. Roll the pastry to a circle roughly 18 inches in diameter.
Using an expandable flan ring or a cardboard template and a sharp
knife as a guide, cut out a 16-inch circle. If the dough softens,
slip it (still on the cloth or plastic wrap) onto a baking sheet
and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes, covered, until firm before
lining the pan. The pastry is too large to slip your hands under
and support adequately. When rolled (and chilled if necessary)
transfer to a 12-to-14-inch flat round heavy steel pizza pan or an
inverted baking sheet, preferably black. To transfer it to the pan,
roll it loosely over the rolling pin or dust it lightly with flour
and fold in quarters, then unfold on pan. Leave the overhang.
</P>
<P>
   Scatter the cranberry mixture evenly over the dough, covering a
13-inch area and leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Fold the overhanging
border of dough over the outer edge of the cranberries, using your
fingers to pleat it loosely at even intervals. Brush this border
with a little milk or water and sprinkle on the reserved sugar.
(This will give the border a crunchy texture.) Cut a 10-inch round
of foil and place it gently over the cranberries, leaving the crust
uncovered. Bake the galette for 30 minutes. If not using a black
pan, plan to bake the galette directly on the oven floor;
alternatively, set an oven rack at the lowest level and place a
baking stone or cookie sheet on it before preheating.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes, place a second round of foil large enough to
cover the filling and the crust border loosely over the tart and
continue baking for about 10 minutes more or until the bottom crust
is golden brown. (Slip a small angled metal spatula or flexible
knife under the edge of the tart, lifting it slightly, to check
doneness.)
</P>
<P>
   Cool the tart on the pan on a rack for about 20 minutes or until
warm. Dust with confectioners' sugar.

   This version of apple pie comes from Beranbaum's cousin, Susan
Butterfass, and is a regular on their Thanksgiving table.
</P>
<P>
   Pie crust for a double-crust 9-inch pie
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons warm brandy
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds baking apples (use three different varieties for
contrast in texture and flavor), peeled, cored and sliced 1/4 inch
thick
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   Nonstick cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   On a floured pastry cloth or between two sheets of lightly
floured plastic wrap, roll the bottom crust 1/8 inch thick or less
and 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to the pie pan. Trim the edge
almost even with the edge of the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and
refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine the raisins and warm brandy and
macerate for 20 minutes. Drain and set aside. In a large bowl,
combine the apples, lemon juice, brown sugar, granulated sugar,
cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and toss to mix. Allow the apples to
macerate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and no more
than 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the apples and their juices to a colander suspended
over a bowl to capture the liquid. The mixture will release at
least 1/3 to 1/2 cup of liquid. In a small saucepan (preferably
with a nonstick surface) over medium-high heat, boil down the apple
liquid with the unsalted butter to about 1/4 to 1/3 cup, or until
syrupy and lightly caramelized. Swirl the liquid but do not stir
it. (Alternatively, spray a 4-cup heatproof measuring cup with
nonstick vegetable spray, add the liquid and butter and boil it in
the microwave, 6 to 7 minutes on high.) Transfer the apples to a
bowl and toss them with the cornstarch until all traces of it have
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the syrup over the apples, tossing gently. Fold in the
brandied raisins. (Do not be concerned if the liquid hardens on
contact with the apples; it will dissolve during baking.)
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the top crust large enough to cut a 12-inch circle. Use
an expandable flan ring or a cardboard template and a sharp knife
as a guide to cut the circle.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the apple mixture to the pie shell. Moisten the border
of the bottom crust by brushing it lightly with water and place the
top crust over the fruit. Tuck the overhang under the bottom-crust
border and press down all around the top to seal it. Crimp the
border using a fork or your fingers and make about 5 evenly spaced
2-inch slashes starting about 1 inch from the center and radiating
toward the edge. Cover the pie loosely with plastic wrap and
refrigerate it for 1 hour before baking to chill and relax the
pastry. This will maintain flakiness and help to keep the crust
from shrinking.

</P>
<P>
   6 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup Lyle's Golden Syrup, or dark corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate Lace Topping:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons heavy cream, cold
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Divide pie crust dough in two and
roll each piece to 18 by 8 inches. Place each piece in a 14-by-4
1/2-inch rectangular tart form. Prick with a fork and bake for 7 to
8 minutes or until golden brown. Set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees at least 15 minutes before baking
time. Set an oven rack at the lowest level before preheating.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the pecans, top sides up, in the bottom of each baked
crust. Have ready a strainer suspended over a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, combine the egg yolks, syrup, brown sugar,
butter, cream and salt. Cook over moderately low heat, stirring
constantly with a wooden spoon and without letting the mixture
boil, until it is uniform in color and just begins to thicken
slightly (160 degrees on a candy thermometer), 7 to 10 minutes.
Strain at once into the small bowl and stir in the vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly pour the filling over the pecans, coating their upper
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Place foil on top of the crust to prevent overbrowning and bake
for about 20 minutes or until the filling is puffed and golden and
just beginning to bubble around the edges. The filling will shimmy
slightly when moved. Allow the pie to cool completely on a rack,
about 45 minutes, before unmolding from the pan.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chocolate Lace Topping: In a small, microwavable bowl or
the top of a double boiler set over hot simmering water, place the
chopped chocolate. (Do not allow the water to touch the bottom of
the upper container.) Heat the chocolate, stirring often, until
melted and remove from heat; if using a microwave, stir every 15
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the cream on top of the chocolate and stir until smooth. It
should drip thickly from a spoon. If it is too thick, add a little
bourbon or a little more cream.
</P>
<P>
   Pour mixture into a reclosable quart-size freezer bag and close
it securely. Use it at once to pipe onto the cooled pie: Cut off a
very small piece from one corner of the bag and drizzle lines of
chocolate back and forth over the top of the pecans, first in one
direction and then the other to form a lacy design of chocolate
webbing.
</P>
<P>
   Cut into 1-inch strips and serve with creme fraiche or bourbon
whipped cream.

 &HT;    Commandments for crust
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a confession to make: I have a dough phobia.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurous home cook though I may be, when it comes to all
things pastry, I can be backed into a corner by the Pillsbury Dough
Boy. That giggle of his sounds sinister to me.
</P>
<P>
   So when Thanksgiving rolls around and it's time for the required
pumpkin and pecan pies, my crust has always come straight from the
freezer at the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   I have been visited by a pie priestess _ Rose Levy Beranbaum,
author of the newly released ``Pie and Pastry Bible'' (Scribner,
$35). And I have seen the light, or rather tasted a light and flaky
pie crust made by my very own hands following Beranbaum's
commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she's been known to most as the ``cake lady'' since her
``Cake Bible'' was published 10 years ago. But for more than 15
years, Beranbaum has been pondering and playing with pastry,
compiling some 674 pages of recipes, tips and instructions for
making impeccable pies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are much more afraid
</P>
<P>
   of pies than cakes,'' said Beranbaum. ``Usually it's the crust
that people fear.''
</P>
<P>
   As a cooking instructor, cookbook author and gifted baker, she's
had a goal to master the pie crust, and then teach others.
Beranbaum traveled far to understand pastry _ Denmark for Danish,
Austria for strudel and France, Hungary, Switzerland and Germany
for pastries.
</P>
<P>
   The girth of ``The Pie and Pastry Bible'' may further intimidate
the pie novice, but Beranbaum said the lengthy instructions and
tips are only a starting point, an attempt to give as much
information as possible. ``Even if you mess up, you will have a
good dough, just not a great dough,'' she assures.
</P>
<P>
   There are 18 different crust recipes, which serve as bases for
more than 300 pies and pastries, in the book. And the crusts are
keenly engineered.
</P>
<P>
   Beranbaum promotes flattening pastry dough into discs rather
than balls for chilling before rolling _ that reduces cracking. Her
recipes call for a dash of cider vinegar ``to relax the protein,''
leading to a more tender crust. She recommends kneading the dough
in a plastic bag _ to keep the warmth of your hands from softening
the butter as you work with it.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to many bakers who swear shortening makes the flakiest
crusts, Beranbaum prefers butter. ``When you use vegetable
shortening, you might as well be eating cardboard,'' she bristled.
(She does include a recipe for shortening crust in her book, but at
the same time suggests it's pointless.) Her easiest pie crust is
mixed in a food processor and uses cream cheese, which she
demonstrated in my kitchen to make a cranberry galette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you eat a cream cheese crust, you'll always wonder what's
missing from the butter-only crust,'' she said. Indeed, it's a
flaky and flavorful all-purpose crust that most can master with
little practice.
</P>
<P>
   But I wanted to put Beranbaum's manual to a true test. So before
she arrived in my kitchen, I attempted to make her basic flaky pie
crust completely by hand. Then I followed her recipe for Great
Pumpkin Pie.
</P>
<P>
   Because I had begun to confront my fear of dough by making
biscuits, I was worried about overhandling _ that cardinal sin that
toughens many a pastry. But pie dough can take more abuse,
especially with chilled ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring the crust to the pan wasn't as difficult as I
imagined _ the dough didn't tear or fall apart. I used Beranbaum's
method of folding the crust in half, then folding in half again,
then picking it up and placing it in the pan and unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   The baking is important, too. Many of Beranbaum's recipes call
for baking directly on the oven floor. That gives a direct, even
heat to the bottom of the pie pan and thus the crust.
</P>
<P>
   Except in my oven. When she looked through the bottom of my
glass Pyrex pan, Beranbaum noticed a couple of burned patches on my
crust, indicating uneven heaeeling a surge of confidence and
understanding what Beranbaum meant in the introduction to her book:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more empowering than the thrill of achieving
good pastry.''

 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A recent Food section story offering a tantalizing
array of updated variations on the chicken salad theme didn't fully
satisfy Jack Boykin of Vidalia, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think you could squeeze in an old-fashioned good recipe for a
traditionalist?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   For Boykin, and all of us who appreciate a classic, here again

 &HT;    From soup to sandwiches, leftovers a tradition
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything was perfect _ the turkey was golden, the steaming
mashed potatoes fluffy and the pumpkin pie an eye- and
stomach-satisfying masterpiece. You're stuffed, and all you want
now is a good nap.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, a sinkful of dishes and a turkey carcass are calling
your name.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rod-
</P>
<P>
   gers, author of ``The Turkey Cookbook,'' ``50 Best Stuffings and
Dressings'' and, most recently, ``Thanksgiving 101,'' knows this
moment. It is the one when he seeks help with the dishes through
the wishbone's magic. But for leftovers, wishing just won't make it
so, according to the man who travels the country teaching home
cooks how to survive Thanksgiving and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing to do is march right back in the kitchen and get
to it, Rodgers says.
</P>
<P>
   First, remove the meat that's left and freeze what won't be
going into sandwiches or salads right away. One-pound packages are
handy.
</P>
<P>
   And even if your only plan for the leftovers is a couple of
Friday sandwiches, go ahead and make a soup base. If you don't want
soup on Saturday, freeze the base for the next time turkey soup
sounds appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who recently brought his ``Thanksgiving 101'' class to
Atlanta, finds that the main ingredient at Thanksgiving, both for
the holiday feast and for the leftovers, is tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me there's no other way to eat (leftover turkey) but hot
with gravy and stuffing. It's a personal thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his routine: ``I freeze leftovers so I'll have it in
a couple of weeks to make enchiladas out of. Then I make soup on
Friday and freeze most of it. Then I have to have that sandwich on
Friday afternoon. On Friday night, I do something really light
because I'm sick of rich food, honestly, and normally do a stir-fry
like turkey broccoli.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkey breast meat tends tbout 5 minutes. Add the turkey
carcass pieces. Pour in enough cold water (about 3 quarts) to cover
the carcass by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat,
skimming off any foam that rises to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Add the parsley, thyme, bay leaf, salt and peppercorns. Reduce
the heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, adding more water as needed to
keep the carcass covered, until the broth is well-flavored, at
least 2 and up to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Place a colander over a large bowl or pot. Pour the soup base
through the colander and discard the solids. Let the base stand for
5 minutes, then skim any clear fat from the surface. (The soup base
can be frozen for up to 3 months. Cool completely, then store in
airtight containers.) Add enough water to make 2 quarts soup base,
or return to the pot and boil over high heat until reduced to 2
quarts.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you roasted a turkey using a salt rub or brine method,
omit salt from soup base. _ From ``Thanksgiving 101''

</P>
<P>
   8 large slices crusty Italian or French bread
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   In Dutch oven or flameproof casserole, heat 2 tablespoons of the

minutes. Add the kale, cover and cook until the kale wilts, about 5
minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt and crushed red
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Add the turkey soup base and wine and bring to a boil. Reduce
the heat to medium-low and partially cover. Simmer for 30 minutes.
During the last 5 minutes, stir in the turkey and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat
to 400 degrees. Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and lightly
brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Bake until the bread is
lightly toasted around the edges, about 10 minutes. Set the toasted
bread aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Add 4 bread slices to the soup, pressing them down with a large
spoon or a ladle until completely submerged. Place the remaining
bread on the top of the soup and sprinkle with cheese. Bake until
cheese is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve in deep soup bowls,
including a piece of crusty bread topping in each serving. Pass a
cruet of olive oil for drizzling.

   12 corn tortillas
</P>
<P>
   1 15-ounce container sour cream

<P>
   2 1/2 cups bite-size pieces cooked turkey (about 12 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup thawed frozen
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   3 green onions (white and green parts), chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cups shredded sharp

<P>
   Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375
degrees. Lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a gas stove, turn a burner to medium heat. Place a
tortilla directly on the burner grid and cook, turning once, until
the tortilla is warm and softened, about 20 seconds total. Repeat
with the remaining tortillas. If you have an electric stove, heat
an empty skillet over medium heat. Place a tortilla in the skillet
and cook, turning once, until softened, about 45 seconds total.
Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Stack the warmed tortillas on
a plate as you go and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, whisk the sour cream and milk until smooth.
Spread a thin layer of the salsa in the bottom of the prepared
dish. Place 4 tortillas in the bottom of the dish, tearing them to
fit. Scatter half of the turkey over the tortillas, then top with
1/2 cup of the corn and half the green onions. Drizzle with 3/4 cup
of the cheese, 1/2 cup of the salsa and about 1/3 of the sour cream

<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of physicists has found evidence that a new kind of
atomic jigsaw puzzle, in which identical puzzle pieces are allowed
to overlap each other to form complex structures, may explain why a
peculiar class of compounds exists in defiance of long established
geometric rules.
</P>
<P>
   Their demonstration, reported this month in the journal Nature,
strengthens a theory about how atoms arrange themselves in an
enigmatic type of substances called ``quasicrystals,'' discovered
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Then, many scientists were skeptical that quasicrystals could
exist, and even today, although the skeptics have been refuted,
some uncertainties remain about the mathematics underlying
quasicrystals.
</P>
<P>
   But a new theoretical framework for quasicrystals promises to
simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   Most solid matter can be roughly classified as either
``glassy,'' in which atoms are jumbled together without any order,
or crystalline, in which atoms arrayed in lattices form regularly
repeating patterns. A typical crystal is the cubic lattice of table
salt, in which atoms of sodium and chlorine alternate with each
other in a kind of three-dimensional chess board.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 150 years, rules based on well-known geometric
relationships have sufficed to explain the forms and behavior of
crystals. One such rule has to do with symmetries of rotation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a crystal is rotated in an X-ray beam and the
X-rays scattered by its atomic structure create exactly the same
pattern with each half turn of the crystal, the crystal is said to
exhibit ``two-fold symmetry.'' A repetition of the pattern every
third of a turn implies that the crystal has ``three-fold
symmetry,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the symmetries forbidden by classical crystalography
is five-fold symmetry. The reason is related to the fact that
regular pentagons _ ``tiles'' with five equilateral sides _ cannot
be fitted together to neatly cover a table top without leaving
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   The same objection applies to the three-dimensional analogue of
the pentagon: the regular icosahedron, a geometric object with 20
identical faces, each one an equilateral triangle. Icosahedrons
cannot be packed together to fill a solid space leaving no gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the old rule forbidding five-fold symmetry, Dr. Daniel
S. Schechtman, an Israeli electron microscopist working in the
United States at the National Bureau of Standards (now the National
Institute of Standards and Technology), discovered the impossible;
he found clear evidence of five-fold symmetry in a substance that
was neither as disordered as a glass nor as neatly periodic in
structure as a crystal.
</P>
<P>
   At the time in 1982, he and other scientists at the standards
bureau were experimenting for the Defense Department with alloys of
aluminum, manganese and other metals, hoping to develop a vary hard
aluminum alloy. Schechtman's discovery seemed so unlikely that it
took him and his colleagues nearly three years to verify their
findings to a point at which they felt confident enough to announce
them.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 100 quasicrystals have been made and
identified in laboratories, mostly alloys of aluminum. They have
not proved to be especially useful, but they continue to inspire
the same fascination of mathematicians and crystalographers that
Rubik's Cube induced in puzzle fans after its invention in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   About the time of Schechtman's discovery, two mathematical
physicists at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Paul J.
Steinhardt and Dr. Dov Levine, hit upon a possible structure for a
substance in which atoms are arranged in non-periodic patterns.
Their system borrowed from a mathematical game that had been
invented by Dr. Roger Penrose, an Oxford University physicist and
cosmologist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Penrose devised various pairs of complementary
``tiles'' _ parallelograms that can be laid on a flat surface with
their edges joined. Such tiles can be fitted together (using rules
stipulated by Penrose) to completely cover any flat surface,
leaving no gaps between tiles. The patterns thus formed have
endless variations and do not repeat themselves in any periodic
way.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of Penrose's tiling sets consists of two types of
rhombus, both with edges of the same length. One, a ``fat
rhombus,'' has interior angles of 108 and 72 degrees, while the
other figure in the pair, a ``skinny rhombus,'' has interior angles
of 144 and 36 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Penrose tilings based on matched pairs of tiles like these are
interesting not only to mathematicians but to commercial
enterprises. A group of entrepreneurs produced a decorative wall
covering consisting of Penrose tiles, and last year, Penrose
brought a suit against a paper company to constrain it from
embossing its toilet paper with a copy of one of his tiling
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt noticed the possibility of building a
three-dimensional structure analogous to a smooth, gapless surface
covered with two-dimensional Penrose tiles. The equivalent of the
Penrose fat and skinny rhombuses was a pair of complementary
rhomboids that could be fitted together to completely fill a
three-dimensional volume without leaving gaps.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, such a structure was found to produce icosahedral
arrays scattered through it at irregular intervals, and thus a
possible explanation for five-fold symmetry was found.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, another and simpler explanation has been
discovered. In the new version, complementary pairs of rhomboids
are replaced by stacks of 10-sided arrays of atoms.
</P>
<P>
   These arrays are identical decagons that ordinarily cannot be
fitted together to cover a surface without gaps. But using some new
rules based on the chemical and physical relationships of atoms,
the decagons can be allowed to overlap. Neighboring decagons must
be allowed, however, to share some atoms with each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a development reported this month, Steinhardt, now a
professor of mathematics at Princeton University, and his
collaborators in Korea and Japan said they believed they detected
experimental proof that the stacked decagon theory was the best
explanation for the structure of quasicrystals.
</P>
<P>
   The new theory, which was partly suggested in 1991 by Dr. Sergei
E. Burkov, a mathematician at the Landau Institute of Theoretical
Physics in Moscow, is based on the joining-together of single units
with the same shape rather than pairs of units with different
shapes like the original Penrose tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt's group believes it has experimentally validated and
improved on Burkov's theoretical scheme by producing
electron-microscope images of a real quasicrystal, an
aluminum-nickel-cobalt alloy.
</P>
<P>
   The predictions of the overlapping decagon theory closely match
electron-microscope images of the atoms in a real quasicrystal. The
simplicity of the system, Steinhardt said, accounts for the
apparent ease with which atoms find their proper places in the
structure when the metal alloy is properly prepared.
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion emerged from investigations in Japan at Tohoku
University and the National Research Institute for Metals of a
quasicrystalline alloy of aluminum, nickel and cobalt. Its formula
is Al72 Ni20 Co8.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a decagon cell as a basic unit in quasicrystals was
proposed in 1996 by Dr. Petra Gummelt, a German mathematician at
Arndt University, Greifswald, Germany. She suggested (without fully
proving) that pairs of Penrose tiles could be replaced by single
overlapping decagons to explain the structures of quasicrystals.
</P>
<P>
   But to make this work, Steinhardt said in an interview, it was
necessary to replace the mathematical Penrose matching rules with
new rules based on the interrelationships of real atoms in a
quasicrystal.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed in this light, Steinhardt and his Korean colleague, Dr.
Hyeong-Chai Jeong, reported in their Nature paper, the theoretical
structure of Al72 Ni20 Co8 turned out to closely match reality.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the end of the quasicrystal puzzle or the
debates it ignites, however.
</P>
<P>
   In a comment on Steinhardt's Nature paper, Dr. Knut W. Urban of
the Helmholtz Research Center, Julich, Germany, wrote that the new
model explaining quasicrystals must be tested further. But the
theory makes ``it worthwhile revising current models to incorporate
this new view of quasicrystal formation.''

   &UR; Curing the Iron-Poor &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria, new research shows, may be a kind of Geritol for
plankton.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian scientists have demonstrated that, much as people can
supplement their diets by taking iron in the form of a pill, a type
of Pacific Ocean plankton can get much of the iron it needs by
ingesting bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in the journal Nature, note that the
concentration of dissolved iron in sea water is often fairly low;
instead, most of the metal is bound to organic molecules. This is a
problem for plankton, as these larger complexes cannot cross the
cell membrane.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers studied a common Pacific Ocean plankton and
found that it can obtain iron by ingesting bacteria. This way of
getting iron is so efficient that plankton on bacteria grew much
faster than plankton living on dissolved iron alone. The
researchers suggest that the ability to ingest bacteria may be a
strategy by which plankton adapt to grow in iron-poor seas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Organic Jeans? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Something borrowed, something blue: Biologists in Britain say
that by taking a tip from medieval methods of indigo dyeing, modern
textile makers could produce blue jeans in a more environmentally
friendly way.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval technique used leaves from the woad plant that were
allowed to ferment in a vat of water heated to about 120 degrees
Fahrenheit. Bran was added to aid fermentation, and wood ash to
reduce the acidity that resulted.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists, who reproduced the technique and reported on
their studies in Nature, found that a distinct strain of
Clostridium bacteria plays a primary role: It strips oxygen atoms
from the indigo (a process known as reduction), making it soluble
in the water. Modern methods use large amounts of chemicals for
indigo reduction, creating an environmental headache when the used
dye is disposed of. Bacterial reduction, the researchers say, could
reduce the environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tastebuds on a Chip &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Texas have designed an
electronic ``tongue'' that they say may eventually be used by food
and beverage manufacturers to taste and analyze their products.
</P>
<P>
   The device relies on compounds that act as sensors, changing
color in the presence of specific chemicals. The Texas engineers
found a way to attach these sensors to tiny beads that are then
placed in microscopic cavities machined into a chip of silicon.
When a liquid is placed on the chip, the sensors turn colors, which
are then read and analyzed by a computer.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the ``tongue'' could hold enough kinds of sensors
that would enable it to distinguish sweet, sour, salty, bitter and
the all the nuances among them. But now, only a few basic sensors
are used _ for acidity and alkalinity, for example. No word on when
the device might be able to detect the soft woody notes and subtle
overtones of pineapple to be found in a glass of Chateau Lafite.

   UNDATED - To the digitally demure, the Internet probably feels
something like an underground stream of information and
entertainment and who knows what-all.
</P>
<P>
   It's down there _ up there? out there? _ full of cool or scary
stuff to buy or consume or just momentarily gawk upon. Personal
computers are the wells by which you draw the magic water. And
maybe that Bill Gates fellow wants to control it all. Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The Net is a mysterious place even to the people who use it
every day. One minute it's something you've never heard of, the
next minute you're pumping out www.whatevers like a gifted lab
monkey. How (begin ital) do (end ital) all those intriguing
work-at-home-and-make-big-bucks- in-your-spare-time opportunities
make it into my daily delivery of e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   Robert X. Cringely, PBS' techno-Sherpa, on Wednesday offers a
crash course in Internet history. It's a fascinating tale, told in
slick style, and it is likely way more important or interesting
than any of its sweeps-concluding competition.
</P>
<P>
   Cringely, a former computer-industry gossip columnist for
``InfoWorld'' magazine, has a flair for the telling quip, and he
generally oozes irony. He frequently takes a moment to define a
term _ packet switching, protocol, browser, etc. _ critical to the
story, speaking mostly in plain English.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in ``Triumph of the Nerds,'' his 1996
history-of-the-PC piece for PBS, Cringely visits the sites where
computing history was made, finds the history-makers and gets them
talking.
</P>
<P>
   If you're new to this world, these three hours might make you
passably conversational with neighborhood teens. If the tame
technology of TV still scares you _ (begin ital) and you're reading
a story about computers? (end ital) _ Stephen Segaller,
producer-director of the ``Nerds'' special, has written a companion
book with the same title.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour, Cringely takes viewers to the small office in
the bowels of the Pentagon _ ``home of the squarest jaws on the
planet,'' he says _ in which the Internet was born. Originally a
Cold War response to America's apparent technological disadvantage
to the Commies, the ARPAnet _ Advanced Research Projects
Administration network _ was designed to link mainframes at a few
universities across the country. It worked, really well.
</P>
<P>
   In this hour, Cringely also explains the history of the mighty
(at) sign, around which all modern discourse now hinges.
</P>
<P>
   In hour two, Cringely wades deep into the Internet's commercial
explosion, diagraming the power flow of a business start-up in the
domain of billionaire geeks.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with the founding brains, typically grungy
post-hackers who fuel their dream with junk food and credit-card
debt. Then come the venture capitalists. Then come the professional
business managers _ ``adult supervision'' in Cringely-speak. Then
comes everybody getting vastly rich. Then, inevitably it seems,
comes acrimony between all parties.
</P>
<P>
   On a cheerier note, Grateful Dead fans played a key role in
development of the Internet as well _ on The Well, actually, a
virtual community that, uh, mushroomed in the late 1980s as a
method by which Dead Heads tracked their fave combo.
</P>
<P>
   In the third hour, Cringely explains the World Wide Web, and
introduces viewers to the man who made the characters http://www
the signature of the cyberage.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we also meet the lads from the Internet media company
called Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Cringely got actual footage of the just-out-of-Stanford founding
crew hanging out in their proverbial start-up garage. This was in
1994, when all they had was a sack of communal rice.
</P>
<P>
   The story then fast-forwards to the same young men today, now
worth a communal 10 figures-plus, and still in the pre-acrimony
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The archival garage segments were gathered when Cringely was
working on ``Triumph of the Nerds'' and are documentary gold.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really explains how Internet companies can be worth so
much without having turned much of a profit, but the carny carousel
of paper wealth spins on. One of the sly architectural touches in
the cool new Excite world headquarters is a fanciful garage door _
a reminder of those distant days when the six young bosses weren't
richer than Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At three full hours, Cringely's Internet tour might be a bit of
a Siberian trek, especially for TV-tainted attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cringely has a professional gossip's weakness for hamming
it up, frequently inserting himself into settings _ simple
establishing shots, for example _ that probably would look fine
without him.
</P>
<P>
   But he mostly entertains while informing, and that's a priceless
talent in this day and age.
</P>
<P>
   Cringely's sense of humor can be clean-room dry. For example,
his personal Web page _ www.pbs.org/cringely (actually a sub-page
on the larger PBS site) _ is titled ``I, Cringely.''
</P>
<P>
   Which seems either arch and pompous or loopy and
self-deprecating until you learn that Cringely isn't his real name.
</P>
<P>
   There's a long story behind how Mark Stephens became Robert X.
Cringely, and Stephens/Cringely himself hates telling it.
</P>
<P>
   Another person, a woman, still writes the ``InfoWorld'' gossip
column using the Cringely name. Lawyers have profited from the
situation. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious, artificial identities are just one of the Internet's
many modern charms. &QL;

   &UR; Sensing a Storm &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why can my dog sense when a storm is coming an hour before it
arrives?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Sense'' in its physical meaning is the key word, according
to Dr. Lee Zasloff, associate director of the Center for Animals in
Society at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of
California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Many case reports cite instances of animals' behaving in strange
ways before natural phenomena, she said, but few scientific data
exist on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic animals, dogs and cats in particular, do have hearing
and other sensory capacities that are greater than ours,'' Dr.
Zasloff, a behavioral scientist, said. ``It wouldn't be surprising
if they were able to sense these kinds of things better.''
</P>
<P>
   Their hearing is more sensitive and covers a wider frequency
range, and they have a much better sense of smell, she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists say that storm winds may carry smells from other
areas and temperature and humidity differences that are detectable
far in advance of any actual precipitation, and even human beings
sometimes say they can smell when snow is coming.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true of certain kinds of heavy snow storms
accompanied by winds from the south, said Dan Graf, a meteorologist
at Pennsylvania State University.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ Cissy Bennett, a high school biology teacher in
Birmingham, Ala., has to use a textbook with a disclaimer in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution,'' says the message from the Alabama State Board of
Education, ``is a controversial theory some scientists present as
scientific explanation for the origin of living things, such as
plants, animals and humans. No one was present when life first
appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement about life's origins
should be considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not deter Ms. Bennett from teaching her students that
humans and all other species developed from common ancestors under
the influence of natural selection. ``I tell them on the first day,
`We are going to learn about evolution,' '' she said. `` `I do not
care if you believe what I am saying, but you will learn.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But some teachers are more intimidated by the disclaimer. One
colleague, Ms. Bennett said, once told her that she thought
teaching evolution was against the law.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 73 years since another high school biology teacher,
John Scopes, was found guilty under Tennessee law for teaching that
humans and apes descended from a common ancestor, and 30 years
since the United States Supreme Court essentially overturned the
Scopes ruling and declared that states could not prohibit teachers
from discussing evolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Darwin's theory still faces challenges in the
nation's classrooms from increasingly sophisticated creationists,
state and local school boards that leave evolution out of science
education, and many biology teachers who themselves reject
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evolution-creation controversy is as charged today as it
was when Scopes was tried,'' said Randy Moore, a professor of
biology at Louisville University in Kentucky and the editor of The
American Biology Teacher, a magazine published by the National
Association of Biology Teachers. ``Creationists are more powerful
than ever. They're winning, not in terms of courts cases, but what
happens in classrooms. I get three to five phone calls a week from
teachers with problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent caller, Moore said, told him that a high school
principal in Louisville had used the public address system in his
school to announce that evolution had been overthrown and no longer
needed to be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with incidents like these, teachers of evolution have been
in ``a defensive mode,'' said Wayne Carley, executive director of
the 7,500-member biology teachers association.
</P>
<P>
   The association and other groups like the National Academy of
Sciences and the largest professional group of evolutionists, the
Society for the Study of Evolution, are embarking on a concerted
effort to change the way Americans view evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution was at the center of the biology teachers' annual
convention, which brought Moore and Ms. Bennett and about 1,500
other teachers to Reno this month. Teachers heard about the latest
challenges in the classroom, received a copy of a book published
earlier this year by the National Academy of Sciences about
teaching evolution, and crowded into more than a dozen workshops on
teaching the theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine the lack of emphasis on evolution in
kindergarten through 12th grade, with the immense popularity of
creationism among the public, and the industry of discrediting
evolution,'' Moore said, ``it's easy to see why half of the
population believes humans were created 10,000 years ago and lived
with dinosaurs. It is by far the biggest failure of science
education from top to bottom.''

   The challenges to teaching evolution have changed, said Dr.
Eugenie C. Scott, executive director of the National Center for
Science Education, which monitors the teaching of creationism in
schools and communities nationwide. The latest wrinkle, Scott said,
is to try to introduce into the classroom other theories like
``intelligent design'' _ the idea that the universe is so
impossibly complex that it must have been designed on purpose by an
omniscient creator.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism ranges from literal interpretations of Genesis in
the Bible to the belief that God created and set in motion the
process of evolution itself, a view shared by up to 40 percent of
scientists according to national surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, who has written four books attacking ``the
dogmatic teaching of Darwinian evolution,'' advocates that students
be taught to be distrustful of the evolution theory.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is affiliated with Access Research Network, a group in
Colorado Springs, Colo., that promotes intelligent design in the
biology textbook ``Of Pandas and People.''
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, some sessions featured well-established
lessons like comparing early hominid skulls and fossil footprints
to the heads and feet of students in classes. But other workshops
discussed current research in evolutionary biology and how the
latest findings could be used to add new life to lessons.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project, for example, is finding an increasing
number of genes that are shared by different species, from worms to
mice to humans.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of bacteria that cause infections to become
increasingly resistant to antibiotics, and the resistance insects
develop to pesticides offer real life examples of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers were even shown a case where HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, developed a resistance to different drugs within a patient
suffering from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The association honored two high school science teachers who
served on the front lines in the legal fight to teach evolution.
Susan Epperson of Arkansas and Don Aguillard of Louisiana both took
legal cases to the United States Supreme Court. Epperson vs.
Arkansas outlawed state bans on teaching evolution in 1968, and in
Edwards vs. Aguillard, the Court ruled in 1987 that states could
not require that ``creation science'' be taught along with
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The two teachers, who volunteered to serve in these test cases,
have become folk heroes to some biology teachers. They have been
stopped in the halls to autograph programs and have their pictures
taken. But despite their legal victories, Ms. Epperson and
Aguillard warned that the battle goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight has shifted from people like Susan and myself to
you,'' Aguillard told the teachers. ``The task has shifted from
constitutional challenges to grass roots efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey of 387 Louisiana biology teachers, Aguillard
found that 24 percent believed in creationism and 29 percent
believed it was appropriate for high school biology classes. Some
teachers he interviewed said they ignored evolution, and one told
Aguillard, ``I try to poke as many holes in it as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   To Aguillard and others in the biology teachers association
those findings, which echo previous studies in other states,
indicate that creationism is not fading away, but is itself
evolving.
</P>
<P>
   The center for science education is involved in a court case
challenging a school board resolution in Tangipahoa, La., that
instructs teachers to read a disclaimer recommending that students
consider ``other concepts'' than evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The center is also mulling a legal challenge to the Alabama
disclaimer, but that may be tough, said Scott, because the warning
is written with finesse. ``This is bad science, and the First
Amendment doesn't protect us from bad science,'' she said. ``We
would have to convince a judge that it is a disguised sectarian
religious view.''
</P>
<P>
   Cissy Bennett, for one, is not sure that a legal challenge is
the way to go. People are tired of the controversy, she said.
Biology teachers in Alabama won a fight to get decent textbooks
that include evolution. The disclaimer ``seemed like a good
compromise,'' she said, adding: ``We're able to get around it. Most
teachers just teach their stuff and ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   At their annual meeting, biology teachers shared strategies for
dealing with problems in class. Most start their classes by
discussing the differences between science and religion, and talk
about the limits of science and the fact that theories are always
subject to correction and change.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers acknowledge their own faiths and offer to talk
with students outside class. Most have found ways to go on teaching
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't change very many minds,'' said Greg Wickett, a 10th
grade biology teacher in Oregon. ``When a kid is 15 years old, of
course his minister and parents are influencing him more than his
teachers. That's how it should be. I've had students who called me
the devil. I told them I wasn't trying to convert them. I'm not
trying to teach them religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irene Eckstrand, who heads a new education committee of the
Society for the Study of Evolution, says she believes it is almost
inevitable that teachers will be defensive. ``They're held
accountable to so many people,'' said Dr. Eckstrand, whose group is
working with the teachers association to integrate new research
into classes. ``Teachers are on the front line. But I'd like to see
us not be so defensive. We have a wonderful story to tell.''

BOSTON'S MONET EXHIBIT PROVES MODERN ART GIANT IS STILL RELEVANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON - When this century began, painter Oscar-Claude Monet was
60 years old. He was a portly, comfortable bourgeois with a
gray-haired crew cut and a long grizzled beard out of which
normally poked a smelly cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   He lived on his estate outside Paris and loved most of all his
family, his automobile and his flower garden. He was also wealthy
enough to afford servants to tend each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Monet had been a painter for more than 30 years. He had helped
invent Impressionism in the 1870s, and over the years, he had
produced more than a thousand canvases. By his 60th birthday, his
shows regularly sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from that time until his death in 1926, at an age most
people contemplate retirement, he produced nearly 450 new
paintings. But what was most astonishing wasn't the number of the
works, but their striking originality.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Monet felt challenged by the new century and its
younger artists and meant to prove he still had what it took. He
did.
</P>
<P>
   His work in the 20th century is distinct enough, and important
enough, that it currently supports two large traveling exhibitions.
The smaller of them features pieces from the Musee Marmottan in
France and is in Portland, Ore., and will visit Phoenix in the
fall. The larger is immense: 80 pieces collected from all around
the world, and it is now on view at the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston, where it will remain until Dec. 27. Its only other venue
will be London.
</P>
<P>
   By size alone, the Boston show is impressive. It eats up nearly
15,000 square feet of gallery space; on view is 1,500 square feet
of painted canvas. The 80 works come from 68 separate collections
from as far away as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They cover all the themes of his late work: the gardens, the
waterlilies, the landscapes he painted on visits to London and
Venice. They also show him growing less and less fussy over
details.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the result is Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Monet achieved fame by painting what he saw, only more
accurately and with fewer preconceptions than anyone else. He
painted what he saw, and not what convention told him was there.
And he looked very, very hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monet is only an eye,'' Paul Cezanne remarked, ``but (begin
ital) what (end ital) an eye!''
</P>
<P>
   He was interested not only in what a tree looked like, but what
it looked like at 4 p.m. on a clear day in November. Or what it
looked like at 10 in the morning in May. He was fascinated with the
effect of light and weather on the things of this world, and he
recorded them in minute exactness, often paying closer attention to
the light than to the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people think of Impressionism as fuzzy, for Monet,
it was incredibly precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm chasing the merest sliver of color,'' he said. ``It's my
own fault. I want to grasp the intangible. It's terrible how the
light runs out, taking color with it. Color, any color, lasts a
second, sometimes three or four minutes at the most. What to do,
what to paint in three or four minutes? They're gone, you have to
stop. Ah, how I suffer, how painting makes me suffer. It tortures
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, especially in the second half of his career, was
turned into series. There are famous series of the Rouen Cathedral,
of haystacks, of poplar trees.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston show, there are series paintings of Charing Cross
Bridge and Waterloo Bridge in London, all of them in various states
of fog, and of Grand Canal and the Ducal Palace in Venice, all of
them in various states of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   He would set up his canvas in one spot and return to it at the
same time each day to catch the same light, until the painting was
finished. Sometimes, he would have multiple canvases, working on
one at sunrise, one in the morning, one at noon, one in the
afternoon and yet another at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is always working on two or three canvases at once,'' wrote
journalist Georges Jeanniot, who visited Monet at his home. ``He
brings them all along and puts them on the easel as the light
changes. This is his method.''
</P>
<P>
   As he got older, his horizon shrank. He traveled out less often
and spent longer hours in his yard, painting over and over the
flowers he planted in his garden, the Japanese bridge and the
waterlilies that covered the pond he built.
</P>
<P>
   But he never lost touch with the visual reality in front of his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the central lesson of the Boston show, which chronicles
how, as Monet got older, he got more and more abstract. But unlike
the younger self-consciously modern artists, such as Kandinsky, who
made abstracts out of mere color and shape, or the younger Picasso,
who turned the world into twisted graphic icons of itself, Monet
never retreated from reality.
</P>
<P>
   His last, great mural-size waterlily paintings, made as a gift
to his native country after the First World War, are often pale
skeins of color, with no outlines, no simple subject. Yet, in them,
there is always the seen world, looked at so intently that it glows
beyond the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston show, the canvases are hung in roughly
chronological order, and we can follow the development of the
painter. The canvases get bigger the deeper into the show we walk,
until, in the final galleries, we are shown the wall-size
waterlilies, and they take your breath away.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to sense the modernness of them: They are not some
flowers in a vase captured in the square of canvas like a horse in
a corral. They are glowing patches of color. It is only with
difficulty that you can make out the subject of them: the wisteria,
the nymphaea, the agapanthus, growing in and reflected by the
surface of the water.
</P>
<P>
   They look modern, with an emphasis on the paint and duck and can
easily pass for abstract _ but for that anchor line set fast in the
bottom mud of reality. It is the paint that is captured, like the
horse in the corral, not the plants.
</P>
<P>
   The corners, for instance. Monet was not interested in corners.
One after another, the edges and corners of the canvases show
Monet's neglect. The paint is thickest in the middle, thinnest away
from the middle, sometimes dwindling to bare canvas in the bottom
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Monet has three different surfaces. The first _ and earliest _
is the flat, refined surface with brushwork smoothed over.
</P>
<P>
   Second _ and most common _ is the loose, fast brushwork that
daubs color on in twists of the brush _ there thick, there thin _
so you can almost see him painting in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   The third is the most highly manufactured surface. It looks as
if he troweled down a layer as thick as textured plaster. It is
almost sculptural.
</P>
<P>
   The large, late paintings particularly show this last surface _
although as he leaves the center of the canvas, the texture thins.
Again, it is as if we can see him working before our eyes. It is
easy to spot which brush strokes came later in the process and
which earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This obsession with surface is modern. But Monet yanks us back
into the optical world he loved, and we are forced once more to see
the flowers. It is a strong, magnetic pull.
</P>
<P>
   As he got older and aged into the first quarter of this century,
he was increasingly defined by that dichotomy. It was paint as
paint, and flowers as flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from painting and gardening,'' he said, ``I'm good for
nothing.'' &QL;

WHEN MAY JOURNALISTS LIE? ARIZONA SUIT CHALLENGES ABC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When may journalists lie in pursuit of an important
truth and a big story?
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit against ABC-TV and star reporter Diane Sawyer in a
federal court in Phoenix is part of a national battle over
reporters' techniques in gathering the news. The outcome hinges on
that very question.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a hidden camera and phony identities, the ABC
newsmagazine ``PrimeTime Live'' came to Phoenix in 1994 for an
elaborate undercover investigation of Consultants Medical Lab,
which examined Pap smear slides for signs of cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation led first to a dramatic warning by Sawyer that
many cancers were going undetected because of shoddy analysis by
overworked technicians. Then it spawned the Phoenix lawsuit, which
challenges not just the veracity of the report but the undercover
techniques behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which awaits a key ruling from U.S. District Judge
Roslyn Silver of Phoenix, pits the media's First Amendment rights
to seek the truth against the individual's rights to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These news-gathering issues are the hot area of First
Amendment law,'' said Phoenix attorney Daniel Barr.
</P>
<P>
   He said suits are claiming violations of privacy rights not only
through clandestine techniques but also with cameras carried openly
by newsmen accompanying police as they execute search warrants.
</P>
<P>
   The print media are also part of the raging debate. Jane
Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press, pointed to the ``Cincinnati Enquirer'''s repudiation
this year of its expose of hometown Chiquita Brands International
Inc. The paper alleged that Chiquita had attempted to bribe
officials in Colombia, sprayed pesticides on workers, and secretly
controlled other banana companies.
</P>
<P>
   But after publication came a humiliating apology. Expressing
regret that its reporter had used voice-mail messages stolen from
the company, the ``Enquirer'' averted a massive lawsuit by writing
a check it said was ``in excess'' of $10 million. The settlement
left many unanswered questions about the substance of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Kirtley said the issue of news-gathering techniques ``is the
cutting-edge issue in terms of what the parameters of the First
Amendment will be, because the Supreme Court has never told us much
about what the First Amendment protection for news gathering is.''
</P>
<P>
   Deception long has been a part of journalism, from the
restaurant critic who dons a wig to reporters posing as apartment
renters for stories on discrimination. But although a reporter who
lied to stop a mass murder would be unlikely to face a lawsuit, the
lines of permissible deceit are hard to define. Now, technological
advances have sharpened the questions, and courts are being asked
for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rishwain, attorney for the Phoenix man who owned the lab
targeted by ``PrimeTime,'' puts the Phoenix case in a dramatic
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media are effectively arguing that the First Amendment
trumps the right of privacy,'' said the Los Angeles attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, all Americans are going to be subject to
fraud and trespass and invasions of privacy by the media. The media
could do that with impunity and say, `We have a press pass.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hurwitz, the Phoenix lawyer representing ABC in the case,
declined to comment, explaining that it was ABC policy not to have
its lawyers publicly discuss matters in litigation. But in papers
filed with the court, he has rejected the claim that the network
violated the privacy of John Devaraj.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to clashing legal theories, changing public
attitudes may steer the course of the controversy, legal experts
say. The public has grown more hostile toward the press at a time
when technological advances and competitive pressures have
sharpened media intrusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In a much-publicized courtroom battle between ABC and the Food
Lion grocery store chain, a North Carolina jury smacked down the
network's attempt to raise the shield of public-service journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Food Lion $5.5 million in punitive damages
after ``PrimeTime Live'' used hidden cameras as it accused Food
Lion of such unappetizing practices as bleaching spoiled chicken
and tampering with expiration dates.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interesting twist that shows the shape of the new
legal battleground, the jury never saw the expose. For although
Food Lion's public response was to condemn the report as a fraud,
the company's courtroom attack did not challenge its accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had brought a traditional libel case, they would have
lost on summary judgment,'' lawyer Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with its landmark 1964 ``Sullivan vs. New York Times''
decision, the Supreme Court has recognized broad defenses for the
media in libel cases involving public figures or matters of public
concern. The high court ruled that a libel plaintiff had to prove
not only that a news report was false but that the reporter knew it
was false or demonstrated ``reckless disregard'' for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Although the libel bar is set high, Food Lion's lawyers faced
less formidable obstacles when they claimed other ``tort''
violations arising from the way the information was gathered. They
alleged that ``PrimeTime'' producers who used phony resumes to get
supermarket jobs had breached their duty as employees and had
trespassed on company property.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case of media uncovering wrongdoing,'' a Food
Lion attorney said. ``This is a case of media doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on the jury to ``stop `PrimeTime Live' from doing this
to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the Phoenix case are more complex than those in the
Food Lion Case. ABC went to extraordinary steps to penetrate
Devaraj's office, establishing two phony companies that contacted
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   First, the producers concocted the Huron Women's Health
Collective, which contacted Devaraj with an urgent request. A
Michigan blizzard was preventing technicians from reaching the lab,
they said, so they wanted to fly a shipment of more than 600 slides
to Phoenix for analysis over a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While the slides were being examined by Devaraj's staff, the
second fake company showed up, ostensibly for business discussions
but actually to make undercover video recordings of work being done
on the slides from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In her report, Diane Sawyer announced that the lab had failed to
identify two of four slides that showed ``clear cut cancer,''
according to medical experts retained by ABC. It also failed to
identify three of 19 slides that showed abnormalities, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And the lab's response on the show?
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the manager of the lab what had happened,'' Sawyer
said. ``He said to us, if mistakes were made, it was an unusual
circumstance, and he vowed not to take such a large caseload
again.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sawyer reported that one of the technicians who misread
the slides had been working ``exhausting days'' and that another
had examined 200 slides at a rate far faster than the industry
standard, a medical expert drew the chilling moral for the
nationwide audience:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like speeding on highways, and the faster you go, the
worse accidents are and the higher the death rates go up.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed by Rishwain lays out the toll the story took
on Devaraj. It claims his business has been destroyed, his home and
savings lost, and his standing in the community devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Silver is expected to decide soon whether to send the case
to a jury trial or dismiss it outright. As she ponders her
decision, she will be looking at the limited body of relevant case
law, including two decisions pointing opposite ways.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a 1971 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision
against Time Inc., publisher of ``Life'' magazine. The case was
prompted by ``Life's`` use of a hidden camera to photograph a man
who was treating patients at his home. He claimed to be able to
heal with clay, minerals and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding a District Court decision, the appeals panel wrote,
``The First Amendment has never been construed to accord newsmen
immunity from torts or crimes committed during the course of news
gathering. The First Amendment is not a license to trespass, to
steal, or to intrude by electronic means into the precincts of
another's home or office.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion contrasts with the view of a federal appellate
judge in Chicago who overturned a fraud judgment against ABC. That
case stemmed from an undercover investigation at an eye clinic that
allegedly performed unnecessary cataract surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that the Supreme Court had shielded the press
against defamation suits ``with many safeguards designed to protect
a vigorous market in ideas.'' Then he ruled that such protection
also should apply in the story about the eye clinic, which had
accused ABC of fraud in its news-gathering techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded, ``Today's `tabloid'-style investigative
television reportage, conducted by networks desperate for viewers
in an increasingly competitive television market constitutes _
although it is often shrill, one-sided and offensive, and sometimes
defamatory _ an important part of that market. It is entitled to
all the safeguards with which the Supreme Court has surrounded
liability for defamation. And it is entitled to them regardless of
the name of the tort.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Judge Silver's decision may be, whoever loses is likely
to appeal. That would send the case on a course that could end at
the Supreme Court, and the ultimate test of a reporter's right to
lie. &QL;

ENDURING IMAGES: TOUGH BOYS AND SWEET GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a mother of a 2-year-old child, I am rather too intimately
acquainted with a large, purple TV dinosaur named Barney. I know
the lyrics to a number of the show's exhortatory songs (my personal
favorite: ``It's time to CLEAN UP! CLEAN UP! 'Cause we want to do
our share!''), and I've attended to the carefully selected
multisociocultural cast. The rotating group of children has
included whites, blacks, Chinese, Koreans, Hispanics, Arabs, kids
in wheelchairs, a blind girl, a boy with a hearing aid, chubby
kids, identical twin kids.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one thing I have never seen amid the peppy
junior rainbow coalition it is a child whose sex is at all
ambiguous, who is not, in other words, clearly and unmistakably
either a girl or a boy. Virtually all the girls have long,
luxurious hair, the boys short. And though the girls do wear pants,
they as often wear dresses, accoutred with nifty striped knee socks
or prim white anklets.
</P>
<P>
   Such stylistic options are obviously not open to the Barney
boys, who are close to horror-struck when they pay an imaginary
visit to Scotland and meet a male bagpipe player wearing a kilt.
``Don't worry,'' the man assures them. ``This is just for special
occasions; normally I dress just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, it has become almost fashionable to toss
around terms like ``transgender'' and ``meta-sexual.'' A fall issue
of the liberal digest, Utne Reader, is emblazoned with a picture of
a man with breasts and a woman without. ``It's 2 a.m.,'' a cover
headline says. ``Do you know what sex you are? Does anybody?''
</P>
<P>
   The media has given wide play to the cause of intersexuals, or
hermaphrodites, who reject the notion of the binary sex code and
all surgical attempts to enforce it. Glam rock and its androgynous
spoofery is back, sort of. We love gender-benders, cross-dressers,
and gays when they're well-behaved. They're so interesting and
cute, and they remind us of how complex and interdigitating the
concepts of maleness and femaleness can be. How far we've
progressed; how nuanced is our thinking!
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, when it comes to our children. For our
children, the categorical distinctions we make between male and
female remain inviolate, more so, in a sense, than ever before.
After a brief period in the 1970's and early 1980's of questioning
infant apartheid by pink and blue, the world has ``rediscovered''
just how different boys and girls really are. And if you're a
parent, you can't get away from the drumbeat of La Difference. On
commercial television, the advertisements for boys' toys roar,
``Smash 'em, hate 'em, annihilate 'em!'' while the jingles for
girls' toys are so taffy-sweet you'll go running for the dental
floss.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the crass media. Everybody reinforces the old
truisms. I go to a party of standard, middle-class Nature
Conservancy donor-card types, and an older boy takes away my
daughter's cup of milk. I jokingly warn my daughter, ``You've got
to watch out for those older kids.'' No, the boy's mother says.
It's because he's a boy. A moment later, an older girl grabs away
my daughter's cup of milk, but, um, that doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   I take my daughter shopping at the local food co-op and wend my
way through aisles of bulk organic kasha and woven hemp shopping
bags, and still the store clerks must comment on how ``good'' and
``nice'' little girls are. ``If my son were here,'' one said,
``he'd be pulling everything off the shelves!'' Later, when I get
home and my daughter sends an avalanche of books crashing to the
floor and clobbers the cat with a wooden block, I consider calling
the clerk and offering a child swap, but, hey, my daughter's
longish hair is awfully pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the mounting insistence that boys will be boys and girls
will behave, by birth and by genotype, is, I believe, the rising
popularity of fields like behavioral genetics and evolutionary
psychology, which habitually reach sweeping conclusions about deep
human nature on the basis of the scantiest of data. Geneticists
find behavioral differences between two sets of girls with a
chromosomal condition called Turner's syndrome, and the next thing
you know they're speculating grandly about a gene for social
graciousness, which girls have but boys don't.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary psychologists distribute questionnaires to college
students about what qualities they find attractive in the opposite
sex, and the male students say they like kind, funny, intelligent,
considerate, attractive women; and the female students say they
like kind, funny, intelligent, considerate, industrious men; and
evolutionary psychologists conclude, ``Ah ha! Men and women really
are different after all _ men want comely mates, women want
ambitious mates, and it has been thus since that mystical,
all-powerful Stone Age.''
</P>
<P>
   So if women aim to please, and men aim to get ahead, we may see
such behaviors as the fruits of sexual selection, the need for each
sex to respond to the desires of the other. Which, when scaled down
to suit our pre-sexual children works out roughly as: boys are
naturally aggressive, girls are naturally solicitous.
</P>
<P>
   On average, of course; scientists are always careful to speak of
averages rather than absolutes. But still, there you are, and
there's my girl, deemed ``nice'' by nature, and there's the boy
gestating in the belly of a friend of mine, who will, a mother of
sons assures my friend, ``be a radical change'' from the daughter
my friend already had.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Mackoff, a psychologist in Seattle and the author of
``Growing a Girl: Seven Strategies for Raising a Strong, Spirited
Daughter'' (Dell; $12.95), points out that we are now using our
children to fight the old battle of the sexes. ``The new question
is, Who has it worse, boys or girls?'' she said. ``Who is more
shortchanged by society?''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, girls are said to suffer a crushing loss of
self-confidence at puberty, and thus to be at a disadvantage
relative to boys. On the other hand, a new line of argument says
that boys are worse off, for they suffer from comparatively higher
rates of conduct disorder, are more likely to be put on medications
like Ritalin, and have a higher risk of being truants and high
school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new war, but the weapons we're using are the same ones
we've always used in the battle of the sexes, and it always comes
down to nature versus nurture,'' Dr. Mackoff said. ``Those who
argue that boys are shortchanged by this culture insist that boys
will be boys by nature.'' As an example, she cites another recent
book, ``The Wonder of Boys'' (Tarcher; $24.95), in which the
author, Michael Gurian, insists that boys are rambunctious and
high-spirited not because they watch too many crush 'em, mush 'em
TV commercials or any other such ``politically correct'' reason,
but because, yes, testosterone makes them do it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, some similar psycho-irritant _ estrogen? choler? Saturn in
retrograde? _ makes me resent the persistent emphasis on sexual
dialectics, particularly when it is writ small and applied to my
daughter and her peers. Are there ``innate'' sex differences?
Possibly, on average, with a staggering amount of overlap. Ho hum!
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many conflicting theories about sex differences
that may never be resolved,'' Dr. Mackoff said. ``But we don't have
to deny that sex differences may exist, or tackle that problem to
the ground, to recognize that the biggest difference between girls
and boys is in how we treat them. There is where our effort and
focus should be. As long as we dwell obsessively on sex
differences, we're going to put limits on our kids and shortchange
every one of them.''

PHOENIX CHIEF ENVISIONS POLICE BECOMING `PROBLEM SOLVERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If you had told me eight years ago that I'd see the
local cops go from hard-core street warriors to aspiring social
engineers, I'd have said I'd believe it when I see pigs fly.
</P>
<P>
   But now, I swear I perceive pigs taking wing.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's police chief and other Phoenix area law enforcers want
to lead us all into an age of social enlightenment wherein could-be
gang members are nurtured into good citizens, slums are bulldozed
and single moms are embraced by a caring society.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Harold Hurtt was reputed to be a pretty tough
street cop years ago. But he sounded like an ACLU-loving,
bleeding-heart liberal the other day as he sat in his office and
talked about saving the young from a life of crime.
</P>
<P>
   He smacked fist to palm and said that until adequate prenatal
care is available to all pregnant women, until day care is
available to all, until we expand after-school programs, until we
develop more and better parenting programs, ``police never will get
ahead of the crime curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt went further.
</P>
<P>
   He said he looks to a day early in the next century when not
only are those social programs realized, but police officers become
``problem solvers.'' He sees the day when police stations become
community centers where social workers, truant officers, drug
counselors and housing-code inspectors work side by side with the
cops.
</P>
<P>
   I've reported on cops and crime since 1990, and most of the cops
I know don't quite see themselves in this social-worker mode. Most
see themselves, frankly, as street warriors protecting and serving
and hooking and booking and generally being heroic figures battling
the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt and his assistant chiefs and commanders readily admit that
bringing all 2,300 Phoenix police officers along in this vision of
cops playing social reformers won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the younger guys, in particular, imagine themselves as
sure-shooting, crime-fighting street heroes, not as social
workers,'' said Cmdr. Mike McCort, who was with Hurtt in his
office. ``But when police ask themselves, `How many times can we
arrest the same people?' or, `What are we accomplishing with all
these arrests?' they see we have to have some new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt nodded emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a while, but we're taking advantage of research
done by others,'' he said. ``You beat your head against a wall so
many times, and you begin to say, `How can I get around this
thing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider the millions of dollars it would save if we
did something at the front end for the young people who wind up in
the justice system, you start to be a believer in intervening with
families and the young.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that Hurtt and others looking to change
American policing are saying that recent innovations in law
enforcement aren't enough, because two of those innovations have
been at the heart of Phoenix policing for the past eight or nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Those two programs are ``community policing'' and the ``broken
windows'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Clever criminologists came up with the community policing
concept in the 1980s, and it's spread to almost every force in the
land. Community policing, cops say, is a partnership between the
police and the community.
</P>
<P>
   Police chiefs told their officers to get out of their cars and
talk to neighbors. Begin walking a beat again. Ride bicycles. Help
block watches get started. Go to block-watch meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, community action officers work with neighborhood
organizations, police are in schools, and we have hundreds of block
watches around the Valley, with neighbors calling the cops the
moment they see anything resembling a crime.
</P>
<P>
   What has been the result of this partnership?
</P>
<P>
   More crime reports.
</P>
<P>
   The number of ``calls for service'' to police has skyrocketed
since community policing began. In Phoenix, there were about 1.2
million calls for service in 1990. There were about 2.2 million in
1997, an increase that far outstripped Valley population growth.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, many say the incredible increase in calls to police
since community policing began is largely due to citizens now
calling in thousands of crimes that previously went unreported.
</P>
<P>
   While community policing has been at best a mixed success _
there has been a decline in some crimes, a climb in others _
another strategy hatched by police seeking to redefine themselves
has seemed to hold greater promise.
</P>
<P>
   The broken windows strategy was named after a 1982 ``Atlantic
Monthly'' article, ``Character and Community: The Problem of Broken
Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   That article said neighborhood ruination begins with small
things _ like broken windows. Fail to repair one broken window and
another appears. One wall with gang graffiti left upon it begets
graffiti everywhere. Let one drug dealer work the neighborhood and
five more surely will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory, we can save our neighborhoods, save our
cities, by mending the broken windows. We can radically cut major
crime by fighting small disorders.
</P>
<P>
   When that theory was tried in New York City's subway system _
when fare beaters, panhandlers, drug dealers and gang members were
run off _ crime plummeted. When the strategy was taken to the
streets of New York, a drop in crime of historic proportions took
place, and continues still.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, across America, and certainly throughout Arizona, graffiti
cleanups began. Panhandlers were run out of city centers. Drug
dealers and users were rounded up.
</P>
<P>
   Many American neighborhoods, including many in the Valley, are
safer places as the broken-windows approach has been folded into
the community policing approach.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a price, here and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As all those drug addicts, gang members and prostitutes _ all
those ``window breakers'' _ have been locked up, our prison
population has leapt. There were about 1 million Americans behind
bars in 1990. Now there are about 1.7 million. In 1980, there were
about 24,000 people locked up for drug offenses. Now there are
about 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Hurtt's police department calling for a
new approach to fighting crime _ an approach that is much more than
either community policing or the broken-windows strategy. What
Phoenix cops are saying is that neither of those strategies quite
gets to the heart of why we are having a crime problem in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police are saying we have to widen the definition of
``community'' in community policing and we have to fix not only
broken windows but mend the broken people who break those windows.
</P>
<P>
   The approach being called for by Phoenix police may be traced
back to the often grim street experiences of McCort. He said that
his years on the street told him that we have to stop treating
symptoms and begin addressing causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just taking away guns or closing drug houses or arresting a
few gang members isn't enough,'' he said. ``We have to focus on
changing the lives of youths, strengthening families and
rehabilitating neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   McCort said the whole community must get involved in crime
fighting, not just cops and block watches. He said we must involve
parents, churches, schools, business people and many government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, McCort wrote a paper calling for a communitywide
attack on violence. He and Assistant Police Chief Irwin Bakin took
the paper to Arizona State University's Morrison Institute for
Public Policy. Bakin and McCort said police wanted community help
in fighting crime, and they wanted the institute to help them find
ways to get that help.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's members, fascinated by McCort's study, went
looking for grant money to finance a wider, more comprehensive
study.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Waits, the institute's associate director, raised
$150,000 in a few weeks _ ``the easiest fund-raising I've done in
my career,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, the institute formed a 40-member steering
committee consisting of business executives, sociologists,
prosecutors, judges and police. That steering committee went to
nationally known criminologists to find out what works in the fight
against violence.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said programs proven to cut violence are, to be
sure, extra police patrols. But at least as important are programs
that provide family therapy and parent training, vocational
training, quality after-school programs and slum eradication.
</P>
<P>
   They said programs least likely to cut violent crime include gun
buyback programs, arrests of juveniles for minor offenses, arrests
or raids on drug market locations, and correctional boot camps.
</P>
<P>
   To cut crime, they said, we have to reach out to the young
people most likely to become criminals. We have to see that they
are nurtured and mentored as children, that they live in safe
neighborhoods, that they are cared for if parents have to work.
They must be helped to develop a sense of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what McCort had concluded from years of
watching young people fall into lives of crime from lack of
guidance and care.
</P>
<P>
   The Morrison Institute's effort was named the Phoenix Violence
Prevention Initiative. The steering committee formed early in 1997
was broadened late that year to include 300 people from every
aspect of our community. The group divided into committees and
spent this year consulting experts and drafting resolutions that
were released last month.
</P>
<P>
   The groups' violence prevention strategies include prenatal
programs for ``at-risk'' families, parenting training, child care,
after-school programs, summertime activities for children and
mentor programs to connect young people to adult role models who
care about them and help them develop and grow.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this is not the first time experts have said that to
properly fight crime we have to attack its root causes. But it is
the first time in Arizona that police, judges, prosecutors,
social-service workers and the business community are agreeing that
we better be ready to spend some significant money _ public and
private _ to attack those root causes.
</P>
<P>
   And Hurtt isn't the only high-profile law enforcer to back the
program. Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley and Arizona Supreme
Court Justice Charles E. Jones are strong supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the influence of the backers of the initiative, we
shouldn't imagine that megamillions immediately will be
appropriated by the Legislature and city councils or donated by
businesses for the family-level crime battle. It will be several
years before we see whether the promise of the Violence Prevention
Initiative will be realized.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, steps are being taken to make aspects of the
initiative a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials already have included money for after-school
programs in this year's budget. The Legislature will be asked to
help fund such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses will be asked to form partnerships with schools to
fund youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative has long since grown beyond McCort's original
paper, but Phoenix police say they consider the initiative a
guiding light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look for long-term solutions to the problems of
criminal violence in our cities,'' Hurtt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at the root causes of criminal behavior. Why
do young people turn to crime? We all know the disintegration of
the family has contributed to the rise in crime. We know lots of
single families will be out there in the future, and we have to
deal with that _ have to deal with the families as they are, not as
we wish them to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to rethink our approaches to maintaining order in
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hurtt leaned back in his chair and stared out his
fourth-floor window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We police have to rethink our role,'' he said. ``We have to
learn to work with truant officers, with social workers, with
anyone who can help us make the community a place where young
people can grow up strong, happy and healthy, where families can be
safe and healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether Hurtt noticed the pig flying by outside his
window. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Borrowing an exploratory technique from geology, astronomers
have learned to take ``core samples,'' not of Earth but of the
great depths of time in the universe. In 1995, astronomers aimed
the Hubble Space Telescope for 10 days of concentrated observations
of a single patch of the northern sky.
</P>
<P>
   The long camera exposures, in effect, bored through space and
time to produce views filled with thousands of galaxies at various
ages and stages of evolution, some appearing as they existed when
the universe was only 10 percent of its current age.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the sequel, a core sample of the southern sky that
gives astronomers more spectacular views of galaxies never before
seen and probably new clues to the history of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Over a similar 10-day period last month, the Hubble telescope
operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was
focused on a narrow region in the constellation Tucana, near the
south celestial pole. The pictures, called the Hubble Deep Field
South, were made available Monday to astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The southern field promises to be the most studied area of the
sky over the next five years,'' said Dr. Robert Williams, the
astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore
who led the observations.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 50 astronomers and data processors has conducted a
preliminary examination of the pictures and concluded that they
appear to validate the common assumption that the universe looks
largely the same in any direction.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful new telescopes in Australia and Chile will be trained
on the galaxies revealed by the survey and will precisely measure
their distances from Earth and other properties.
</P>
<P>
   The first findings based on the new observations in ultraviolet,
optical and infrared light are expected to be reported in January
at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Williams said, astronomers noted that
disk-shaped galaxies seemed to be more common in the southern
survey than in the northern one, and elliptical galaxies less
common. Astronomers said that some of the more spectacular objects,
with variegated patterns like marbles, could be two or more
galaxies at different distances superimposed on each other. Or,
they could be examples of merging galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   The results have raised expectations. The importance of mergers
in the evolution of galaxies was one of the insights gained from
the northern study. Another insight was that galaxies appeared to
develop from the bottom up, not the top down.
</P>
<P>
   That is, they begin as smaller objects, which are prevalent in
the early universe, and grow into larger galaxies and groups of
galaxies, instead of extraordinarily large structures that break
into galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that star formation seemed to peak seven
billion to nine billion years ago, consistent with earlier studies
of the composition of the intergalactic medium.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the most significant result of the northern survey
was the validation of a technique of using the colors of galaxies,
as seen through different filters, to estimate their distances from
Earth. The technique is proving useful in estimating distances of
galaxies beyond the range of ground-based telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   The target region for the southern observations was selected
because it incorporated one phenomenon, a quasar, not present in
the northern survey. Quasars are extremely distant and bright
objects believed to be powered by black holes, those gravitational
sinks at the cores of many galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Quasars are like beacons shining through cosmic haze. Because
they are usually so far away, their light travels through and
illuminates otherwise invisible clouds of intervening hydrogen gas.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble's imaging spectrograph was used to dissect light from
this quasar and thus detect some of the universe's hidden structure
between the galaxies and over the billions of light-years between
Earth and the quasar.
</P>
<P>
   Properties of the quasar light should not only betray the
presence of these hydrogen clouds but also reveal clues to star
formation and galactic evolution.

TIPS ON BUYING A COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Ready or not, here come the holidays!
</P>
<P>
   For many people, this year's holiday season will involve buying
a new desktop computer for home use.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask me, there's never been a better time to take the
computing plunge. Today's models offer an exciting array of
features, whether you're in the market for a sub-$1,000 machine or
a top-of-the-line, bleeding-edge technology screamer!
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, buying a new home computer can be tricky. And nobody
wants to mess up when $1,000 or more is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   So, here are some tips, suggestions and rules of thumb you might
want to review before heading out to spend your hard-earned money:
</P>
<P>
   - Think about how you would use a computer. Surfing the Internet
doesn't require a powerful machine, but graphics work or playing
the latest 3D games need all the power you can afford. Talk with
friends who have computers. Check software stores for titles you
might want to use, and look for the ``minimum requirements'' listed
on the box.
</P>
<P>
   - PC or Macintosh? This is something you'll need to decide for
yourself. Most of the world uses PCs running Windows 95 or Windows
98. But many students, artists and others swear by the ease of use
offered by the Macintosh. Go with your gut on this one.
</P>
<P>
   - Set yourself a budget. This will help keep you from being
talked into buying something you don't need. A good beginning
system shouldn't cost more than $1,250, including monitor. In fact,
many decent systems cost hundreds of dollars less. (See the
following tip.) Midrange systems cost between $1,250 and $2,000.
The best systems run from $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Looking to buy the cheapest computer you can find? OK, but
make sure you know what you're getting. I've seen some systems
advertised for less than $400, but they don't come with monitors,
CD-ROMs, modems or even operating systems! Here's something to look
for: IBM has just announced the Aptiva D1N, a system with a
suggested retail price of $599. It doesn't come with a monitor, but
it sounds like a decent beginning computer. Learn more at
www.pc.ibm.com/us/aptiva /aptivad1n.html (that's an underscore in
front of `d1n').
</P>
<P>
   - Educate yourself. I'm not suggesting you take a college
course. But you'd be surprised how much you can pick up by spending
a couple weeks reading through some computer magazines or talking
with people who use computers.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, start scanning computer ads. Soon, the lingo won't
sound so weird, and you'll get an idea of the things most computers
contain and how much similar systems cost.
</P>
<P>
   Ask friends, relatives and co-workers what kinds of computers
they have at home. Ask them where they bought their machines, what
brand they own and whether they'd do anything differently the next
time.
</P>
<P>
   Visit a couple of computer stores just to try out their
computers on display. This will give you an idea of how the models
vary, what different keyboards feel like and whether you can do
without that expensive 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to get your education from the salesman on duty.
They won't have the time to answer your questions, and, if they do,
they probably won't give you the best answers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you don't have time to educate yourself, at least
find a computer-savvy friend who can help you choose the right
computer.
</P>
<P>
   - Be brave. No matter where you end up buying, chances are you
will encounter at least one condescending salesman. I don't know
why. But you should expect it.
</P>
<P>
   This person will try hard to make you feel stupid and probably
will act as though he or she doesn't have time for you unless
you're ready to plunk down your Visa card, buy a computer and
quickly leave the store.
</P>
<P>
   Remain calm. Know that this happens to everybody, regardless of
how much _ or how little _ they know about computers. Be prepared
to turn around and walk out (or hang up the phone) if a salesman
refuses to treat you properly.
</P>
<P>
   - Use common sense. Don't expect a department store that sells
sofas and washing machines to offer a wide variety of computers or
have a sales staff that knows much about them. The best sources of
computers and software are always those places that do nothing else
but sell computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   - Computers are like houses _ you should buy the biggest you can
afford. Believe me, you will grow into every nook and cranny your
computer offers. It's better to have a little extra to begin with
than to wish you had a better computer just six months down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   - If you ask me, beginners do best buying a name-brand computer
from a major retail store, such as CompUSA, or from a major
mail-order outlet, such as Gateway or Dell.
</P>
<P>
   - Technical support, service and reliability are everything,
because chances are something will go wrong. Make sure you can get
help seven days a week, 24-hours a day. The November issue of ``PC
World'' magazine rated Dell, IBM, Micron, Quantex, CyberMax and
Sony as tops. Compaq, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and NEC were
average. AST and Packard Bell were rated poor. Acer was dubbed
`unacceptable.'
</P>
<P>
   - Call me short-sighted, but I don't think DVD drives and
television tuner cards are worth the money. I just don't see a big
need for such capability _ at least not yet. If you buy a $3,000
computer to watch DVD movies, you have way too much disposable
income. Most buyers would be better off putting the money into a
bigger monitor or a good printer or scanner.
</P>
<P>
   - Speaking of which: No home system is worth much without a good
printer. And if you have kids or you plan any kind of graphics
work, you should invest in a good flatbed scanner. These days, you
should be able to find a quality color inkjet printer for $300 or
less. A decent scanner will cost about $125.
</P>
<P>
   - Make sure that computer you are buying is NEW! This sounds
obvious, but some retail outlets have been known to repackage used
equipment and resell it as new. They are very good with the
shrink-wrap machine, so it's not always easy to spot used stuff. If
it's refurbished, it should be marked as such, and should not cost
as much as new.
</P>
<P>
   - Fourteen-inch monitors are long gone, leaving 15-inchers the
standard size with preconfigured systems. But if you can afford it,
get yourself a 17-inch monitor. You will enjoy computing more,
because you'll be able to see more at once, use larger fonts (if
you need to) and many other things. The 17-inchers are everywhere
these days, and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   - Do what you want, but if it was up to me, you'd never buy one
of those extended warranties. They are pure profit for the
retailer. Most brand-name machines come with their own warranties,
which last from one to three years. Some even come with on-site
repair service. If it ain't broke after three years, it'll be
outdated. So tell the salesman ``NO'' when the subject of an
extended warranty comes up.
</P>
<P>
   - Be polite, but refuse when your brother or his friend or the
guy down the street offers to build you a new system ``real
cheap.'' So he saves you money? Will he be around every time you
have a question? Will he guarantee his work? What software will he
provide? And if serious problems arise you'll want to demand
immediate service, not worry that you'll offend some relative or
damage a friendship.
</P>
<P>
   - If you buy a new computer and it goes south within the first
30 days, TAKE IT BACK. Demand a full refund or a new system. If you
let them start fiddling with bits and pieces of a faulty system,
you are asking for trouble. And some companies will even force you
to accept refurbished equipment to complete the repairs. Don't even
go there!
</P>
<P>
   That's about it. Have fun!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one more thing: Last week I promised to print some of your
feelings about Microsoft's new Internet Explorer 5.0 and the
Microsoft antitrust trial going on in Washington, D.C. As you can
see, I ran out of room this week. So look for the comments next
week! &QL;

today, they asked Starr his definition of sex. He said, in his
words, sex is something that happens to other people.''
</P>
<P>

   ``We finally got to hear Monica's voice, after a year of this.
Were you surprised? I thought her voice would be a little huskier.
I mean, after being around all those cigars..''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has agreed to pay $850,000 to Paula Jones to
drop her sexual harassment suit against him. Clinton did it in a
very clever way. He's putting all these sex scandals on his
Discover card. This way, at the end of the year, he gets a quickie
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's kind of a sad story. It seems the grandson of Ronald
Reagan, Cameron Reagan, was arrested the other day in L.A. and
charged with burglarizing cars. Breaking and entering. Sounds more
like Nixon's grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Pennsylvania, the Ku Klux Klan is trying to improve their
public image by cleaning up litter along the highway. Is that
really an improvement? I mean, sure, the litter's gone, but now
you've got white trash by the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New England Patriots are planning to move their team to

</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today, the Monica Lewinsky tapes were released to the
media and it was the first time Americans heard Monica's voice. It
was also the first time President Clinton heard her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been reported that Monica Lewinsky has put on 50 pounds
since the scandal broke. Apparently, she is still getting advice
from Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, Dennis Rodman married former 'Baywatch' star
Carmen Electra at a Las Vegas chapel. Rodman said he was looking
forward to this day for a long time because he was always the
bridesmaid and never the bride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the newly released audio tapes, Monica Lewinsky tells Linda
Tripp that she has had sex with eight men. The surprising part is
only three of them were Presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's list of the 10 worst holiday toys is out and one
of the items is a feather boa kids can play dress up with. Safety
experts want a tag attached to the feather boa that says, 'Danger,
this item could cause your child to become governor of
Minnesota.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a new interview, Paula Jones says that she would like to be
remembered 'as a modern-day David who took on Goliath and won.'
After hearing this, President Clinton said, 'That's funny, I call
it Goliath too!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In his testimony before the House Committee today, Kenneth
Starr said that despite all that has happened, he would take the
job of independent counsel all over again. Mainly because this is
the closest he has come to sex in years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the impeachment hearings this morning, two leading
Democrats walked out on Kenneth Starr before he was halfway
finished. While watching from home, Monica said, 'Hey, the
President did the same thing to me.'''

closed during Kenneth Starr's two-hour statement. He said, 'I
wasn't sleeping. I was trying to visualize Monica.'''

   ``During an interview on 'Inside Edition,' Paula Jones burst
into tears. It was right after she found out she wasn't being paid
for the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Rodman's agent thinks that Carmen Electra married him
because she's after Dennis' money. In response Carmen Electra said,
'That's not true, I'm after his clothes.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kenneth Starr was finished testifying for the day,
Republicans on the House Impeachment Committee gave him a standing
ovation. This put Starr in such a good mood he indicted his
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday while talking to Japanese leaders, President Clinton
said that Generation X frequently uses the expression 'Denial is
not just a river in Egypt.' Of course, Generation X also frequently
uses the expression 'I can't do that Mr. President, you're
married.'''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>
SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT THE BRONCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ To explain this properly, we can only explain the
Denver Broncos this way: This is how the San Francisco 49ers used
to look.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any 49ers. The very best, most mature and fully
actualized 49ers _ the 49ers of 1984 and 1994, well stocked at
every position and utterly convinced of their own collective
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   So confident are they that they could return team icon John
Elway to action after two weeks on the sidelines with a bad
hamstring and sore ribs and find a way to make him a receiver. You
know, just in case people thought they were running short on
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked John during the week how he felt about running the
play, if he thought he wanted it,'' head coach Mike Shanahan said
of the pass from wide receiver Rod Smith to Elway that began the
second quarter of Sunday's 40-14 pounding of the Oakland Raiders.
``He looked at me and said, `Of course I want it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And hang the danger, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I got a first down on it, didn't I?'' Elway said with a
smile that was part superficial charm and mild incredulity.
``Actually, I thought I could break back inside and get some big
yardage on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to settle for 14, though, largely because the Raiders, in
a brief moment of mental acuity, played a zone defense instead of a
man-to-man, allowing Charles Woodson, the team's only surviving
secondary member, to tackle him before he caused too much mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he had the speed to catch John,'' Shanahan
said, giving way to a moment's giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   But only a moment's. The Broncos gained satisfaction out of
knowing that they finally showed they could take a real punch and
give back five, and in reinforcing the widely held notion that the
only team that can beat them, is them. A very bad them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back on us, sure,'' linebacker Bill Romanowski said
of the Raiders' third-quarter comeback, which pulled Oakland to
within three points at 17-14. ``But that's when we stood up, we
didn't let them keep the ball, we put the pressure on them and took
control of the game back. I think this shows that if we play our
game, nobody's going to beat us. With that kind of confidence, it's
going to be tough for anyone to come in here and beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski learned this verbal swagger in San Francisco, where
the walk not only matched but exceeded the talk, no mean feat on a
team with the young Deion Sanders on it. Romanowski sees it every
day in the Bronco practices.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Shanahan, Romanowski said: ``He wants us to be
perfect, or close as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how close the Broncos are getting. Sunday's win was
their 16th in succession, including last year's postseason; it made
them only the fifth team since the NFL-AFL merger to win its first
11 games ('72 and '84 Dolphins, '85 Bears and '91 Redskins); it
clinched them a playoff spot with five games still to play; and it
has induced the kind of breathless admiration last seen around the
Yankees. There is something special brewing here, something
powerful enough to eradicate the glorious memories of last January,
when they finally escaped the Nation of Noble Losers.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that most jazzed the Broncos and their slavish fans
Sunday was the return of Elway to his efficient and occasionally
swashbuckling self. That he hit Willie Green with a first quarter
pass to break the 50,000-yard mark in passing served as a brief
sideshow, but the eye-openers came after a couple of series of
understandable rust. His throws had the requisite Elway steam (the
touchdowns to Shannon Sharpe and Smith were standard Elway
heaters), his peripheral vision was still 20/10 (he ducked all but
one Raider tackler all afternoon), and he betrayed few signs of
either age or stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he is as equipped as ever to lead this Bronco team to
the one place no team has ever gone _ 19-0.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This would seem to be a depressing bit of news for the Raiders,
who came here as one of the two real playoff-potential teams on the
Denver schedule (the other was Jacksonville, a 37-24 loser in Week
8) and left a pile of twisted smoldering wreckage. To come from 17
down to within a field goal only to be pounded flat in the last
quarter cannot serve as inspiration for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told some of the Raiders' players we could see them again in
the playoffs,'' running back Terrell Davis said, ever gracious
after taking 162 yards from the Oakland defense. ``Games like this
bring you down to earth, but it will help us in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, it will give Elway some time to work on his
yards-after-the-catch numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 38, but I can still run and catch,'' he said with a smile
that looked an awful lot like the one he wore last January. The one
that can be seen on a 49er's face only with the help of a VCR.

</P>
<P>
   This is a New York tale about two savvy Upper West Side cats.
They were getting fat and lethargic, and my daughter, Diane,
thought it was time to get a kitten to perk them up. She brought
home a lively 6-week-old kitten, but things didn't work out as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The kitten bit the cats' tails, jumped on their stomachs,
scratched their ears and, worst of all, ate all their food before
they could get to it.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, as my daughter was leaving the apartment, the
two cats ran into the hall. They refused to come home, refused to
eat the food she brought out for them. They were on a hunger
strike. The only thing missing was a picket sign.
</P>
<P>
   This went on all day and all night. By the next afternoon, my
daughter gave in. She put the kitten in the carrier and brought him
back to the vet.
</P>
<P>
   When she came back, she showed the cats the empty carrier and
said, ``OK, you win.'' The cats ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   They had not been great friends, but since they went on strike
they've become inseparable. How did they know that in union there
is strength? Had they watched strikes on television? Did the
liberal tradition of the Upper West Side rub off on them?
</P>
<P>
   _ VERA LEWIS
</P>
<P>
   Alan Magill and a co-worker volunteered to do a comedy program
for residents at a city hospital. They were letting fly with old
gags and physical humor the likes of which probably hadn't seen the
light of day since vaudeville. Most of the patients were reasonably
receptive. The exception was a man sleeping in a bed in a large
room that had about 20 other beds. He turned his head to look at
the pair, and they promptly greeted him with a barrage of gags. He
responded with what they admitted was understandable disdain. ``Do
I come into your house and do this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a crowded restaurant on the Upper West Side at
dinner time. People were waiting, but the party at one of the
tables ignored the standees and lingered long after they had
finished. Diane Feldman overheard and enjoyed the waiter who
finally came up and queried, ``Would you like to see the breakfast
menu?'' It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Jeanne Burck was walking along the Upper East side to her
job as a special education teacher when she felt her tote bag grow
noticeably heavier. It was early in the morning and she knew she
was tired but this was ridiculous, she thought. She stopped, looked
inside the bag and a golden retriever, who had obviously jumped in,
was chomping on the roast beef sandwich she had prepared for her
lunch. Both dog and sandwich were evicted _ the dog claimed by an
obviously oblivious owner.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Werfel thinks the sign she saw recently in a clothing store
belongs under the heading Shopping for Dummies. It read: ``2nd
floor. Upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes park in front of my house, where there is a No
Parking Here to Corner sign, issued by the traffic department.
</P>
<P>
   I stuck a post-it note to the windshield of one car noting that
it was illegally parked. Just then a radio car stopped and a young
officer questioned what I had done. He replaced my note with a
traffic summons. ``This works better, and you never know what the
driver will do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I replied in my best teacher-trained voice, ``so what
you're saying is that my deed would engender retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me blankly for a moment and then nodded
tentatively: ``Yeah, if I used those words, that's what I'm
saying.''

   Herbert Geist was on an uptown Madison Avenue bus when a harried
woman got on at 67th Street. Could anyone give her four quarters
for a dollar, she asked anxiously. Several passengers quickly
volunteered. Transaction completed, she hurriedly left the bus. She
was last seen depositing the quarters in a parking meter.
</P>
<P>
   My 6-year-old daughter, Dorothy, was eating lunch with her
grandmother in a Madison Avenue coffee shop when she noticed the No
Smoking sign posted near the door.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress came by and Dorothy said: ``That sign is rude. Why
doesn't it say No Smoking Please?''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress looked at her a moment, unamused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you smoke?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' Dorothy said. ``I'm only a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what's it to you?'' the waitress asked.
</P>

<P>
   Are the ``Titanic'' tales ever going to stop? Probably not.
Suzanne Schwalb still can't get over an exchange that took place at
her former place of employment. A colleague was talking about going
to see the film when a friend asked, ``What's it about anyway?''
Astonished, the colleague responded, ``You know, the luxury ocean
liner that hit an iceberg and sank in the early 1900s.'' The friend
replied in disgust, ``You didn't have to give away the plot.''
</P>
<P>
   The office building called the Interchurch Center is home to a
large number of church-related offices, including the National
Council of Churches. Every week, the menu for the cafeteria is
posted in the elevator. Until recently, ``roasted vegetables in a
hallowed baguette'' appeared on the menu. The most recent menu
changed hallowed to hollowed. Carol Smolenski is not happy.
Baguettes are no longer sacred. Will someone reinstate the holiness
of the bread?
</P>
<P>
   I'm probably the last New York City woman to believe that one
can eat bagels without worrying about adding pounds to one's
figure. As a devoted lover of bagels, maintaining this belief was
always difficult until the other afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   I was waiting in a long line at Tal Bagels on 53rd Street and
First Avenue, thinking about yelling my order for a salt bagel with
egg salad when the woman in front of me bellowed, ``I'd like a
light cream cheese on a scooped raisin.'' The counterman, without
looking up, executed her wish. I was perplexed. What had she
wanted, I asked, when it was my turn. He explained to me, as if I
were not too swift, how he pulls out the inside dough of the bagel
so it is ``scooped out.''
</P>
<P>
   On a subsequent visit, I was ready to ask for a cream cheese on
scooped poppy when a young, very slim woman said, ``I'll have tuna
on sesame, deep scoop.'' I understood now how New York women could
eat bagels without worrying about gaining weight. I called out my
order: ``Light cream cheese on poppy, deep scoop.''

<P>
   `Remmember, Clinton had to give his definition of sex? Well,
today, they asked Starr his definition of sex. He said, in his
words, sex is something that happens to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky says she's gonna write a book. In this book
she says she will show a side of Monica that even Bill Clinton
didn't see. Yeah, I think it's called her face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got to hear Monica's voice, after a year of this.
Were you surprised? I thought her voice would be a little huskier.
I mean, after being around all those cigars..''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has agreed to pay $850,000 to Paula Jones to
drop her sexual harassment suit against him. Clinton did it in a
very clever way. He's putting all these sex scandals on his
Discover card. This way, at the end of the year, he gets a quickie
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's kind of a sad story. It seems the grandson of Ronald
Reagan, Cameron Reagan, was arrested the other day in L.A. and
charged with burglarizing cars. Breaking and entering. Sounds more
like Nixon's grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Pennsylvania, the Ku Klux Klan is trying to improve their
public image by cleaning up litter along the highway. Is that
really an improvement? I mean, sure, the litter's gone, but now
you've got white trash by the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New England Patriots are planning to move their team to
Hartford, Connecticut. Even more shocking, the Washington Redskins
are planning to move across the 50-yard line.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today, the Monica Lewinsky tapes were released to the
media and it was the first time Americans heard Monica's voice. It
was also the first time President Clinton heard her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been reported that Monica Lewinsky has put on 50 pounds
since the scandal broke. Apparently, she is still getting advice
from Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, Dennis Rodman married former 'Baywatch' star
Carmen Electra at a Las Vegas chapel. Rodman said he was looking
forward to this day for a long time because he was always the
bridesmaid and never the bride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the newly released audio tapes, Monica Lewinsky tells Linda
Tripp that she has had sex with eight men. The surprising part is
only three of them were Presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's list of the 10 worst holiday toys is out and one
of the items is a feather boa kids can play dress up with. Safety
experts want a tag attached to the feather boa that says, 'Danger,
this item could cause your child to become governor of
Minnesota.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a new interview, Paula Jones says that she would like to be
remembered 'as a modern-day David who took on Goliath and won.'
After hearing this, President Clintn said, 'That's funny, I call
it Goliath too!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In his testimony before the House Committee today, Kenneth
Starr said that despite all that has happened, he would take the
job of independent counsel all over again. Mainly because this is
the closest he has come to sex in years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the impeachment hearings this morning, two leading
Democrats walked out on Kenneth Starr before he was halfway
finished. While watching from home, Monica said, 'Hey, the
President did the same thing to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican Congressman Charles Canady was caught with his eyes
closed during Kenneth Starr's two-hour statement. He said, 'I
wasn't sleeping. I was trying to visualize Monica.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``During an interview on 'Inside Edition,' Paula Jones burst
into tears. It was right after she found out she wasn't being paid
for the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Rodman's agent thinks that Carmen Electra married him
because she's after Dennis' money. In response Carmen Electra said,
'That's not true, I'm after his clothes.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kenneth Starr was finished testifying for the day,
Republicans on the House Impeachment Committee gave him a standing
ovation. This put Starr in such a good mood he indicted his
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday while talking to Japanese leaders, President Clinton
said that Generation X frequently uses the expression 'Denial is
not just a river in Egypt.' Of course, Generation X also frequently
uses the expression 'I can't do that Mr. President, you're
married.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Kevorkian is being profiled on this week's '60 Minutes.'
Reportedly, there's one awkward moment just after the interview
when Kevorkian tells Mike Wallace, 'I'll be in touch.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``At a televised town meeting in Japan this week, President
Clinton was asked by a Japanese woman how he apologized to Hillary
and Chelsea for his affair with Monica Lewinsky. President Clinton
responded by screaming, 'Look, Godzilla!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma has been made the
Conference Chairman for the Republican party. House Majority Leader
Dick Armey says this will go a long way to change the perception of
the Republicans from the 'party for wealthy white men' to the
'party for wealthy white men and that black guy.'
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are so excited about Watts that they've given
him his own bathroom and water fountain.''

</P>
<P>
   `Remmember, Clinton had to give his definition of sex? Well,
today, they asked Starr his definition of sex. He said, in his
words, sex is something that happens to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky says she's gonna write a book. In this book
she says she will show a side of Monica that even Bill Clinton
didn't see. Yeah, I think it's called her face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got to hear Monica's voice, after a year of this.
Were you surprised? I thought her voice would be a little huskier.
I mean, after being around all those cigars..''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has agreed to pay $850,000 to Paula Jones to
drop her sexual harassment suit against him. Clinton did it in a
very clever way. He's putting all these sex scandals on his
Discover card. This way, at the end of the year, he gets a quickie
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's kind of a sad story. It seems the grandson of Ronald
Reagan, Cameron Reagan, was arrested the other day in L.A. and
charged with burglarizing cars. Breaking and entering. Sounds more
like Nixon's grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Pennsylvania, the Ku Klux Klan is trying to improve their
public image by cleaning up litter along the highway. Is that
really an improvement? I mean, sure, the litter's gone, but now
you've got white trash by the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New England Patriots are planning to move their team to
Hartford, Connecticut. Even more shocking, the Washington Redskins
are planning to move across the 50-yard line.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today, the Monica Lewinsky tapes were released to the
media and it was the first time Americans heard Monica's voice. It
was also the first time President Clinton heard her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been reported that Monica Lewinsky has put on 50 pounds
since the scandal broke. Apparently, she is still getting advice
from Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, Dennis Rodman married former 'Baywatch' star
Carmen Electra at a Las Vegas chapel. Rodman said he was looking
forward to this day for a long time because he was always the
bridesmaid and never the bride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the newly released audio tapes, Monica Lewinsky tells Linda
Tripp that she has had sex with eight men. The surprising part is
only three of them were Presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's list of the 10 worst holiday toys is out and one
of the items is a feather boa kids can play dress up with. Safety
experts want a tag attached to the feather boa that says, 'Danger,
this item could cause your child to become governor of
Minnesota.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a new interview, Paula Jones says that she would like to be
remembered 'as a modern-day David who took on Goliath and won.'
After hearing this, President Clinton said, 'That's funny, I call
it Goliath too!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In his testimony before the House Committee today, Kenneth
Starr said that despite all that has happened, he would take the
job of independent counsel all over again. Mainly because this is
the closest he has come to sex in years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the impeachment hearings this morning, two leading
Democrats walked out on Kenneth Starr before he was halfway
finished. While watching from home, Monica said, 'Hey, the
President did the same thing to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican Congressman Charles Canady was caught with his eyes
closed during Kenneth Starr's two-hour statement. He said, 'I
wasn't sleeping. I was trying to visualize Monica.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``During an interview on 'Inside Edition,' Paula Jones burst
into tears. It was right after she found out she wasn't being paid
for the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Rodman's agent thinks that Carmen Electra married him
because she's after Dennis' money. In response Carmen Electra said,
'That's not true, I'm after his clothes.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kenneth Starr was finished testifying for the day,
Republicans on the House Impeachment Committee gave him a standing
ovation. This put Starr in such a good mood he indicted his
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday while talking to Japanese leaders, President Clinton
said that Generation X frequently uses the expression 'Denial is
not just a river in Egypt.' Of course, Generation X also frequently
uses the expression 'I can't do that Mr. President, you're
married.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Kevorkian is being profiled on this week's '60 Minutes.'
Reportedly, there's one awkward moment just after the interview
when Kevorkian tells Mike Wallace, 'I'll be in touch.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``At a televised town meeting in Japan this week, President
Clinton was asked by a Japanese woman how he apologized to Hillary
and Chelsea for his affair with Monica Lewinsky. President Clinton
responded by screaming, 'Look, Godzilla!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma has been made the
Conference Chairman for the Republican party. House Majority Leader
Dick Armey says this will go a long way to change the perception of
the Republicans from the 'party for wealthy white men' to the
'party for wealthy white men and that black guy.'
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are so excited about Watts that they've given
him his own bathroom and water fountain.''

<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is a New York tale about two savvy Upper West Side cats.
They were getting fat and lethargic, and my daughter, Diane,
thought it was time to get a kitten to perk them up. She brought
home a lively 6-week-old kitten, but things didn't work out as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The kitten bit the cats' tails, jumped on their stomachs,
scratched their ears and, worst of all, ate all their food before
they could get to it.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, as my daughter was leaving the apartment, the
two cats ran into the hall. They refused to come home, refused to
eat the food she brought out for them. They were on a hunger
strike. The only thing missing was a picket sign.
</P>
<P>
   This went on all day and all night. By the next afternoon, my
daughter gave in. She put the kitten in the carrier and brought him
back to the vet.
</P>
<P>
   When she came back, she showed the cats the empty carrier and
said, ``OK, you win.'' The cats ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   They had not been great friends, but since they went on strike
they've become inseparable. How did they know that in union there
is strength? Had they watched strikes on television? Did the
liberal tradition of the Upper West Side rub off on them?
</P>
<P>
   _ VERA LEWIS
</P>
<P>
   Alan Magill and a co-worker volunteered to do a comedy program
for residents at a city hospital. They were letting fly with old
gags and physical humor the likes of which probably hadn't seen the
light of day since vaudeville. Most of the patients were reasonably
receptive. The exception was a man sleeping in a bed in a large
room that had about 20 other beds. He turned his head to look at
the pair, and they promptly greeted him with a barrage of gags. He
responded with what they admitted was understandable disdain. ``Do
I come into your house and do this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a crowded restaurant on the Upper West Side at
dinner time. People were waiting, but the party at one of the
tables ignored the standees and lingered long after they had
finished. Diane Feldman overheard and enjoyed the waiter who
finally came up and queried, ``Would you like to see the breakfast
menu?'' It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Jeanne Burck was walking along the Upper East side to her
job as a special education teacher when she felt her tote bag grow
noticeably heavier. It was early in the morning and she knew she
was tired but this was ridiculous, she thought. She stopped, looked
inside the bag and a golden retriever, who had obviously jumped in,
was chomping on the roast beef sandwich she had prepared for her
lunch. Both dog and sandwich were evicted _ the dog claimed by an
obviously oblivious owner.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Werfel thinks the sign she saw recently in a clothing store
belongs under the heading Shopping for Dummies. It read: ``2nd
floor. Upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes park in front of my house, where there is a No
Parking Here to Corner sign, issued by the traffic department.
</P>
<P>
   I stuck a post-it note to the windshield of one car noting that
it was illegally parked. Just then a radio car stopped and a young
officer questioned what I had done. He replaced my note with a
traffic summons. ``This works better, and you never know what the
driver will do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I replied in my best teacher-trained voice, ``so what
you're saying is that my deed would engender retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me blankly for a moment and then nodded
tentatively: ``Yeah, if I used those words, that's what I'm
saying.''
</P>

   Herbert Geist was on an uptown Madison Avenue bus when a harried
woman got on at 67th Street. Could anyone give her four quarters
for a dollar, she asked anxiously. Several passengers quickly
volunteered. Transaction completed, she hurriedly left the bus. She
was last seen depositing the quarters in a parking meter.
</P>
<P>
   My 6-year-old daughter, Dorothy, was eating lunch with her
grandmother in a Madison Avenue coffee shop when she noticed the No
Smoking sign posted near the door.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress came by and Dorothy said: ``That sign is rude. Why
doesn't it say No Smoking Please?''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress looked at her a moment, unamused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you smoke?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' Dorothy said. ``I'm only a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what's it to you?'' the waitress asked.
</P>
<P>
   _ JEAN HANFF KORELITZ &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Are the ``Titanic'' tales ever going to stop? Probably not.
Suzanne Schwalb still can't get over an exchange that took place at
her former place of employment. A colleague was talking about going
to see the film when a friend asked, ``What's it about anyway?''
Astonished, the colleague responded, ``You know, the luxury ocean
liner that hit an iceberg and sank in the early 1900s.'' The friend
replied in disgust, ``You didn't have to give away the plot.''
</P>
<P>
   The office building called the Interchurch Center is home to a
large number of church-related offices, including the National
Council of Churches. Every week, the menu for the cafeteria is
posted in the elevator. Until recently, ``roasted vegetables in a
hallowed baguette'' appeared on the menu. The most recent menu
changed hallowed to hollowed. Carol Smolenski is not happy.
Baguettes are no longer sacred. Will someone reinstate the holiness
of the bread?
</P>
<P>
   I'm probably the last New York City woman to believe that one
can eat bagels without worrying about adding pounds to one's
figure. As a devoted lover of bagels, maintaining this belief was
always difficult until the other afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   I was waiting in a long line at Tal Bagels on 53rd Street and
First Avenue, thinking about yelling my order for a salt bagel with
egg salad when the woman in front of me bellowed, ``I'd like a
light cream cheese on a scooped raisin.'' The counterman, without
looking up, executed her wish. I was perplexed. What had she
wanted, I asked, when it was my turn. He explained to me, as if I
were not too swift, how he pulls out the inside dough of the bagel
so it is ``scooped out.''
</P>
<P>
   On a subsequent visit, I was ready to ask for a cream cheese on
scooped poppy when a young, very slim woman said, ``I'll have tuna
on sesame, deep scoop.'' I understood now how New York women could
eat bagels without worrying about gaining weight. I called out my
order: ``Light cream cheese on poppy, deep scoop.''

TIME TO START TALKING TRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Robert Lilienfeld has some pet peeves that will
either make Angelenos feel terribly guilty or dismiss him entirely.
</P>
<P>
   People who drive gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles a few
blocks at a time, for instance. He can't stand that. Even worse,
those who leave the car running while they dash into a store.
Blasphemous!
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who buy impulsively, filling their closets
with clutter that will someday end up in a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing: ``Bottled water drives me crazy,''
Lilienfeld said. ``There are very few places in the United States
where any official would advise you to drink bottled water over tap
water.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the mad attempt at status-grabbing that bothers him so
much. It's the utterly unnecessary wasting of natural resources
that sends him into a tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people just don't understand,'' Lilienfeld said. ``If
each of us would do a little bit, it would make an enormous
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And this time of year, Lilienfeld feels as frantic about his
message as last-minute Christmas shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans throw away 25 percent more trash between Thanksgiving
and New Year's than any other time of the year, according to the
ULS Report.
</P>
<P>
   Sales fliers. Catalogs. Shopping bags. Greeting cards. Gift
wrapping. Ribbons. Decorations. Leftover food from holiday fetes.
Combined, it makes the nation's trash grow by an extra 1 million
tons per week.
</P>
<P>
   It's pure madness. It's enough to set a man on a mission to get
Americans to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   Lilienfeld, an environmental activist who hails from Michigan,
and William Rathje, an Arizona anthropologist who studies garbage,
are the authors of ``Use Less Stuff: Environmental Solutions for
Who We Really Are'' (Ballantine Publishing Group; $12). The newly
released book grew out of their nonprofit bimonthly newsletter
called the ULS (Use Less Stuff) Report, which for five years has
offered strategies for reducing consumption and conserving
resources while saving money.
</P>
<P>
   Their message is spreading, hitting home with at least 20,000
subscribers, including Mosa and Nancy Kaleel of Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Kaleels were among the many guilty of being
generous contributors to the American waste stream. It wasn't until
they started recycling paper, plastic and glass that the couple
took a good look at their garbage for the first time and noticed
they were throwing away enormous amounts of food.
</P>
<P>
   That's when they started planning their menus rather than
haphazardly throwing items in a shopping cart and wondering why the
broccoli always went bad.
</P>
<P>
   Mosa held onto his '87 car, uses both sides of the paper at work
and takes his own cup to Starbucks. Nancy donates old magazines to
nursing homes and makes gifts for friends from furniture she finds
at garage sales. She decorates chairs with old keys or bottle caps
and weaves new seats from twine.
</P>
<P>
   They took their name off of catalog mailing lists to reduce
their junk mail. ``I definitely wanted to get away from being the
ultimate consumer,'' said Mosa, 30. ``We've let ourselves become
unconscious about our surroundings and our waste. We need to take
responsibility for the affluence of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   A state law passed in 1989 required every California city to
reduce the amount of waste dumped into landfills by 25 percent by
1995 and 50 percent by 2000. It's spurred municipalities to
institute recycling programs; even Christmas trees get turned into
mulch now.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the entire answer, Lilienfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   To really reduce our waste, we have to reduce consumption in the
first place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing it backwards,'' Lilienfeld said. ``We're patting
ourselves on the back for collecting as much waste as possible but
in reality what we wanted to do was not create it in the first
place. By worrying about packaging, we keep hiding the fact that we
are using too much stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the main culprit filling up the landfills? Of the 210
million tons of trash Americans dispose of yearly, paper makes up
the bulk of it _ about 38 percent. That's followed by yard waste
(13 percent), food (10 percent) and plastics (9 percent), according
to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs Americans are starting to catch on to the
urgings of environmentalists, said Bob Dellinger, the EPA's
director of municipal and industrial solid waste.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Americans generated an average of 2.68 pounds of
garbage per person each day. That number continued to climb,
hitting a high of 4.5 pounds a day per person in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996, the number dipped slightly to 4.3 pounds a day,
the most recent statistic available.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger attributed the shift to two major factors: Consumers
are making small changes, such as leaving grass clippings on their
lawn and composting, and corporations, in an attempt to lower
shipping costs, are using less material to package products.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce, reuse, recycle _ that's the mantra uttered by
conservationists everywhere. Not only will you help save the earth,
you stand to save money.
</P>
<P>
   To help you get started, conservationists offered these tips:
</P>
<P>
   DECKING THE HALLS: Buy outdoor light strands that are wired in
parallel so that if one bulb blows out, the rest will keep shining.
The smaller the bulb, the lower the wattage and the lower the
energy use.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Christmas cards, consider sending an e-mail greeting.
There are dozens of Web sites that offer free, animated postcards
you can personalize and send via e-mail. Try
!bold!www.123greetings.com/Christmas,
www.marlo.com/xmas/xmas.htm!off! and
pwww.bluemountain.com/eng/christmas/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY TIME: For formal affairs, rent a gown or a tux or buy them
from a secondhand shop. Not only is this practicing the second
conservationist tenet _ reuse _ you'll save money, too.
</P>
<P>
   Turn down the heat before guests arrive. You'll save energy, and
the extra body heat of the guests will warm up the room.
</P>
<P>
   Plan meals wisely and practice portion control to minimize
waste. If you have leftovers, don't throw them away. Send food home
with guests, or donate it to a food bank or church.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING: Consolidate purchases into one bag rather than getting
a new bag at each store. Better yet, bring your own bags.
</P>
<P>
   Buy rechargeable batteries for electronic toys.
</P>
<P>
   Donate unwanted gifts or toys the kids have outgrown to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Drop off extra packing peanuts at mailing stores. Call the
Plastic Loosefill Council's Peanut Hotline at (800) 828-2214 for
names of businesses that reuse them.
</P>
<P>
   Plan what you need to buy in advance. Rather than just piling up
presents under the tree, think about what your family and friends
really want. Give a ticket to a concert, museum or sporting event.
Sign them up for dancing, golf or foreign-language lessons.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE YOUR OWN GIFTS: Homemade gifts have added meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Kreigh Hampel, a Burbank artist whose projects are made from
recycled materials, scours junkyards to find materials for gifts he
makes _ frames decorated with braided vines along the borders, or
furniture he's refinished and refashioned from discarded scraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junkyards create a huge palette of materials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be an artist to make a great gift. Here are
some additional ideas from the Center for a New American Dream, a
Takoma Park, Md., nonprofit group that offers information on
reducing consumption:
</P>
<P>
   Make a personalized basket filled with homemade muffins, cookies
or jam. Record interviews of parents, grandparents, aunts or
uncles; ask them to discuss their memories of the person you plan
to give the tape to, or compile a family history.
</P>
<P>
   Make a rope swing, painted wooden blocks or a sandbox for a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Put together a book of favorite family recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Make a calendar with important family dates such as birthdays
and anniversaries. Decorate the calendar with family photos.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a talent or a skill, you can offer that, whether
it's piano lessons, changing oil in a car, or refinishing
furniture. Or simply give the gift of your time.
</P>
<P>
   For the person you just don't know what to get? Hampel has an
elderly neighbor who lives alone. He's having her over for a
home-cooked dinner.

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If the urgings of environmentalists or even the
promise of saving money aren't enough to get you to cut down on
consumption, these surprising facts may do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least 28 billion pounds of food are wasted every year _
more than 100 pounds per person in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ If every family reduced gasoline consumption by one gallon _
about 20 miles _ it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1
million tons.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1981, the average household received 59 mail-order
catalogs. By 1991, the number had increased 140 percent to 142. If
every household canceled 10 mail-order catalogs, it would reduce
trash by 3.5 pounds a year for every household.
</P>
<P>
   _ Americans send 2.65 billion Christmas cards a year, enough to
fill a football field 10 stories high.
</P>
<P>
   _ If every family reused 2 feet of ribbon, it would conserve
38,000 miles of ribbon _ enough to tie a bow around the entire
planet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I spent my youth on a beach in Southern California gazing out to
sea where my brother or my boyfriends surfed some of the best waves
in the world. Clad in a string-bikini and puka shells, I carefully
timed my tanning sessions and applied lemon juice to my
sun-bleached hair, which insured me the identification of ``surfer
chick,'' even though I had never ridden a board.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the world of the waves was mainly a male domain,
just about every male of any age in town seemed to be able to do
it, even the ones who seemed to live entirely on caffeine, fast
food and a cornucopia of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it occurred to me recently that I might want to try
this totally hip sport, I worried that despite my reasonably good
health, above-average swimming skills and fairly good balance, I
might not _ at 40 _ be up to it. I asked my brother to opine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll rip,'' Rocky assured me. ``And it's never too late to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kid I had been an ocean distance swimmer, though I gave
that up years ago not long after I saw the movie ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   I am fairly fit, though certainly not in top form, and I stay in
shape by practicing a combat-oriented martial art that I have
studied for almost 15 years. I suppose my brother thought my
prowess in the ring might translate to the waves. Still, when
pressed, he pointedly declined to teach me. So I signed up for surf
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing instruction comes in a variety of packages, from the
two-hour group lesson to the week-long intensive. I opted for the
latter and arrived full of black coffee, and uncertainty, at the
Paskowitz Surf Camp near San Clemente, Calif., at 8 a.m. on a sunny
morning. Other than basic swimming skills, hopeful surfers should
possess a bit of upper body strength and a huge willingness to get
tossed around in breaking waves. I figured I had at least a dollop
of both.
</P>
<P>
   That first morning the waves, glassy and breaking rather
smallish, were covered with ant-like, wet-suit clad surfers, each
one seemingly an expert at slicing the long, blue tubes. As younger
campers _ some much younger _ were dropped out of BMW's and sports
utility vehicles, I confessed my nervousness to Israel Paskowitz,
the director of the camp, known locally as Izzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No worries,'' he replied, which turned out to be the surfer's
mantra. After donning a wet suit, an act that seemed akin to
stuffing a sausage, I trudged to water's edge to join my people, a
nervous group of about 25 _ ranging in age from about 8 to a
dentist from Baltimore in his early 50s. There were four other
female campers _ 13-year-old girls in full makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I came to the conclusion that I had made a terrible
mistake, the head beach instructor, Terry Sims, a former longboard
champion, launched into the opening diatribe on safety. Sims made
sure everyone had basic ocean skills like the ability to dive under
waves and swim, or even dog-paddle, through the surf. (Even with
the surfboard attached to a leg leash, post wipe-out swims run
about 10 yards and happen frequently.) ``And,'' he said, ``turn
upside down _ like a turtle _ with your board if you are about to
be slaughtered by a breaking wave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand like this,'' Sims continued, demonstrating a long, low
crouch, legs spread and backside in the air, a stance similar to
that of a disgruntled stink bug. I was surprised that he thought we
were going to stand at all. This stance, with knees deeply bent and
back hunched slightly, works the upper legs and takes a little bit
of quad strength, but it gives the beginning surfer a wide base to
balance on. Once longboard surfers have mastered standing and
balancing, they pull their legs closer together and stand more or
less upright.
</P>
<P>
   Each camper was called upon to copy Sims' example, and if
successful, was whisked into the surf alongside a cheery
instructor. My heart started thumping inside my tightly bound ribs
when I realized that the only ones of us not yet chosen were the
girls, the two other old guys and me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reminds me of high school gym class,'' I murmured to the
dentist who had surfed before and seemed not at all fazed by the
whole brouhaha. Still, we wallflowers eventually demonstrated the
kung-fu pose and within minutes I was trotting _ well, struggling _
down the beach with an enormous board perched on my head. Then,
just as suddenly, I was belly down and paddling into actual surf.
Campers flanked me on both sides. They looked like surfers paddling
out through the shore-break, grimacing each time a wave broke over
the nose of their boards, I thought, so I must, too!
</P>
<P>
   Just as a primordial yelp started to rise up inside, I was hit
by a crash of white water and my attention quickly turned to the
horizon, where it stayed most of the morning. Right then I
discovered the best thing about surfing: you can't think of
anything else while doing it. Even when waiting for a wave, surfing
requires full concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean was relentless, waves broke constantly, close in or
far out, and there was always paddling to do, lining up or striving
for position. That first day the counselors swam among us while we
learned the basics, including judging exactly where a wave would
break. Often the wave would break and roll toward shore just yards
away from a frantic paddler leaving him or her behind, bobbing on
the roiling sea.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder of wonders, after three ungraceful wipeouts, I was
standing _ yes, hunched over _ but actually riding a wave. I heard
a chorus of whoops as I made for shore, but then I went down. I
quickly floundered up onto my board. Yahoo! I had popped up into
the stink-bug pose just as Sims had modeled, but once up I
straightened up too quickly and lost my balance. Or maybe I was
just so excited about standing up, I fell off. No matter, I was
already paddling back.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, my shoulders were sore from paddling, and
they would only get worse by week's end as would my obliques (the
muscles above my hip bones) from hoisting myself onto the board).
But because of all the wipeouts, I'd been tossed around a fair bit
and my body felt loose and amazingly invigorated.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, Dorian ``Doc'' Paskowitz, the 78-year-old camp
founder whose body looks like that of a man 40 years younger, read
from his book ``Surfing and Health.'' He believes the two go hand
in hand, and his self-published book chronicles the last 50 years
of his globe-trotting surfing life.
</P>
<P>
   Paskowitz, father of the camp's director, Israel, told me he
still surfed nearly every day. He pointed toward a figure launching
into the surf. ``He's 83,'' he announced. ``Hell, compared to him,
I'm young!'' I discovered later that the 83-year-old could not lie
prone on a board because he wore a colostomy bag, so he paddled
sitting up. That afternoon I watched him slide easily down the face
of perfect three-footer.
</P>
<P>
   After the two-hour afternoon session I was nearly delirious and
could barely grip my board. Deeming myself a danger to the village,
I slogged up the beach to find our waterlogged group, buoyant and
chummy, full of camaraderie as if we had all just survived some
disaster. But there had been no disaster. Everyone was, to put it
aptly, stoked. My ankle was bleeding where a divot the size of a
golf tee had been gouged by the fin of my board, but other than
that and bone-deep exhaustion, I felt great.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week I was skilled enough to go off on my own.
I ordered myself a board, and have made several solo surfing
safaris. Each time I've been out, whether successful or not, in
good surf and in bad, I have walked out of the water feeling
fabulous. And this week I am headed back to San Clemente for a
Thanksgiving weekend surf-a-rama.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'm a surfer chick, though perhaps chick is pushing it.

back.''

   ``When Kenneth Starr was finished testifying for the day,

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is a New York tale about two savvy Upper West Side cats.
They were getting fat and lethargic, and my daughter, Diane,
thought it was time to get a kitten to perk them up. She brought
home a lively 6-week-old kitten, but things didn't work out as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The kitten bit the cats' tails, jumped on their stomachs,
scratched their ears and, worst of all, ate all their food before
they could get to it.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, as my daughter was leaving the apartment, the
two cats ran into the hall. They refused to come home, refused to
eat the food she brought out for them. They were on a hunger
strike. The only thing missing was a picket sign.
</P>
<P>
   This went on all day and all night. By the next afternoon, my
daughter gave in. She put the kitten in the carrier and brought him
back to the vet.
</P>
<P>
   When she came back, she showed the cats the empty carrier and
said, ``OK, you win.'' The cats ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   They had not been great friends, but since they went on strike
they've become inseparable. How did they know that in union there
is strength? Had they watched strikes on television? Did the
liberal tradition of the Upper West Side rub off on them?
</P>
<P>
   _ VERA LEWIS
</P>
<P>
   Alan Magill and a co-worker volunteered to do a comedy program
for residents at a city hospital. They were letting fly with old
gags and physical humor the likes of which probably hadn't seen the
light of day since vaudeville. Most of the patients were reasonably
receptive. The exception was a man sleeping in a bed in a large
room that had about 20 other beds. He turned his head to look at
the pair, and they promptly greeted him with a barrage of gags. He
responded with what they admitted was understandable disdain. ``Do
I come into your house and do this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a crowded restaurant on the Upper West Side at
dinner time. People were waiting, but the party at one of the
tables ignored the standees and lingered long after they had
finished. Diane Feldman overheard and enjoyed the waiter who
finally came up and queried, ``Would you like to see the breakfast
menu?'' It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Jeanne Burck was walking along the Upper East side to her
job as a special education teacher when she felt her tote bag grow
noticeably heavier. It was early in the morning and she knew she
was tired but this was ridiculous, she thought. She stopped, looked
inside the bag and a golden retriever, who had obviously jumped in,
was chomping on the roast beef sandwich she had prepared for her
lunch. Both dog and sandwich were evicted _ the dog claimed by an
obviously oblivious owner.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Werfel thinks the sign she saw recently in a clothing store
belongs under the heading Shopping for Dummies. It read: ``2nd
floor. Upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes park in front of my house, where there is a No
Parking Here to Corner sign, issued by the traffic department.
</P>
<P>
   I stuck a post-it note to the windshield of one car noting that
it was illegally parked. Just then a radio car stopped and a young
officer questioned what I had done. He replaced my note with a
traffic summons. ``This works better, and you never know what the
driver will do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I replied in my best teacher-trained voice, ``so what
you're saying is that my deed would engender retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me blankly for a moment and then nodded
tentatively: ``Yeah, if I used those words, that's what I'm
saying.''

   Herbert Geist was on an uptown Madison Avenue bus when a harried
woman got on at 67th Street. Could anyone give her four quarters
for a dollar, she asked anxiously. Several passengers quickly
volunteered. Transaction completed, she hurriedly left the bus. She
was last seen depositing the quarters in a parking meter.
</P>
<P>
   My 6-year-old daughter, Dorothy, was eating lunch with her
grandmother in a Madison Avenue coffee shop when she noticed the No
Smoking sign posted near the door.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress came by and Dorothy said: ``That sign is rude. Why
doesn't it say No Smoking Please?''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress looked at her a moment, unamused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you smoke?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' Dorothy said. ``I'm only a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what's it to you?'' the waitress asked.

   Are the ``Titanic'' tales ever going to stop? Probably not.
Suzanne Schwalb still can't get over an exchange that took place at
her former place of employment. A colleague was talking about going
to see the film when a friend asked, ``What's it about anyway?''
Astonished, the colleague responded, ``You know, the luxury ocean
liner that hit an iceberg and sank in the early 1900s.'' The friend
replied in disgust, ``You didn't have to give away the plot.''

   The office building called the Interchurch Center is home to a
large number of church-related offices, including the National
Council of Churches. Every week, the menu for the cafeteria is
posted in the elevator. Until recently, ``roasted vegetables in a
hallowed baguette'' appeared on the menu. The most recent menu
changed hallowed to hollowed. Carol Smolenski is not happy.
Baguettes are no longer sacred. Will someone reinstate the holiness
of the bread?
</P>
<P>
   I'm probably the last New York City woman to believe that one
can eat bagels without worrying about adding pounds to one's
figure. As a devoted lover of bagels, maintaining this belief was
always difficult until the other afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   I was waiting in a long line at Tal Bagels on 53rd Street and
First Avenue, thinking about yelling my order for a salt bagel with
egg salad when the woman in front of me bellowed, ``I'd like a
light cream cheese on a scooped raisin.'' The counterman, without
looking up, executed her wish. I was perplexed. What had she
wanted, I asked, when it was my turn. He explained to me, as if I
were not too swift, how he pulls out the inside dough of the bagel
so it is ``scooped out.''

eat bagels without worrying about gaining weight. I called out my
order: ``Light cream cheese on poppy, deep scoop.''

more pickups and sport utility vehicles than in Texas, a market so
important to the Motor City that makers have for years considered
ways to put hat racks in every model. But federal officials are
expected to adopt new emissions regulations next month that would
mess with the trucks that Texans love to drive, pushing up sticker
prices [ up]anywhere from $300 to $1,500 per truck nationwide.

A MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By CHRISTINE DAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New York City 2,200 people vie for the 600 seats available
each night at the mini-medical school at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine to hear lectures on topics such as infectious diseases,
neuroscience and physiology.
</P>
<P>
   The mini-medical program at the University of Colorado in Denver
sells out every year. And on eight consecutive Tuesdays this fall,
more than 500 people attended the mini-medical school at Emory
University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-medical schools _ community education programs offered by
medical schools and research institutions to give those outside the
field an insight into the world of medicine _ are drawing crowds
all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five mini-medical programs are offered in various parts of
the country, and requests have been made for several more. Dr.
Randy Martin, director of the Emory program, says he understands
the popularity. ``The mini-med school is a neat way for people to
experience the excitement of medical school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Doughty, a 60-year-old technical writer, attended the
Emory program and said he was especially inspired by lectures on
cell biology and genetics. ``Did you know that there are genetic
predictors for hundreds of major maladies? I'm on fire about this
stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Cohen, a professor of immunology and medicine,
organized the first mini-medical school in 1990 at the University
of Colorado in an effort to share the knowledge and expertise of
the medical-school faculty with community members.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred people enrolled, and 800 more were put on a waiting
list. ``We were expecting about 20 people to sign up, the same
number of people who would sign up for an extension-school course
on bird-watching or basket-weaving,'' he said. ``A short article in
the local newspaper about the upcoming program generated 1,200
calls in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of that program inspired medical-school professors
around the country to start their own. The programs tend to draw on
the strengths of their sponsoring medical institutions, and their
curriculums can vary significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-medical schools at universities generally take place in the
fall or spring, while those organized by institutions like the
National Institutes of Health and the State of New York Department
of Health are offered at a variety of times.
</P>
<P>
   Programs generally run nightly for four nine weeks. A number of
the programs, sponsored by medical institutions or pharmaceutical
companies, are free, while others cost $75 to $130.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levin, director of the Center for Medical Consumers in
New York City, says he believes that mini-medical schools are
useful, but he advises people to look with a critical eye at the
information presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are getting one person's point of view,'' he said. ``It
may not be the only view. It may not be the most accurate view. I
would encourage people to go further. After the mini-medical
school, stop by the medical-school library to do more research.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Fuchs, director of the Office of Science Education at
the National Institutes of Health, cited growth potential. ``People
are striving for deeper understanding, and mini-medical schools lay
the groundwork with lectures on the basic science of medicine,'' he
said. ``I would like to see a mini-med school at every medical
school.''

CLUES FOUND ON SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of years after medical scholars believe the Bible
inaccurately reported on it, scientists have begun to find real
clues to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a medical condition that has
killed millions of apparently healthy infants with the speed and
stealth of a dart that leaves no trace.
</P>
<P>
   Using autopsy results, researchers at a regional medical center
in Wichita, Kan., have found persistent levels of a blood chemical
called hemoglobin-F (HgF) in victims of SIDS in the weeks or months
after birth _ well after those levels should have declined. British
studies with a different focus have shown similar persistent
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diana L. Cochran, a professor of medicine at Wichita State
University, and her colleagues reported last week, at a meeting of
the American Public Health Association in Washington, that they had
found a series of links between the higher-than-normal levels of
HgF and some known risk factors for the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Hemoglobin is the red blood component that attaches itself to
oxygen for distribution throughout the body. It normally switches
from the HgF type, which is predominant in newborns, to
hemoglobin-A, which is normally dominant in adults, within the
first few months of life. The HgF does not release oxygen to the
tissues as readily as hemoglobin A. .
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cochran's group observed 633 infants born at Via Christi
Regional Medical Center in Wichita for six months last year. Using
the medical records, the researchers found that the elevated levels
of HgF correlated specifically with the presence of some of the
risk factors associated with SIDS, including maternal urinary tract
infection, placental complications, a pregnancy weight gain of 20
pounds or less and restricted growth in infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too soon to know, until we have many more studies,
whether preventive measures can be taken''as a result of the
findings, Dr. Cochran said. But she said the research might
eventually lead to methods of adjusting infant HgF levels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992. the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended putting
infants to sleep on their backs or sides, advice that seems to be
effective, though no one knows why. This practice has lowered the
annual number of deaths in this country from 5,000 in 1992 to 2,906
in 1996, the latest year for which statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   All manner of suspects have been blamed through the centuries
for the sudden infant deaths _ from milk to suffocating bedclothing
to mothers who were believed to have rolled on their babies in
their sleep. The myth of the ``overlaying mother'' goes back at
least to 1 Kings, in which one mother told King Solomon that
another woman had killed her own baby: ``During the night,'' she
said, ``this woman's son died because she lay on him.'' But each of
these early suspects has been exonerated.

COMDEX SHOWS PREDICTIONS OF SCI-FI COMING CLOSER TO REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - A crowd at Comdex gathers around three small robot
dogs sitting atop a demonstration platform.
</P>
<P>
   Sony technician Takishi Yamomoto pats one on the head, starting
the action at the nation's largest computer show last week. The
gray plastic creature trimmed with wires and diodes stirs slightly.
Yamomoto pats a bit more emphatically. The puppy-size robot slowly
turns his head down toward his chest and stretches his feet out in
front, in a strikingly accurate mimic of a waking dog. The crowd
oohs and ahhs.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the noise of the receptive crowd, Yamomoto bends
over and talks into an unseen microphone located where a real dog
would have an ear.
</P>
<P>
   The dog wags its tail.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd grows and people in the back strain to see the
robo-puppies go through their paces.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps better than any other Comdex item, the Sony Pet Type
entertainment prototype illustrates how the computer is coming
closer to making good on the predictions of science fiction a
generation ago. Comparisons to the clunky but lifelike movements of
Star Wars' C3PO are unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away from the robot pets, a 3-pound Sony laptop
computer sports a minuscule video camera secreted in the frame of
its pop-up monitor. It's not quite as small as the size of Dick
Tracy's wrist video phone, but it's on the market in Japan and is
expected to be sold in the United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   In another area, Richard Tinker is talking with the computerized
voice of a woman, asking her to turn appliances on or to retrieve
stock quotes or sports scores from the Internet. The product's name
Home Automated Living is an obvious reference to Hal, the computer
in ``2001, A Space Odyssey.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Robotics advancing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sony's pet prototype faces cost issues that may prevent it from
ever reaching production. But it is a striking example of how the
robotics field is advancing.
</P>
<P>
   The three dogs are programmed to function autonomously, instead
of simply following a set of prescribed directions, according to
Koji Kageyama, manager of the laboratory that produced the robots.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs respond to sound, color and other visual information
from the two tiny digital video cameras that serve as eyes. Sensors
in the head respond to touch. Acceleration sensors allow them to
sense gravity, which means that they can right themselves if they
are laid on their sides.
</P>
<P>
   The systems run on a 64-bit processor with 8 megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   One of the robots is programmed to like the color orange and
dislike blue. When he is presented with a blue piece of plastic, he
tries to push it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's attacking,'' Kageyama explains.
</P>
<P>
   When he wanders up to an orange ball, his tail wags and he pats
at the ball in a more playful manner.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the dogs vary their responses to touch. When petted,
they respond in a friendly manner and raise their front paws off
the ground to beg for more. But pat them too hard, and they will
extend their front legs and try to push away the offending hand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the robots, apparently a male, practices lifting one back
leg.
</P>
<P>
   The robots can be programmed to mimic the behavior of dogs, cats
or humans.
</P>
<P>
   Kageyama will not discuss how much the company has spent
developing the products, or how much it would cost to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much would you pay for it?'' he asks with a smile. He
dismisses several offers of $5,000 or less. ``I don't think so,''
he says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Smaller, lighter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the show, several trends in computers are apparent.
Laptops are getting smaller and lighter. And it seems that every
company in the world is selling small video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has latched onto both those trends with its VAIO notebook,
due out in the United States next year. The computer weighs
slightly less than 3 pounds and has a camera so small that it
almost goes unnoticed. The lightweight is expected to cost about
$2,200.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just laptops that are shrinking. Laptops blend into
hand-held, which are slightly larger than palm-top computers. This
year's palm tops are smaller than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   For those who find a palm top too bulky, the New Jersey company
that created hand-held computers in 1986 has a digital assistant
the size of a credit card. Franklin Electronic Publishers offers
the RexPro with 512K of RAM, enough memory to hold 6,000 entries.
The ultraportable sells for about $200. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Talk, talk talk &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Comdex, people were talking to computers. Computers
were talking back and in some cases, doing things like searching
the Internet for information or turning appliances on and off.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more colorful applications was HAL, by Home Automated
Living. Tinker demonstrated the system, chatting with Rosie, whose
voice was full of efficiency and competence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie, who won the game last night?'' he asked on Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver won 30-7,'' Rosie replied after a pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie, turn off the light.''
</P>
<P>
   A light on the booth turns off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light is off,'' Rosie replies.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie is programmed to dial up the Internet at prescribed
intervals. She then downloads prerequested information such as
sports scores, stock quotes and weather.
</P>
<P>
   Her speech-recognition skills are strong enough to handle
requests delivered over a cellular phone, Tinker said, allowing
people to turn on the lights if they are away from home or turn on
the air-conditioner at home when stuck in traffic. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Nancy Mankins, the biggest sadness is realizing her
husband has no way of knowing their two grown children have married
and that one just had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   This sadness continues week after week, year after year _ and
with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very, very bittersweet to have our first grandchild
and not be able to share it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mankins' husband, Dave, was one of three missionaries with the
Florida-based New Tribes Mission who were kidnapped from their
homes in a tiny Panamanian village on Jan. 31, 1993, by armed men,
presumably leftist guerrillas fighting the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
   If still alive, the missionaries, who also include Mark Rich and
Rick Tenenoff, would be the longest-held Americans who are still
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Their wives, who have seven children among them, have lived a
life in limbo, full of dashed hopes and one setback after another.
</P>
<P>
   But a flurry of activity in recent months has lifted the spirits
of the families to their highest levels in some time.
</P>
<P>
   In March, one of the wives, Tania Rich, testified before the
House International Relations Committee, which led to a
congressional resolution passed in September calling on the U.S.
State Department to raise the kidnapping with the Colombian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Oct. 27 in Washington, the wives met with new Colombian
President Andres Pastrana, himself a previous victim of a political
kidnapping, who promised to press the rebels during peace talks for
information about the men, even if it meant hearing of their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Also in late October, a rebel who defected to the Colombian
government revealed that he was told the three men are still alive,
though the report has not been substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to hear, although I do have to step back and
remember that this is really just a rumor,'' said Patti Tenenoff,
one of the wives. ``We've heard many rumors over the years, both
good and bad, that have created a lot of ups and downs for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, privately, many U.S. and Colombian officials have
expressed fears that the men are no longer alive. Their pessimism
has grown since 1995, when two other U.S. missionaries for New
Tribes Mission, Tim Van Dyke and Steve Walsh, were found killed
after being held a year and a half by Colombian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Tenenoff, Mankins and Rich have traveled to
both Colombia and Capitol Hill to ask for help in finding their
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   They've tried to keep memories of the men alive for their
children, who ranged in age at the time of the kidnappings from 9
months to 23 years, with old stories and photos.
</P>
<P>
   They've been interviewed in newspapers and on television;
ABC-TV's ``20/20'' plans to air a segment on the kidnappings in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mankins and Rich live in Sanford, Fla. Tenenoff lives in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about visiting different heads of state across
Latin America to ask for their assistance,'' Tenenoff said. ``We'll
keep doing everything we have to until I see my husband and he
comes home to me and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The three families were sent to live and work with the primitive
Kuna Indians in the tiny Panamanian village of Pucuro, about 15
miles north of the Colombian border, by New Tribes Mission in
Sanford.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1942, the Protestant group claims 3,200 missionaries
in 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Mankinses moved to Panama in 1986, followed by the Tenenoffs
two years later. Mark and Tania Rich arrived in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The families led peaceful, fulfilling lives, translating the
Bible into Kuna and proselytizing to more than 300 Indians.
</P>
<P>
   They had no clue of any future danger.
</P>
<P>
   But kidnappings are a normal part of life in much of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 885 people have been kidnapped for ransom in
Colombia, a practice that's become a $120 million-a-year industry.
Two-thirds of the kidnappings are by rebels, who seek out
foreigners, knowing they usually yield larger ransoms.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the missionaries were kidnapped, more than 150 men
dressed in jungle camouflage and waving submachine guns burst into
their town.
</P>
<P>
   The wives were ordered to pack their husbands' clothes _ enough
for three days _ before being assured they'd see the men again
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the men told us to have faith, and I heard my husband
tell him that 'we do have faith, and it is in the Lord Jesus
Christ,' which is the last thing I ever heard my husband say,''
Mankins said.
</P>
<P>
   Within nine days, New Tribes Mission received a demand via
shortwave radio for a $5 million ransom.
</P>
<P>
   But New Tribes Mission doesn't pay ransoms, and the kidnappers
abruptly ended contact in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, countless attempts to re-establish communication
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   In April, so-called ``celebrity hostages'' Terry Anderson and
Terry Waite, both kidnapped in Lebanon, traveled to Colombia where
they demanded that the kidnappers free the men or reveal what
happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   But attempts such as these have run up against a brick wall _ so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Pastrana's promise to push for information and the
indication from a former rebel that the men might still be alive,
New Tribes Mission has taken new actions to find them.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 6, New Tribes Mission used an airplane to drop more than
22,000 leaflets over Colombia near the Panamanian border bearing
the pictures of the men and a plea for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged that we may be close to a resolution,'' said
Scott Ross, a spokesman for New Tribes Mission. ``We found the
rebel's information to be quite credible.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next may depend on how well peace talks in Colombia
progress, because these give New Tribes Mission its only direct
conduit to the rebels through Pastrana and his negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Colombia's largest rebel group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, agreed to
negotiate an end to that country's long-lasting civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the group's sincerity has been in question since Nov. 1,
when rebels launched one of their fiercest attacks in 34 years,
killing 50 people as they overtook the southern village of Mitu.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's sure what FARC is going to do next, whether it will
fight or negotiate peace,'' said Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for
Amnesty International in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. government officials say they will urge the Colombian
government to do all it can to assist American hostages, adding
that the last indication they've had that the three missionaries
are still alive came in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the three women can't help but hold out hope their
husbands will come home to them, even after nearly six years of not
knowing their fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the holidays come, I can't understand how everybody
can be so happy when my life feels so empty,'' said Tenenoff, whose
children now are 14, 9 and 7. ``Still, not a day goes by that I
don't wonder whether that day will be the one when Rick comes home
to us.''

WESTERN PRIMARY WISE STRATEGY  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE NOV. 23 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After a fling in the national spotlight as a
go-it-alone state during the 1996 presidential campaign, Arizona is
talking seriously about joining seven other Western states in a
regional primary.
</P>
<P>
   It is a wise strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics will bluster that Arizona stands much to lose if it were
to become part of a ``Big Sky'' primary on March 11, 2000. But the
critics are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There is no argument that Arizona's 1996 primary gave the state
good exposure. It was held Feb. 27, after the always-first Iowa
caucuses and the New Hampshire primary and before the delegate-rich
primaries of New York and Super Tuesday in the South.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't meaningful exposure. Bob Dole skipped Arizona
after the opening of his campaign office, but it didn't seem to
hurt his nomination bid. And Democratic presidential candidates
were excluded from participating in the Arizona primary by their
own rules. Steve Forbes won Arizona, but who remembers? He soon
faded from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A regional primary would be different, particularly a region in
which Arizona is a major player. Candidates of both parties would
participate in the eight-state Big Sky primary, which also would
include contests in Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Wyoming, Utah,
Montana and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and its voters would get enhanced exposure. With
populations double or more of the other states, Arizona and
Colorado would be the big prizes of the day. That likely translates
into more campaign stops here over a longer period of time than in
a go-it-alone scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: Forbes carried Arizona, but did that mean he
was the West's choice? Of course not. Nationally, his Arizona win
meant little. That won't be the case if a candidate carries the
bulk of the Big Sky states _ a fast-growing region destined to see
to its clout rise. With more delegates at stake, candidates will
pay more attention, not less.
</P>
<P>
   This has added value for the region and its specific concerns,
from border issues to growth to water to natural resources to
public lands. These matters don't receive attention in the East or
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Says Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, a key proponent of a Big Sky
primary: ``We are bigger than California, and we are bigger than
Texas. It's time for the voice of the West to be better heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of such a primary also is key. The plan to sandwich
it between the coastal primaries in California and New York and
Super Tuesday in the South makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, however, must win approval in each of the eight
state legislatures. And there lies the rub. In Arizona, Gov. Jane
Hull has embraced the concept, as has the state's congressional
delegation, Democratic Chairman Mark Fleisher and Republican
Chairman Mike Hellon. But the Arizona Legislature remains
unenthused.
</P>
<P>
   Cost should not be a problem. The state's 1996 primary cost
taxpayers about $2 million, and state officials estimate a similar
expenditure under the proposed multistate primary.
</P>
<P>
   We think it would be a good idea if the entire country were
divided into regional primaries, with the first-to-vote region
rotating each election to make things fair.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Arizona and its neighbors in the West deserve to be
taken seriously by presidential aspirants. A regional primary would
benefit the region. We urge state lawmakers to make this a priority
in January. &QL;

<P>
   One of the upsets of the Nov. 3 election was the defeat of the
incumbent Republican, Michael Pappas, in New Jersey's 12th
Congressional District by Dr. Rush Holt, who had never held elected
office.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas was best known nationally as the congressman who once
sang, on the floor of the House of Representatives, a tribute he
had composed to the special prosecutor, ``Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth
Starr, now we know how brave you are.'' Holt, 50, a physicist, was
the assistant director of Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. He
will join Rep. Vernon J. Ehlers, Republican of Michigan, as one of
two physicists serving in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about starting a bipartisan physics caucus,''
Representative-elect Holt, a Democrat, joked recently in an
interview at his mother's Washington apartment. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In your campaign, you received contributions from 14
Nobel Prize winners. Did they support you because you're likely to
put science issues onto the legislative agenda?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I must tell you, we didn't try to recruit Nobel Prize winners
to my campaign. But word went out in the community that I was
running, and some scientists told others and they gave. My campaign
staff was very excited by these contributors and they wrote them a
letter and asked if it was OK to use their names. My staff picked
up on that ... just like they picked up on the fact that I'd been
on ``Jeopardy'' six times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics) Oh, really? How much did you win?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. About $5,500 and a car. This was back in the 1970s when the
categories were worth $10 and $20.
</P>
<P>
   But back to my campaign, to be honest, science was not much of a
factor in it. I would talk about what a scientist could bring to
Congress, but issues of science did not seem to move most voters.
Occasionally, I'd meet a voter who said he'd like to see someone in
Congress who ``really understood quantum mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people cared more about health care, Social Security,
education _ issues that they felt affected their daily lives, and I
tried to address those. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Now that you've won, do you intend to be the science
community's point man on the Hill?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't help but be, yes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are you starting a trend, trading laboratory for
legislature?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With all due respect to lawyers, we need more diversity among
legislators. I think more scientists should get involved in public
policy. But many say: ``Politics is dirty. There's too much
compromising.''
</P>
<P>
   You know the first question everyone asks me is why would a
scientist leave a perfectly good job at a major research lab to go
into ``that muck.'' But for me, politics wasn't such a big step.
This is the first office that I've run for, but I've worked on
Capitol Hill in the early 1980s in the office of congressman Bob
Edgar as a science, defense and education adviser. I worked at the
State Department during the Bush administration, doing arms
control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How do you think your father, the late Rush Holt
Sr., a senator from West Virginia, would have felt about your
career change?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think he'd be particularly impressed or pleased with
my election, although I showed some skill as a candidate. I think
his satisfaction would come if he saw that I was really using the
office to accomplish good for people.
</P>
<P>
   My father passionately fought for good government. ... Ever
since my election, I'm getting letters from people in West Virginia
who say, ``Your father was a hero of mine.'' He's been dead 45
years, but he's still remembered because he took stands. In fact,
he was defeated for re-election in 1940 because although elected as
a New Dealer, he fought with Roosevelt on a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, during an orientation session the Democrats had for
new members of Congress, one of the congressional leaders said to
us, the freshmen, ``If you're not prepared to leave Congress over a
principle, then you should leave now.'' I thought that was an
interesting statement. So we'll see. ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why is it important that there be scientists in
Congress?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not that scientists have a corner on the truth, but a
science background is important for understanding the limitations
of some policies. Scientists are in a position to define what is
possible. There are examples where policy makers promote programs
that just are ... fallacious, that essentially are prohibited by
the laws of science. Legislative calls for a space-based Star Wars
system had some aspects of this. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is retiring, is said to
be a big science buff. Did he support science?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the first things Gingrich did was to abolish the
Office of Technology Assessment, an agency that advised Congress on
science and technology, thus saying in effect, ``We don't want
scientists telling us what we don't want to hear.'' After that, I
found it very hard to accept Gingrich's claim that he was the
champion of science and technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Would you like to see the office re-established?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know what the political possibilities on that are.
But I do believe we have to increase the emphasis on science in the
government. If there's a slogan on the wall, it should read, ``It's
productivity, stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   The way our economy is able to provide for its people is through
productivity and that comes from educational training and new
ideas. The new ideas, primarily that's research and development. So
things such as R and D tax credits are very important. If you look
to industry, industries more and more are pulling back on research.
Economists will argue how much government funding of research and
development leads or follows corporate research and development.
I'm inclined to think it leads. But either way, we need more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Take energy research. We're spending more than $500 billion
dollars a year on energy and we're not spending 1 percent of that
on research into alternatives. Whether you're a cobbler or a tinman
if you see that your raw materials are in jeopardy, you extend some
effort to find new sources to survive. The point is that our
supplies are in jeopardy, and our means of producing energy are
environmentally damaging and yet we're paying so little attention
to alternatives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)We've heard you'll be advocating reforms in science
education.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, yes. Science education should not just be for future
scientists, but for all kids. We should get away from this idea
that in 10th grade you do biology, in 11th chemistry, and if you
stick it out long enough, you do physics in the 12th. It should be
all mixed up. And we should be teaching science in a way that's
integrated with other disciplines _ literature, social studies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How did you get interested in science?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think when I was in elementary school a book on dinosaurs
and fossils got me interested, and I decided then I would be a
scientist. My mother was a biology teacher and I'd borrow her
books. She had a master's in zoology. After my father died, she
taught at a junior college for a couple of years. Then, later, she
became secretary of State in West Virginia and she never got back
to science. But while she was still teaching, I often went to the
building where my mother was teaching and played around with the
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know at the time how dangerous it was to play with
mercury. But it sure was fun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Back to your recent campaign. When you heard
congressman Pappas singing ``Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr'' on
C-Span, what was your first reaction?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That we should rethink our media budget. I thought, every
voter in the district should have the opportunity to hear that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Would you say, if you were rewriting Machiavelli's
``The Prince'' one of your new rules might be ``Never sing on
C-Span?''(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeah. I think Al D'Amato also sang. What was it? ``Old
MacDonald Had a Farm.'' And I think Charles Schumer took a page
from our campaign with resurrecting an old Al D'Amato song. And
he's now senator-elect Schumer. &QL;

 Author Brings Everyday Hospice Tales to Life 
 (Lead)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;  &QL;  &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon'' is a book everyone should read because it is about a
subject no one wants to think about. But A.G. Mojtabai's theme _
terminal illness and death _ is a universal one, and she approaches
it with sympathy, humor, and an educated heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago Mojtabai, one of America's most gifted and
sensitive novelists, went to Amarillo, Texas, to do research for a
magazine article that evolved into her great nonfiction book,
``Blessed Assurance,'' a study of apocalyptic religion in the town
dominated by the final assembly plant for American nuclear weapons.
Up until that time, Mojtabai had led an unconventional but
cosmopolitan life in New York, Iran, and Cambridge, where she held
an appointment at Harvard; in Amarillo she unexpectedly found home.
For several years she has been a volunteer worker in the hospice at
St. Anthony's Hospital in Amarillo, and the 17 miraculous stories
in ``Soon'' come out of that experience.
</P>
<P>
   The stories circle around the experience of death no one can
describe from within, so they are stories about the living _ about
the staff and volunteers of the hospice, who appear and reappear
throughout the cycle of the story; about friends and families; and
about the dying patients. The title of one of the stories, and the
substance of all of them, remind us that the dying are ``still
here.''
</P>
<P>
   They have reached the seventh of Shakespeare's ages of man,
although they are not all old _ there's a child, not frightened by
the grim fairy tale of ``The Juniper Tree''; there's a young man,
dying of AIDS, alone. They are not even sans everything, though
their belongings don't amount to much. ``Ruthie's mother held
tightly to the possessions in her lap, all she would ever need at
this, or any, time: comb and brush, cup, tooth swabs, a cake of
soap, and a small, kidney-shaped basin _ they filled a pink plastic
tub, not much bigger than a bread box. ... Waiting for the hospice
admission procedure to begin, Ruthie would catch her consulting her
empty wrist. It was hard, Ruthie guessed, to put aside such an old
habit as time.'' These people are beyond wardrobe; they are without
any remaining public manifestation of ``identity''; they are
without hope, as most people understand that emotion; many of them
can no longer speak, or don't make sense when they try. But
Mojtabai's special grace is to show us that none of them is without
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   There are details and anecdotes embedded in ``Soon'' that have
the ring of experienced truth. Mojtabai knows the exceptional
routine of daily activity in a hospice, and she knows the anecdotes
they tell the tour groups _ and the ones they don't. One delights
in the little tale of the cowboy reunited, briefly, with his
beloved horse, and the story of the baptism in the whirlpool bath.
One shudders at the father who shouts into the room where his son
is dying of AIDS, ``It's your own fault.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the stories Mojtabai has had to invent, because the
people she writes about were past being able to tell her anything,
and as a volunteer she had no access to official medical or family
information. She saw things, felt them, and wondered. A woman,
keeping up appearances, a turban piled atop her head, exhausts her
remaining strength writing letters; to find out what was in them,
Mojtabai had to write the letters herself. A patient lay with an
orchid pinned to her pillow. Mojtabai imagines how it got there,
what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are utterly lucid and concrete, but mysterious. They
are divided into two groups _ ``Looking On'' and ``Trying to See.''
Some patients die with the consolations of religion; others do
without. All of them seem to understand and accept things their
friends and relatives do not, even the ones who are not prepared to
give up the fight. Children play while a grandparent dies. (```Kids
help a lot,' (Amy) said, `at times like this, but there won't ever
again be anybody like my father. The new doesn't cancel out the
old.' `No,' Louellen agreed, `no, it doesn't.''') The stories are
beyond description as ``upbeat'' or ``downbeat,'' though one
patient is wheeled into the chapel to bear witness to the wedding
of her favorite granddaughter, and another rides triumphantly out
of the hospice in his wheelchair, ready for a hot night out on the
town.
</P>
<P>
   But that happy ending, or happy postponement of the ending, is
not the miracle of the specific story ``Spring Me'' or the miracle
of the entire collection. Mojtabai has all the gifts of a great
writer _ the observant eye that misses no nuance of expressions;
the ear that hears the music and the poetry behind the plain
cadences of common speech; the willingness to confront her own
primal fears. It isn't even the educated heart that can write. ``I
(marvel) how strong families _ mine is not _ draw in at times like
this. It's like the closing of an open wound, or the mending of a
rip in a fabric, the threads drawing tighter around the tear,
keeping the fabric whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The miracle is the willingness to accept what is unknowable,
which is the only way to understand it. Hospice, Mojtabai reminds
us in her preface, is ``as much a mode of practice as a place. ...
Help comes through a mutual unfolding. And, happening to be present
at a graced moment, sometimes I am startled to find _ this side of
death _ the old barriers rolled away, stranger turning towards
stranger with no other strangeness than the ease of turning.''

   &UR; Rome... Paris ... Capri ... Condoms ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The adage ``when in Rome . . .'' may be more likely to describe
women than men, according to a study of British travelers published
in the current issue of The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Cardiff University in Britain interviewed 5,676
people ages 18 to 34 who had traveled abroad without sexual
partners. From those, they surveyed the 286 men and 114 women who
reported sexual encounters on their travels and found that the
sexual behavior of men tended to be consistent with their behavior
at home.
</P>
<P>
   If they used condoms with sexual partners at home, for example,
they tended to use them abroad. The sexual behavior of women, on
the other hand, was less consistent and tended to be shaped by
their new male partners.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who carried condoms on their trips were more likely
than those who did not to report new sexual relationships and no
episodes of unprotected intercourse, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   About the male-female differences, Dr. Michael Bloor, lead
author of the study, said: ``Travel may affect the sexes
differently in the degree to which they are liberated from
constraints on their behavior at home. Also, travel abroad may be
associated with notions of romance, and women may see the
relationship in a romantic light, with its connotations of intimacy
and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the study showed that 75 percent of the 400
participants used condoms on all occasions when they had sex with a
new partner overseas, the discrepancies between men and women on
condom use, Dr. Bloor added, ``highlight the need for safer-sex
campaigns which are not gender blind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ALISHA BERGER
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Appealing a Case to a Higher Authority &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It seems that sometimes even doctors refer to a higher
authority. Eighty percent of 438 family physicians who participated
in a University of Kansas survey say that at one time or another
they have advised patients to seek religious counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Given recent studies that have linked spirituality and prayer
with good health, the researchers set out to identify how often and
under what circumstances doctors refer their patients to pastoral
care. The findings were published in the current issue of the
Archives of Family Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that most of the doctors who made
referrals to ministers, priests, rabbis and other clergy said they
did so when their patients were facing a terminal illness or were
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent said they had suggested pastoral counsel to
patients who were experiencing marital and family hardship, while
nearly 40 percent cited depression and mood disorders as reasons
they had advised certain patients to seek religious or spiritual
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Daaleman, assistant professor of family medicine at
the University of Kansas, says it is critical that doctors
acknowledge their patients' spiritual needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a doctor asks a patient who has just received a
life-altering diagnosis, `How will you cope with this?' and that
patient replies, `I pray,' the physician may not be comfortable
with the response,'' Dr. Daaleman said. ``The resulting discomfort
may come across as a diagnostic or therapeutic uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who said they had never referred patients to pastoral
care gave several reasons, including previous bad experiences with
clergy and not knowing the right clergy for referrals. Only about 2
percent of the participants said that religious referrals were
outside the realm of their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that group, Dr. Daaleman said, ``Perhaps those
physicians were relying on divine intervention for the referral.''
</P>
<P>
   _ALISHA BERGER
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When to Say When For Breast-Feeding &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Our society has been so critical of women who have nursed beyond
one year. It is perfectly normal. It is done around the world and
has been for centuries. Babies wean at different times; in fact,
many anthropologists think the normal time to breast-feed is about
four years. In multiple studies, we find that babies who are
breast-fed beyond one year, instead of clinging to their mothers,
are stable, self-assured children. The sexualization of the breast
does not occur in this age group under ordinary circumstances.
Babies associate the breast with nourishment and have no reaction
that may be considered sexual. As for the father's role, it is
equal but different. Every baby needs a non-nutritive cuddler.
That's the father.
</P>
<P>
   _RUTH A. LAWRENCE, M.D. Professor of Pediatrics, University of
Rochester
</P>
<P>
   Late nursing limits the father's involvement and means that the
husband can't take on some of the most intimate child-rearing
tasks. His parenting is not about that close bonding, making it
harder for him to participate. Late nursing is also difficult for
working women. When 66 percent of mothers of children under 6 work,
who is available in that way and who wants to create the kind of
dependence that such nursing engenders? It may be medically
correct, but all decisions about children must be weighed, medical
vs. social vs. psychological. What is best for a family must be
considered, and that includes what is best for a child, because
ultimately it means what is going to create the happiest
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   _JOAN K. PETERS Author, ``When Women Work: Loving Our Children
Without Sacrificing Our Selves''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thinking, With a Wave of the Hand &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some people do it a lot, some hardly at all. But, at least
sometimes, all people talk with their hands, even children blind
since birth, two University of Indiana researchers have found,
raising the question of whether people not only talk but think with
their hands. The new study, summarized in a letter to Nature
published last week, sought to test two explanations for hand
gestures: that people who use them do so because they have seen
others do it and that gestures are used because they are useful in
conveying information.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jana Iverson, one of the researchers, said in an interview
that she and Dr. Susan Goldin-Meadow, working at the University of
Chicago, sought to test these hypotheses by comparing gesture rates
among 12 blind and 12 sighted children talking to blind and sighted
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Blind children, the researchers found, used gestures at
virtually the same rate as children who could see. In the second
phase of the study, sighted and blind children used gestures at the
same rate whether they were told the person listening was sighted
or blind.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, the researchers wrote, leave open the possibility
that ``gestures that accompany speech may reflect or even
facilitate the thinking that underlies speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   For the blind children, Dr. Iverson said, ``It was kind of a way
of helping themselves think through a problem. They moved their
hands around while they talked, and there was the answer.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The former gateway to hell is on the fourth floor of a
cavernous building at 23rd and Rockwell, on the city's near
Southwest Side. Ripped from its original location, this entranceway
is wedged into a narrow corridor, leaning against metal shelves
which are groaning under the weight of old files and records.
</P>
<P>
   In and of itself, there's nothing unusual about this
square-shaped piece of lumber. It could have been the hatchway to
anyone's attic or basement.
</P>
<P>
   What gives you the chills as you rap your knuckles against the
frame is the knowledge that this was once the doorway to John Wayne
Gacy's crawlspace.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors placed this entranceway in the courtroom for Gacy's
trial. During his closing statement, William Kunkle gathered up
photos of the known victims and theatrically flung them through the
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years later, the hatchway sits in this musty evidence
room. You are here because Gacy's venom has seeped from his grave
and he is in the headlines again. This week, investigators
commenced digging for more Gacy victims near an apartment building
where Gacy's mother once lived.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening because a private investigator told an
Illinois group called the Better Government Association he
remembered seeing Gacy in an alley near the apartment building,
holding a shovel at 3 a.m. The BGA used a radar device to sweep the
parking lot, resulting in photos of shadowy images that could be
skeletal remains.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes another dig, another search for bones, as national
attention is once against focused on the serial killer who was
executed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The morbid media circus is back in Chicago, courtesy of the
killer clown.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was at best a longshot, but you thought there might be
something in the old Gacy evidence that would connect him to that
parking lot. A notation in his appointment book, a reference to the
lot in the notes from his conversations with investigators,
something.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sobun, project coordinator of the archives department,
unlocks a bolted metal door and slides it open, and leads you to
the Gacy materials, which include the crawlspace and two oversized
boxes brimming with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to properly prepare yourself to view the photos
of the bodies, and the body parts, as they were found. You know
they're going to be unspeakably grisly _ but they're worse than you
could have possibly imagined.
</P>
<P>
   You flip through photos of bones and skulls. Dental X-rays.
Envelopes containing high school class rings, boards with hairs
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more mundane police photos are terrible. Like the
black-and-white shots of Gacy's bedroom _ the messy bed unmade, a
few crummy shirts hanging the closet, and a very creepy clown
painting on the wall. Next to the bed, a TV and a clock radio _
both of which belonged to one of Gacy's victims, John Scyz.
</P>
<P>
   You extract a piece of rope from one envelope, and Sobun says,
``That was taken from the neck of one of the skeletal remains.''
(Gacy strangled his victims by using a stick to twist the ropes
around their necks.)
</P>
<P>
   In another envelope: Heavy metal handcuffs and keys. Gacy would
put handcuffs on his victims, in the guise of showing them a magic
trick. Once they were restrained, he'd explain the trick was
``having the key.''
</P>
<P>
   A brown suede jacket with fringe trimming is tucked into one
box. It belonged to John Mowery, a 19-year-old who was the 13th of
Gacy's victims to be identified. Also in the box is Mowery's
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   You come across another jacket, this one worn by Rob Piest,
Gacy's final victim. A photo receipt from the Nisson Pharmacy in
the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines, where Piest worked, was found by
police in Gacy's home. It was a crucial piece of evidence linking
Gacy to Piest's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Next you open Gacy's appointment book for 1978-79. The early
days of December are filled with names and numbers and scheduled
meetings, but there's not a single entry after Dec. 21.
Investigators tailed Gacy for more than a week before he was
arrested; perhaps he knew the end was near.
</P>
<P>
   A notation for Dec. 16 reads, ``X-Mas Dinner Party at House.'' A
house that stood above more than two dozen bodies. (For some
reason, maybe the party was canceled. Gacy went out drinking that
night, hitting several bars and not calling it a night until 6 a.m.
Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   Your hands are coated with dust as you sift through the
20-year-old evidence. You'll scrub them like a surgeon once you're
away from this place.
</P>
<P>
   As you reach the bottom of the second box, you realize there's
nothing here connected to the parking lot where they'll begin
digging Monday (Nov. 23). Gacy once wrote a message on the back of
one of his prison-created paintings: ``Find the bodies if you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was just jerking everybody around. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   You come across one last piece of evidence _ Gacy's hand-drawn
diagram of the crawlspace, indicating where some of the bodies were
buried.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough. You thank Sobun for his time, and he leads you
outside, sliding the big metal door closed and locking it tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope we don't have to go in there for another 20
years,'' he says.

<P>
   Always an awe-inspiring sight, the giant redwoods that tower
along the California coast are perhaps at their majestic best on
foggy days, when these ancients, among the botanical wonders of the
world, can be glimpsed through wisps of swirling mist.
</P>
<P>
   But now scientists are learning that fog among the redwoods is
more than just picturesque. They believe fog may be crucial to the
well-being of these rapidly disappearing forests and an answer to
the long-pondered question: Why are redwoods the tallest trees on
earth?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long known that when fog rolls into a redwood,
water suspended in the fog begins dripping down the tree's limbs,
needles and trunk.
</P>
<P>
   But in a study to be published in January in the journal
Oecologia, Dr. Todd Dawson, a plant ecologist at Cornell University
and the University of California at Berkeley, has shown that this
curious mechanism can provide an immense amount of water to the
trees _ and to the ground around them.
</P>
<P>
   The study overturns a major piece of ecological dogma, that
plants steal water rather than contribute it to a habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In one foggy night, a single redwood can douse the ground
beneath it with the equivalent of a drenching rainstorm and the
drops off redwoods can provide as much as half the water coming
into a forest over a year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dawson concluded, the redwoods' ability to draw water
from fog appears crucial in maintaining the wet climate that they
and so many other species, some endangered, thrive in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants aren't passive players out there,'' Dawson said.
``They're active in influencing their own environment. I've never
been more wet in my life than I have been in the redwood forest
during a major fog event. You're soaking wet when you're underneath
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathleen Weathers, forest ecologist at the Institute of
Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., said, ``This is really
important, not just for redwoods but for the other plants. If you
cut the redwoods down, you take away that structure that can
intercept the fog and the water will pass right by.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists working to save these charismatic trees, which
can inspire people to extremes of impassioned zeal, have long
argued that fog drip is vital not only for plants but for
endangered animal species, as well as the people who struggle to
maintain water supplies in habitats that can see little or no rain
in the summer. Coastal redwoods, or Sequoia sempervirens, are found
patchily mostly along the California coast and into southern
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Northern California, Dawson measured the water
dripping off redwoods and off artificial fog collectors in forested
and deforested areas. He found that redwoods are extremely
efficient producers of fog drip. In deforested areas, which warm up
and dry out quickly, it is much more difficult to capture water
from fog.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson also took advantage of the fact that not all water is
created equal. Hydrogen and oxygen, the two components of water,
come in different forms, or isotopes. Fog water and rainwater can
be distinguished from one another by the varying ratio of isotopes
they contain.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the isotopes in water in different plants, Dawson found
that fog drip was an important source of water to redwoods as well
as many other plants. He said sword ferns were at times entirely
dependent on the water coming off redwood trees.
</P>
<P>
   With redwoods thriving in a wet environment and thriving
redwoods making the environment wetter, the interaction forms a
positive feedback loop. Dawson said even the handsome structure of
a redwood itself may help with this feedback. Redwoods may have
evolved their structure of many branches and an array of fine
needles over the aeons because the complex structure so efficiently
strips fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story that gets repeated in a lot of different
environments around the world,'' Dr. Tom Hinckley, forest biologist
at the University of Washington, said of the interaction between
fog and trees. ``Until now these fog phenomena have been largely
discounted.''
</P>
<P>
   For local activists who live in and around redwood forests,
scientific confirmation of their theories was good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you clear cut, you don't have any input from the fog,''
said Els Cooperrider, a redwood conservationist and local radio
talk-show host, who said she has made ``fog drip'' a household word
in Mendocino County. ``One of the reasons so many people around
here have begun to listen to this phenomenon of fog drip is that
they've seen their wells and springs dry up.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Carroll, lawyer for Friends of the Old Trees, a
conservation group in California, said the group had already used
fog drip as an arguing point to stop logging. Twice the group
prevented cutting in a redwood forest using the objection that the
loss of water from fog drip was not addressed adequately in the
logging plans that had been submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists are fighting a difficult battle as researchers
say only 4 percent of the original redwood forest remains standing
today and a single old-growth redwood can contain wood worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson said it remained an open question whether the fog water
he studied replenished streams or ground water. Among those eager
for answers are biologists interested in the fate of endangered
species like the coho salmon, whose streams run through redwood
forests before reaching the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see this being hugely important,'' said Dr. Terry
Roelofs, salmon stream ecologist at Humboldt State University in
Arcata, Calif., explaining that the time coho spend in shallow,
drying streams in the summer can be a crucial bottleneck for these
fish. ``If fog drip contributes to stream flows, that would be a
real plus for these animals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While new to biologists, the idea that fog can be a crucial
source of water has in fact been around for some time. In coastal
regions of South America and in Namibia, where fog is common but
water is not, people build elaborate structures _ which function
like a redwood's many branches and needles _ to capture water from
rolling banks of fog.

</P>
<P>
   Whatever else biologists may learn about redwoods, the most
stunning thing about them remains their sheer, jaw-dropping size.
Dr. John Sawyer, vegetation ecologist at Humboldt State University,
said the tallest tree alive in the world today is a 370-foot-tall
redwood whose location biologists declined to disclose, to protect
its fragile habitat from visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But given the physical challenge of moving water up to high
leaves and branches, biologists have long wondered how redwoods
achieved their fantastic size.
</P>
<P>
   Plants do not have an active pumping system to move water, and
depend instead on the evaporation of water out of the leaves, an
action that draws up more water from below.
</P>
<P>
   But this passive movement of water has to be strong enough to
overcome the resistance within the pipelike structures that
transport water throughout a plant, and the taller the pipe the
greater the resistance. With too much resistance a plant can suffer
a break in the water column, which could stop the flow of water
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book on redwoods scheduled to be published next fall by
Island Press, Dawson has contributed to an article that suggests
that the ability of redwoods to keep their environment so moist
with fog water may reduce the rate at which they lose water and the
rate at which water must move up through them, thereby reducing the
water demands that keep other plants from growing to such great
heights.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dawson said it was possible that redwoods were
taking in fog water through their foliage, an ability that could
greatly reduce their need to move quantities of water upward.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reed Noss, co-director of the Conservation Biology Institute
and editor of the upcoming volume on redwoods, said that
understanding the relationship between fog drip and the stupendous
height of redwoods was more than a mere curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells us something about restoration,'' said Noss. If it is
the presence of a lot of big, fog-stripping redwoods that allows
redwoods to soar skyward, he asks, ``once we deforest a site, will
we ever be able to grow these giants back?''

TEXAS PAROLES WOMAN CONVICTED OF MURDERING HER STEP-FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Sonia Cacy, whose conviction of a heinous murder
was based in part on a county medical examiner's report, was
paroled Monday after serving six years of a 99-year-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just overwhelming. My thoughts won't work. I can't
talk,'' Cacy said shortly after being released from a Texas state
prison in Gatesville.
</P>
<P>
   But she said her freedom was just the first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my name cleared. I want to be found innocent,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cacy, 51, was convicted in Fort Stockton in 1993 of killing her
aging step-father, Bill Richardson, by pouring gasoline over him
and then igniting him.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the prosecution's case was a finding by the Bexar
County Medical Examiner's lab of traces of gasoline on Richardson's
charred clothing. A second analysis, however, detected no gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial, various outside experts have reviewed the same
lab analysis and have not found gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Cacy's conviction and the disputed forensic evidence received
national news attention in stories examining the reliability and
power of expert witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that Richardson, a heavy smoker, probably
died of a heart attack, and the fire was likely caused by a
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Cacy and her lawyers said they would file a writ, or formal
legal document, with the trial court in Pecos County asking to have
the conviction overturned.
</P>
<P>
   They will argue that the Bexar County experts were wrong and
that Cacy had a listless defense lawyer who did not call any
credible expert witnesses to counter the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has gotten national attention because crime labs do
crank out these expert results, and they often go unchallenged,''
said Gerry Morris, an Austin lawyer who is preparing the writ.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I can't understand _ that is flat beyond me _ is why
the lab doesn't say, `We made a mistake,' especially when so much
is at stake,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the prosecutor nor the Bexar crime lab was ready to
admit error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen any information to lead me to believe we
convicted an innocent woman,'' Albert Valadez, the Pecos County
district attorney who tried Cacy for murder, said from his office
in Fort Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent DiMaio, the Bexar County Medical examiner, said
Monday he stood behind his technicians and their assessment of how
Richardson died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cases have been reviewed internally, and everyone still
says the gasoline is there. As to the person dying of a heart
attack, that's absurd,'' DiMaio said.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio likened the dispute to that of another high-profile case
involving disputed forensic evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the O.J. Simpson case, you can always get
experts to say something different. So that's it ... This is what
defense lawyers get paid for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer Eric Rabbanian, who represented Cacy before the
parole board, said Cacy would remain under supervision by the state
for the rest of her life unless her conviction is overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the eyes of the law, she's a murderer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cacy said she did not intend to give up trying to have the
conviction overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If prosecutors and forensic experts can do this to people,
they can convict anyone, especially if you don't have any money.
It's frightening,'' she said.

<P>
   AIDS virus infections worldwide have risen 10 percent over the
past year, showing a disturbing lack of progress in prevention, the
U.N. AIDS Program in Geneva said in a report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The document, released as part of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, also
reported that the spread is largest among young people and more
women are becoming infected.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of people infected with HIV, the AIDS virus,
rose by 5.8 million, to 33.4 million from 27.6 million. All but 5
percent of the infections occurred in Asia, Africa and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the new infections _ nearly 3 million _ were among those
15 to 24, the age when most people become sexually active. Because
it is also a time when they are at their peak productive and
reproductive years, AIDS is causing economic devastation in many
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children orphaned by AIDS is also rising
dramatically. ``This is gloomy news,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, the
head of the U.N. AIDS Program.
</P>
<P>
   Women are reaching an unwelcome equality with men in HIV
infections, the UNAIDS report said. Women now account for 43
percent of all HIV infected people over 15 years, a rise of 2
percent over the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no indications that this trend will reverse,'' Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   One in ten new infections among people under 15 years resulted
from infection in utero, at birth, or through breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   HIV runs rampant in Africa, the report also noted. Namibia and
Swaziland have been added to the list of countries where from 20
percent to 26 percent of people 15 to 39 are infected. They join
Botswana and Zimbabwe as the countries with the highest infection
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the staggering rates, many people in those countries
refuse to discuss AIDS or say someone died of it. ``The silence
needs to be broken,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   HIV trends in India, where 930 million people live, are also
alarming. Only two years ago, HIV was thought to be concentrated in
urban sex workers and their clients, Piot said in an interview. Now
in five Indian states, more than 1 percent of pregnant women in
urban areas are infected.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, rural areas, where 73 percent of Indians live, were
thought to be spared from HIV. Now in some areas, HIV has become
common in villages and cities.
</P>
<P>
   A random survey of households in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu
with 25 million people indicates that 500,000 are infected.
Infection rates are 2.1 percent in rural areas compared with 0.7
percent in cities. The rates are expected to soar because 10
percent of the population had gonorrhea, syphilis and other
sexually transmitted diseases, which increase the risk of HIV
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Many women who have sex only with their husbands are at high
risk of becoming infected. In one study, of 400 women attending a
clinic for sexually transmitted diseases in the city of Pune, 93
percent were married and 91 percent said they never had sex with
anyone but their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   During 1998, the United States and western Europe recorded
little progress in reducing the number of new HIV infections, and
while the disease is not out of control in these areas, it has not
been stopped, the United Nations said.``The epidemic has not been
overcome anywhere,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   World AIDS Day will focus on ways to harness the power of youth
to prevent HIV infections. The United Nations report said that
young people were more likely to practice abstinence or safer sex
than adults if they had the information and skills to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In Senegal, 40 percent of women under 25 and 65 percent of men
used condoms with non-regular partners in 1997, compared with less
than 5 percent for both sexes at the start of the decade due
largely to educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   In western Europe, 60 percent of young people now use condoms
the first time they ever have sex, up from 10 percent since the
early 1990s. Nevertheless, in the United States 3 million
adolescents a year contract a sexually transmitted disease, a clear
indicator of unsafe sex that also increases the risk of
transmitting HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, when AIDS was first recognized, 47 million people
have become infected and 14 million have died. Of these, 2.5
million will have occurred in 1998. AIDS now kills more people
worldwide than any other infection, ahead of malaria, which caused
1 million deaths. Tuberculosis is third.
</P>
<P>
   Because tuberculosis is common among HIV infected people, and
accounts for 30 percent of all AIDS deaths, stronger programs are
needed to combat tuberculosis and AIDS, the United Nations said.

HELPING AIDS PATIENTS HAVE SAFE SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The patient was running late; he was due at work in
20 minutes and didn't have time to chat, but he did need the
doctor's help with a couple of quick problems.
</P>
<P>
   First on his list was an annoying burning and discharge after
urination that he worried meant he had picked up a sexually
transmitted infection from an incautious sexual encounter over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And second, he needed refills on all his regular medications:
the three he took for AIDS, his vitamins, and the testosterone and
Viagra he took to normalize his sexual functioning.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, none of his requests would have given the doctor much
pause. Together, they packed a wallop. Were the patient's symptoms
evidence that he was not using condoms during sexual activities _
activities that were enabled by the doctor's prescriptions, and
were putting others at risk of HIV infection? What were the
doctor's responsibilities in this situation?
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those moments that medical school seldom prepares
doctors for, but that caring for people with HIV infection is
increasingly providing. As AIDS changes from an inevitably fatal
condition to one people can live with for years, patients are
struggling to readjust _ and doctors are, too.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-paced tragedy and heroics of dealing with catastrophic
illness are fading from their workdays, which are filling instead
with the less dramatic but often far more difficult tasks of
helping patients with a chronic but treatable illness craft normal
lives.
</P>
<P>
   And integrating sexual activity into those lives is probably the
most complex job of all, for patients and doctors alike.
</P>
<P>
   HIV infection can affect sexual and reproductive health in a
variety of ways. Depression can limit sexual drive in both men and
women; irregular menstruation is common in women, while in men,
blood testosterone levels may fall to levels far below normal,
causing fatigue, weight loss and an inability to function sexually
that may persist even on the powerful new AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual dysfunction is very prevalent in HIV-infected people,''
said Dr. Ellie Schoenbaum, director of AIDS research at Montefiore
Medical Center in the Bronx. ``All through the epidemic we've found
that patients haven't had the active sex lives or rapid partner
turnover we first expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s a series of studies showed that replacing
testosterone in men with HIV infection ``transformed them,'' said
Dr. Judith Rabkin, a professor of clinical psychology at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons who worked on some
of the earliest studies. Men gained muscle mass and energy and
shook off depression, and their sexual desire and performance
became more normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testosterone is an extremely popular and effective
treatment,'' she said, one that is increasingly accepted by doctors
for HIV-infected men and is being studied for women with HIV as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Important in her studies, Dr. Rabkin said, was the discovery
that improving men's sexual functioning with testosterone
unquestionably increased the likelihood that they would use
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before taking testosterone, a lot of men didn't use condoms
because they were afraid they would lose the erection,'' Dr. Rabkin
said. ``That wasn't the case afterward. So giving it to people can
actually be a positive public-health move.'' While Viagra is too
new to have been studied extensively in HIV-infected men, it is
also used by doctors to help patients with HIV function more
normally.
</P>
<P>
   Against these straightforward medical facts, the behavioral
facts are plain, too. Despite the ``safe sex'' and ``use condoms''
mantras that permeate AIDS counseling, in sexual matters, people
with HIV find it as difficult as anyone else to speak frankly to
partners and to use condoms.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in February in the Archives of Internal
Medicine, Dr. Michael Stein of Rhode Island Hospital in Providence
found that 40 percent of the sexually active HIV-infected people he
surveyed had not told all their recent sexual partners of their
infection. More than half of them also did not use condoms
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that as survival increases and optimism about the
disease increases, there will be more truthful talk about sex among
infected people and their partners,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Who should initiate these conversations? Is it the infected
person's responsibility to tell, or the partner's responsibility to
ask? Both, said Dr. Ronald Bayer, a professor of public health at
Columbia University who has written extensively on the topic of
sexual ethics in HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethicists increasingly endorse a responsibility on the
part of the infected person to protect uninfected partners, as well
as a responsibility on the part of partners to protect themselves,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the sexual ethics of AIDS _ complicated enough when only the
participants are involved _ become even more of a tangle when a
third party hovers in the background, influencing the course of
events with a prescription pad.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the doctor's primary allegiance is
traditionally to the health and well-being of his or her own
patient. Still, experts in medical ethics acknowledge the
obligation to protect other people who may be injured by the
patient. In recent years, the courts have emphasized this
obligation, finding doctors liable for failing to warn others of
potential harm at the hands of their violent patients or of
patients with communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
   When a doctor is treating a patient known or suspected of being
sexually reckless, the doctor may well choose to withhold
medications that enable sexual activity, until the patient
demonstrates more responsible behavior, said Nancy Dubler, a lawyer
and ethicist who heads the division of bioethics at Montefiore
Hospital and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But even this simple decision can be a terrible mistake if a
patient who occasionally neglects to use condoms becomes completely
unable or unwilling to use them as a result.
</P>
<P>
   When the patient who was late for work wanted his prescriptions,
the doctor's next two patients were jittering in the waiting room.
But a physician in this situation ``has the absolute obligation to
deliver a set of educational and moral warnings and information
with the medication,'' Ms. Dubler said, and must tell the patient
that his right to a normal and enjoyable sex life is balanced by
``extraordinary obligations'' to be candid with sexual partners and
avoid putting them at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' the doctor said. ``I know you're in a hurry, but I

WEB SITE TRACKS MUNIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - As one of the few tax shelters left, municipal bonds
have been popular investments for years.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping track of these obscure IOUs can present a real
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the more than 7,000 stocks and nearly 8,000 mutual
funds in the United States, municipal-bond issues number 1.4
million. Not only is the market vast, but information isn't readily
available.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, muni-bond prices and yields aren't quoted
in newspapers or magazines, which means you must call your broker
every time you want an update.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason prices aren't quoted is that the universe is so
large,'' said Tom Hislop, chief executive officer of the Phoenix
investment firm Peacock Hislop Staley &AMP; Given.
</P>
<P>
   But a free new Web site unveiled on Monday by the Bond Market
Association in New York provides substantially more information on
municipal bonds than has previously been available. The site
(www.investinginbonds.com) tracks key information on actively
traded munis _ those that logged at least four trades on the
previous day. On average, about 1,000 bonds will show up each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors will easily and quickly be able to compare the
prices and yields of actively traded issues based on the prior
day's trading activity,'' said Heather Ruth, president of the Bond
Market Association, which counts 200 securities firms as members.
</P>
<P>
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt also
came out in support of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This highly commendable effort represents another step toward
improving price transparency in the debt market,'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also includes other information, including primers
on government, corporate, municipal and inflation-index bonds, plus
links to additional investing sites.
</P>
<P>
   Like many bond-market experts, Hislop said he hadn't yet seen
the Web site but welcomed the greater availability of price and
yield figures. Investors at his firm and others typically receive
such information once a month with their account statements. People
who seek more frequent updates must call their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a client owns 30 different bonds, it becomes a problem to
call a broker for prices every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Web site doesn't provide a complete listing for all
bonds, it generates enough samples to give you a feel for where
your bond is trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, you want to look at comparable issues,'' Hislop
said, referring mainly to bonds with similar credit ratings,
interest rates and maturities.
</P>
<P>
   One nice feature of the service allows you to screen bonds by
various traits, including credit rating, maturity, trading volume
and coupon (or interest rate). In addition, you can sort bond
trades by the state where the issuer is based.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 15 Arizona bonds showed up on the Web site's
inaugural day. Issuers ranged from Maricopa County and Salt River
Project to subdivisions of the cities of Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa,
Scottsdale and Cottonwood.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds issued by Arizona municipalities are in high demand by
Arizona residents because these bonds pay interest that skirts both
federal and state taxes for local investors.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans also can search the Web site for, say, California or
New York bonds, but their interest payments would avoid federal
taxes only. Similarly, people living elsewhere in the country may
buy Arizona bonds, but they too would receive only the federal tax
break.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site provides three main types of yields, and a rough
knowledge of these is critical if you hope to make sense of the
service.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the site presents a ``coupon'' or stated interest
rate, which measures the yearly interest paid by a bond divided by
its face or maturity value.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there's the ``yield to maturity,'' which shows the
compounded yearly interest paid by a bond divided by the current
price. Yield to maturity also factors in the impact from any
capital gains or losses if you buy a bond for a price that's
different from its maturity value. For example, if you buy a bond
for 98 percent of its maturity value, the yield to maturity will be
higher than the coupon or simple yield, reflecting that 2 percent
capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the Web site presents ``yield to call,'' which measures
the compounded yearly interest compared to a bond's call price.
Many issuers can call, or forcibly redeem, their bonds prior to
maturity, usually at a price slightly above the normal maturity
amount. Calls typically are bad for investors because they must
relinquish their bonds early.
</P>
<P>
   To see how these three yields can vary, consider the figures
listed Monday for a 1989 issue of Scottsdale Water &AMP; Sewer Revenue
Project bonds. They carried a 5.25 percent coupon, a 4.56 percent
yield to maturity and a 4.47 percent yield to call. The latter two
figures reflect a recent price 6.5 percent above the maturity
value.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site takes a while to get used to. For starters, the
names of muni issues are abbreviated and thus can be hard to
decipher. Also, the daily high and low prices are extremes that
don't necessarily indicate where most trades took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good effort for taking some of the mystery out of
bond-market prices, but some of these numbers are confusing,'' said
Chuck Howell, a senior trader of Arizona muni bonds for Piper
Jaffray in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a free site of this caliber is a welcome development.
Individuals directly hold about 33 percent of all muni bonds and
own 40 percent more through mutual funds. &QL;

portions of the metro Atlanta area until January, is accused of
pocketing at least $13,000 in state funds by forging the names of
office volunteers and falsely claiming expenses, such as the cost
of speechwriters. He also is accused of offering a staffer $2,700

   STATE-MASTERCARD-MISUSE _ With state charge card in hand,
workers at the Texas Department of Health went shopping for
computer printers. They charged so many to the state budget that
almost every cubicle in some regional offices had a private
printer. And computer scanners? Those were charged, too, even when
they weren't needed. Eight months later, some were still in their
original boxes. The purchases were made on Mastercards used by
state employees but billed to the State of Texas. Just after state
officials cracked down on misuse of American Express cards by state
employees, new documents show similar abuse of Mastercards by state
employees. A recent audit at the state health department found that
nearly one quarter of all Mastercard purchases violated rules.
Auditors found that employees, who are limited to $1,000 a
purchase, were swiping the card several times in order to buy
things that cost $6,700, and using the card to get around General
Services Commission contracts. The misuse of Mastercards more
directly affects taxpayers because the state picks up the tab,
unlike the state-issued American Express purchases, which are
billed to the employees. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman).

HOW MUCH THERAPY IS ENOUGH? IT DEPENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1946, two Chicago psychoanalysts, Drs. Franz Alexander and
Thomas French, observed that while some of their patients required
years of therapy, others got better after much briefer treatment,
sometimes even ``as the result of a few consultations.'' The
therapist's task, the analysts asserted in ``Psychoanalytic
Therapy,'' should be to provide ``flexible'' and ``efficient''
treatment, ``adjusted to the individual nature of the great variety
of neurotic patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that therapy could be brief was radical in an era when
psychoanalysis was ascendant and long-term therapy the norm, and
the Chicago analysts' work was sharply criticized. Fifty years and
a health-care revolution later, short-term psychotherapy _ defined
as therapy intended to last anywhere from one session to 15 or 20
sessions _ has become the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Americans receive mental health care under
insurance plans that closely monitor the course of treatment, set
limits on the length of therapy and require authorization for
further visits at frequent intervals. People who spend years in
psychotherapy pay almost all the costs themselves, and Woody Allen
jokes are a relic from a time when ``managed care'' was still just
a gleam in a cost-control expert's eye.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of how much has changed, the bible of psychotherapy
research, ``The Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior Change,''
will omit its customary chapter on brief therapy in its 2001
edition ``because almost all therapy is brief therapy now,'' said
the book's editor, Dr. Michael Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question of how much therapy is enough in different
cases remains elusive, bedeviling a field that is struggling to
justify every 50-minute hour spent by a therapist in the consulting
room. There is a growing consensus that some patients need longer
treatment _ and that they do not always receive it. But scientific
knowledge lags far behind the fervor of policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of outcome data that would enable us to use
psychotherapy with the precision and certainty with which a
physician operates to remove tonsils or gallstones simply does not
exist,'' Dr. Carol Shaw Austad, a psychologist at Central
Connecticut State University, wrote in ``Is Long-Term Psychotherapy
Unethical?'' (Jossey-Bass, 1993). And the issue of treatment
duration remains a volatile one, guaranteed to stir debate in any
gathering of clinicians, managed-care representatives and employers
who pay the bill for their employees' mental health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this dearth of knowledge, researchers around the
country are beginning to examine psychotherapy in a much more
systematic way than ever before. They are exploring, in carefully
designed studies, what the appropriate ``dose'' of psychotherapy
might be for different groups of patients, and tracking the
progression _ rarely a linear one _ that patients make as they
improve.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, investigators are moving outside the
laboratory, trying to study effectiveness and length of treatment
in real-world settings, a major focus of the National Institute of
Mental Health's research program. And while most studies of therapy
have been short-term, scientists are now trying to follow patients
for longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in outpatient clinics and private offices, clinicians
are developing their own innovations, finding new ways to provide
continuing care by challenging traditional assumptions about the
timing and frequency of sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that therapy should be brief does not stem just from
the desire to control costs and prevent the abuse of benefits.
Insurers began placing limits on psychotherapy in the 1980's, when
employers complained about surging mental health costs, and
analyses indicated that a minority of insured employees were using
a majority of psychotherapy services. But studies dating from the
1960's and 1970's demonstrate that short-term treatments of many
different schools are effective for a variety of emotional ills,
particularly those that are clearly defined, like phobias and some
other anxiety disorders, stress-related conditions, grief
reactions, marital difficulties, sexual dysfunctions and some forms
of depression.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Freud was the first brief therapist: He treated the
composer Gustav Mahler for impotence while the two men took a few
walks together, and he conducted a spontaneous single-session
analysis of an 18-year-old woman on a mountain trail.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, national surveys have consistently shown that if
attendance record is a true indicator, most Americans choose brief
treatment, even when longer therapy is available. A 1987 survey,
for example, found that of the 3 percent of the population that
sought psychotherapy, about a third (33.9 percent) stopped going
after the first or second visit. Another third (37 percent) dropped
out after 3 to 10 visits.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by such statistics and building upon the work of
brief-therapy pioneers of past decades, like James Mann, Peter
Sifneos, Habib Davenloo, Bernard Bloom and others, therapists have
developed an abundance of short-term techniques. These methods,
some mainstream, some best described as ``alternative,'' share
certain characteristics: They are goal oriented and clearly
focused, they take advantage of the continuing benefits of therapy
even after the sessions stop, and they play to a patient's
strengths. In addition, most play down the influence of unconscious
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care companies, for their part, routinely cite the
effectiveness of brief treatments and the preferences of patients
in justifying their focus on short-term therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as researchers are discovering, people recover from mental
disorders at different rates, and their progress does not always
conform to the time limits enforced by insurers, or the prepackaged
therapies offered by some practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with more severe conditions, for example, get better
more slowly. Some illnesses, like depression, are recurrent. And
even patients who need only a few sessions of therapy now may in
the future want and benefit from further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ellen Frank, a professor of psychiatry at the University of
Pittsburgh's Western Psychiatric Institute, observed: ``There's
been a kind of dogmatism about short-term treatments _ this is a
12-week treatment, or this is a 16-week treatment. For some
patients, fewer sessions are adequate. But there are others who, if
we're going to take things seriously, we may be talking about
weekly therapy ad infinitum.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank's own research on depression is a case in point. Two
methods of brief therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and
interpersonal therapy, have been shown in large clinical trials to
be effective _ both alone and in combination with antidepressant
drugs _ in treating depressed patients. But people who suffer from
one episode of depression are prone to relapse after months or
years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank and her colleagues studied 138 depressed patients over
a three-year period. All the patients in the study recovered from
their initial episode of depression through a combination of drugs
and interpersonal therapy. Patients who received no further
treatment were more likely to relapse, while patients who received
interpersonal therapy monthly or who continued taking medication
were more likely to be protected against further illness.
</P>
<P>
   Even patients with much milder problems, clinicians are finding,
may benefit from a longer-term relationship with a therapist, even
if they come in for a session every few months, or for a few weeks
every few years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Simon Budman, president of Innovative Training Systems and
an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School,
says he often sees patients over a period of years, but
intermittently, dealing with different problems as they come up in
the patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   In this model, much of the ``work'' done by the patient takes
place outside of the consulting room, as the therapist adopts a
role more like that played by the family doctor: a constant and
reassuring figure who can inspire progress at critical times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perspective that everybody can be treated in five sessions
or less doesn't take into account the ways that people change,''
Dr. Budman said. ``There is a way to be humane and thoughtful and
helpful to people, but at the same time consider the issue of cost,
in terms of dollars, human suffering and people's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have known for some time that the quality of the
relationship between therapist and patient, the so-called working
alliance, is one of the best indicators of therapy's success, but
they are also beginning to discover other predictors of outcome.
Patients who get better in therapy, for example, are usually those
who show improvement within the first few sessions. And more
severely disturbed patients are likely to have worse outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   More difficult is establishing exactly how much psychotherapy is
required by different types of patients for them to get well. But a
growing number of studies indicate that many patients take longer
to recover than the length of time provided by the typical
insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 45 patients seen at a university clinic, for
example, Dr. Lambert, the editor of the psychotherapy handbook, and
his colleagues at Brigham Young University found that after eight
sessions of therapy, only 22 percent of patients had made a
significant recovery; after 16 sessions, 50 percent had become
better, and it took 26 sessions for 75 percent of the patients to
meet the criteria for a successful outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In a new study, as yet unpublished, Dr. Lambert has elaborated
these findings, showing that of 75 outpatients, those who exhibited
a ``higher level of distress'' took on average eight more sessions
to reach recovery than patients with lower levels of distress. The
results, Dr. Lambert says, suggest that to provide adequate
treatment, insurance plans should cover at least 20 sessions of
psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were an employer with a tightly limited plan, I'd feel
like I was only serving half my employees, and it's the half who
are least in need of help,'' Dr. Lambert said. ``I'm not serving
the people with the toughest problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing 30 years of studies involving more than 2,400
patients, Dr. Kenneth Howard, a psychologist at Northwestern
University, was the first to establish this type of
``dose-response'' curve, giving scientists a means of charting
therapy's action the way pharmacologists track the efficacy of
drugs. Dr. Howard's numbers differ slightly from Dr. Lambert's: He
found, for example, that after eight sessions, 50 percent of
patients showed measurable improvement. But he also found that
patients with diagnoses of conditions like depression or anxiety
took 20 sessions to respond to therapy. And patients with more
severe problems, like borderline personality disorder, often
required a full year of therapy before they showed improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Some managed-care companies, aware that it is in their long-term
interest to insure that patients get what they need, have become
active participants in this type of outcome research. ``We've been
selling the idea of quality, and the customers _ employers, the
government, whoever _ are saying `Fine. Show us.''' said Dr. Jeb
Brown, director of the Center for Clinical Informatics, a firm in
Salt Lake City that is a consultant to the managed care industry.
Other companies, plagued by debt and eager to curtail losses,
evince little interest.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health experts predict that the ire of practitioners and
the complaints of patients will, in the next few years, nudge the
treatment pendulum, now lodged firmly in the ``less is more''
position, back into a more moderate zone. Whether that shift brings
the field closer to the goal of matching treatment to patient
depends on how much researchers are able to learn, and on the
collective decision about what is worth paying for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very cost-conscious society,'' said Dr. Hans Strupp,
Distinguished Professor of Psychology emeritus at Vanderbilt
University, ``and we are a society in a hurry. We can do certain
things in a limited amount of time. But with others, we shouldn't
fool ourselves.''

PRISON GUARD ALLEGEDLY BRAGGED OF KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A prison guard allegedly boasted of shooting to
death an unarmed inmate who had escaped from prison and begun a new
life in Puerto Rico before being recaptured and returned to San
Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   Correctional Officer Timothy Scott Reynolds repeatedly bragged
that he killed inmate Mark Adams in a prison exercise yard after
Adams was featured on ``America's Most Wanted'' and recaptured, the
officer's former girlfriend testified.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Pamela Jean Gallagher, a clerk with the Modesto
Police Department, was given in a wrongful death suit filed by the
inmate's widow.
</P>
<P>
   The case was being heard before U.S. District Judge William
Orrick of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Adams' family and his widow, who met him
while she was his supervisor in prison, fell in love with him and
allegedly hid him in her San Rafael apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Their suit claims that Reynolds used excessive force on March 7,
1994, when he fired three shots from 25 feet, striking Adams once
in the back of the head. It also claims the California Department
of Corrections was the nation's only law enforcement agency to
maintain a ``sadistic'' policy allowing guards to shoot inmates to
halt fistfights.
</P>
<P>
   Both Reynolds and the department have denied the civil suit's
allegations. They say the shooting was necessary to stop Adams _
who was in prison for a murder and robbery he committed at age 16 _
from beating another inmate.
</P>
<P>
   The department also maintains its policy on the use of firearms
was proper. But while the rule has not changed, the department in
recent years has ``clarified'' the ``when and when not to fire''
circumstances and given guards additional firearms training, said
corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton. Fatal shootings of inmates
have declined, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' death at San Quentin's high-security East Block exercise
yard marked an abrupt end to what seemed to be one man's nearly
successful transcontinental flight from the past. The convicted
murderer's supporters in Puerto Rico even lobbied against his
extradition to the United States, holding candlelight vigils on his
behalf. But the saga ended as it began, with a rifle shot to the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides of the case declined to discuss the Adams
trial, which follows a barrage of other suits and investigations
questioning correctional officers' use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1989 and 1994, state prison guards shot dead 28 inmates,
more than three times as many as in all other U.S. prisons
combined, said Steve Fama of the Prison Law Office, a private
prisoners legal services group in San Rafael.

`OPENED GROUND' AND `SEAMUS HEANEY': IN A LYRIC VISION, DANGER
CASTS A LONG SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the best descriptions of Seamus Heaney's extraordinarily
rich and varied oeuvre come from the poet's own work: His verse not
only gleans ``the unsaid off the palpable'' but also captures the
``music of what happens,'' both in the domestic sphere and in the
larger world beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing ideology and ``the diamond absolutes'' of partisans on
both sides in Northern Ireland, Heaney has created a remarkable
series of poems that stay ``true to the impact of external
reality'' while at the same time remaining ``sensitive to the inner
laws of the poet's being.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily for the reader, the publication of ``Opened Ground,'' a
new selection of Heaney's poems spanning the years 1966-1996 and
demonstrating the consummate virtuosity of his work, coincides with
the publication of a monograph on his verse by the Harvard
professor Helen Vendler, the most astute and eloquent critic of
poetry at work today.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vendler's ``Seamus Heaney'' serves as a wonderfully succinct
road map to the poet's verse, illuminating the effect that both
private and public events have had on the development of his work,
while explicating the continual evolution of his style.
</P>
<P>
   She shows us how Heaney has pushed the boundaries of the
traditional lyric poem in his efforts to articulate his changing
vision of the world, even as she helps us to understand his
masterly use of sound, symbol, imagery and parable.
</P>
<P>
   As Heaney points out in his 1995 Nobel lecture, his writing has
been ``a journey where each point of arrival'' has ``turned out to
be a stepping stone rather than a destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the early nature poems in ``Death of a Naturalist''
(1966), ``Door Into the Dark'' (1969) and ``Wintering Out'' (1972)
radiate a tactile, sensuous apprehension of rural life, an
awareness of mortality and danger intrudes in many of these
pastoral lyrics, embodied in the images of lice and rats and ``a
rat-gray fungus'' glutting a basket of berries.
</P>
<P>
   Such images give way gradually to a growing awareness of a wider
social world that reaches its culmination in ``North'' (1975), a
deservedly famous volume that Ms. Vendler regards as ``one of the
crucial poetic interventions of the 20th century,'' ranking with
Eliot's ``Prufrock,'' Wallace Stevens' ``Harmonium'' and Frost's
``North of Boston'' in ``its key role in the history of modern
poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence in Northern Ireland had escalated during the late '60s
and early '70s, and ``North'' reflected the growing mood of
desperation with its chilling images of bones and graves and a
``skull-capped ground.'' There are a few topical allusions to the
Troubles: references to a ``new camp for the internees'' and
``machine-gun posts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the volume's most powerful poems use the archaeological
image of ``bog people'' (bodies of murder and sacrificial victims,
killed during the Iron Age and preserved in European peat bogs) as
a metaphor for enduring historical violence, a symbol, as Ms.
Vendler observes, that lends the poems an imaginative scope that
transcends the journalistic.
</P>
<P>
   In later poems, the Troubles of Northern Ireland will often take
a back seat to more personal and philosophical concerns, but they
remain a lurking presence.
</P>
<P>
   In one poem in ``The Spirit Level'' (1996), they explode in a
bloody dream ``of bodies raining down like tattered meat''; and in
another, the hope of their cessation (engendered by a 1994 truce
between the IRA Provisionals and the Ulster paramilitaries) offers
a couple _ presumably Heaney and his wife, Marie _ the liberating
promise of a personal life free from the shadow of ``the tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions of political commitment also hover around Heaney's
frequent re-examinations of his own vocation. In the early poem
``Digging,'' the poet compares his pen not to the guns of political
activists, but to the spade used by his ancestors to farm their
land.
</P>
<P>
   And in the title poem from ``Station Island'' (1984), a
dazzling, Dantesque meditation in 12 parts, the poet is confronted
by a series of ghosts who force him to reassess his chosen
profession: a murdered cousin accuses him of confusing ``evasion
and artistic tact,'' of having ``whitewashed ugliness,'' while the
ghost of James Joyce urges him to remain true to his artistic
calling, to ``write for the joy of it,'' to swim out on his own and
``fill the element with signatures'' of his ``own frequency.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vendler acutely observes that the deaths of Heaney's mother
in 1984 and his father in 1986 ``caused a tear in the fabric of
Heaney's verse,'' and the poems in ``The Haw Lantern'' (1987) tend
to focus on absences, rather than presences, on virtual,
metaphorical and metaphysical questions rather than material
realities.
</P>
<P>
   To this reader, the results _ both in ``The Haw Lantern'' and
the volume that would follow it, ``Seeing Things'' (1991) _ are not
Heaney's strongest work: The poems here often feel disembodied and
abstract, ``the real thing'' melting into a vague ``republic of
conscience.'' Lines like ``High cries were felled and a pure change
happened'' lack the tactile energy of Heaney's earlier work, while
the metaphors in poems like ``The Pitchfork'' and ``The Skylight''
feel strangely predictable and trite.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps such transitional difficulties were necessary for Heaney
to move on to the poems in ``The Spirit Level'' (1996), verse that
attests to the poet's re-embrace and reimagining of ordinary life.
It is a return, in many respects, to the farm world of his earliest
nature poems, but with a notable difference: There is an elegiac
music in this verse, a sense of hard-won optimism tempered by a new
wisdom and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The poem ``Keep Going,'' Ms. Vendler observes, is a tribute to
the life of the poet's brother, Hugh, who stayed in the North to
maintain the family farm, ``remaining equable through the horrors
of the Troubles, and living in peace with his neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   It leaves us with an image of everyday life surviving the
terrors of sectarian politics and murder, and celebrates the
virtues of ``keeping going.'' It also leaves us with a renewed
appreciation of Heaney's own art, an art, in Heaney's own words,
that makes space ``for the marvelous as well as for the
murderous,'' an art that commemorates the endurance of the private
in the face of history and public grief.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a cultural icon and a partner in The Three Tenors Inc.,
Luciano Pavarotti has been doing just fine in recent years. But his
appearances in opera during this period have been another story,
even at the Metropolitan, where he has sung, to date, 359
performances in 20 roles, more than with any other company.
</P>
<P>
   So, going into the Sunday afternoon gala to celebrate the 30th
anniversary, almost to the day, of his Met debut (as Rodolfo in
``La Boheme''), the signs were not good. For some time now
Pavarotti, who is 63, has been struggling vocally and coasting,
sometimes shamelessly, on his great fame. On top of it all, this
summer he underwent a hip replacement operation, from which he is
still recuperating (the reason he gave for withdrawing from three
scheduled performances of ``Tosca'' at the Met this month).
</P>
<P>
   But this turned out to be not just an occasion for acknowledging
the renowned career of an indisputably great singer. In the
ceremony following the performance, Pavarotti said that he had
wanted in his gala to prove to himself that after 30 years he could
still sing. And that he did.
</P>
<P>
   The program showcased Pavarotti in complete acts of three operas
from the three main areas of his repertory. He sang the bel canto
role of Nemorino in Act II of Donizetti's ``Elisir d'Amore,'' the
lirico spinto role of Rodolfo in Act III of ``La Boheme'' and the
weightier heroic role of Radames in Act IV of Verdi's ``Aida.''
Understandably, his voice has faded. He started off tentatively in
the Donizetti and sang with noticeable caution throughout the
afternoon. He now has to negotiate high pianissimo phrases, which
were once his glory.
</P>
<P>
   But he sounded fully prepared and determined; he paced himself
well and never really faltered. There were moments of beautiful
singing to savor, flashes of Pavarotti in his prime, when he
combined an unsurpassable sense of language with an instinctive
understanding of style and sheer vocal charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pavarotti is still a bit shaky on his feet, he has lost
considerable weight (at least 70 pounds, a colleague of his said)
and looks fitter than he has in years. In ``L'Elisir,'' he even
took some dance spins with the soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, who sang
Adina. He may still be adjusting to the weight loss, for his voice
sometimes lacked support. But the vocal colorings remain a marvel.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues seemed palpably excited to be part of the
occasion. Ms. Swenson was in exquisite voice. The soprano Daniela
Dessi was Pavarotti's lovely Mimi in ``La Boheme.'' And one hopes
the heated lovers' quarrel that Dwayne Croft as Marcello and Ainhoa
Arteta as Musetta enacted in the final quartet was not based on
real-life experience: the couple were married last year.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Guleghina stepped in on short notice as Aida for the
indisposed Aprile Millo. In the earlier trial scene, the powerhouse
mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick smoldered through the music of Amneris,
spurring Pavarotti on to his most impassioned singing and winning
herself a frenzied ovation. James Levine, who has given Pavarotti
solid support over their years together at the Met, conducted with
his customary excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, during a ceremony onstage, Levine; the Met general
manager, Joseph Volpe; all the participants, and Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani led the tribute, while a grateful audience roundly ignored
the Met's ban on flash photography.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no 35th-anniversary gala at the Met for Pavarotti;
that seems sure. Even his close colleague Joan Sutherland has
suggested publicly that it would be wise for him to retire. Still,
if a young tenor arrived tomorrow sounding as he did Sunday, we
would all be proclaiming a great new voice on the scene.

`BLUE' FANS AWAIT ANSWER TO DETECTIVE'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
NYPD BLUE 
Starring: Jimmy Smits, Kim Delaney, Dennis Franz 
On: ABC, Tuesday at 9:30 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will beloved Detective Bobby Simone heave his last heavy breath
Tuesday night on ``NYPD Blue''? Will the cop drama be true to its
oh-so-grittily realistic aesthetic, which occasionally brings us up
close and personal with Andy Sipowicz's bare bottom, or will Bobby
emerge happy and healthy from the 90-minute episode, the lucky
recipient of a new heart? And most importantly, will Andy, Bobby's
codependent best buddy, finally end the recent jag of narcissistic
worry that has elevated him from merely annoying to hands-down TV's
most irritating character?
</P>
<P>
   I will not divulge the answer to any of these questions, except
to confirm what executive producer Steven Bochco has already said,
that Bobby is ``not going to be a cop anymore.'' And to add to
Bochco's tidbit that Jimmy Smits' last episode is one of the
series' most memorable, a marked improvement over the repetitive
crime plots and tough-talking sentimentality that have dogged it
for the last few seasons. It's a highly emotional, and yet
restrained 90 minutes, with a satisfying resolution to the grim
heart-infection story arc that has kept Smits down (and the show's
ratings up) for what has seemed like forever.
</P>
<P>
   Smits has always been a plus on ``NYPD Blue,'' particularly
since his understated acting style has compensated for Dennis
Franz's excesses. He has made Bobby into an appealingly stoic
character, one to watch for some nicely nuanced reactions. While
Andy was busy acting out his feelings all over everybody, Bobby was
more apt to internalize his conflicts. A more obvious actor than
Smits would have become tiresome as Bobby's weeks gasping in the
hospital have stretched on and on, but Smits has managed to remain
sympathetic throughout, and particularly in this episode. It's not
hard to imagine Andy's unbearable dudgeon had he been the character
in the throes of a potentially fatal illness.
</P>
<P>
   In a nice touch, the episode begins with an extended version of
the ``previously on `NYPD Blue'' clips, returning back to Smits'
debut on the show in 1994. And rather than developing a crime
investigation subplot, the episode wisely keeps its focus on the
medical themes of recent weeks, as Kim Delaney's Diane continues to
cope with a rather cold medical establishment. Delaney is quite
affecting, as she moves expertly among profound emotions that
extend well beyond concern and fear. The episode also brings back
Andy's first wife, Katie, who has become a prisoner of grief for
their late son. Andy must help her out, even though he and the
other cops at the 15th precinct are preoccupied with Bobby, who
begins the episode with a new heart in place.
</P>
<P>
   But the episode belongs to Smits, who ends the Smits era of
``NYPD Blue'' with grace and power. Certainly, he doesn't make it
any easier for Rick Schroeder, set to take over for him on next
week's show.

SMITS' FAREWELL IS TOO DRAWN OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of ``NYPD Blue'' are a patient lot who know that Jimmy
Smits has been easing his way out of the series since the Truman
administration.
</P>
<P>
   'Scuse me. I've been informed that he actually began leaving at
the start of this season, which was Oct. 20. Imagine! A mere month
that only seems like the longest goodbye since Randy Johnson's
adios from the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Steven Bochco, David Milch and the other field generals
of ``NYPD Blue'': In the interest of keeping us awake past 10 on
Tuesday nights, tune in ``Law &AMP; Order'' on Wednesdays (and now on
Fridays, it seems) to see an alternate way of dealing with
departing characters. Bada-boom, bada-bing. One episode and they're
gone. No muss, no fuss, no justifying a six-episode story arc,
which is roughly one-fourth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And could you maybe do something about those heinous ABC promos
hyping tonight's episode as the next great moment in television? I
realize you guys don't write the ad copy, but puh-leeze! Equating
it with the birth of Little Ricky, the last episode of ``MASH,''
the broadcast of ``Roots'' and the ``who shot J.R.'' episode is
more absurd than ABC's decision to pre-empt ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. The J.R. episode was absurd, so maybe that one
fits.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Tuesday night's bye-bye-Bobby show won't bring a lump
to the throat or a tear to the eye. Smits' performance is the best
thing about a bloated 90-minute episode (ABC, check local listings)
that could have been kept to 60 if ABC cared more about quality and
less about ratings. But if you miss it, don't start tossing good
china. For some reason _ probably the long buildup _ tonight's
``moment'' seems more annoying than fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Can't say much more without giving away secrets. Fans know that
Simone is battling an infection brought on by cardiomyopathy. Last
week's episode had him preparing for a heart transplant. Suffice it
to say that not a lot of police work gets done tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The only viable subplot involves the long-suffering ex-wife of
Simone's partner in criminology, Detective Andy Sipowicz (Dennis
Franz). The woman reappears in Sipowicz's life at this
fraught-with-tension juncture, and guest star Debra Monk gives
Katie Sipowicz a frantic lonelieness that almost brings the show
back to its dark, gritty-streets realism. But not quite. The
overwrought behavior of Simone's colleagues as they fret about his
struggle to regain good health may make for good drama, but it
doesn't ring especially true.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tonight's episode is well written (by Nicholas Wootton)
and generally well acted, with several characters having to
experience a range of emotions. (Most disappointing: Kim Delaney,
as Simone's wife, Detective Diane Russell.) But the whole
six-episode arc strikes me as a B or B-minus effort that got bogged
down in one character and gave us all-too-familiar subplots that
were lacking in imagination. Not bad for some shows, maybe, but not
good for a great show like ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt next week's episode, when Rick Schroder joins the cast,
will provide the ``previously on `NYPD Blue''' synopsis that will
summarize tonight's events in about 89 fewer minutes. For those not
inclined to sit through a 90-minute goodbye, it might be the smart
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Death with dignity?
</P>
<P>
   I decided not to watch ``60 Minutes'' Sunday night for the same
reason that I don't usually watch _ or write about _ programs like
``The Jerry Springer Show.'' Can you say lowest common denominator?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian certainly has the right to argue his position
on assisted suicide, and CBS had every right to show the tape of
Kevorkian giving his patient a lethal injection. But for me, dying
with dignity doesn't include having millions of people watch a
videotape of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian and CBS defend the segment as a dramatic discussion of
a controversial issue. I can defend it in two words: November
sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just surprised it wasn't on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of farewells, the final episode in the five-year run of
``Babylon 5'' airs Wednesday night on TNT. (Not to worry: A spinoff
series, ``Crusade,'' will appear next year.) . . . ``The Rosie
O'Donnell Show,'' which went from live to taped broadcasts in
September, the start of its third season, will return to a live
format in January. During yesterday's show, taped last Tuesday,
O'Donnell expressed her dissatisfaction with the lack of
spontaneity in taped shows. ``I am sick of this,'' she said of the
delayed broadcasts. ``Tuesday is Wednesday. Friday is Sunday. March
is February. Christmas is Easter.'' She said the live format will
return on Jan. 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything was perfect _ the turkey was golden, the steaming
mashed potatoes fluffy and the pumpkin pie an eye- and
stomach-satisfying masterpiece. You're stuffed, and all you want
now is a good nap.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, a sinkful of dishes and a turkey carcass are calling
your name.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rodgers, author of ``The Turkey Cookbook,'' ``50 Best
Stuffings and Dressings'' and, most recently, ``Thanksgiving 101,''
knows this moment. It is the one when he seeks help with the dishes
through the wishbone's magic. But for leftovers, wishing just won't
make it so, according to the man who travels the country teaching
home cooks how to survive Thanksgiving and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing to do is march right back in the kitchen and get
to it, Rodgers says.
</P>
<P>
   First, remove the meat that's left and freeze what won't be
going into sandwiches or salads right away. One-pound packages are
handy.
</P>
<P>
   And even if your only plan for the leftovers is a couple of
Friday sandwiches, go ahead and make a soup base. If you don't want
soup on Saturday, freeze the base for the next time turkey soup
sounds appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who recently brought his ``Thanksgiving 101'' class to
Atlanta, finds that the main ingredient at Thanksgiving, both for
the holiday feast and for the leftovers, is tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me there's no other way to eat (leftover turkey) but hot
with gravy and stuffing. It's a personal thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his routine: ``I freeze leftovers so I'll have it in
a couple of weeks to make enchiladas out of. Then I make soup on
Friday and freeze most of it. Then I have to have that sandwich on
Friday afternoon. On Friday night, I do something really light
because I'm sick of rich food, honestly, and normally do a stir-fry
like turkey broccoli.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkey breast meat tends to dry out rapidly, Rodgers
suggests cooking as quickly as possible the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``For stir-fries, just warm it through,'' he said.

   Friday Turkey Soup Base
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 cups Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 2 3/4-4
3/4 hours
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you don't want to turn the turkey carcass into a soup,
make the soup base anyway and freeze to substitute for chicken
broth in other recipes,'' says Rodgers. And if you do want soup
right away, start with this base.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium celery rib with leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 turkey carcass, chopped into large pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 parsley sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   In a large soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the
onion, carrot and celery, cover and cook, stirring occasionally,
until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the turkey carcass pieces.
Pour in enough cold water (about 3 quarts) to cover the carcass by
at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, skimming off any
foam that rises to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Add the parsley, thyme, bay leaf, salt and peppercorns. Reduce
the heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, adding more water as needed to
keep the carcass covered, until the broth is well-flavored, at
least 2 and up to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Place a colander over a large bowl or pot. Pour the soup base
through the colander and discard the solids. Let the base stand for
5 minutes, then skim any clear fat from the surface. (The soup base
can be frozen for up to 3 months. Cool completely, then store in
airtight containers.) Add enough water to make 2 quarts soup base,
or return to the pot and boil over high heat until reduced to 2
quarts.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you roasted a turkey using a salt rub or brine method,
omit salt from soup base. _ From ``Thanksgiving 101''

<P>
   5 cups Friday Turkey Soup Base (see this page)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup hearty red wine, such as Chianti or zinfandel
</P>
<P>
   4 cups bite-size pieces cooked turkey (about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   1 19-ounce can cannellini (white kidney) beans, drained and

</P>
<P>
   8 large slices crusty Italian or French bread

<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

minutes. Add the kale, cover and cook until the kale wilts, about 5
minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt and crushed red
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Add the turkey soup base and wine and bring to a boil. Reduce
the heat to medium-low and partially cover. Simmer for 30 minutes.
During the last 5 minutes, stir in the turkey and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat
to 400 degrees. Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and lightly
brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Bake until the bread is
lightly toasted around the edges, about 10 minutes. Set the toasted
bread aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Add 4 bread slices to the soup, pressing them down with a large
spoon or a ladle until completely submerged. Place the remaining
bread on the top of the soup and sprinkle with cheese. Bake until
cheese is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve in deep soup bowls,
including a piece of crusty bread topping in each serving. Pass a
cruet of olive oil for drizzling.

   Rodgers likes to use leftover dark-meat turkey in dishes such as
this one that cook for more than a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   12 corn tortillas
</P>
<P>
   1 15-ounce container sour cream
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup green tomatillo salsa, green taco sauce or
</P>
<P>
   thick-and-chunky style tomato salsa
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups bite-size pieces cooked turkey (about 12 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup thawed frozen
</P>
<P>
   corn kernels
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions (white and green parts), chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cups shredded sharp
</P>
<P>
   Cheddar cheese (8 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375
degrees. Lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a gas stove, turn a burner to medium heat. Place a
tortilla directly on the burner grid and cook, turning once, until
the tortilla is warm and softened, about 20 seconds total. Repeat
with the remaining tortillas. If you have an electric stove, heat
an empty skillet over medium heat. Place a tortilla in the skillet
and cook, turning once, until softened, about 45 seconds total.
Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Stack the warmed tortillas on
a plate as you go and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, whisk the sour cream and milk until smooth.
Spread a thin layer of the salsa in the bottom of the prepared
dish. Place 4 tortillas in the bottom of the dish, tearing them to
fit. Scatter half of the turkey over the tortillas, then top with
1/2 cup of the corn and half the green onions. Drizzle with 3/4 cup
of the cheese, 1/2 cup of the salsa and about 1/3 of the sour cream
mixture. Top with 4 more tortillas, then the remaining turkey,
corn, green onions and salsa. Drizzle with half of the remaining
sour cream mixture and sprinkle with another 3/4 cup of the cheese.
Top with the remaining 4 tortillas, spread with the remaining sour
cream mixture, and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the casserole is heated through and the cheese is
melted, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. _

OTHER COUNTRIES CATCHING UP TO U.S. IN EDUCATION, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American educational system, while perhaps less rigorous
than in the rest of the industrialized world, has long prided
itself on its access and reach, producing far more high school
graduates than elsewhere. Now a major new international study shows
that school completion rates in other industrialized countries have
surpassed those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Monday by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, a group based in Paris and comprised
of 29 of the richest countries, suggests that the changing picture
is less a matter of American backsliding than of substantial recent
progress by other nations in educating the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1990, American ``educational expectancy,'' or
the average number of years a 5-year-old will be enrolled in school
or college, was the world's highest, at 16.3. In 1996, the latest
year for which data are available, the American score was 16.8 but
11 other countries, including Canada, Spain and Finland, had
surpassed that number.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report found that the United States devoted a
smaller percentage of its national income to teacher salaries than
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In university education, the United States still remains on top,
but a similar pattern in high school graduation rates is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entry rates to college education in the U.S. are still the
highest in the OECD but that is likely to change soon,'' said
Andreas Schleicher, principal administrator at the OECD and one of
the study's authors. ``While enrollments in the United States
remained relatively stable between 1990 and 1996, they increased by
more than 25 percent in 16 OECD countries.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the United States also has one of the highest
university dropout rates in the industrialized world _ 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 432-page report, called ``Education at a Glance: OECD
Indicators 1998,'' is the fifth such study issued by the
organization since 1991, when it started examining educational
trends in member countries. Schleicher said that over the last
three years the report has been the OECD's best-selling
publication. Given the keen and growing interest in education as
the key to prosperity, he said, there was every reason to expect
the current volume to continue to sell well.
</P>
<P>
   He said member states had placed enormous emphasis on improving
access to education, bringing them in line with and surpassing
American achievements.
</P>
<P>
   The shifting balance and consequent American concerns raised by
the report are likely to fall on fertile ground here since the
quality of American education has been the focus of growing
attention and debate for 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should be quite alarmed by this,'' said Gerald
Graff, professor of English and education at the University of
Chicago, who is writing a book on what he considers the dangerous
gap between the thinking classes in America and the rest of the
society. ``We've never fully committed ourselves to the democratic
idea of education. There is a kind of silent bargain between
schools and many of its students that says, `We'll leave you alone
if you just sit there and don't bother us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the results of a mathematics and science test
of 12th graders in many countries showed the United States to be
among the least knowledgeable. Earlier tests showed the lowest 25
percent of 8th graders in Japan and South Korea to outperform the
average American student.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Education is widely viewed as having been the top concern of
voters in the elections for state and federal office held earlier
this month with candidates of both major parties vowing increased
spending on teacher training and school improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The issue first gained high profile in 1983 with publication of
an alarming report on American education entitled ``A Nation at
Risk'' which said that if a foreign power had imposed such a low
level of education on the United States, it would rightfully have
been perceived as having engaged in an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, numerous efforts have sprung up, from
alternatives to public education like charter schools and voucher
plans, to projects to improve teacher quality, widely perceived as
the system's Achilles heel. Some states are now testing student
teachers more rigorously and offering signing bonuses and plans to
forgive student loans to encourage better candidates to enter the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many states are instituting tests at various stages in
school to make sure students are not graduating without basic
skills and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The OECD report shows that Americans between the ages of 55 and
64, who graduated high school some 40 years ago, have a graduation
rate of 77 percent, the highest in the OECD. Among those aged 24 to
34, who graduated about a decade ago, the United States slipped to
eighth. Today's graduation rates, with the United States at 72
percent, place it second to last in the 29-nation group, with only
Mexico lower.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that the shift reflects higher standards for
graduation in the United States over those of other countries since
comparisons of adult literacy rates in the study show Americans to
be among the industrialized world's least literate populations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the United States' expenditure per
pupil is still among the highest in the group at all levels of
education. It particularly stands out in the way it has brought the
private sector into college and university education, leading the
way in a growing international trend, according to Schleicher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the OECD, students in both public and private colleges
are being asked to pay more for their education,'' he said.
``Unlike in the United States, however, this spending has, in many
countries, supplemented rather than displaced public spending on
education.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the United States spends a great deal on education in
absolute terms, its expenditure is about average when examined as a
percentage of gross domestic product. Moreover, teacher pay viewed
through the same lens shows the United States to be among the
lowest, with demands on teacher time in class among the highest.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced high school teacher in the United States earns
1.2 times the gross domestic product per capita. Among the 29 OECD
member states, only the Czech Republic, Hungary and Norway pay
their high school teachers less when measured as a percentage of
their GDP's. In Germany, Ireland, South Korea and Switzerland,
among others, teachers earn twice or more of the GDP per capita.
Moreover, the average teacher salary in the United States is
significantly below that of other university graduates; in many
other countries, like Australia, France and Britain, it is above
it.
</P>
<P>
   However, the amount of time a typical middle school teacher in
the United States spends in front of a classroom per year is 964
hours, among the highest in the OECD, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report adds that Americans can not comfort themselves by
thinking that theirs is a society of social mobility and second
chances. It finds that children whose parents completed college are
more than three times as likely to become college graduates
themselves than children whose parents did not complete high
school. Moreover, the achievement gap between the children of the
well-off, well-educated and those without such family backgrounds
is above the average for the OECD.

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   He has come close to politically and legally torpedoing the
president. And he has done it all from long distance, declining to
dirty his own hands in his own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's absentee performance reminds me of a poem by an early
20th century author, Hughes Mearns, about the little man who wasn't
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. He
wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's droning, scripted testimony on Capitol Hill accusing
President Clinton of impeachable offenses did not change any minds,
galvanize the House to recommend the ultimate presidential
punishment or reverse Starr's own low standing with the public. But
he painstakingly rubbed salt in Clinton's self-inflicted wounds and
cheered many Republicans, the wobblies as well as the Clinton
haters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats picked on Starr for his own prosecutorial excesses
but gave him a pass on his dubious interpretations of the
constitutional impact of Clinton's behavior. The bottom line is the
president lied about sex, we all know it and nobody wants to defend
it. The rest is political padding.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing is that Starr was advocating other people's
work, not his own. He sometimes seemed as disingenuous as Clinton
when asked embarrassing questions. His memory was often faulty,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Starr heatedly denied Democratic charges of excessive zeal among
his agents and gross prosecutorial abuse, including the harassment
of witnesses. ``It was our duty to be meticulous, to be careful. We
were,'' Starr insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But how could he possibly know?
</P>
<P>
   Starr was never there.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross examination by the president's lawyer David Kendall,
Starr revealed himself as an absentee prosecutor. The White House
has long been aware of this oddity, but the general public has not.
</P>
<P>
   Other prosecutors were shocked at the extent of his remoteness.
``It is very unusual for a lead prosecutor to leave the first-hand
gathering of evidence to his staff,'' a veteran criminal lawyer and
former prosecutor said. ``And I emphasize the `very.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another former prosecutor agreed. ``Eyeballing matters,'' he
said. ``Most prosecutors would not leave the on-the-spot assessment
of the credibility of key witnesses to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been relying all this time on what amounts to hearsay.
What he knows about the conduct of his own investigation and the
credibility of various witnesses comes entirely from what he has
been told or what he has read from written transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall forced Starr to admit that he was not present for any of
the 19 witness depositions or the 134 FBI interviews submitted with
the impeachment referral. Nor was Starr present for any of the 115
grand jury appearances by witnesses whose transcripts were sent to
the House Judiciary Committee, with the exception of the
interrogation of Clinton in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Starr did not ask a question during the grilling of the
president but sat silently in the room. Throughout his four-year,
$40 million investigation, he has not personally asked a single
question of a single witness. Nor did he go to the Justice
Department for that crucial discussion of whether Attorney General
Janet Reno should assign the rapidly-developing Lewinsky case to
his office. He sent deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was not present when his agents initially cornered Monica
Lewinsky at a hotel and tried to persuade her to wear a wire to
tape the president. Nor was he present for her grand jury testimony
or any subsequent FBI interview. In fact, Starr has never met or
talked with Lewinsky, his primary legal focus the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not had occasion to meet or otherwise to look her in
the eye myself,'' Starr conceded.
</P>
<P>
   He was not present for the questioning of the major figures
crucial to his charges of perjury and witness-tampering against the
president, including presidential secretary Betty Currie, Clinton
pal Vernon Jordan and White House Deputy Chief of Staff John
Podesta. He is unaware of the nuances, inflections and other clues
to their credibility except as described to him by others.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous life, Starr was an appellate judge. He has never
been a prosecutor, an activist, advocacy role in sharp contrast to
the quiet paper-shuffling that characterizes the bench. This may
explain some of his incredible responses to criticism of his
office's strong-arm tactics.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to pass off his tactics, such as rummaging through
Lewinsky's reading list, as simply standard operating procedure.
After all, the theory went, Lewinsky was ``a felon'' no different
from a mass murderer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Starr doesn't know what he is talking about. No wonder
he had to rehearse his lines repeatedly before his congressional
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   His name is on the report, and its accuracy and fairness are his
responsibility. He continually used the collegial ``we'' in
discussing the activities of his office. But he is a showhorse, not
a workhorse.
</P>
<P>
   So what was Starr doing when he wasn't paying attention to the
multiple Clinton probes? Probably tending to his private law
practice, which he could legally do. He made $1.2 million last year
as a partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in Chicago, in part representing
clients like the tobacco industry that seek to undo or block
Clinton administration policies.

 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was during the ``Ugg-a-Wugg'' Indian number that
the little girl in the rainbow-colored cardigan turned and flashed
me the A-OK sign. I might have been quick to suspect her as an
audience plant by the ``Peter Pan'' public relations people. Except
that she was my own daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie and her school chum and theater buddy, Elizabeth, were my
companions for a clear-eyed critical assessment of the latest
incarnation of this melodious 1954 bedtime story, which opened
Monday night at the Marquis Theater, with the former Olympic
gymnast Cathy Rigby, in a reprise of her 1990 Broadway appearance,
in the title role. It's no exaggeration to say that the show won a
ringing endorsement from my pink-ribbon panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Their contentment was unequivocal _ in a theater, 6-year-olds
tend to be enthralled or asleep _ although overall, Lizzie and
Elizabeth liked the talkier scenes and the mushier songs the least.
In descending order, their favorite moments of the production came
when: 1) Peter flew; 2) Wendy flew; 3) Michael and John flew; 4)
Tinker Bell was saved by their clapping, and 5) the crocodile ate
Captain Hook. Their one real regret: Nana, the Darling family sheep
dog, never became airborne.
</P>
<P>
   My pleasure was observing their pleasure. For a parent, there
are few experiences more exhilarating. And, of course, it took me
back 100 years or so, to the first time I saw ``Peter Pan'' _ it
was that grainy television version, starring Mary Martin _ and how
wowed I was not by a boy who could fly but by one who had to have
his shadow sewn back on. This is not to imply that this new
road-show production, presented by, among others, Ms. Rigby's own
entertainment company, offers only vicarious enjoyment for adults:
Paul Schoeffler, for instance, is in excellent voice as the
dastardly Hook; Dana Solimando's Tiger Lily is agile and athletic,
and Ms. Rigby's aerial exhibition is as taut as the Blue Angels'
sky-high figure-eights.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite a few cruder aspects, like the
overamplification that gives some scenes and songs the dead-air
sound of a stadium public-address system and a scruffy scenic
design that looks as if it were cannibalized from old Disneyland
rides, this ``Peter Pan'' is more than passing fair, and better
still if you have the privilege of seeing it through children's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the company of little theatergoers will undoubtedly put you
in a more forgiving mood. But thanks to the dandy score by Carolyn
Leigh and Moose Charlap (with assists from Jule Styne, Betty Comden
and Adolph Green), as well as the efficient staging by Glenn Casale
and muscular choreography by Patti Colombo (a remodeling of Jerome
Robbins' original work), this seemingly indestructible show is a
far more enjoyable, child-friendly holiday spectacle than, say,
Madison Square Garden's grandiose ``Christmas Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be plain by now that those seeking an elegant
entertainment after dinner at Le Cirque 2000 should find another
box office. This ``Peter Pan'' ideally follows pizza at John's or
precedes a birthday party at Serendipity. Hordes of parents and
grandparents apparently had something like this in mind on Saturday
afternoon, when the Marquis was the place to be seen for the
Playskool set. (Memo to the concessions department: Three words _
Nana Beanie Babies.) Throughout the 2 hour 40 minute show, the
wails of toddlers in the intermittent throes of agony or ecstasy
competed with the warbling actors. A silent minority the tiny
ticketholders were not.
</P>
<P>
   They were struck dumb, however, any time the convincingly
tomboyish Ms. Rigby _ looking in her blond mop like a cross between
David Cassidy and Rick Schroeder _ was lifted by cable and
dive-bombed as if she were a one-woman fighter squadron. These are
the best moments that the production has to offer. That's because
the ageless Ms. Rigby remains more stuntwoman than star, and only
truly captivating in midair. Back on terra firma, her voice is
strong and pleasing, if a little ragged on the high notes, and oh
dear, I could swear her crowing in ``I Gotta Crow'' was
pre-recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The acting skills are perky but only passable. Effecting a
generic British accent, she lacks the ebullient presence of
predecessors in the role like Martin and Sandy Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance pays off when it counts. Her most successful
number is the goosebump-raiser ``I'm Flying,'' which is also her
most physical. Any time this ``Peter Pan'' exerts itself, it makes
a strong case. The second-tier song, ``Ugg-a-Wugg,'' is transformed
here by Ms. Colombo into a first-rate show-stopper, with Indians
and Lost Boys forming a ``Stomp''-style percussion section. Keeping
things kinetic and comfortable for children is the goal of the
production, which like the original offers two intermissions, one
only 45 minutes into the show. It also excises, for the benefit of
younger viewers, a plot-slowing Neverland number sung by Hook and a
Peter disguised as a mysterious lady.
</P>
<P>
   As with Ms. Rigby, the other performers are paler shadows of the
indelible originals, at least as captured on the video of the
television version. But in virtually all cases, this is not a
significant distraction. Schoeffler does his best Cyril Ritchard
impression as both Darling and Hook, and his singing voice is
vastly better than Ritchard's, as made wonderfully clear in
``Hook's Waltz.'' The Darling children, played by Elisa Sagardia,
Chase Kniffen and Drake English, are endearing; the 7-year-old
English, in particular, has the gift of unaffected adorableness.
The Lost Boys, on the other hand, are pretty much a lost cause.
They are way too old for boys and one in particular looks as if
he's in need of a shave.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie and Elizabeth, sated by the acrobatics and bagsful of
gummy worms, were not bothered by such trifles. Their perspective
on the proceedings was defiantly macro, and they made me happy to
share their enchantment. Even better, they left the theater
desperate to know when they might see a show again. I'll wager they
would be appalled by any nit-picking. And as both of them are
learning to read, I'm sure I'll hear about it sooner rather than
later.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY PROBES POSSIBLE OBSTRUCTION IN WILLEY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry
went behind closed doors Monday, with panel investigators asking
Kathleen Willey's former lawyer, Daniel Gecker, about alleged
efforts to keep Willey silent on her claim that President Clinton
made unwelcome sexual advances during a 1993 Oval Office encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic staff members questioned Gecker for
three-and-a-half hours. News media representatives were not allowed
to attend the questioning of Gecker, who practices law in Richmond
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans are attempting to find out whether Clinton
lawyer Robert Bennett or anyone in the White House called Gecker in
an effort to prevent Willey _ a one-time White House volunteer _
from testifying about her meeting with the president on Nov. 29,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Willey has said she met with Clinton that day to plead for a
full-time White House position at a time when her husband was
accused of embezzlement and she was in desperate financial shape.
According to Willey, Clinton responded by making a pass at her,
fondling her breast and putting her hand on his genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Willey, in an interview with ``60 Minutes'' on CBS in March,
said she pushed Clinton away and told him ``I think I'd better
go.'' Clinton denied Willey's account in his Aug. 17 grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dismissed the Gecker deposition as a last-ditch GOP
effort to revive impeachment in the face of evidence that
Republicans may lack the votes to impeach Clinton on the House
floor next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost painful to watch committee Republicans spastically
flailing about, looking to put a sheen of seriousness and
respectability on this whole dubious enterprise,'' said Jim Jordan,
spokesman for the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Willey episode is a crucial link in the evolution of the
Monica Lewinsky matter that forms the basis of the committee's
impeachment inquiry. A 1997 Newsweek magazine story quoted Linda
Tripp, a 1993 White House employee, as saying she saw Willey after
the alleged encounter with Clinton, with her hair and clothing in
disarray. She seemed to be excited and pleased, according to Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett later expressed doubts about Tripp's credibility, a fact
that Tripp cited as a reason why she started taping her telephone
conversations with Lewinsky about Lewinsky's sexual relationship
with Clinton. In January, Tripp turned the tapes over to
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, setting in motion what
ultimately turned into the House panel's impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Starr turned over Willey-related evidence to the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see Willey as an example of what they characterize
as a White House habit of trying to prevent testimony damaging to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Along that line, committee investigators plan next week to
question Nathan Landow, a Maryland developer and wealthy Democratic
contributor. Willey knew Landow through his daughter, Harolyn
Cardozo, who worked as a volunteer at the White House with Willey.
Willey has said that Landow pressured her to conceal her encounter
with Clinton, a charge Landow denies.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress argues that Clinton tried to
shape the testimony of Lewinsky in the civil sexual harassment suit
that Paula Jones brought against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Clinton himself informed Lewinsky she would be
called as a witness in the Jones case. At that time, Clinton's
close friend and confidant Vernon Jordan was seeking a job for
Lewinsky in New York, at the request of Betty Currie, Clinton's
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky ultimately signed a false affidavit denying a
relationship with Clinton, leading Republicans to pursue the theory
that the job search was a payoff to buy Lewinsky's silence.
</P>
<P>
   Willey, whose testimony also was sought by Jones' lawyers
seeking to show a pattern of sexual harassment, has said that in
the months leading up to her testimony in the Jones case last
January, her cat disappeared and her car tires were punctured with
nails.
</P>
<P>
   Two days prior to her appearance, Willey said, a menacing
stranger approached her outside her home and inquired about the cat
and the tires, and asked about her children by name.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also have issued subpoenas to Bennett and White
House deputy counsel and close Clinton friend Bruce Lindsey. No
dates have been set for those depositions.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will extend from the Ohio Valley to the Northeastern
and Middle Atlantic States on Tuesday in the wake of a cold front
that will move off the East coast early Tuesday morning. However,
temperatures will still average near to slightly above normal in
most places. Scattered snow showers will affect the mountains of
northern New England, but it will be mainly dry and tranquil
elsewhere as high pressure takes control.
</P>
<P>
   A moist disturbance will drift across northern Florida with
batches of showers and some thunderstorms over the peninsula.
Meanwhile, residual moisture will cause clouds, patchy showers and
spotty drizzle to linger near the Southeast coast. Light winds will
cover the interior Southeast from Georgia to eastern Texas where
areas of low clouds and fog will be slow to break.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure starved for moisture will produce spotty rain
showers over the far northern Plains. Otherwise it will be quite
mild in the Plains, with afternoon highs 10 to 15 degrees above
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Moist winds from the Pacific will blow across the Northwest and
northern Rockies on Tuesday, but only patchy showers are expected
through Tuesday afternoon. Snow will accumulate a few more inches
in the mountains. However, another surge of heavy rain and very
strong winds will reach the coast on Tuesday night, as the latest
in a series of potent storm systems arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sinking air currents will lead to ample sunshine and
pleasant temperatures from southern California to parts of western
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Squall Line
</P>
<P>
   A line of squally thunderstorms charged across the Oregon coast
early Monday. Such a formidable ``squall line'' is unusual in the
Pacific Northwest. Typically, tempestuous lines of thunderstorms
precede strong cold fronts in the eastern states as very warm and
humid air near the surface is rapidly lifted by upper-level
disturbances. In the Pacific Northwest, the combination of very
warm and humid air rarely occurs, owing to the influence of cool
Pacific waters. On Monday, lifting by a powerful upper-level
disturbance overcame the lack of humid warmth, igniting a line of
fierce storms.

A STRAIN ON THE BRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, Nov. 25)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, it may not appear that soccer players and
newspaper columnists have much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer players are well-conditioned athletes who can run around
for hours without getting tired, whereas newspaper columnists tend
to be avocado-shaped slugs who get winded swiping spare change from
the coffee fund.
</P>
<P>
   However, I read something in the paper the other day that made
me think that soccer players and newspaper columnists may have more
in common than I realized.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the American Academy of Neurology reveals that pro
soccer players suffer from impaired memory, planning and
recognition skills as a result of ``heading'' the ball and slamming
into other players.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in mental abilities is much the same as that
suffered by newspaper columnists after years of banging their heads
against the wall and being slammed by readers and editors.
</P>
<P>
   According to my research, columnists lose 10 percent of their
mental acuity for every year they practice their craft. Since I
have been doing this for 12 or 14 years (I can't remember which),
that means that my mental abilities are on par with those of a
soccer ball, and not a very well-inflated one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, neither soccer players nor newspaper columnists
need to be the sharpest tools in the shed in order to do their
jobs. Indeed, one might argue that limited brain power is a job
requirement for both occupations.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask 100 children what they want to be when they grow up,
you will get a variety of responses. Some will want to be baseball
players; some rock stars; some nameless, faceless drones in a
bloated, unnecessary federal bureaucracy ....
</P>
<P>
   But few, if any, I venture, will say that they want to make a
living by using their foreheads to deflect a heavy, leather ball
whistling at them at 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, for that matter, will you find many kids pining for a job
where you sit for long, lonely years in a cramped, dusty cubicle
downwind of the newsroom refrigerator trying to come up with new
ways to make fun of Canadian tourists.
</P>
<P>
   While it is easy to understand how heading a soccer ball might
knock a few screws loose, the gradual mental deterioration of a
newspaper columnist occurs for less obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls and letters certainly play an important role.
Shortly after I came to work this morning, I received a phone call
from a self-described ``sex therapist'' who suggested I write a
column promoting the employment of vestal virgins in the White
House. Centuries ago, according to the caller, kings, generals and
any other male authority figures who thought they could get away
with it deflowered vestal virgins on a regular basis as a way of
gaining strength, improving their stamina and possibly getting
drafted by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   If, the caller went on, we consider Monica Lewinsky a vestal
virgin (are you seeing the reasons for the mental deterioration
now?), then perhaps we should look at Clinton's Oval Office
rendezvous as an act of patriotism rather than simply the goat-like
ruttings of a grown man suffering from a bad case of arrested
development.
</P>
<P>
   Before that had time to sink in, I opened a letter from
AllHerb.com, a ``comprehensive online wellness destination,''
advertising a new line of natural herbal aphrodisiacs aimed
specifically at Republicans so that they can reclaim a little of
that ``devil-may-care'' attitude that has worked so well for
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer players don't know how lucky they are.
</P>

 &HT;    A DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE WHITE HOUSE
 &HT;    For release Thursday, Nov. 26.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day in the life of the White House begins an hour
before midnight when Susanna McGuire rubs her coded photo ID across
the electronic scanner at a wrought-iron gate, punches in a
personal number, then enters under the gaze of a uniformed Secret
Service agent.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious young press aide who will spend the night clipping
papers for President Clinton's morning news summary, McGuire is one
of hundreds of human cogs who make the White House a perpetual
motion machine _ running day after day, decade after decade,
president after president.
</P>
<P>
   Unique in the world, the building where the president lives and
works is among the most recognizable symbols of American democracy.
It is a home and a museum, a fortress and a bureaucracy, a
playground and a monument and a backdrop for TV newscasts. It is a
place permeated with the temptations of power, of course, but also
blessed with the virtues of community and continuity.
</P>
<P>
   During the depths of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, White House
correspondents sometimes described a paralysis in the building
looming dramatically behind them. Images of inactivity could not
have been more misleading, however, in portraying the legions of
employees who every day continued to shepherd through 6,000
tourists, open 10,000 letters, answer 1,600 phone calls, entertain
foreign dignitaries, cook meals, plan parties, prune shrubbery and
oversee operation of the federal government _ accomplishing the
mundane as well as the miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   Until he recently fell ill, for instance, 78-year-old John
Muffler continued to wind the 85 or so clocks in the White House
every Friday _ a routine he had followed for half a century. Now
semi-retired, the courtly electrician's tasks have ranged from
changing light bulbs for Harry Truman to programming a VCR for
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Head florist Nancy Clarke continues to keep fresh flowers in
practically every room _ ever mindful not to aggravate President's
Clinton's allergies with pollen and not to provide tourists with
tales of bugs crawling out of blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing a staff of four full-time designers in the basement
flower shop below the North Portico, Clarke has accommodated floral
tastes of first ladies since Nancy Reagan hired her in 1981.
Regardless of the time of year, for example, Mrs. Reagan wanted
peonies in arrangements. When the Reagans left, Clarke made a
needlepoint pillow for the departing first lady _ decorated with a
bright peony and the inscription ``Peonies Bloom in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Muffler and Clarke are among 1,500 people employed in the
Executive Office of the President _ posts that range from seven
speech writers to four physicians. About 400 work in the White
House, including about 90 on the executive residence staff.
</P>
<P>
   The full-time force is augmented by 1,010 volunteers who work at
least 16 hours a month _ mostly in the correspondence office. The
Clinton administration says these volunteers save taxpayers about
$1.2 million in wages per year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, about $8.5 million is budgeted for care, heating and
lighting of the historic residence and for official entertainment
expenses of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential mansion, with its familiar columns and
porticos, was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-born architect
selected by George Washington. The cornerstone was laid on Oct. 13,
1792. Eight years later, John Adams moved in to became the first
president to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Built of Virginia sandstone, the central mansion has six floors,
including a basement and sub-basement, about 67,200 square feet of
floor space, 132 rooms including 34 bathrooms, three mezzanines,
147 windows, 412 doors, 12 chimneys, three elevators, two
dumbwaiters and seven staircases. Teddy Roosevelt dubbed this
building the ``White House'' in 1901. Before that, it was known as
the ``President's House'' and the ``Executive Mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   The first President Roosevelt also added the West Wing and its
famed Oval Office in 1909 to handle the increasing need for
presidential staff offices. The mansion and West Wing are connected
by the press area, built over what was a swimming pool from 1933 to
1969. The president walks from home to office through an open-sided
colonnade between the Rose Garden and windowless press rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Franklin Delano Roosevelt added the East Wing where the
first lady has her office. The Old Executive Office Building, a
massive gray structure that once housed all Cabinet offices next
door, is now part of the White House complex enclosed by a
protective and decorative wrought iron fence. Also inside the fence
are 19 acres of lawns, gardens and trees that make up the White
House grounds.
</P>
<P>
   It is a setting where there are no typical days.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m., chief of staff John Podesta convenes the daily
meeting of senior presidential staffers in the Roosevelt Room of
the West Wing. The photocopied news summary begun by Susanna
McGuire already has been distributed to their desks. All are
stapled except the one bound for the Oval Office. A senior adviser
shuffles that summary to prioritize presidential reading.
</P>
<P>
   Small tables are fit together in the middle of the room to make
a large conference center. Top presidential advisers on domestic,
foreign and political issues fill the leather chairs around the
tables and the overstuffed armchairs and sofas along the walls. The
Roosevelt Room's namesake presidents look down from portraits _
Teddy on horseback and FDR signing legislation at a desk. The Nobel
Peace Prize won by Theodore Roosevelt sits on a mantelpiece over a
fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   A 49-year-old fitness buff who likes to jog shirtless, Podesta
is regarded as an unpretentious boss _ known for cooking elaborate
Italian meals and a passion for riding roller coasters. However,
the chief of staff can be demanding and has a dark side nicknamed
``Skippy'' by underlings. Nobody wants to provoke ``Skippy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the workaholic West Wing, where days routinely stretch from 7
a.m. to 9 p.m. or later, Podesta sets the standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we say here every Friday, only two more working days till
Monday,'' he has observed. Indeed, before the 8 a.m. session,
Podesta already has completed a smaller meeting in his nearby
office.
</P>
<P>
   The day's agenda is set at the senior staff meeting, which
usually lasts less than an hour. Afterward, attendees scatter to
preside over daily meetings of their various departments. Press
Secretary Joe Lockhart, for instance, holds a communications staff
meeting at 8:45 or so.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the president is usually in the Oval Office. Awakened
by a call from a steward, Clinton has breakfast _ often coffee and
fruit _ in an upstairs family kitchen decorated with cheerful
fruit-patterned wallpaper. The Clintons converted a butler's pantry
into this ``ordinary'' room shortly after they arrived in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Most mornings, a national security briefing is an early order of
presidential business. The data comes from the top-secret,
high-tech Situation Room located on the floor below the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The West Wing has three levels, with staffers' offices on floors
both above and below with the Oval Office. The Situation Room is
staffed 24 hours a day by experts monitoring trouble spots around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, 52, is in
charge of the security briefing. A longtime friend, he met Clinton
when both worked on George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing takes place beneath the embossed presidential seal
on the white ceiling of the Oval Office. Behind Clinton's desk, a
table displays pictures of his wife and his daughter, Chelsea, and
his collection of political campaign buttons. On his desk are busts
of FDR and Harry Truman. On the floor nearby are an African drum
and a drum made by Native Americans to commemorate the North
American Free Trade Agreement _ showing the shared American Indian
heritage of Mexico, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A rocking chair sits in the adjoining private study. The
president's computer is there, too, connected to the Internet _
though aides won't say whether Clinton ever surfs through
cyberspace. There is no TV.
</P>
<P>
   From her adjoining office, Nancy Hernreich helps keep Clinton on
schedule. As director of Oval Office operations, Hernreich, 52, is
one of the ``meanies'' whom Monica Lewinsky complained was trying
to keep her away from the president. A longtime loyalist, she was
Clinton's scheduler in the Arkansas governor's office. Divorced and
a diligent runner, Hernreich dotes on her daughter, Ashley, a
student at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Hernreich is the gatekeeper _ regulating who gets in to see the
president and, to some extent, when they leave. However, it is up
to the president to decide when a meeting ends.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Caplan, assistant to the president and staff secretary,
manages the flow of presidential paperwork _ moving color-coded
binders on and off Clinton's desk. Green for action. Pink for
correspondence. Blue for information. Red for classified.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, White House kitchens are bustling. The holiday
season is approaching, and 120,000 cookies and pieces of cake will
be baked for a panoply of parties.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Walter Scheib, an imposing figure nearly 7 feet tall from
the top of his traditional toque to the toes of his shined shoes,
is responsible for all meals served in the White House. A graduate
of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., Scheib was
chef at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia when hired by
Hillary Clinton in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was looking for an American cuisine chef with a
light touch, and Scheib has worked hard at reducing the fat in the
White House fare without sacrificing flavor, texture or appearance.
Cooking oil is kept in spray bottles, for instance, and misted onto
pans rather than being poured or brushed.
</P>
<P>
   Now 43, Scheib grew up in the nearby suburb of Bethesda, Md.,
and remembers watching his mother cook the dishes Julia Child
demonstrated on TV. His wife, Jean, also is a chef, and the two
cooked together at the Boca Raton Resort and Club in Florida before
moving on to the Greenbrier.
</P>
<P>
   The first family pays for its own food _ which Scheib orders
from nearby wholesalers and from suppliers all around the nation.
He searches for the best ingredients _ buffalo milk mozzarella from
upstate New York, Michigan blueberries, Virginia ham _ and the
nation's food merchants eagerly solicit his business.
</P>
<P>
   Food bound for the White House is detoured to another facility
where it is checked by the Secret Service before being sent in
secure trucks to Scheib's pantries, refrigerators and freezers.
Scheib's staff includes two assistant chefs, a kitchen steward and
two assistant stewards. For state dinners and other major events,
this culinary force is augmented by chefs from local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking separately in a tiny kitchen jammed between the state
floor and the family quarters is pastry chef Roland Mesnier and his
longtime assistant, Franette McCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   Mesnier was born in a French village in 1944 on the very day
American soldiers liberated the community from Nazi occupation. At
the age of 14, he left school and began an apprenticeship at a
village bakery. He created pastries in kitchens in Paris, London
and Bermuda and was cooking at the Greenbrier in 1980 when Rosalynn
Carter hired him for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mesnier's themed desserts have become the sweet stuff of legend.
At a luncheon for Egyptian officials, he created a pistachio mousse
pyramid flanked by two edible palm trees and a marzipan camel. One
Christmas, he made gingerbread and chocolate reproductions of the
president's boyhood home in Hot Springs, Ark., and the suburban
house where Hillary Rodham grew up in Park Ridge, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   For Chelsea Clinton's 16th birthday, Mesnier decorated her cake
with a replica of her new driver's license, complete with color
photo, and a car with a license tag reading ``Sweet 16.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, after 18 years, it's hard to come up with ideas,''
said Mesnier. ``Two days before the birthday I was driving to work
listening to the radio and the announcer said, 'Chelsea will soon
be getting her driver's license.' Then, Boom! It hit me. Chocolate
car and license.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, the last of this day's 6,000 or so tourists
_ more than a million visit the White House each year _ stops for a
final photo of the North Portico before leaving the compound and
stepping onto the sidewalk along Pennsylvania Avenue. The mansion's
ground floor and second story are part museum, open to visitors
from 10 a.m. to noon Tuesdays through Saturdays. The busiest times
are the summer months and December; the slowest are January and
February.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists enter on the east side and proceed through the library,
the Vermeil Room with its portraits of recent first ladies, the
China Room, the East Room where presidential press conferences are
held, the Green Room, the Blue Roomwhere the White House Christmas
tree will be placed, the Red Room and the State Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Bates, 52, director of the Office of Tourism, is a
longtime friend of President Clinton. She took him to his first
Judy Collins concert in 1964. When Collins visited the White House
three decades later, Clinton returned the favor by introducing the
singer to Bates.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is a treasure trove of antiques, art and
oddities. Original Norman Rockwell drawings adorn the walls of an
out-of-the-way West Wing waiting area, for instance. In another
reception area, a handsome clock made of wood, inside and out,
keeps visitors aware of the time. Historic portraits are
everywhere. A photo on an end table shows Calvin Coolidge with the
original Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Betty Monkman, who has worked at the White House for
three decades, is responsible for displaying and maintaining the
artifacts, furnishings and art.
</P>
<P>
   A job whose title belies its importance is the social secretary
_ responsible for every event inside the White House and on the
grounds. From state dinners to the annual Easter Egg Roll, Social
Secretary Capricia Marshall juggles VIPs and RSVPs and a myriad of
details of protocol and logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Three to 10 events take place every week at the White House.
More than 60,000 people are entertained annually at official
functions.
</P>
<P>
   A Cleveland native and law school graduate, Marshall joined the
Clinton presidential campaign in Ohio in 1991 and came to the White
House as a special assistant to the first lady after Clinton's
initial election. In 1997, at 33, she was appointed social
secretary. Marshall made an immediate impact in her new post by
posing in Vogue magazine wearing a backless Donna Karan gown.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   It's midafternoon, and President Clinton is standing in a sunny
Rose Garden promoting his proposals for health-care reform. Irv
Williams is concerned about reporters stomping on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   For more than four decades, chief horticulturist Williams has
tended the 19 acres of trees, grass and shrubbery that compose the
White House grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The groundskeepers work for the National Park Service. Williams
helped Jacqueline Kennedy redesign the First Lady's Garden, next to
the formal Rose Garden where speeches are staged and treaties
signed.
</P>
<P>
   Every first lady leaves her own special bloom in the garden _ a
peach-colored rose for Rosalynn Carter, a yellow rose for Betty
Ford, red for Nancy Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Every president plants a tree on the grounds before leaving. The
oldest surviving presidential trees are three magnolias given root
by Andrew Jackson. Clinton has planted several trees, including an
American elm, a willow oak and a linden.
</P>
<P>
   The gently rolling South Lawn, brightened by flower beds and
partly shielded by trees, is the first family's back yard.
</P>
<P>
   In the southwest corner are a tennis court and an outdoor pool.
A short chip shot from the Oval Office is a putting green laid out
by President Eisenhower in 1954. It was removed in 1971 by the
non-golfing Richard Nixon, who built a bowling alley in the White
House basement. The green was reinstalled in 1995 by Clinton, who
also added a padded jogging track around the South Lawn driveway
and subtracted the horseshoe pits dug by George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While the president is speaking in the sunshine, Dan Burkhardt
is managing messages deep inside the Old Executive Office Building
_ a massive, foreboding gray building across West Executive Avenue
from the West Wing. The prime parking spaces for key staffers are
located between the ``OEOB'' and the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   A political appointee from California, Burkhardt is director of
correspondence and presidential messages. The White House receives
about 10,000 letters a day at the 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. mailing
address.
</P>
<P>
   These are sorted by subject and assigned to volunteers for
replies. On any given weekday, 100 to 250 volunteers are handling
mail. The replies are checked by one of Burkhardt's 70 full-time
staffers _ who oversee everything from the processing of
presidential gifts to responding to the 2,000 or so e-mails the
president receives every day to handling incoming calls on 20 phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the OEOB operation, an auxiliary White House mail
room is located at the U.S. Soldiers and Airmen's Home near Capitol
Hill where military retirees process letters addressed to
presidential pets _ currently Socks the cat and Buddy the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Many offices in the Old EOB are spacious, with high ceilings and
working fireplaces. They are not as eagerly sought as the cramped
quarters in the West Wing, however, for proximity to the president
is prized above all other perquisites in the White House complex.
</P>
<P>
   Aide Sidney Blumenthal's office, for instance, is a converted
barbershop _ but still coveted by many because it is downstairs
from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Old EOB houses the staffs of many top advisers whose own
offices are in the West Wing. It also has a bank, a post office, a
cafeteria and a medical unit for staffers. In the main White House
is another medical unit for the first family. And on the bottom
floor of the West Wing, senior staffers can dine in or carry out
from the White House Mess, which is operated by Navy cooks.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Around 7 p.m., President Clinton walks down the colonnade,
headed to the top two floors of the White House that are the home
of the first family.
</P>
<P>
   He has likened this lifestyle to the way average Americans lived
in bygone decades _ residing above their stores or on their family
farms, with their jobs and homes practically melded. Here, though,
White House staffers zealously guard the upstairs private lives of
presidential families.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Walters, an aggressively discreet former Secret Service
agent with the unimposing title of chief usher, is the supervisor
of all who serve the first family in their home. With a staff of
about 90 to direct and the ultimate responsibility for everything
from state dinners to overflowing toilets, Walters has filled this
historically powerful post since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Eight chief ushers have served in the nearly 200-year history of
the White House. The improbably named Ike Hoover served the longest
_ 42 years beginning in 1891 _ and managed the care and comfort of
10 presidents and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are movie fans and regularly invite friends over
for films in the 51-seat movie theater off the East Wing portico.
Facing the screen are rows of four to six beige overstuffed
armchairs _ the rows rising on tiers toward the rear of the room.
When the Clintons show movies, tables stocked with popcorn, soft
drinks and other snacks are set up outside the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Many nights, though, Clinton takes memos upstairs to read late
into the night, aides say, working even as Susanna McGuire arrives
to start another day in the life of the White House.

CONSUMER DEMAND FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS UP _ AND SO IS THE COST,
FOR PATIENTS AND INSURERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARY SIT-DuVALL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When University of Houston Professor Viswanathan Kumar
recently tried to get a prescription filled for the popular allergy
medicine Claritin-D, he was in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacist told him his insurance plan no longer covered the
drug. So he offered him a cheaper alternative _ Claritin that
contained only an antihistamine.
</P>
<P>
   He could buy the decongestant part of Claritin-D in an
over-the-counter medication, the pharmacist said.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, neither the surprise nor the suggestions sat
well with Kumar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very upset. I'm paying a higher premium, and I'm
supposed to get all these prescription drugs covered,'' Kumar said.
``They said, `It's our policy. Take it or leave it.' They didn't
exhibit much concern.''
</P>
<P>
   For the thousands of people who receive their prescription drugs
through a health maintenance organization, scenes like this are
likely to become more common.
</P>
<P>
   As the cost of prescription drugs for health plans rises 12 to
15 percent each year, HMOs are looking for ways to keep a lid on
the overall costs of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   As Kumar discovered, delisting some drugs from coverage is one
way. Raising insurance premiums is another.
</P>
<P>
   This year, U.S. prescription drug sales are expected to exceed
$90 billion, up from $81.2 billion the year before, according to
IMS Health, a health care information company in Plymouth Meeting,
Pa. In the first six months of this year, sales surpassed those in
the same period last year by 17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Drug expenditures have become the fastest growing segment of
total health care costs for many reasons: newer, better drugs are
sliding through the approval pipeline at a faster rate than ever
before; demand for drugs is increasing, fueled partly by
advertisements aimed directly at consumers; and an aging population
with growing medical needs is clamoring for feel good/look good
drugs such as Viagra and Rogaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``New drugs are coming into the marketplace, replacing older
drugs, and these new drugs have a higher cost,'' said Nick
Vasilopoulos, principal and managed pharmacy practice leader at
William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm. ``It's a
problem. As a benefits manager or as a pharmacy director of an HMO,
to have a portion of costs increasing in double-digit increases per
year is alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   These increases are in part the price of innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not really paying for one drug but all the research and
drugs it took to get this particular drug to market,'' said Philip
Gerbino, president of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and
Science and former president of the American Pharmaceutical
Association. ``To get one drug that is safe for humans, it means
that virtually hundreds of similar compounds have to be tested in
the same way. The cost is only going to go up as we get more and
more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing contributors to drug costs have been
anti-depressants _ including Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft _ with sales
climbing by more than 20 percent from 1996 to 1997, IMS Health
says.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next five years, more than 100 new chemical entities
are expected to hit the market, Gerbino said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the federal Food and Drug Administration accelerated its
drug approval process by hiring more reviewers and streamlining
procedures, the average time required for approval has shrunk from
30 months in 1992 to 16 months, according to Alan F. Holmer,
president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The result: 39 drugs were approved last year, 53 the year
before. Before 1995, the average number of drugs approved each year
was 25.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor pushing up the growth in prescription drug sales:
More people are taking prescription drugs than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3.4 percent of the 17.6 percent growth in drug sales during
the first half of this year came from price increases, said Gary
Friend, a spokesman at IMS Health. The rest stemmed from increased
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth in the industry is not price-driven. It is
increased consumption, new products and a shift in how our health
care dollar is being spent,'' Friend said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the new cholesterol-reducing drug Lipitol reduces
the incidence of arteriosclerosis and, thus, the likelihood of a
heart attack and bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pill is cheaper than surgery,'' Friend said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, consumers are more compliant in following doctors'
orders. Since prescription copayments are around $10, patients are
more likely to have prescriptions filled.
</P>
<P>
   Slick television commercials also have whetted the appetite of
consumers to try new drugs. Before the FDA changed its advertising
rules in 1997, drug companies only could mention the name of a drug
_ but not the symptoms treated by that drug. The new rule allows
companies to mention both.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-to-consumer advertising spending is expected to total at
least $1.3 billion this year _ an increase of more than 50 percent
over 1997, according to IMS Health.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the pharmaceutical industry says it's too soon to gauge
the effects of such advertisements, a survey in April by Prevention
magazine of 1,200 adults showed that the ads are working.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of every 10 adults have seen or heard a direct-to-consumer
prescription drug ad, and about 53.9 million talked with their
doctor about it. Eighty percent of consumers who asked for an
advertised medicine said their doctor gave it to them. That
translates to 12.1 million consumers getting a prescription due to
an advertisement, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Donoho, managing director of benefits at Houston-based
Continental Airlines, which provides insurance for 29,000 plan
members, said rising demand is increasing the airline's
prescription drug costs by 15 percent a year, and that's definitely
a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescriptions represent 15 to 16 percent of our medical costs.
That's high. You would like to see it at 3 to 4 percent,'' Donoho
said. ``All the commercials you see now on the new drugs _ everyone
wants it. Everyone wants Viagra. Claritin ... at the slightest
little sneeze they want a $25 prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Houston _ which covers 62,000 employees, their
spouses and dependents, and retirees _ says it spent $95.9 million
on health care last year, with more than $20 million of that on
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The average claim cost per prescription jumped 38.7 percent to
$28.69 per prescription from 1995 to 1998. And although the city
isn't paying for that increase because it is fully insured under
NylCare, it continues to track the increases closely since drug
increases eventually will lead to higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to fuss about the rising cost of hospitalization. Now
we have the number of admissions down _ but you punch the balloon
in one place, and it pops out in another,'' said Candy Clark
Aldridge, assistant director in the personnel office at the city of
Houston. ``We're real happy for drug breakthroughs that keep people
out of the hospital. But keeping out of the hospital doesn't
guarantee to reduce your costs.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have tried to contain the costs by restricting the drugs
they will cover and shifting more of the burden onto consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of managed care companies use closed formularies,
lists of drugs they will cover. It is up to the consumer to pay for
anything not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   A recent trend is a multitiered approach. Consumers pay one
copayment for a generic drug, a higher copayment for a brand name
and an even higher one _ usually around $25 _ for drugs not on
either list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health plans want to come up with ways to manage the cost and
not be so restrictive for their members. They want to give their
members choice and access,'' said Blair Jackson, a spokesman for
PCS Health Systems, a pharmacy benefits management company that
administers prescription benefits programs. ``It puts much of the
control in the hands of the plan members while putting in an
incentive to move them towards a more cost-efficient drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But newer so-called drug edits _ in which the number of pills,
inhalers or vials are restricted to so many per month for
everything from asthma to migraines _ have raised the ire of many
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson of PCS Health Systems says drug edits are a trend, and
while many physicians view it as an intrusion and one more obstacle
to jump, others appreciate it because it's a way to track how their
patients are doing on particular medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerbino of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science
blasts the cost-restraining efforts by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put in constraints rather than common sense and made
decisions that are cost-based rather than therapeutic-based
decisions,'' Gerbino said. ``Had they franchised their physicians
as partners and developed therapeutic strategies ... they wouldn't
be in the chaos that they're in over drug prices.``
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Healthcare, which uses the three-tiered approach to
its formularies, also says it tries to contain costs by making sure
its doctors are appropriately treating Prudential members.
</P>
<P>
   ``A program I'm working on now during cold and flu season is
trying to get members to think about nonprescription remedies,''
said Karen Lachaux, director of pharmacy for Prudential
Healthcare's Gulf Coast region. ``There's a set of material we send
to doctors. We always start everything with data analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with drug edits and encouraging the use of nonprescription
drugs or other alternatives, some HMOs are forced to raise
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Feyen, president and chief executive officer of PacifiCare
of Texas, said prescription drugs represent roughly half of the 6
percent premium increase PacifiCare expects next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our copays are going up, and we're encouraging the use of the
most cost-efficient drugs by having a lower copay _ $10 _ for
generics, $25 for brand names,'' Feyen said. ``We are providing
information to physicians so they can see how their patterns of
utilization and different use of drug classes compares to their
peers. There are benchmarks that ... help them make more-informed
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these strategies to rein in pharmaceutical costs,
there's no slowdown in sight, analysts say. But they say that fewer
surgeries and hospital stays should help offset the newer, more
expensive generation of drugs being used to manage diseases,
although that's hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, consumers can expect more restrictive drug
benefits, higher insurance premiums and more legislative control.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, premiums are increasing for all employers,
regardless of plan type, says the Washington Business Group on
Health.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Business Group on Health reports 1999 premiums will
increase an average 10 percent. Watson Wyatt, a benefits consulting
group, predicts increases of 5 to 15 percent. Towers Perrin,
another consulting group, says to expect an increase of 7 to 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Webber, senior associate at Consumer Coalition for
Quality Health Care, a public policy and advocacy group in
Washington, warns that drug companies need to be circumspect in
setting their prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug companies are in such a powerful position to charge just
about anything they want. They should fear they have such control
over the marketplace,'' Webber said. ``Over time, there is going to
be an outcry for tighter regulation of that industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Dickerson, a consultant at William M. Mercer Inc. in
Houston, said health plans will begin carving out pharmacy benefits
as an elective choice for employers.
</P>
<P>
   PacifiCare's Feyen said that in the end, payers _ in most cases,
the employers _ will try to share the costs more with employees and
make them more responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot of changes coming down the road in the
next couple of months,'' Feyen said. ``How care is delivered and
the cost will undergo significant change. Who ultimately pays for
all that will likewise need to be addressed, if not changed. I
believe there will be a greater sense of accountability and some
reward mechanisms for those who maintain a healthier lifestyle.''

`N.Y.P.D. BLUE': NOW, SO LONG, BOBBY SIMONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a major character in a series is placed in mortal danger,
the question is not ``Will he die?'' but ``How will he escape?''
But when Jimmy Smits decided to leave ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' after five
episodes this season, the show took full advantage of the freedom
his departure offered. Smits' character, Detective Bobby Simone,
has quickly faded from a heart infection and at the end of last
week's episode was about to receive a transplant. The plot has
energized the series with the kind of unpredictability usually
limited to films.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, Tuesday night's 90-minute installment is
Bobby's last. And though many viewers will watch because of the
suspense about his fate, there are other reasons Bobby's final
story has been so poignant. This season ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' has been
as good as ever (and it has been among the best on the air, though
last season was slack). Bobby's decline has added a tone of sadness
and anxiety rare in a weekly series, and the show has come through
with a new emotional depth and stylishness.
</P>
<P>
   As Bobby has drifted in and out of consciousness in the past
weeks, dream scenes have been used sparingly and to great effect.
In one recurring dream he has seen Patsy (Brad Sullivan), now dead,
a father figure from Bobby's youth who inspired his hobby of
raising pigeons (one of the quirky details that have filled out his
character). Last week Patsy sent Bobby back to the world of the
living. Tuesday night's dreams seem especially true and haunting.
</P>
<P>
   The episode ignores any major crimes to focus on the characters'
private lives. It would ruin the suspense to reveal too much about
Bobby, though it gives away nothing to say there is a battle
between two doctors who have appeared before: Bobby's arrogant
surgeon, Dr. Swan (Jack Blessing), and the young Dr. Carrera (David
Barrera). Some peculiar, ambiguous conversations make it hard to
judge which, if either, is the good doctor.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a compelling, unrelated subplot about Andy Sipowicz
(Dennis Franz) and his ex-wife, Katie, played with powerful
understatement by Debra Monk. After the death of their grown son,
Katie has started to drink, which echoes Andy's own former drinking
days and makes him feel guiltily responsible for having left her.
The plot adds great resonance to the sadness that has imbued the
series all season.
</P>
<P>
   In the past weeks, Andy's response to Bobby's decline has been
anger as well as grief, which has called for Franz to explode too
many times, with some scenery-chomping that is as much the writers'
fault as the actor's. Tuesday night Franz shows Andy more in
control of his explosive emotions, and the effect on viewers is
likely to be even more wrenching
</P>
<P>
   ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' has always violated truisms about television
heroes. Here, they are complex and imperfect. They may drink or
rough up suspects or display unconscious racial bias (and that's
just Andy).

   Bobby was the judicious center around which so many others got
to spin out of control. And though his level-headed approach
offered Smits few opportunities for stormy acting, it is a huge and
subtle accomplishment to have made Bobby so richly believable. And
let's not ignore the hunk factor. Take an informal poll of women:
he was the reason they watched, and they always thought Bobby could
do better than Diane Russell (Kim Delaney), the neurotic colleague
he married.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bobby loses his life or recovers and moves on to a new
career that takes him out of town (airline pilot? professional
pigeon raiser?) the tone of the series is bound to change when Rick
Schroeder arrives next week as Andy's green new partner. And when
tonight's episode ends, it will be time for a couple of reality
checks. Presumably Smits still has an agent and some healthy career
prospects. And thank goodness for reruns.

WACO SCHOOLS CRITICIZED FOR REJECTING ABSTINENCE PROJECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Waco might seem an unlikely place for
conservatives to lose out when making a pitch for an
abstinence-only sex education program.
</P>
<P>
   But the school board in Waco, a conservative city that is home
to Baptist-run Baylor University, is now under attack by social
conservatives for turning its back on a program that promotes
abstinence while discussing birth control and condoms in a negative
light.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Health recently awarded the McLennan
County Collaborative Abstinence Project a $657,950 grant, among the
largest in the state, for abstinence programs intended to reach
young people in a county with the state's second-highest teen
pregnancy rate. Statewide, $4.4 million has been distributed for
the programs out of $50 million nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law establishing the grants says they may only
support programs whose exclusive purpose is to promote abstinence
and to teach that ``sexual activity outside the context of marriage
is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Waco school board members are not troubled by that message, but
worry the program could worsen the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't necessarily agree with all their guest speakers,''
said Connie Jefferson, a parent and school board member. ``They
stressed that birth control is not effective and not to use it. We
wanted people to tell children the whole truth and nothing but the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other opponents worried that sexually active teens in
Waco's urban schools might respond to the county project's
``Teen-Aid'' program by forgoing contraceptives and condoms while
continuing to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson also said there was concern about the issue of
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people ... who thought and had heard rumors that the
Christian extreme right and Christian Coalition were behind the
MCCAP program, and they didn't want to get involved with those
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For MCCAP, which had pledged in the grant to reach more than
28,000 clients, losing the largest school district in the county
came as a blow. Marilyn Ammon, director of the group, said she's
scrambling to reach teens instead through churches, youth groups
and even school districts outside the county.
</P>
<P>
   Ammon also insists there is no religious funding behind MCCAP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not receiving any funds from any religious organization.
We're truly an extension of the medical awareness of the (sexually
transmitted disease) epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including Planned Parenthood and doctors in Waco, say
Teen-Aid is among several curriculum programs that promote
abstinence through fear, mentioning contraceptives and condoms in
the worst possible light. Waco's educators decided they preferred
the approach they had. It teaches abstinence as the preferred
behavior but informs older teens about how contraceptives and
condoms can reduce health risks associated with teen sex.
</P>
<P>
   After the board's rejection, a letter-writing campaign to board
members in support of ``abstinence only'' ensued, and news reports
appeared saying the grant could be endangered, said school board
member Ralph Strother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt very political to me and very organized,'' Strother
said. ``I've been involved in politics for a long time. I know
politics when I see it. This thing won't die down.''
</P>
<P>
   A press release criticizing the Waco board's action was issued
by the Free Market Foundation, a Plano-based socially conservative
think tank. The Free Market Foundation often works ``hand in hand''
with the Texas Christian Coalition, according to Coalition
president Chuck Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think it would be a pretty hot issue in the Bible Belt
in Baylor town,'' said the Free Market's Kelly Shackelford. ``In
other states there are battles going on. This is the first time
we've heard of anywhere in this state of their rejecting it.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The foundation has a division called Texas Physicians Resource
Council, which includes a number of doctors who are staunch and
vocal opponents of abortion, according to the Texas Medical
Association. Shackelford said ``abstinence only'' education for
teens is now the physicians council's No. 1 issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programs that teach mixed messages about the use of abstinence
and the use of condoms create conflict,'' Dr. Hal Wallis, chairman
of the council, said in the press release. ``To offer condoms to
someone for the express purpose of preventing STDs (sexually
transmitted diseases) is essentially malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallis said that kids feel they've been lied to when they learn
that condoms are not enough to prevent some external venereal warts
caused by a virus that has been strongly linked to cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office is filled up with pap smear abnormalities. I can
just see in my own practice that the number of people involved with
this is just overwhelming, primarily among young people, girls 25
and younger,'' said the Waxahachie obstetrician/gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   While other doctors don't dispute the possibility of contracting
the warts while using condoms, groups such as the Texas Medical
Association support more comprehensive approaches to sex education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors have voiced a policy that older teen-agers who are
sexually active should have information and be given educational
information on how to reduce their risk behaviors, which would
include using condoms,'' said Gail Harris, TMA's director of public
health. ``We do support abstinence, but that doesn't work for all
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Cohen of Planned Parenthood's Houston office said it is
important to warn teen-agers about the human papilloma virus that
causes warts linked to cervical cancer. She noted that it is
``very, very widespread'' among the young, and quite serious.
However, she added there is no reason why anyone should die from
cervical cancer. Rather, all women must be taught to undergo
medical screenings once a year or more if they are diagnosed with
the virus.

   BETHESDA, Md. _ At the National Book Awards ceremony on
Wednesday, all bets for the Fiction Award were on ``A Man in
Full,'' Thomas Wolfe's flamboyant novel weighing in at 742 pages,
full of larger-than-life characters. In case Wolfe won, his
publisher, Roger Straus, the president and chief executive of
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, was ready to read Wolfe's acceptance
remarks for him. Wolfe was in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But instead the prize went to a novel 280 pages long that
``cared nothing for horsepower, only for stealth,'' said Thomas
Mallon, chairman of the judges' panel in announcing the prize. The
book was ``Charming Billy,'' by Alice McDermott, a quiet,
unpretentious story of quiet, unpretentious people, Irish Catholics
in New York for whom religious faith is a given.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDermott, whose book was also published by Straus, was
expecting nothing. Her book ``That Night'' had been nominated in
1987 and did not win. She had other priorities: three children _
Will 13, Eames, 10, and Patrick, 5 _ and her writing students at
Johns Hopkins University, who needed recommendations. ``I was
surprised this time, and very pleased,'' Ms. McDermott said in
typically modest fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charming Billy'' is about Billy, who in his youth fell in love
with an Irish girl. The girl returns to Ireland; he works to bring
her to the United States so he can marry her, and he sends her
money. But then he is told that she has died. Billy spends his life
in bars, mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark, sparkling, sprinkled with moments when the sound and
smell and sight of the place,'' Ms. McDermott writes, ``the taste
at the back of his throat, transported him, however briefly, to a
summer night long ago when he was young and life was all promise
and she was there to turn to.''
</P>
<P>
   He marries plain Maeve, who carries him drunk to bed every
night. One day Billy learns that the Irish girl didn't die after
all. She had taken his money, married and opened a gas station with
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy is in every extended Irish American family,'' Ms.
McDermott said. ``He's the lovable drunk. It's not a party or a
family gathering unless he's there.'' Ms. McDermott was interested
in ``the persistence of the love that families and friends have for
these people. It's probably wrong-headed. Smart, modern people
would say you're enablers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDermott, 45, drew partly on the Irish Catholic culture of
her extended family to write the book. Her parents moved from New
York City to Long Island, N.Y., when Ms. McDermott was an infant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDermott's father was a business representative for Con
Edison, the utility. Her parents were not college educated, but her
father had had a Catholic education. He would emote ``The Charge of
the Light Brigade,'' she said. ``He would quote favorite lines from
Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother encouraged her to write when something troubled her.
Another influence, she said, was ``the Latin Mass, the rhythm of
the language of prayer and ritual, the importance of repetition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDermott went to parochial school, where, she said, she was
a feckless teen-ager, ``sneaking into bars with fake IDs at 16 and
17, probably drinking too much on weekends and getting in all the
wrong cars.''
</P>
<P>
   For college, she chose the State University of New York at
Oswego, ``because it was a great party school.'' But she fell under
the influence of her writing teacher, Dr. Paul Briand. ``I got bad
news for you kid, you're a writer,'' Briand told her.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she drifted. After college, she worked in New York at
Vantage Press, a vanity publisher. She won a scholarship to the
writing program at the University of New Hampshire and came under
the influence of another mentor, Mark Smith, who told her, she
said: ``I'm taking you seriously. You have to take yourself
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   She got serious and sold a story to Ms. magazine, then another
to Seventeen. She also met her future husband, David Armstrong, ``a
Midwestern WASP,'' she said, at the Mad Hatter, a singles bar in
New York. Armstrong is a neuroscientist.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage, she began a novel about a girl working at a
vanity press. Her mentor, Smith, wrote to his agent, Harriet
Wasserman, saying, ``You're going to kiss my feet in Macy's window
for the writer I'm going to send you.'' Ms. McDermott showed Ms.
Wasserman some pages, and a week later, Jonathan Galassi, then at
Houghton Mifflin, offered her a contract.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was very diffident, Galassi said, but in her
writing, he added, ``She's controlling what's going on, and very,
very powerfully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bigamist's Daughter'' (Random House) was published in 1982,
and reviewed on the front page of The New York Times Book Review by
Anne Tyler, who said that Ms. McDermott ``writes with assurance and
skill, and has created a fascinatingly prismatic story.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Ms. McDermott published ``That Night'' (Farrar, Straus
&AMP; Giroux), about a teen-age romance in suburbia. David Leavitt
praised it on the front page of the Book Review, for ``its sense of
almost Shakespearean tragedy.'' Galassi, reading the review to her
over the phone, ``started to cry,'' Ms. McDermott said. ``That
Night'' was later made into a movie starring Juliette Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Weddings and Wakes'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux) came in
1992. She calls it ``my Irish-American novel.'' It's about five
Irish Catholic women, one of whom, an ex-nun, is courted by a
mailman. She marries him, and dies four days later. That book made
the New York Times best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the praise, writing is difficult for Ms. McDermott. One
method of foiling her terror, she said, is to work on two novels at
once. If one isn't working, ``I can have the courage to dump it.''
</P>
<P>
   She began ``Charming Billy'' in 1995, as usual showing Galassi
sections of it, asking his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface a simple book, it is in fact technically complex,
weaving between past and present, told from several points of view,
sometimes told from inside the heads of characters, at others by an
omniscient narrator.
</P>
<P>
   The main narrator is a young woman. Ms. McDermott was determined
to have her. ``There aren't enough smart women's voices in
fiction,'' Ms. McDermott said. Too often it is a male narrator who
tells the truth of things. She wanted ``a woman's voice that is not
deluded, not mistaken, not self-obsessed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the woman's role in a family,'' Ms. McDermott said,
``to put the histories together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDermott lives in a large brick house in Bethesda. She
calls herself a practicing Catholic whose faith has deepened. ``I'm
doomed to be a Catholic,'' she said, with a laugh. ``There's no
turning back.'' She works from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. while her children
are at school.
</P>
<P>
   She is, as usual, writing two novels, one too new to talk about.
``The other one is about women, almost exclusively,'' she said. ``I
still think there's a lot of material in the experience of women
not fully tapped and appreciated.'' Women, she said, are ``the
people who take care of the old people and the young.'' They keep
the domestic world moving. The novel is about motherhood, ``about
women's lives from beginning to end.''

WOMEN VS. MEN, MEDICALLY SPEAKING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Men and women react differently to certain diseases and
treatments, according to the Society for the Advancement of Women's
Health Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recently learned that women appear to process proteins
less effectively than men, which may be why women are three times
more likely to contract an autoimmune disease,'' says Dr. Denise
Faustman, associate professor of medicine at Harvard School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Some differences:
</P>
<P>
   _ Autoimmune disease _ Three out of four people with autoimmune
diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus
are women.
</P>
<P>
   _ STDs _ Women are twice as likely as men to contract a sexually
transmitted disease, and 10 times more likely to contract HIV
during unprotected sex with an infected partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lung cancer _ Female smokers are more likely to develop lung
cancer than male smokers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heart disease _ Women are more likely than men to have a
second heart attack within a year of a first.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anesthesia _ Women tend to wake up from anesthesia more
quickly than men _ an average of seven minutes for women, 11
minutes for men.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pain _ Some pain medications (kappa-opiates) are far more
effective in relieving pain in women than in men.

TRADING CARDS: INDUSTRY, A LITTLE WISER NOW, ISN'T HURTING DURING
NBA STRIKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time labor strife shut down a major professional sports
league, the sports trading card industry nearly shut down. That was
in 1994 when baseball players walked out. The strike accelerated a
deep decline in the boom-bust sports card business.
</P>
<P>
   The five-month-old NBA lockout hasn't had quite the same impact
on sports card sales, and among the reasons is the industry's new,
more conservative approach. Wary manufacturers, drowned by excess
inventory in the past, delayed or canceled preseason basketball
card shipments in anticipation of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaner times of the past have taught us to be more
efficient,'' explained Marty Appel, spokesman for New York-based
The Topps Co., a leading sports-card manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by increased interest in baseball cards triggered by last
summer's Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home-run chase, the industry has
found a sort of economic equilibrium, if not another boom.
</P>
<P>
   New-card sales by major manufacturers have stabilized at about
$400 million to $450 million annually, according to the industry's
rough estimates, down from about $1.1 billion in the peak sales
year, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And while some manufacturers collapsed, including Dallas-based
Pinnacle Brands, which filed for bankruptcy this year, others like
Topps, Upper Deck and Fleer/Skybox have survived and stand to
prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Topps, for one, said it has never had a losing financial quarter
in its sports-card business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hobby is in better shape now than it has been in the last
few years,'' said Rob Springs, sports-card analyst for Dallas-based
Beckett Publications, a publisher of industry price guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every manufacturer realizes one thing. Overproduction killed
the market. So they've all scaled down their production
dramatically,'' said John Klassnik, owner of J.W. Sports Cards and
Collectibles in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Cardmakers' approach to the NBA lockout, to some degree, mirrors
the industry's current operating philosophy: Too much product isn't
necessarily a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson was a painful one to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to capitalize on the unprecedented demand for cards caused
by heavy speculator investment in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
trading-card makers overproduced. Soon, inflated card values
deflated, sales tumbled, manufacturers folded or merged, retail
shops shuttered and the number of card shows declined.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators ``had heard that cards could be worth a lot of
money, and they saw an opportunity to get rich quick,'' Springs
explained. ``They'd buy a bunch of cards, `flip' them (resell them
for a profit) and try to make a killing. It just gathered steam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of speculators came into the market and drove the prices
to unrealistic levels,'' said Klassnik, who is both a card retailer
and a distributor for manufacturers to hobby shop operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that goes up that fast is bound to go down that fast,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand was fueled by collectors' desire for so-called ``chase''
cards _ limited editions placed randomly in select packs. The
limited supply of such cards drove up their value.
</P>
<P>
   The market also was super-heated by the creation of new,
technologically advanced styles and designs, a trend that continues
today. Whereas sports cards once were plain pieces of cardboard,
five to a pack with a stick of pink gum inside, they now feature
refracted light effects, innovative photography and all manner of
shapes and sizes. Prices went up, of course, and cards came fewer
and fewer to a pack.
</P>
<P>
   Today, cards are apt to be made of leather, or to feature pieces
of game-used uniforms or bats, cut up in tiny pieces, and imbedded
in the card itself. Some of Babe Ruth's game-used bats have been
chopped up, for example, with the pieces imbedded in cards. That
has caused a protest from others in the collectibles industry who
consider it sacrilege. But it is, all agree, an indication of how
far manufacturers will go to distinguish their product.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular cards today, though, might be the most
traditionally valuable _ rookie cards of star players. It is,
dealers suggest, another sign of a back-to-roots trend in the
industry. Personally autographed cards are a staple, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good rookie content is what drives the market,'' Klassnik
explained. ``Pure hobbyists want rookie cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Mark McGwire's first card. His 1985 Topps, $30 at the start
of last season, has been going for $250, dealers said. Sosa's 1990
Leaf card has soared from $5 in spring training to about $120 now.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of such valuable cards still motivates buyers to
plunk down anywhere from $1.25 to about $9 per pack. Today's higher
prices, however, have caused one change in the market, according to
Al Melnick, owner of Al's Sports Cards in Fort Worth. Now, Melnick
said, a different kind of customer is likely to be looking for that
autographed Ken Griffey card.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lottery for kids,'' Melnick said. ``Well, for adults,
now.''

`FELICITY' FLUNKING OUT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having watched every second of every episode of ``Felicity,''
having digested each ``uh,'' ``um,'' ``yeah,'' and ``Are you OK
with that?'' _ I can say with confidence that it has not lived up
to its megahype.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't possibly have done so, given the breathless way the
rat-pack media devoured this young-adult drama about an
introspective college freshman and the boy she dashes cross-country
to join. Still, ``Felicity'' (9 EST tonight, The WB Network) isn't
even the highest-rated new drama on its own network. That would be
``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people have already written off this 2-month-old series,
considering it a well-intentioned but botched attempt at capturing
the intensity of collegiate life. As sturdy, well-written,
well-crafted and splendidly acted as the pilot was, the series has
become disappointingly redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Each episode begins with frolicking freshman Felicity (Keri
Russell) hunched over in silhouette, taping a letter to her mentor,
and fades out with pretty much the same thing. In between, we get
the dramatic morsels of that letter _ a nifty little creative
device usually delivered in slo-mo, backed by slamming music _ but
far too much of it involves Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Ben. Played by Scott Speedman in sexually brooding fashion,
this is the young man she dumped her premed studies at Stanford to
chase. He's romantically unpredictable _ one moment he's gazing
into Felicity's eyes, the next saying, ``I'm kinda into Julie ...
are you OK with that?'' But Felicity has become what the writers
refer to as ``chronically infatuated.'' (Most courts would probably
classify her as ``stalker.'')
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't bother that cuddly Noel (Scott Foley), the student
resident adviser who finds Felicity adorable even though he's got a
girl back in Chicago. But it does tick off Julie (Amy Jo Johnson),
who for a while there was dodging a lovesick Ben, just to spare
Felicity's tissue-thin emotions.
</P>
<P>
   There in a nutshell is Felicity, the series one critic called
``life-affirming,'' and another gushed ``capable of greatness.''
This, I suppose, is correct, since even The Brian Benben Show was
capable of marvelous things before it got on air and proved
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The WB remains happy with the kind of viewers this series has
attracted _ it averages a little more than 5 million viewers per
week, many of them advertiser-friendly young adults. So the drama
may get enough time to mutate into the richly textured series it
promised us in the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Even the star-is-born anointing of Russell, who was all over
magazine covers before her show hit the air, has slowed
considerably, except for that recent TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   I would pretty much agree that there are far too many scenes
where Felicity loses my interest, that the series is squandering a
hotbed of dramatic possibilities. Instead, we're witnesses to an
hour of moping and soul-searching, as though going away to college
is nothing less than the beginning of life.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Russell said by phone the other day that
she'd also like to see the series lighten up, and promises that
tonight's Thanksgiving episode (all the gang gather for dinner,
including Noel's long-distance love) isn't as heavy as bricks.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Ben/Noel situation, her character will soon ``be in a
relationship with one of them.'' My bet is Noel.
</P>
<P>
   For all the disappointments offered here about Felicity, three
final things:
</P>
<P>
   One: For all its flaws, this series is still more intriguing
than most dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Russell is one of the more provocative actors to emerge
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Three: Slow-building shows tend to find longevity.
</P>
<P>
   The last point is where we'll leave off. The deluge of press
bothered Russell; she knew the series couldn't live up to its hype
and would suffer the usual media backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the media vultures have moved on and are, well, picking
apart Calista Flockhart, Russell thinks Felicity may get the time
it needs. ``When you start slower and gain in popularity,'' Russell
figures, ``people have a little more respect for you.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll see.

MEDICAL BILLS BALLOON AS PRESCRIPTIONS SURGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By SARAH LUNDAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zocor. Viagra. Lamisil. Zoloft. Prilosec.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, in newspapers and on television, Americans are
bombarded with advertising for a stream of new drugs to battle
everything from high cholesterol to impotence to fungus.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing push is driving prescription drug usage in the
United States to new levels and is a prime reason why consumers and
insurance companies are facing higher health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think it's the price of drugs,'' but it's not just
that, said Jackie Cottrell, spokeswoman for the industry
organization, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Overall pharmaceutical spending increased nationwide by 14.2
percent in 1997, but only 2.5 percentage points resulted from
increased prices, according to data collected by IMS America, a
research and information company. The remaining 11.7 percentage
points are from increased prescription use, fed by rising use of
newer, more expensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, consumers like Rebecca Wilson say it's difficult to place a
price on an improved quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington resident, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis,
is taking Enbrel, a drug approved this month by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I was bad, I would come in from work and go to
bed,'' said the 41-year-old, who now rides bicycles with her two
daughters. ``I am convinced that I would be in a wheelchair now, if
it weren't for this drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson doesn't yet have to worry about paying for Enbrel,
because she is participating in a research project. But if she were
paying, it has a high price tag: about $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   As costs continue to escalate, prescription drug sales are
expected to climb to a record high of $102.5 billion this year, an
increase of 15 percent over last year, according to the National
Association of Chain Drug Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and even health insurance companies say the increased
spending on prescriptions has a good side. Drugs may help people
avoid even more expensive hospital stays, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the increase in the drug cost is good and
appropriate,'' said Nick Hanchak, Aetna U.S. Healthcare's pharmacy
benefits manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the theses is that drug costs are going up, but it may
actually be reducing the total cost of care,'' Hanchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance companies, like Aetna, are on the front lines
of the battle over cost. They paid out $51.6 billion, or 63
percent, of the $81.9 billion in U.S. prescription sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of pharmaceuticals for people who are enrolled
in health plans increased to $282.48 last year, compared with
$243.34 in 1996 and $180.25 in 1993, according to Michael J.
Dillon, executive director of the Foundation for Managed Care
Pharmacy in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, who spoke at the Texas Association of Health Plans
annual meeting last month, says that most health insurers are
looking for new ways to ensure that low co-payments aren't abused,
while still providing medications needed to benefit members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can prove the value of the prescription dollar, and the
fact that we're spending more money on our drugs means that we're
caring for our patients far better _ that's excusable,'' Dillon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the increasing prices and spending will change the way
two-thirds of the nation's prescriptions are administered. Health
insurance companies are raising premiums, raising co-payments and
designing new lists of available prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having employees pay a flat $5 co-payment for
generics and $10 co-payment for brand-name drugs, many insurance
companies and employers are considering having members pay a
percentage of each prescription cost, such as 20 percent or 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Teichgraeber, vice president for sales and marketing at
Inteq, a pharmacy benefits company, develops strategies for
employers who self-insure and are searching for ways to lower drug
costs. Some of his clients include Trans World Airlines, Tom Thumb,
Albertson's and H-E-B Stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some groups are going to see over 20 percent increases in
their drug cost this year'' in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
Teichgraeber said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Teichgraeber agrees that increased drug use is a
significant factor in higher drug costs, he said other factors
include the expensive price tags attached to new, brand-name
medications and the success of advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The number of drugs approved by the FDA is surging, according to
department officials. The FDA approved 131 new drugs in 1996, a
record increase over 82 approved in 1995, according to the most
recent government figures.
</P>
<P>
   The increased costs have health insurers carefully evaluating
how to administer pharmaceuticals, said Aetna's pharmaceutical
manager Hanchak. ``We are moving very much toward the types of
benefit designs that encourage the rational use and cost-effective
use of drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another developing program that may reduce escalating drug costs
in Texas is to give employees a ``three-tier program,'' says Geoff
Wurzel, executive director of the Texas Association of Health
Plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as an answer to a lot of things,'' Wurzel said. A
three-tier program would ask the consumer to pay a basic co-pay for
drugs that fall within the health plan's formulary, or list of
preferred drugs. A typical three-tier program would ask consumers
to pay $5 for generic, $15 for brand-name, and $25 for any drug not
in the formulary, Wurzel said. Other programs might have even
higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage clearly is it does give people the flexibility
of getting something else,'' Wurzel said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare, the nation's largest health insurer, will
introduce a triple tier co-payment plan in the North Texas market
as soon as it is approved by the Texas Department of Insurance.

BRISTOL'S SLAVE TRADE TRAIL 
ROME'S PALAZZO MASSIMO 
CHRISTMAS IN RIO 
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
(mk) 
 By SUZANNE MacNEILLE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am planning a few days' stay in Bristol, England, and would
like to visit places associated with the slave trade. Can you help?
_ Sam Stanley, Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Slave Trade Trail Around Central Bristol,'' a booklet
published by the Bristol City Council, will undoubtedly be of great
use as you explore this notorious era in Bristol's history. The
$3.50 guide lists, describes and has maps for 42 sites, including
houses, museums, pubs and other public and private buildings and
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic slave trade began in the 15th century with the
Portuguese and continued into the latter half of the 19th century.
England, seeking to increase the supply of labor to its Caribbean
and American colonies, became involved in the mid-1700s. While
London was England's most important slaving port, Bristol gained
dominance in the 1730s, followed later in the century by Liverpool.
Parliament eventually abolished the British slave trade in the
early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites on the one-and-a-half-mile Slave Trade Trail is
the docks area used by the ships traveling between the West African
coast and the Americas. The starting point is the Bristol
Industrial Museum, where there is a reconstruction of the hull of a
slave ship showing the slaves' wretched living quarters and the
manacles used to restrain them. In the winter, the museum, on
Princes Wharf, is open on weekends; from April to Oct. 31, it is
open from Saturday to Wednesday. The hours year-round are 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Admission is free. Information: (44-117) 925 1470.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning your trip next year, you may also want to
visit the City Museum and Art Gallery on Queen's Road, where an
exhibition, ``Bristol and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade,'' will
run from March 6 to Sept. 2. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Queen Square, there are several private buildings that were
once the homes and offices of merchants and officials who prospered
from the Atlantic trade. Twenty-nine Queen Square, a 1709 Queen
Anne structure now housing the offices of English Heritage, a
government-sponsored conservation body, was the home of Henry
Bright, a mayor of the city and an 18th-century slave trader. On
the south side of the square you'll find the site of the first
American consulate in Britain, established in 1792 to oversee the
trade in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A short distance away, at the bottom of Redcliffe Hill, is the
Quakers' burial ground. The Quakers were the first religious group
to oppose the slave trade and campaigned against it in the 1760s.
At the end of Merchants Wharf, the 18th-century Ostrich pub has had
an interior wall demolished to reveal one of the many caves in
Bristol where slaves were incarcerated before they were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slave Trade Trail Around Central Bristol'' is available from
the City Museum and Art Gallery Shop, Queen's Road, Bristol BS8
1RL. Phone (44-117) 922 3650.
</P>
<P>
   Palazzo Massimo Alle Terme
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like some information on the museum in the Palazzo
Massimo alle Terme in Rome. I find nothing in guidebooks. _ Jayne
Marker, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A. The late 19th-century Palazzo Massimo alle Terme, which
houses part of the archeological collection of the National Roman
Museum, was inaugurated as a museum just last June, which is
probably the reason you're finding little information on it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the displays are a series of recreated rooms, frescoed
from floor to ceiling. One room is a reconstruction of the
triclinium, or dining room, of the Villa on the Via Flaminia which
belonged to Livia, wife of the Emperor Augustus. Another series of
rooms contains original frescoes that once adorned the Roman Villa
of the Farnesina. Because of the fragility of these works _ some of
which date back to 1 B.C. _ this area can only be visited with a
museum guide. Groups are admitted every 45 minutes and the set time
is indicated on the entrance ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's underground vault, with a collection of rare coins,
dates mostly from the Roman epoch. Lighted panels with moving
magnifying lenses allow you to get a close-up view of the coins. A
display on ancient Roman jewelry and luxury goods, mostly artifacts
from tomb findings, completes this section.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining rooms are filled with marble and bronze
sculptures, including Greek originals, mosaics and a series of
sculptured Roman portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Guided tours in English are available on request at (39 06)
520726 and cost $3.85 a person. The National Roman Museum Palazzo
Massimo alle Terme, Largo di Villa Peretti 1, is open Tuesday to
Saturday 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday and holidays 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Admission is $7.70. Information: (39 06) 520726.
</P>
<P>
   No Snow in Rio
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm taking my family with me on a business trip to Rio de
Janeiro and we've decided to stay for Christmas. Can you give us an
idea of what we might expect? _ Harold Kanen, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A. Certainly not snow. In the most populous Roman Catholic
country in the world, Christmas falls just a few days after the
official start of summer, and by and large, it is a tropical
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio, celebrations start on Dec. 20. At 4 p.m., Santa Claus,
or Papai Noel, as he is known in Brazil, arrives by helicopter at
the Quinta da Boa Vista, in Sao Cristovao suburb, a park area that
includes the city zoo and the National Museum. The event will
include music and circus shows that are still being organized. At 6
p.m., a choir will sing Christmas songs at Praca do Lido, on
Copacabana beach.
</P>
<P>
   Many churches around the city hold midnight Christmas Eve Mass.
One of the most beautiful is at the Mosteiro de Sao Bento (68 Rua
Dom Gerardo) _ a 16th-century Baroque monastery with gilded altars
and elaborate carving _ where a Gregorian choir will perform.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day, all beach avenues from the Aterro do Flamengo
to Leblon will be closed to traffic so that families can stroll,
and children can show off the presents they received the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to stay for New Year's Eve, and don't mind crowd
scenes, you can join the more than 2 million people who flock to
Copacabana beach to enjoy a fireworks display and pay homage to
Yemanja _ the sea goddess worshipped in Brazilian cults _ by
burning candles on the sand and tossing white flowers into the
waves.

 &HT;    Farewell to Simone is `NYPD' badge of courage
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be heartless, so to speak, to divulge what ultimately
happens in tonight's ``NYPD Blue,'' the one in which viewers will
learn whether Detective Bobby Simone lives or dies.
</P>
<P>
   In a season mostly bereft of connections between viewers and
series, ``NYPD'' has provided one of the few story lines that has
shaken people up and elicited a lot of reaction. Taking what could
have been a teary, dreary cliche _ the prolonged hospital bed vigil
_ the series has invested it with dignity while still milking the
pathos shamelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Jimmy Smits had served his four-year contract and
wanted to move on, producers Steven Bochco and David Milch were
faced with a dilemma: How would Simone exit? They could have opted
for the heroic demise, having him killed in the line of duty, but
``NYPD'' never has been about gunplay; it would have felt wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They could have had him resign over some injustice, but they'd
done that with Simone's predecessor, John Kelly, and they wanted to
give the well-liked Smits a more dramatic send-off than David
Caruso got.
</P>
<P>
   The failing of Bobby's heart (physically, but not emotionally)
was a risky move, but one that has paid off richly. Smits always
has been a minimalist actor, and as Simone's condition has
worsened, his communications have been reduced to a thin smile and
the waver of fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   The strands that have been spun this season are knitted together
in tonight's 90-minute conclusion, which starts with an extended
``Previously on ...'' recap of Smits' full run on the show.
Simone's beleaguered wife, Diane (Kim Delaney, who's staying on the
show), is increasingly confused as to the best medical course of
action and sparks a rift between Simone's doctors. His partner,
Sipowicz (Dennis Franz), who's been looking to explode for more
than a month, reconnects with his ex-wife and also with his own
truth, that his recovery from alcoholism had drifted onto
autopilot. And there are more of Simone's unnerving dreams about
his surrogate father, Patsy (gravel-voiced Brad Sullivan), and the
unlikely symbolism of pigeons as earthly cares.
</P>
<P>
   Simone's long goodbye has been so wrenching for his precinct
cohorts and for viewers that the appearance next week of Rick
Schroder as Detective Danny Sorenson, Sipowicz's new partner, is
bound to meet with tremendous resentment from everyone. According
to Bochco &AMP; Co., that resistance is part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD'' could have been coasting this season, like Sipowicz's
sobriety. Instead, Smits' departure has given the series a reason
to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

Beatles and Beatles-related releases hitting stores in time for the
holidays. Here's a sampling:

 &HT;    `W.I.T.', you won't find diet tips in this womens magazine
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   King for a day
</P>
<P>
   People ($2.99) does a royal splash on the 50th birthday
festivities for Prince Charles and 340 of his closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   Debut issue
</P>
<P>
   W.I.T., or Women in Touch ($2.95), will try to fill a niche for
women more interested in business, health and the Internet than in
how to nurture a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   W.I.T. focuses on business for women
</P>
<P>
   Newsstands are filled with magazines for women, but the editors
of the new W.I.T., or Women in Touch ($2.95), believe theirs is the
first to combine traditional service with information about
traditionally male fields. In the premiere issue, there are no
articles about ``How to Feel Good About Yourself'' or ``10 Ways to
Lose 10 Pounds.'' ``You already know the answers to those
questions,'' says editor in chief Estelle Sobel. ``And, if not, you
probably know where to find them.'' Sobel says W.I.T. will provide
the latest developments in health care, legal issues, high finance
and the Web to women ages 30 to 44 with a median income of $60,000
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The debut issue is heavy on business advice (including a regular
feature called ``Mompreneurs''), but there's also a beauty article
with a twist. For ``Future Perfect,'' the magazine asked several
beauty experts to divulge the keys for keeping beautiful in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   Among their predictions: Women will be able to temporarily or
permanently alter their eye color; the age for the first face lift
will decline from the 40s to the 30s; and women interested in
flirting can choose fabrics that change colors or patterns
according to their levels of attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA ARTS: Bluemilk, a free publication launched about four
months ago by a group of 20-something Atlanta writers and artists,
is worth a look if you're interested in the city's arts. Available
at bookstores, restaurants and galleries around town, Bluemilk has
featured short fiction by Emory University professor Frank Manley,
poetry by John Stone and an excerpt from an unpublished novel by
award-winning playwright and novelist Jim Grimsley. The current
issue includes a short story, ``Fishing,'' by Emory writer Ha Jin,
and a round-table discussion of art in the New South with various
gallery owners. ``Our goal is simple,'' says editor in chief Chris
Kowalski. ``We want to unify Atlanta's arts scene. We publish
well-known artists next to unknown artists in every issue.''
</P>
<P>
   FAIR GAME: In the midst of hunting season, Time ($2.95)
correspondent Lance Morrow explores the debate over whether the
sport connects children to nature or makes them killers. Should
parents teach children to hunt? Al Fehlman, a high school math
teacher in Grand Junction, Colo., says, ``There's something about
hunting that nurtures my existence.'' Like many hunters, Fehlman
has taught his 12-year-old son not to shoot anything he doesn't
intend to eat. And while 4 million deer are killed by hunters each
year, Morrow writes, hundreds of thousands more will die of
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   TALES OF THE TAPES: Newsweek ($2.99) takes its readers into the
Starr chamber this week with an interview with Sam Dash, the
independent counsel's former ethics adviser. But the most
interesting article is a short essay by author Deborah Tannen about
why men and women heard different things when they listened to the
Linda Tripp tapes of Monica Lewinsky. Men found it boring, she
says, but women _ who are used to telling secrets to their best
friends _ found it compelling.
</P>
<P>
   CANNIBALISM IN AMERICA: Perhaps you want to wait to read this
until after Thanksgiving. Long before the Donner party decided to
make a meal out of some of its companions, The New Yorker ($3)
reports that the Anasazi, ancestors of the Hopi and other Pueblo
Indians, were cannibals. Douglas Preston interviews anthropologist
Christy Turner II about a major new book, ``Man Corn: Cannibalism
and Violence in the Prehistoric American Southwest,'' to reveal
some horrifying details about a tribe once thought to be peaceful
and highly spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN THANKS-
</P>
<P>
   GIVING: Edna Lewis and Scott Peacock (founding chef of Atlanta's
Horseradish Grill) were once dubbed ``the Odd Couple of Southern
Cooking'' when they first began appearing as co-chefs. Lewis and
Peacock's first collaboration, ``Coming Together to Cook,'' will be
published next fall by Alfred A. Knopf, but you can get a preview
of some of the recipes in the November issue of Food &AMP; Wine
($3.95).
</P>
<P>
   Featured is the chefs' menu for a Southern Thanksgiving feast
that includes cheese straws, silken turnip and potato soup, roasted
salt-brined turkey with giblet gravy, corn bread-pecan dressing,
cranberries with orange zest, roasted beets in gingered sauce,
sweet potato casserole, spicy collard greens, pole beans in smoky
pork stock, deviled eggs, cloverleaf rolls, Lane cake and egg
custard. Presumably a lot yummier than what the Anasazi had to eat.

JETLINER MANUFACTURERS DIVIDED ON FUTURE OF THE SUPERJUMBO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 29)

1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The jetliner of the future will be a double-deck behemoth flying
500 to 800 people in three classes of service, or the same old same
old, perhaps with bigger fuel tanks to fly farther nonstop, say New
York to Singapore. Airbus Industrie and the Boeing Co., the only
makers of jumbo jets, have offered those two very different visions
of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced in January 1997 that it would not invest $7
billion to develop a bigger version of the 747, citing a lack of
demand for any plane bigger than the popular 416-seat version it
now sells.
</P>
<P>
   But Airbus, the European company, hopes to announce a year from
now that it will build double-deck versions of its biggest plane,
the four-engine A-340. Airbus calls the proposed plane the A-3-XX,
with five models seating 481 to 656 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial flights of the plane could begin in 2004, Airbus
said.
</P>
<P>
   A superjumbo jetliner would push down costs, meaning lower fares
for customers and bigger profits for airlines, said Mary Anne
Greczyn, an Airbus spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The A-3-XX would have 10-across seating (3-4-3) for coach on the
main deck, but only nine across (3-3-3) on the upper deck, she
said, allowing for slightly wider seats. First class, which would
be downstairs, and business class, upstairs, would each be six
across.
</P>
<P>
   The plane would feature wider aisles than those in 747s, with a
wide, almost grand, front staircase and a modest, curving staircase
at the tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus appears to be quite serious about building this
plane,'' said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United Airlines. ``We
are of the school that a larger airplane with seating for 700 to
800 could make sense in the right circumstances because we have
very strong hubs and we could consolidate traffic. But a lot
depends on cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic, the quirky British carrier, is among the
airlines most interested in a superjumbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at the Airbus 3-XX on our most popular routes
given that frequency is an issue,'' said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a
Virgin spokesman. ``Between the U.S. and U.K. you just can't add
frequency at the moment because slots at Heathrow and Gatwick are
locked up and that makes a much bigger plane attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that if increased competition is allowed at
London's airports, it would diminish Virgin's interest in
superjumbo craft.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways also believes it could fill a superjumbo, but
only on routes between the biggest cities, said John Lampl, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Airlines and Malaysia Airlines have also said they want a
superjumbo, but the weakness of Southeast Asian economies casts
doubt on demand on their routes, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Superjumbos can be built using existing technology, said Ilan
Kroo, who teaches aircraft design at Stanford University and has
been a consultant to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analyses suggest you can make airplanes reasonably
efficient up to 1,000 passengers or so,'' Kroo said. ``The problems
are much more practical, such as how you get all of those people
out in the required time in an emergency and how you build an
airplane that is not so tall that it requires unreasonable slides
in an emergency situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines would also have to spend money to build new jetways to
get people on and off quickly, or else lose some cost savings as
planes spend more hours on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus' proposed 656-seat version would carry a list price of
$245 million, which is about $373,000 a seat. That's 12 percent
less a seat than its current one-deck jumbo, the A-340-600, which
is scheduled to begin flying in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger plane also means many more passengers with the same
number of pilots, reducing operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's analysis that the world does not need a superjumbo jet,
or at least not for nearly two more decades, rests heavily on a
belief that governments will continue easing regulation of
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In tightly regulated markets,'' Boeing said this fall, in its
latest forecast on global demand for commercial planes, ``airlines
have little incentive to look beyond the option of employing larger
airplanes. In competitive markets, airlines consistently choose to
add flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 years, Boeing projects, airlines around the
world will be flying 60 percent more passengers, with nearly all of
the increase coming from the addition of flights.
</P>
<P>
   But some smaller planes will be replaced with existing larger
models. For example, 50-seat regional jets are already replacing
19- to 34-seat turboprops on flights to smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
   For airports operating at capacity, Boeing suggests adding
flights at slow times of the day _ for example, late-afternoon
departures from the West Coast to the East. But persuading
customers to take these flights, which would land in Boston and
Philadelphia between midnight and 4 a.m., could be difficult.
Airbus says that strategy will not work because people want nonstop
service at convenient times.

HOW SOCIETY ABANDONS THOSE IN NEED 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ His real name is Russell Rosenblatt.
When he goes back to the street he calls himself Richard Crockett.
Julius and Millie Rosenblatt, his parents, aren't sure why he does
that. Maybe Russell thinks that Richard Crockett is a more
mainstream, white-bread American name.
</P>
<P>
   That's only a guess, though. It is, in fact, only one of many
guesses that the Rosenblatts have to make about what goes on in the
tortured mind of their 48-year-old son. They have to guess, for
example, why he periodically wanders away from caregivers, from
safe places, why he goes to live on the streets of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   They know that he's irrationally terrified of the FBI, but they
can only speculate on what other demons drive Russell Rosenblatt's
bizarre behavior. That those demons do exist, the Rosenblatts are
acutely aware. They've known for more than a quarter century that
their son is a paranoid schizophrenic. He was diagnosed with this
mysterious ailment _ one that afflicts more than 2 million
Americans _ when Richard Nixon still occupied the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a brilliant student,'' Julius Rosenblatt said. ``It's
like the boy who went into the Capitol and shot people. I felt so
sorry for the guards. But I felt sorry for the parents who'd tried
to get him into a hospital, and nobody would accept him. My heart
went out to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Freudian theory can't help with a thing like this. You don't get
it because your mother watched soap operas instead of singing you
lullabies. It's a physical disease that affects the way the human
brain receives and processes information. It shows up in the late
teens or early 20s. A paranoid schizophrenic can hear voices that
aren't there and suffer delusions that seem utterly and completely
real _ as tangible and as concrete as the newspaper you're holding
in your hands.
</P>
<P>
   He begins to believe that he's the target of a vast conspiracy _
usually the victim of the FBI, the CIA or some other powerful
organization. He might even feel that he's being persecuted by
extraterrestrial beings. So, often, the paranoid schizophrenic runs
and hides. From his perspective, that's only reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what you would do if you knew that they were after
you and you couldn't get anybody to help _ or even to listen to you
seriously?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, you might find a
way to strike your enemies before they can strike you. If you're
Ralph Tortoricci, a rifle-wielding student who held a State
University of New York at Albany lecture hall hostage a few years
ago, you pull some crazy, violent stunt to call public attention to
the plot against you.
</P>
<P>
   This is a chronic ailment, like diabetes. It can't be cured. It
sometimes can be managed by medication, but not always. Sometimes
the medication works for a while and then stops working. And
sometimes paranoid schizophrenics free of their delusions because
of medication figure that they can do without the stuff. And, of
course, they can't. And the fantasies consume them once again, in
all their horror.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when paranoid schizophrenics would be
hospitalized and cared for in secure settings where their
medication would be administered faithfully. Those times are long
gone in this state and most others. Now people like Russell
Rosenblatt are placed in community settings, sometimes in their own
apartments, and provided far looser supervision. Not surprisingly,
many wind up on the street, where medication takes the form of
cheap wine as they wander about in an imaginary reality.
</P>
<P>
   To a huge degree, that's who the homeless are. They're not, as
propagandists would have you believe, ordinary people who've had
some bad luck and who live in a cruel and uncaring society. They
are, instead, sick, deluded, helpless human beings who live in a
cruel and uncaring society _ a society that systematically refuses
to provide them with any reasonable level of protection and care.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Well, the hospitals cost too much money. They were too
hard to run. Now New York state's mental hospitals sit largely
deserted as empty brick monuments to government frugality, with
thick sheets of plywood nailed over the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Also, civil libertarians argue that these delusional people have
rights. They're entitled to be free of incarceration. So the
hospital doors are flung open. And people who experience life as a
hellish dreamscape filled with imaginary perils enjoy the freedom
to relieve themselves on the street and to freeze to death on park
benches when the weather turns cold.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Rosenblatt is a smallish, intense, white-haired man of
72. He spent years in the meat business in New York City. He and
his wife, Millie, live in retirement in Saratoga Springs, an Albany
suburb. They love their son. They've done everything they could to
ensure that he receives decent care.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Rosenblatt has designated himself as the person who
receives his son's government disability payments and passes them
on to whatever community-based agency or hospital is caring Russell
at any given moment. At all costs, Julius doesn't want the money
going directly to Russell, who'll surely use it to flee supervision
and the fictitious plot against him. He has already done that on
several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Russell fled to the Bowery and lived there for five years
before he was found and taken home. He was again found just last
week after another flight of 18 months. At the moment, he's in New
York City's Bellevue Hospital. Julius and Millie are trying to get
him back up here again, into some sort of supervised setting where
Russell can be protected.
</P>
<P>
   You talk to Julius Rosenblatt, and he'll tell you disturbing
stories of his dealings with the Social Security Administration and
the other agencies of government with whom he does business in
trying to obtain decent care for his son. He says they're
constantly cutting off payment or telling him he got a check when
he didn't. Legal Aid wages war on Julius Rosenblatt's behalf. But
he has walked this planet for more than seven decades, and battles
with the bureaucracy are wearing him down.
</P>
<P>
   If only there was a hospital, Julius Rosenblatt says. If only
there was a place where Russell could live in safety, behind locked
doors with caring people to administer his medication and keep him
from hurting himself or anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no such place _ not really, not any more, not in
this society where millions of demonstrably delusional people have
been set adrift to wander until they harm themselves or somebody
else. Then society does to them what it did to Kaczynski and
Tortoricci. It slaps them into prison and leaves them there, locked
up behind steel bars _ alone with those relentless, terrifying
demons that only they can see.
</P>
<P>
   While society hopes that everybody forgets that they exist to
begin with.

EMISSIONS RULES MAY TIGHTEN FOR PICKUPS, UTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are as Texan as Justin Boots, Wrangler Jeans and long-neck
beer bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the nation does Detroit sell more pickups and sport
utility vehicles than in Texas, a market so important to the Motor
City that makers have for years considered ways to put hat racks in
every model.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials are expected to adopt new emissions
regulations next month that would mess with the trucks that Texans
love to drive, pushing up sticker prices anywhere from $300 to
$1,500 per truck nationwide. Texas officials support the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to determine if these standards are necessary to
protect public health,'' said an Environmental Protection Agency
spokeswoman in Washington. ``We have to weigh reducing emissions
and protecting public health against what it's going to cost the
manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to his Dodge Ram pickup recently outside Billy
Bob's Texas in Fort Worth, the self-proclaimed world's largest
honky-tonk, Earle Joe Finch of Tyler shook his head when told of
what the EPA is considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't right,'' he said, getting into the cab of his
bright red truck, which has two Texas A&AMP;M stickers on the tailgate,
a gun rack across the rear window and a picture of his girlfriend,
Mary Kate, taped to the dashboard. On the picture, Mary Kate has
penned, ``I Luv You Earle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's one thing if those folks in Washington want to
fool around with each other,'' he said. ``It's entirely different
if they start doing things that hurt the working man and his
truck.''
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies the problem. Once the partner of every
hard-working cowboy or construction worker, pickups and sport
utility vehicles, such as the Ford F-150 or Chevrolet Suburban, are
as likely to be found hauling children to school or to soccer
practice as they are packing hay for the back 40. The
largest-selling vehicle in the nation is a full-sized pickup (so is
the No. 2 best-seller).
</P>
<P>
   For years, pickups and SUVs were considered by the EPA to occupy
a small niche in the automotive marketplace and were allowed to
emit as much as three times the pollution per mile as cars. But now
the EPA has decided to update its regulations governing light
trucks, a category that includes SUVs, pickups and minivans.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the agency is expected to release a plan that will
force Detroit to manufacture light trucks that produce emissions
that are as clean as those of cars, or very close.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is expected to almost mirror one passed in early
November by the California Air Resources Board, which regulates
that state's air quality. The California plan goes into effect in
2004 and applies to all vehicles lighter than 8,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers say the impact of tightening emissions on smaller
trucks and SUVs, such as the Ford Explorer, will be manageable. But
they claim that the cost could be steep for full-size pickups, such
as the Dodge Ram, or the larger SUVs, such as Ford's Expedition or
the Suburban, sometimes called the ``national truck of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology to cut emissions on the larger vehicles has to be
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Texans bought more than 621,000 light trucks in 1997, tops in
the nation. California was second with 580,700. Florida, Ohio and
Illinois also bought trucks in big numbers, according to Automotive
News magazine, the industry's leading trade journal.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mueller, manager of air policy at the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission, said the state would support any
change that the EPA makes in emissions for light trucks. The state
has written letters to the EPA and the Big Three automakers saying
that it supports such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expressed a concern that we have a lot of SUVs and pickup
trucks and we felt they needed to be addressed as well,'' said
Mueller. ``We have not undertaken anything locally to explore a
Texas standard. But we have raised the concern that the EPA needs
to do it on a national level and that we would be supportive of
anything that they would come out with.''
</P>
<P>
   State environmentalists say they have been pleasantly surprised
by the state commission's positive approach to the possibility of
new truck regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be able to clean up the air in Dallas-Fort
Worth or the Houston-Galveston area without addressing these
vehicles,'' said Neil Carman, program manager for the Austin-based
Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club. ``They do a play a big role.
These vehicles should have to meet car tailpipe standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone favors such changes.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Steed, president of the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, a
Washington advocacy group, said some automakers have said that they
may have to cut engine power to meet the new standards for the
larger trucks and SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be doable to have some of the smaller pickup trucks and
sport utilities meet these rules, but it's going to be a real
challenge for some of the larger vehicles that are so popular with
boaters and campers. We're concerned that manufacturers will simply
stop making those vehicles or make them smaller to bring them in
compliance with any new rules.''
</P>
<P>
   And others doubt the need for cutting emissions from trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Csaba Csere, editor in chief of Car and Driver magazine, said
truck emissions today are far cleaner than they were in the
mid-1960s. He added that any boost in gas prices, coupled with an
increase in the cost of trucks, could hurt sales and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the profits for domestic automakers might
come from trucks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fort Worth GMC truck dealer Alan Young said the market for
light trucks is strong enough to handle any modest price increase
that new EPA rules could cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if everybody does it, it will be raising the (price)
by one or two percentage points and it should have no effect,'' he
said. ``After all, the sport utility market is very strong and
continuing to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Holloway of suburban Dallas, seated in her blue Ford
F-150 in the Billy Bob's parking lot, had a word of caution for the
EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do this, I hope they make sure that it makes a
difference and it's not just more regulation from Washington,'' she
said before pulling away in her pickup adorned with a bumper
sticker that reads, ``Don't Mess with Texas.''

 &HT;    Column: Simplicity AOL's key to success
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online was way too simple for me, right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I knew all sorts of esoteric computer commands back
in those wonderful days of DOS when real geeks knew that the
computer mouse was a passing fancy.
</P>
<P>
   And to me, AOL was also a flash in the pan, just like the mouse,
soon to be replaced by the Internet. At best it served as training
wheels for those new to the online world _ a way of easing their
toes into the waters of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a longtime reader of my column, maybe you remember my
predicting the demise of AOL about four years ago. Predicting the
future has always been easy for me because I'm almost never right.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here is that the only sure-fire predictions about
technology are that the experts are usually wrong. Instead of going
away, AOL has become the world's most popular way of logging onto
the Internet. Instead of becoming a footnote in the history of
cyberspace, it is rapidly becoming an important part of the future.
</P>
<P>
   I can't blame my cloudy crystal ball on lack of knowledge. Way
back in the early days of America Online it was a tiny and crude
bulletin board system for Macintosh computer users. I helped beta
test the software that opened it up to users of IBM-compatible
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The irony in my predictions that AOL was headed for the junk
heap is that the very thing that bugged me about it proved to be a
magnificent virtue, not a fatal flaw. The simplicity of the
service, the point and click methods of navigating, the ease with
which new users could send e-mail and exchange messages in forums,
was the magic bullet that AOL would use to grow into the world's
most popular way of accessing the Internet. And now, like most
experts, my hindsight is 20-20 and I can explain why AOL succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to understand the importance of the simplicity of
AOL is to take a look at one of the most complicated networking
systems in your home. I'm talking about the telephone network. Long
before there was an Internet, or even the predecessor to the Net _
ARPANET _ the telephone network was routinely able to connect
humans from Des Moines to Hamburg to Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Go find the instruction manual for your telephone. Of course, it
doesn't exist. And yet you can simply push a few buttons and
navigate a network much bigger and more complex than the Internet.
That's the virtue of the telephone that sits on your desk. It's the
way you navigate this network _ no instructions needed. It makes a
complex technology easy to use and accessible.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a bunch of explanations for why AOL survived where
others failed and the reasons for its ability to grow from a tiny
service for Macintosh computers into a company big enough to
challenge Microsoft and to dicker in the billions to buy Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   But to me, none of them is as important or meaningful as the
fact that AOL was and has been way too simple for us computer geeks
to use. Instead, it was aimed at the ordinary person who wanted to
use technology without being a technologist.

 &HT;    Vols stay on top; UCLA, KSU set to pounce
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee remained on top when the new Bowl
Championship Series rankings were released Monday, but No. 2 UCLA
and No. 3 Kansas State have closed the gap on the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the formula that combines an average of the regular polls,
computer polls, strength of schedule and record, Tennessee's margin
over UCLA shrank from 2.04 points a week ago to just .68 points in
Monday's new numbers. A week ago the Volunteers were 2.78 points
ahead of No. 3 Kansas State; now they are 1.92 points ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's total rating a week ago was 3.77. Monday's was 4.39,
a difference of .62. The lower the number in the BCS ranking the
better. The top two teams in the final rankings released on Dec. 6
will play in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (10-0) remained No. 1 in the Associated Press poll and
No. 2 behind Kansas State in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches poll
Sunday. But the Volunteers dropped from No. 1 to No. 2 in the
Seattle Times computer ranking, despite their 59-21 win over
Kentucky. UCLA, which beat Southern California 34-17 Saturday,
moved into the No. 1 spot in that computer poll. The other rankings
remained unchanged. That one shift cost Tennessee .58 points in its
rating. The other .04 came from Tennessee's strength of schedule,
which went rom a .52 to .56 after its win over 7-3 Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, however, is still in good shape to reach the Fiesta
Bowl if the Vols win their final two games, at Vanderbilt on
Saturday and against either Mississippi State or Arkansas in the
SEC Championship game Dec. 5. Almost all of the projected figures
have Tennessee staying on top if it wins those final two games.
</P>
<P>
   Which team will finish No. 2 already is being debated. UCLA has
a week off before it travels to Miami on Dec. 5. Miami is rated No.
20 in the BCS Rankings at 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas State, in third place by 1.24 points, will face No. 5
Texas A&AMP;M (10-1) in the Big 12 championship game Dec. 5. If Texas
A&AMP;M beats Texas on Friday and is 11-1 when it faces Kansas State,
the Wildcats could finish just a few percentage points ahead of
UCLA in the final standings.

 &HT;    Wolf on Pack: Free agency not what ails Green Bay
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf is not a man of
excuses, so after Sunday's defeat he didn't use the alibi that the
Packers have been victimized by free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Wolf bristled. ``Who are the great players
we've lost? Somebody tell me who they are. That's not the reason we
lost today, and it's not the reason we won't be the division
champions this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf noted that the team's two highest-profile free agency
defections this spring _ defensive end Gabe Wilkins (to San
Francisco) and cornerback Doug Evans (to Carolina) _ aren't playing
as well as the youngsters who replaced them. And he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, who signed a four-year, $20 million contract, hasn't
fully recovered from his offseason knee surgery. He's been a major
disappointment for the 49ers, who expected him to replace Chris
Doleman at right end, and Packers rookie Vonnie Holliday already is
a superior player.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who got a five-year, $22.5 million deal despite
liabilities in off-man techniques, surrendered seven touchdown
passes before going onto the injured reserve list two weeks ago.
Third-year pro Tyrone Williams has played well for Green Bay as his
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the teams that signed (Wilkins and Evans) could send them
back to us and not suffer any economic consequences, believe me,
they'd do it,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Long a believer that the game is quarterback-driven and that big
players win titles, Wolf likewise shrugged off losses of guard
Aaron Taylor and punter Craig Hentrich. ``Those kinds of guys don't
win you championships,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What he couldn't deny, however, is that free agency has resulted
in deterioration of the Packers' depth, just as it did with the
Dallas Cowboys a few seasons ago. When starting cornerback Craig
Newsome left the game in the second quarter Sunday, the Packers
were forced to use retread Rod Smith, and he was abused by
Minnesota wideout Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense, yeah, (free agency) hurt us some,'' said Wolf,
who tried unsuccessfully to obtain secondary help, from training
camp to the trading deadline. ``It's a game of economics now, and
you can't keep everyone. You pick and choose, try to keep your
nucleus intact. The pressure is on the assistant coaches to try to
get young guys ready to play faster now, and that's a difficult
task.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice ranting
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice is proving that he not
only is one of the greatest players in NFL history but also one of
the most selfish, to the surprise of many unaware of his longtime
me-first attitude. Despite two 1997 knee surgeries that have
diminished his abilities, Rice leads the NFL in receptions. But
that's not enough for Rice, who can't reconcile the fact that the
younger Terrell Owens has supplanted him as the club's primary
receiving threat. After being shut out in the first half of Sunday
night's victory over New Orleans, then catching three passes in the
second half, Rice threatened that this could be his final NFL
season. ``All I know is I'm not having a good time,'' Rice said.
``So maybe it is time to move on.'' Aware that some younger players
thought Rice was being used to the detriment of Owens and J.J.
Stokes, coach Steve Mariucci reduced his role slightly against the
Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Center of attention
</P>
<P>
   It would be anathema to suggest that anyone other than
Pittsburgh's Dermontti Dawson, a potential Hall of Famer, will be
voted the All-Pro center in '98. But Vikings unheralded snapper
Jeff Christy could give Dawson a run. A six-year veteran, Christy
was superb Sunday in three times picking up Packers middle 'backer
Bernardo Harris. He also slid laterally to help right tackle Korey
Stringer with Green Bay end Reggie White and aided guards David
Dixon and Randle McDaniel in their double-team blocks on Gilbert
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed events
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to take advantage of a Cincinnati defense that
ranks last against the run, but no one loves seeing the Bengals on
the schedule more than Baltimore tailback Priest Holmes. Including
his 227 yards on Sunday, the second-year player ran for 400 yards
and averaged 6.3 yards per carry in two appearances against
Cincinnati. In nine other games, Holmes has totaled 290 yards and
has a 3.2-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback update
</P>
<P>
   With Kent Graham (N.Y. Giants) and Paul Justin (Cincinnati)
joining the list, 22 backup quarterbacks have 95 starts.
Cunningham, Bubby Brister (Denver), Vinny Testaverde (N.Y. Jets),
Donald Hollas (Oakland) and Doug Flutie (Buffalo) have an aggregate
record of 28-4.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tops
</P>
<P>
   After struggling early to assimilate a new offense installed by
first-year coordinator Marc Trestman, Arizona quarterback Jake
Plummer is making big plays to keep his club in the wild-card race.
Plummer passed for two touchdowns and ran for three more in a 45-42
shootout win over Washington. In the last two weeks, Plummer has
thrown for 716 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive best
</P>
<P>
   No player better exemplifies Pittsburgh's inconsistency this
year than cornerback Dewayne Washington. The five-year veteran, who
has surrendered five scoring passes, was on top of his game Sunday.
His two interceptions of Jags quarterback Mark Brunell, and
touchdown returns of 58 and 78 yards, led the Steelers to a 30-15
win.
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   Vikings punter and kickoff specialist Mitch Berger was key to
his team's victory. Berger knocked all six kickoffs into the end
zone, with an average depth of 7 yards, and five were for
touchbacks. Berger also averaged 54.3 yards gross and 47.3 yards
net on three punts and had one inside the 20-yard line. He limited
Green Bay standout return specialist Roell Preston to 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing . . . .
</P>
<P>
   With Herman Moore sidelined by a groin injury, former Virginia
star Germaine Crowell got his first start for the Detroit Lions.
The second-rounder, used primarily as a slot receiver this year,
caught three passes for 82 yards, including a 53-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Stat stuff
</P>
<P>
   Since Bill Cowher succeeded Chuck Noll in 1992, the Steelers
haven't lost consecutive games in divisional play. . . . In seven
seasons, Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren is 38-17 against the rest of
the NFC Central but only 5-9 against Minnesota and coach Dennis
Green. . . . The Chiefs' current six-game losing streak is the
longest under coach Marty Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay tailback Dorsey Levens is expected to return to
practice this week and could get some playing time against
Philadelphia next Sunday. . . . Look for college coaches Barry
Alvarez (Wisconsin) and Bill Snyder (Kansas State) to merit
consideration for some of the NFL's upcoming vacancies. . . . The
odds of June Jones keeping the coaching job in San Diego for next
season improved with the Chargers' last-minute win over Kansas
City. . . . The toe injury to Deion Sanders aside, his Thanksgiving
Day matchup with Moss should be one of the season's best.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia owner Jeff Lurie after his team's 20-0 loss to the
New York Giants, its third shutout of the year: ``We aren't exactly
playing inspired football, are we?''

 &HT;    Rios stands ready to default Sampras's ranking
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in his five-year reign as the world's No. 1
player, Pete Sampras plays the season-ending ATP Tour Championship
with his top ranking endangered.
</P>
<P>
   As the eight-player tournament begins today in Hannover,
Germany, Sampras holds a 33-point lead over No. 2 Marcelo Rios. The
only other time a player was within 500 points of Sampras entering
Hannover was in 1995, when Andre Agassi trailed by 46 but withdrew
with a wrist injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras must match or exceed Rios' performance this week to set
a pro tennis record of six years in a row at No. 1. He currently is
tied with Jimmy Connors (1974-78) and Martina Navratilova
(1982-86).
</P>
<P>
   Sampras says he would consider the record his greatest
accomplishment and seems puzzled that his pursuit hasn't been a
bigger story.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, people have just taken what I have done for
granted,'' Sampras said. ``To win Grand Slams year in, year out and
to be the No. 1 is not an easy thing to do. . . . Americans expect
me to win every match I play. That's the way it has gone for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has won in Hannover four times _ 1991, '94, '96 and '98
_ and has not failed to reach the semifinals this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, meanwhile, has become more grumpy in recent weeks,
establishing himself as the ideal foil for the mild Sampras. Rios'
target has been the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They drill us as if we were in the army,'' Rios was quoted as
saying last week in the German weekly newspaper Stern. ``If
somebody breaks his racquet in anger, then a punishment machine is
set in motion. That way, people are reduced to bloodless
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If somebody says he's got good friends on the
circuit, that's nonsense. In this business, it's like wild animals
in a cage. It's every man for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Rios griped with some merit that the ATP Tour's
schedule penalizes clay-court players. He thought it unfair that
the ATP Championship was played on fast indoor courts and said,
``That's why Sampras always wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 top tournaments on the tour, seven are played on
hardcourts, four on clay, two indoors and one on grass.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras gets good draw
</P>
<P>
   The round-robin groups for Hannover were set Monday, and Sampras
got a break by avoiding Agassi. Sampras is bunched with Carlos Moya
(a clay-court player who upset Sampras last year in Hannover),
Karol Kucera (who beat Sampras at the Australian Open but has lost
to him twice since) and Yevgeny Kafelnikov (2-9 career against
Sampras with both wins on clay). Rios has Agassi, Tim Henman and
Alex Corretja. Sampras and Rios, who were separated because of
their rankings, have played each other only once, Sampras'
straight-sets win at the 1994 French Open when Rios was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis on the tube
</P>
<P>
   The ATP Tour Championship will be televised live through Friday
by ESPN2 (8-10 a.m.) and ESPN (1-3 p.m.). ESPN will provide taped
coverage Saturday (4-6 p.m.) and Sunday (3-5 p.m.). Today's
televised matches probably will be Sampras-Kafelnikov (morning) and
Rios-Henman (afternoon).
</P>
<P>
   On the women's tour
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport finished No. 1 on the WTA Tour, but this could
be the first year since the computer rankings began in 1975 that a
player was given so little a chance of repeating. That's no knock
on Davenport: The competition includes Martina Hingis, Steffi Graf
and Venus Williams as well as veterans Monica Seles, Jana Novotna
and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. ``Staying No. 1 is probably going to
be the hardest thing I've ever tried to do in my tennis career,''
Davenport said. Hingis, however, views it as a two-player race. ``I
don't have the feeling (of rivalry) with anybody else but Lindsay,
because I'm the second one, so everybody else is worse than me.'' .
. . Graf moved to No. 9 in the final rankings this week and became
the first player since Jennifer Capriati in 1990 to go from
unranked to the top 10 in six months. Graf fell off the WTA Tour
computer rankings after the French Open in May.

RUSSIANS SHRUG OFF YELTSIN HOSPITALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Not that long ago, the news that President Boris
Yeltsin had been rushed to the hospital would have caused near
panic in Russia and nervous jitters all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. When the Kremlin announced Monday that
Yeltsin, 67, was suffering from pneumonia and would spend the next
eight to ten days in the hospital, no one panicked. No one even
acted surprised.
</P>
<P>
   This is because Yeltsin has become increasingly irrelevant since
Russia's economic collapse in August. And his country has other
things to worry about than the president's failing health.  &UR;  &LR;  A few
years back, whenever the Kremlin leader came down with something,
financial market prices would plunge, so great was the fear that
Russia without Yeltsin might abandon pro-market policies and policy
makers.
</P>
<P>
   But no one worries about that after August. That was when the
ruble plunged, Russia defaulted on some of its debts, most
Western-oriented Cabinet members lost their jobs and Yeltsin handed
over the affairs of government to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, stocks on Russia's battered stock market's main index
rose nearly 10 percent in light trading, but that had nothing to do
with the Kremlin's forecasts of a quick recovery and brief
television footage of an animated Yeltsin talking with visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the Central Clinical Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, analysts said, traders were encouraged by signs that
Western lenders might be willing to restructure some of Russia's
$17 billion in foreign debt due next year to prevent an even more
damaging default.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who was rushed to the Central Clinical Hospital in
western Moscow Sunday night with a temperature of 102, has been out
of action with various heart and respiratory ailments for most of
his second term since being reelected in 1996. This is the second
time he has had pneumonia in the past two years and the third time
in recent weeks the Kremlin has pronounced him too ill to work.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have had plenty of chances to get used to their
leader's feeble state. A spate of trip cancellations have allowed
foreign leaders to get used to the idea, too. Monday, Queen Beatrix
of the Netherlands postponed her visit planned for this week.
</P>
<P>
   A Kremlin spokesman linked Yeltsin's illness with the murder
Friday of prominent lawmaker Galina Starovoitova, who will be
buried in St. Petersburg today. The shooting has prompted some
Russian politicians to demand a crackdown on crime. Monday,
Primakov ordered law-enforcement leaders to ``root out crime and
corruption,'' and the head of Russia's police force and its
counterintelligence chief said tough new measures were being
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Starovoitova's murder and not Yeltsin's health was the main item
in Russian newscasts, although the president's latest illness did
bring renewed calls for him to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Communists and their allies began saying that long before
Yeltsin underwent heart surgery in 1996. The difference is, now
even Yeltsin's erstwhile allies agree with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series of illnesses show the inability of Boris
Nikolayevich Yeltsin to carry out his duties,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, a leader of a centrist faction in parliament that used to
support Yeltsin unfailingly.
</P>
<P>
   But as Yeltsin fades, the struggle for succession is heating up.
Among those contemplating a run for power is Moscow Mayor Yury
Luzhkov, who campaigned for Yeltsin in 1996, but has now formed his
own party and suggested that the president should step down.
</P>
<P>
   Even Yeltsin's own deputy chief of administration, Oleg Sysuyev,
got into the act Monday by suggesting that Prime Minister Primakov
start thinking of himself as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   That he puts up with the speculation is the clearest sign of
Yeltsin's weakness. A healthier Yeltsin would never have tolerated
such insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   Weak as he may be, Yeltsin has vowed to serve out his term. But
Sysuyev said that Primakov today ``is effectively a deputy
president,'' indicating an even lesser role for Yeltsin down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   That last remaining drama of the Yeltsin presidency appears to
be whether he becomes the first Russian leader ever to part with
power at the end of his term as a democratically elected leader, or
the latest in a long line to die in office.

EUROPEAN DEALS GLOW IN THE DARK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It is the season of short, dark days, the time when the price
drops for a weekend in Europe. If you have some uncommitted money
and a valid passport, you can at least get a look at different
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   And, on the subject of dark days, a recently reissued book,
Fodor's World Weather Guide (by E.A. Pearce and C.G. Smith, Random
House, $17.95 in paperback), gives an idea of how much light to
expect in places where cheap travel packages are being sold.
</P>
<P>
   In Stockholm and London, December brings an average of one hour
of sunshine daily, in Dublin and Paris, two. Madrid gets an average
of five, like New York and Boston; Barcelona gets four.
</P>
<P>
   These long winter weekends overseas become available in November
and continue at the same prices to the end of March. A period of
almost a month around Christmas is either blacked out or carries a
surcharge, because the airlines can fill up with better-paying
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   For some British packages, there is also a higher-cost period
around St. Patrick's Day. The packages expire before Easter and
Passover.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some seasonal packages. Travel agents sell them; phone
numbers are given for more information.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Escapes to 13 Cities  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Swissair Vacations is offering a second season of European
Escapes, this year to 13 cities, for three nights and four days.
Berlin is cheapest, starting at $493 a person in double occupancy.
The other are Amsterdam, starting at $537; Athens, $698; Brussels,
$530; Budapest, $583; Geneva, $589; Nice, $542; Paris, $536;
Prague, $580; Rome, $620; Salzburg, $589; Vienna, $589; and Zurich,
$589. Breakfasts, hotel taxes and service charges are included.
</P>

   U.S.-EDUC-COMPARE (Undated) _ A major new report on education in
industrialized nations shows the United States to be rapidly losing
its supremacy as the world's premier educator. American high school
graduation rates, once the industrialized world's highest, are now
second to last, and teacher salaries as a percentage of national
income are also among the lowest. The report, by the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, suggests
that the changing picture is less a matter of American backsliding
than of substantial progress in other member states. By Ethan

HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH AN INFLEXIBLE SUPERVISOR?
</HEADLINE>

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. Eighteen months ago, a new supervisor came on
board. After a year, he told us we were no longer allowed to
celebrate birthdays in the office (once a month we would bring in a
cake for all to enjoy). He said it wasn't professional. But he does
things like telling off-color jokes and swearing on the job. Now he
says we are not allowed to make coffee, although he allows other
departments to have food and parties. We have met with him to talk
this over, but he won't budge and his supervisor is so far up in
the ranks that she is inaccessible. Is there any hope? H.E. &QL; 
A. As long as there are steps that you and your associates can
take, there is hope. At he same time, your supervisor does sound a
little hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   You have already taken the obvious step, only to find that your
supervisor is as receptive as a brick wall. The puzzling aspect is
your reluctance to either go over or around this wall. After all,
if you continue to allow yourselves to be victimized, things are
only going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that your supervisor's supervisor is at a very senior
level should not stop you from trying to access her. After all,
when problems are not resolved at lower levels, they typically work
their way up. In your case, you are simply avoiding several of the
middle rungs and going directly to a senior person.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are that there is a top-sider somewhere in your
organization who would be appalled by supervisory arbitrariness,
unfairness or off-color jokes. That person is your best hope. If
such a person cannot be found in your organization, one must wonder
if you should be found there either. &QL; 
Q. My boss claims that he can ``read'' people. He has theories
about people's mannerisms and he also draws conclusions about
people because of things like their personal background, appearance
of their car and the way they eat. He says that skills in this area
are becoming widely accepted as integral parts of management. Is
this true? N.W. &QL; 
A. Gaining increased insight into the employees and trying to
understand their individual motivations, needs, values and
objectives are integral parts of management today. In fact, they
are components of effective leadership.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no trend in management that points to anything
close to acceptance of superficial observations, pop psychology or
stereotypes when it comes to gaining insight into employees. And,
if your boss is making decisions about people based on their
personal backgrounds, he may be overlooking another integral aspect
of management, namely employee relations law.
</P>
<P>
   The irony in this situation is that your boss is relatively easy
to read. His behavior points to some know-it-all tendencies, with a
sprinkling of egotism and arrogance. The key point is that a more
effective way to gain accurate insight into an individual's
behavior is to focus on his or her behavior. In this regard, your
boss's behavior is very telling.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to have a shorthand that provides instantly
accurate insights into others, but that aspect of management is
still in the fiction section. And, from the nonfiction standpoint,
managers who tout a simplified approach to reading people often
have difficulty reading themselves. &QL; 
Q. One of the people that I work with often comes in late, takes
long breaks, makes countless personal calls and then leaves early.
I don't want to tattle on her, but this annoys me and I don't feel
it is right. What can you suggest? A.J. &QL; 
A. There are a number of ways to deal with the employee who does
not do much work while at work. If she is creating difficulties for
you and your fellow employees, then a few of you should approach
her and indicate that you need her help. Let her know your specific
concerns, tell her what you expect, and then give her an update as
to the steps you will have to take if she does not change.
</P>
<P>
   If she continues to regard work as a lower priority, your next
step is a visit with your manager, either on your own or with some
colleagues. Tell your manager that it would be helpful if he or she
could try to spend more time communicating with the employees,
meeting with them and observing what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Without having to cite facts, figures or names, you can indicate
that it seems that things have gotten lax, and it would be helpful
to have more managerial contact, guidance and support. Many
managers are focusing on managing by wandering around and this can
certainly help deal with an employee who is fooling around.

NATIVE AMERICANS EXPOSE THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF HUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Native Americans were the greatest hunters the
Earth has ever seen, said historian and author Ted Kerasote,
because they understood ``the spirit of hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   But is hunting relevant anymore in modern society? The numbers
in California say it is mostly not: In a population of 33 million,
154,000 bought deer hunting tags last year, and 75,000 bought duck
stamps, even though there are 20 million acres of public land to
hunt deer and 20 public wildlife refuges to hunt ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting, in other words, has become a cult-like pursuit in
California. Yet according to a survey, those few hunters have more
passion for their activity, regardless of the outcome, than that of
any other sport.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Are modern-day hunters a handful of aberrant nuts?
</P>
<P>
   According to the three top hunting authors in America, the
reason for that passion is many modern-day hunters hope to capture
the same feelings that stirred the souls of Native-American hunters
hundreds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Without having met each other, three authors have come to this
conclusion on parallel tracks: Kerasote, author of ``The Spirit of
Hunting''; Mark Sullivan, author of ``The Purification Ceremony'';
and James Swan, author of ``In Defense of Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   While they are masters of the technical skills of hunting, and
each hunts extensively, they write not so much about how to shoot
an elk but why, a rarity in their fields.
</P>
<P>
   When on a hunt, Kerasote, an editor with Sports Afield magazine,
feels a kinship with the ancient ways, he explained.0
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals, being kindred spirits, were not killed for fun, and
although hunting was exciting, demanding and dangerous, it didn't
shade over into that area of amusement that modern notions of sport
describe,'' Kerasote said. ``An ancient hunter-gatherer would
differ from a modern hunter in disclaiming that his personal skill
had much to do with securing game. Game was sacred gift for
appropriate and humble behavior. Nor would an old hunter want any
accolades from bringing home animals.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sullivan's brilliant book, ``The Purification Ceremony,'' he
puts that ethic into a cutting image in a story about a
Native-American woman hunter, who tracks and hunts in the snowy
wilds of Canada despite her husband's objection _ and then finds
her companions being hunted themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The book has sold well, Sullivan believes, ``because it's a
sympathetic exploration of the complexities of a hunter's soul.''
But he was also disappointed that the book was rejected as a movie,
being told flatly that ``audiences will not support a heroine who
hunts deer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hunters are not unsympathetic, heartless beings by our very
nature,'' Sullivan said. ``We are family people. We are thinking
people. We love. We hate. We achieve. We fail. We care about the
mountains, the rivers and the wild places. We care about the herds
and the flocks. I think it would be safe to say we think and care
about the world around us far more than the average Hollywood
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Sullivan's book ring true is the sensory detail of
the hunting experience, captured with clarity and with feeling.
It's also a page-turner, where you wonder just which hunter among
the group will be stalked next.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no denying that an increasing portion of our society
finds the idea of a hunter unsympathetic,'' Sullivan said. ``Why?
Because they've seen hunters portrayed in the flat, single
dimension of beer-swilling killer for so long that they know of no
other image.''
</P>
<P>
   Swan agrees with that assessment. As both a professional actor,
author and hunter, he has made it a personal mission to research
film, and discovered five significant films in the past 15 years
where hunters are portrayed with any compassion: ``The Ghost and
the Darkness'' (1996), ``Dances With Wolves'' (1990), ``In the
Blood'' (1989), ``The Sacred Hunt'' (1997), and ``Out of Africa''
(1985).
</P>
<P>
   Like Kerasote and Sullivan, Swan credits going back to the
ancient ways of Native Americans as finding the truth that compels
modern hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ```Dances With Wolves' is a rare insight into the spiritual
kinship between Indians and animals hunted that includes some
spectacular action sequences of Indians killing buffalo that did
not seem to elicit much criticism,'' Swan said. ``This movie also
shocks us with the carnage and waste in market hunting scenes,
which is a very sad page in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Swan said he understood that, nationwide, fewer than 5 percent
of Americans buy hunting licenses; that a clear majority, 62
percent (according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), don't
oppose hunting but oppose any resemblance of unethical behavior or
any breach of the fair-chase ethic. The answer, he said, is
returning to the ancient ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunter departs from society, undertakes rituals of
preparation, becomes one with nature, must avoid injury, stalks and
kills wild animals, and returns to share their flesh with the
community,'' Swan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Researchers have discovered spears that have been carbon dated
at 400,000 years old,'' he continued. ``What has never changed is
the practice and spirit of the hunt.''

 CROSSING THE 38TH PARALLEL DISCOUNT RAIL TRAVEL IN EUROPE 
EXPERIENCING CELEBRITYHOOD 
   
(mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of North and South Korean and American troops
are still massed along each side of the demilitarized zone on the
38th parallel, but on Nov. 18 the first ship of tourists from the
South sailed to the North to visit the Mount Kumgang region. The
two Koreas are cooperating in developing tourism in the area and
have begun building a resort complex.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, sent 83 workers to North
Korea on Oct. 13 to build port facilities for tourist ships. The
resort complex is the idea of Chung Ju-yung, 83, the founder of
Hyundai. In June, he was allowed to cross the demilitarized zone
with a caravan of trucks bringing 500 head of cattle to North
Korea, which is suffering a famine. Until then, South Koreans
wishing to travel to North Korea had to go by way of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai is paying North Korea $942 million over the next seven
years for development rights. The resort will provide modern
accommodations amid the area's 230-foot waterfalls, hot springs and
hiking trails. The resort, which will take several years to
complete, could generate sales of $1.5 billion a year, the South
Korean government estimated, more than double the value of North
Korea's 1997 exports.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and Kim Jong Il, the
paramount leader of North Korea, have agreed to cooperate on the
venture and other investments in North Korea by South Korean
businesses, Korean news agencies report.
</P>
<P>
   North Koreans will hold many resort jobs and Hyundai gave its
first group of tourists a brochure warning them that their
bartender may be a North Korean agent and giving tips on how to
avoid turning a vacation into a political intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic
relations, but there are no restrictions on Americans traveling to
North Korea, according to the State Department. Visas are required
and can be obtained by contacting North Korea's representative to
the United Nations, 820 Second Ave., 13th floor, New York, N.Y.
10017, (212) 972-3105. But foreign spots are limited and Hyundai
won't accept applications for tickets from foreigners until at
least spring, the Korean National Tourism Office said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Europe by Train, With Friends or En Famille &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A new pass for train travel in Europe, aimed at families and
small groups, will be available next year. This Europass Saverpass
will give a discount of 15 percent a person off other Europasses to
groups of two to five people traveling together.
</P>
<P>
   Europasses are good in first class for periods of unlimited
travel _ 5, 6, 8, 10 or 15 days _ over two months in five
countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. The cost
of the new Europass Saverpass ranges from $296 to $620 a person.
Children 4 to 11 travel at half fare, and children under 4 travel
free if they do not require a separate seat. For an extra fare,
Europass and Europass Saverpass holders can add up to two of seven
associate countries: Austria, Hungary, Greece, Portugal, Belgium,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of all but the new Europass Saverpass will increase
by about 3 percent beginning Jan. 1, and a traveler who buys a pass
before then will have up to six months to start using it. Those who
wait until next year to buy passes will not only be subject to
higher prices but will also have to use them within three months of
purchase.

   &UR; Dinner and a Movie (Have a Speech Ready) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Diners become celebrities, literally, at a new dinner theater in
Anaheim, Calif., that simulates the experience of attending a
Hollywood awards show.
</P>
<P>
   The glitter at Tinseltown Studios begins at the front door, at
2200 Katella Ave., adjacent to the Edison International Field.
Guests are interviewed for a closed-circuit television show and
make their way up a red carpet through a scrum of autograph seekers
and paparazzi, played by restaurant employees.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the so-called Oggie Awards (a golden statuette) are
presented for best male and female actors. These are really two of
eight customers (four men and four women) who have been digitally
inserted into films like ``Jurassic Park,'' shown on giant screens.
The rest of the show consists of nearly 30 song-and-dance numbers,
and a film-clip tribute to Hollywood. Dinner choices include
salmon, chicken, sirloin and ravioli.
</P>
<P>
   There are two shows nightly (and two sets of best actors), 5:30
and 8:30 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday, and 4 and 7 p.m. on Sunday.
Admission and dinner cost $44.50, $34.50 for ages 11 and under.
Drinks are extra. Information: (714) 712-2700.

   Designed by the London architectural firm of Benson &AMP; Forsyth,
the Museum of Scotland, although contemporary in style, is inspired
by traditional Scottish castles, brochs (Iron Age monumental
roundhouses), tower houses and tenements. Its five galleries will
display more than 10,000 items _ ranging from rocks from the island
of South Uist in the Western Isles dating back 2.9 billion years to
a Hillman Imp, one of the last 500 cars manufactured at the Linwood
plant near Glasgow before it closed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   As well as traditional displays, information will be available
through interactive screens and a multimedia encyclopedia, Mosaics,
based on the Scottish Collections. Mosaics is illustrated with
historic documents and maps, fine paintings, photographs and
archive film, animation and music, and will be available online and
on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   One gallery, Beginnings, explains the geological formation of
the land through flora, fauna, rocks and fossils from millions of
years ago. Another, Early People, traces the period from the first
arrival of human groups, around 7000 B.C., through the
consolidation of the Norse settlements in A.D. 1100.
</P>
<P>
   The next gallery covers the period when Scotland was an
independent nation, ending in 1707 when it became part of the
United Kingdom. A highlight is the Monymusk Reliquary from the
eighth century, the rarest and most precious article surviving from
the conversion period of Christianity. It is an elaborately
decorated portable shrine that was believed to have held the
remains of St. Columba and that was carried for good luck into the
decisive Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, when Robert Bruce's forces
defeated the English.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth gallery, Industry and Empire: 1707 to 1914, includes
exhibits on shipbuilding, whisky distilling, textiles (paisley and
tartan), coal and the railways. Among the displays are the
Ellesmere Locomotive, built in Leith in 1861, and the Newcomen
Engine, used to pump water from a mine in Lanarkshire.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Century gallery contains 200 objects that have had a
major impact on Scottish life, chosen by a wide range of people,
including Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who donated a tartan
sash.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also includes a shop, restaurant, lecture theater and
cinema, as well as a roof terrace affording panoramic views of
Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Scotland, Chambers Street, Edinburgh EH1 1JF,
telephone (44-131) 225-7534, is open daily. Admission is about $5,
children free. The admission fee includes entry to the Royal Museum
next door.

A NIBBLE OF CALEDONIA IN AFRICA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am nominally Scottish.
</P>
<P>
   I also, nominally, like to fish.
</P>
<P>
   This should make me a perfect candidate for trout fishing in the
mountains of eastern Zimbabwe, which are called the Scottish
Highlands of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But let's examine these claims.
</P>
<P>
   I have tramped the real Highlands, even stomping up Glen Coe,
where the Campbells slaughtered the MacDonalds in 1692. It was cold
and wet, my boots leaked, and I liked it.
</P>
<P>
   My ancestors, on the other hand, are from a wee island called
Barra. They were pirates by trade. I thought they were the benign
sort that scoured shipwrecks like the ones in that old Hayley Mills
movie ``The Moonspinners,'' but a Scottish friend set me straight.
</P>
<P>
   No, the McNeils attacked ships and performed rapine and pillage
along the Irish coast. They _ we _ finally got out of the game in
1600, when a bounty hunter enticed the chief, Roderic the
Turbulent, aboard his boat by promising him a taste of plundered
sherry, got him drunk, locked him below decks and sailed him to
Edinburgh to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   My father visited Barra once, in the 1960s. The airport was the
beach at low tide, nearly everyone was named Donald McNeil, and
several seemed a tad under the genetic weather from generations of
island intermarriages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So much for that. Now _ am I a fisherman?
</P>
<P>
   Well, as 12-year-old Californians, a friend and I used to slip
off with his dad's surf-casting gear after sand sharks in the
Bolinas Lagoon. He hooked them; I waded out barefoot to clock them
with a softball bat so we could land them. Huck Finn I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   I did once go fly-fishing in real Orvis style as the guest of an
older cousin on the lovely trout stream of a Connecticut fishing
club. I caught nothing, but I thoroughly enjoyed decorating the
low-hanging tree branches with my cousin's magnificently colored
flies and swearing as those crystal-clear waters poured into the
top of my waders.
</P>
<P>
   So, sort of a Scot, sort of a fisherman. Now, as to Zimbabwe:
</P>
<P>
   Its highlands are the Nyanga Mountains, ``nyanga'' (pronounced
nee-YAHN-guh, but running the first two syllables together),
meaning a witch doctor, or his horn trumpet. They are so beautiful
that Cecil Rhodes, the diamond magnate turned empire builder
(Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980) fell in love with them and,
naturally, bought them.
</P>
<P>
   His former homestead is now Nyanga National Park, where the
weather is usually 20 degrees cooler than in the capital, Harare.
</P>
<P>
   I asked an acquaintance, Robert Marsden, if he would like to go.
I had thought Robert was Scottish, since I saw him get married in a
kilt _ usually a dead giveaway. It turns out he did it to please
his bride, Mandy McGilp.
</P>
<P>
   It is through Mandy that I had learned just how serious an
angler he is. They took their honeymoon in a fleabag hotel on an
island off Mozambique, and when Mandy went to write ``Honeymoon!''
on their family calendar, she discovered that Robert had written
``Fishing!''
</P>
<P>
   We were not heading out at the most felicitous moment. Early
November is the end of the hot, dry season, and I didn't know if
there would be water left in the streams, nor how warm it would be
_ trout begin to die at 73 degrees, Robert told me.
</P>
<P>
   Our timing was inauspicious in other ways. The Zimbabwe dollar
has fallen from 11 cents to less than 3 cents against the United
States dollar in two years. Most blame President Robert Mugabe, who
was a liberation hero when elected in 1980, but has let his
government deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday morning we were to leave, the tabloid headline on
my Johannesburg doorstep screamed ``Troops in Zim on Full Alert''
above a picture of a burned-out bus. Harare, where we were to fly
in, had had protests over the doubling of bus fares.
</P>
<P>
   I started to cancel everything, but then called a friend who
edits a newspaper there. ``That riot was Wednesday,'' he said.
``Early Wednesday. It's been perfectly quiet since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonably reassured, we went ahead. In fact, Harare was calm _
and 95 degrees _ when we started our three-hour drive to the
Nyangas. The scenery started out flat, punctuated by the
fascinating balancing rocks for which the country is so well known
that they appear on its currency.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Halfway House, a thatch-roofed compound built in
the middle of nowhere in 1891. There, one can enjoy a banana split
or fresh raspberries on the lawn. Or pet the zebras and elands
eating cabbage in a tiny zoo. Or browse the antiques shop, which
sells the cast-off touches of the English style that once ruled the
country: silver tea services and mahogany camp tables.
</P>
<P>
   For $20, I bought a thankfully rare 1966 book, ``White Africans
Are Also People,'' a tome by conservatives arguing that
``independence given to people not yet ready for self-government
has resulted in chaos.'' The saleswoman, who was black, smirked
slightly at me.
</P>
<P>
   There is generally less racial tension in Zimbabwe than in South
Africa. It's only about 1 percent white, and one often meets black
Zimbabweans in hotels, restaurants and private clubs, which is not
the case in South Africa, where local blacks are often priced out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, those 100,000 whites dominate Zimbabwe's
economy, and South Africans make fun of the way many of them openly
pine for the old days. They're nicknamed Whenwes, as in ``When we
ran Rhodesia. ...''
</P>
<P>
   After Halfway House, the road slowly climbed into an African
version of the Highlands _ craggy peaks dotted with umbrella thorn
trees. We stopped to take pictures and accidentally flushed a tiny
duiker antelope from cover. We were later to see baboons, gnus and
a scrofulous-looking luncheon party of vultures shouldering each
other aside for the best bits of a cow that had been hit by a car.
You don't see that in Scotland much.
</P>
<P>
   Africa is generally a continent without kitsch, but we saw tiny
indications that the locals were playing along with this Highlands
fling _ there was an estate named Bonny Doon, of course, and one
sign advertising trout fishing ``in our loch.''
</P>
<P>
   Our destination was what my Lonely Planet guidebook had called
``the lovely Troutbeck Inn.'' It was built in 1950 by a Maj. Robert
McIlwaine, who missed the hills of his native Ireland (OK, close)
and did his best to imitate them, building dams to create five
lakes and planting forests of pines. His long, low hotel was built
into a grass-covered hillside above two lakes.
</P>
<P>
   We got in at dusk. The front hall's log fire beneath a portrait
of the late major with his fly rod has been burning continuously
since 1950, no matter what the weather or state of the liberation
wars. ``If it goes out,'' the receptionist said, ``someone gets
fired.''
</P>
<P>
   We made our way past a cozy bar decorated with framed flies,
then down green-and-white halls hung with fox-hunting prints and
stuffed trout _ the biggest a 6-pound-8-ounce rainbow. Our
comfortable rooms had big double beds, big satellite televisions
and big glass doors opening onto the lawn-bowling green and the
lake. Each veranda had two chairs and a boot-scraper for clearing
the mud from one's insteps.
</P>
<P>
   Under a sky speckled with shooting stars and faint satellites,
we walked to the lake, which Robert pronounced perfect. It was
punctuated with thin wood jetties that, he explained, gave one the
height to cast far out and keep the backcast from tangling in the
reeds. A few small, worn rowboats lined the bank.
</P>
<P>
   We went in to dinner. The fixed-price menu had a vegetarian
choice and two meat dishes. I thought the hotel could use a new
chef less devoted to old-fashioned British bland, but he may know
his audience. My roast beef, for example, came with a nice
miniature Yorkshire pudding, but was cooked nearly gray and the
horseradish sauce didn't bite. (Looking back, this was to prove an
omen.)
</P>
<P>
   The service was gracious and well-meaning, but confused. The
headwaiter kept taking us to an oddly shaped rear table, the only
one set for three, until we asked if he could let us take one for
four near the window, since the room was empty. He panicked
briefly, then had five waiters reset a used table instead of just
shifting one of the Reserved signs.
</P>
<P>
   When we asked for South African wine _ I only drink Zimbabwean
Mukuyu Red in emergencies _ there was another fire drill. That page
had been removed from the wine list because the currency had fallen
so fast that imports were outrageously cheap.
</P>
<P>
   But after three requests, a waiter went to the bar and brought
back a tray of bottles, which sent the guests who had by now filled
the room into a flurry of waving him over. The poor guy had no idea
what the prices were, but it hardly mattered. Excellent South
African wines rarely cost more than $15.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we hit the jetties at 5. It was already light,
and we resolved to start at 4:30 the next day. But most of the
other guests were there for a golf tournament (another touch of
Scotland), so we were alone, and it was gorgeous. In dawn's glow, a
few fish mouths and a lot of frog mouths dappled the otherwise flat
surface, and the only sounds were those of dabchicks and redknobbed
coots.
</P>
<P>
   The coot defies description; its knobs and white face make it
look like a bug-eyed grasshopper in a baseball cap. The dabchick,
Africa's smallest waterfowl, looks like a fairy godmother
experiment gone wrong: a mouse changed into a duck. It flashes
across the water squeaking like a panicked rodent, while the coot's
call sounds like a baby sneezing into a harmonica. At moments, it
got riotous.
</P>
<P>
   Our competitors were a martial eagle on a tree stump and a gray
heron in the reeds, but they didn't have any more luck than we did.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's fish warden, Shamiso Musenguri, saw me struggling to
cast, put down his clipboard and showed me how to float out line
and then flick it overhand. Robert later said it was a roll cast.
``It's easy, but it messes up the water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal is to keep your fly airborne while paying out 40 feet
of line, and then lay it on the water as gently as a butterfly
alighting on a rose. Some of my early attempts were more like
Refrigerator Perry alighting on a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   I did get one strike, and saw it jump _ a rainbow that I guessed
to be about 40 pounds of fighting demon. Robert said it was
probably just shy of two pounds. In any case, it got away, so we'll
never know who was right.
</P>
<P>
   Robert is the kind of serious fisherman who guts his first catch
immediately to see what it likes to eat, and then checks his flybox
to see if he has anything resembling it.
</P>
<P>
   With the day free, we drove to World View, which offered
stunning mountain vistas and a Scottish-style stone viewing tower.
The nearby Nyanga Park used to be Rhodes Inyanga Park.
</P>
<P>
   There is a populist move afoot to dig up the Colossus' grave in
the Matopo Hills and throw his bones into a river. But Mugabe has
said it will not be disturbed because ``Rhodes still pays his
taxes'' _ that is, the site is a tourist attraction that draws in
hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   We fished again that evening, competing for good spots with
tired golfers. Not a nibble, and a misty cold front blew up the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 the next morning, we felt like fools for rising earlier.
``Real Scottish weather,'' Robert said cheerfully as we shivered, a
cold drizzle running down our necks and the wind blowing our lines
into the bushes so that I spent three minutes untangling for every
one spent casting.
</P>
<P>
   That day we explored the national park, visiting lakes and
500-year-old hilltop stone forts. Foolishly, we had left the rods
behind, because in one clear stream, we found some pools with trout
so eager that they mouthed tiny pebbles we threw in. A fishing
license in the park costs only $1.25, and a comfortable chalet that
sleeps five rents for $11 a night.
</P>
<P>
   We also toured the Mare Dam Trout Research Center, where the
government breeds fish, including strange blue and gold albinos.
That afternoon, done in by two days of 4 a.m. wake-up calls, I fell
asleep. By the time I got to the water, Robert was standing on a
small sandbar looking pleased with himself. ``You missed all the
action,'' he said. He had two nice rainbows.
</P>
<P>
   I kept trying, but no luck. As dark fell, I walked along the dam
wall. Just below was a small hatchery where one could hook fish
practically out of a bathtub for $1.40 each. I was tempted, but I
have my pride. After all, this is supposed to be a Zen art, one
whose aim is perfection, not dinner.
</P>
<P>
   After another dinner _ at which I learned I like store-bought
trout better because it tastes less like lake bottom _ we resolved
to sleep in if the weather stayed Caledonian. It did, so we lagged
until 6:30. Almost immediately, Robert caught another, even bigger
trout. I congratulated him through clenched teeth.
</P>
<P>
   He let it go, graciously saying it was about the same size as
the one that got away from me. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Driving is the easiest way to reach the Nyangas. Avis and Budget
have outlets at the Harare airport and downtown. Zimbabwe's roads
are good but there are lots of speed traps and lots of loose cows.
If you hit either, be ready to pay on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Troutbeck Inn, Private Bag 2000, Nyanga, Zimbabwe, has 70
rooms, all facing the lake. Besides fishing, it offers golf,
tennis, sailing, mountain biking, swimming, horseback riding, lawn
bowling and volleyball. Rods can be rented for about $1.50 a day
(at the rate of 37 Zimbabwe dollars to the United States dollar).
</P>
<P>
   Room rates, which include breakfast, are $63 a person in
doubles, $101 for singles. Phone (263) 298-305 or (263) 298-880,
fax (263) 298-474. It may be easier to make reservations through
the Zimbawe Sun hotels office in Johannesburg, (27-11) 886-2130,
fax (27-11) 886-3432.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow Nyanga Lodge, Private Bag 2056, Nyanga, Zimbabwe, Cecil
Rhodes' old summer house inside Nyanga National Park (some signs
still call it the Rhodes Nyanga Hotel), is set in a pretty,
flower-filled garden and near the park's trout-stocked lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Modest compared to his estates in South Africa, the 24-room
hotel has a museum of local history and some of his furniture in
the former stables, including his very narrow, bed. Rooms cost $84,
with breakfast, single or double. Two suites are $110 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Park activities include fishing and walks (the park has various
antelope species, but no big predators, elephants or crocodiles).
The park is full of fascinating ruins of the now-vanished Nyana
people _ circular stone forts atop hills, deep stone-lined pits
that date from the 1500s. Golf or horse riding can be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's phone number is (263) 298-376, fax (263) 268-477,
but reservations should be made through Rainbow Tourism in Harare,
(263-4) 733-775 through -779.
</P>
<P>
   Nyanga National Park Chalets are comfortable, basic lodgings
with electricity and hot water, wood stoves and barbecue pits. They
are next to several very pretty lakes in the park and fishing is
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   A chalet sleeping three rents for $6 a night, one that sleeps
six $11. There is no restaurant, so you need to bring your own food
or go to the Rainbow Lodge to eat. Reservations: (263) 298-274, fax
(263) 298-778.
</P>
<P>
   Park admission is $2.70. Fishing licenses are $1.10 or $1.60 a
day (four or five fish limit depending on the lake). Rods can be
rented for $1.35 a day. Fishing is legal year-round, but some lakes
close periodically. The best months are June to August, and October
to early November. Late November and December can be very rainy.

   A Boston Globe article about psychiatric research misstated the
order of two sentences on a consent form used in a study at the
University of California-Los Angeles, and the time frame during
which a patient there went without being seen by a physician for a
year. The correct order of the sentences is: ``I understand that
because of the withdrawal of active medication, I may become worse
during this study and that either a relapse of my initial symptoms
or new symptoms may occur. &UR;  &LR; ... I understand that my condition may
improve, worsen or remain unchanged from participation in this
study.'' Antonio LaMadrid was not seen by a physician between
November 1989 and December 1990, but a doctor did see him in the
months before he committed suicide in March 1991.

 &HT;    Netscape, AOL deal could revolutionize InternetBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The proposed America Online/Netscape deal has the
potential to permanently change the face of the Internet industry
and create a company uniquely suited to compete against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, the nation's largest online service, said it is negotiating
to buy Internet browser maker Netscape for about $4 billion in
stock to create a more powerful competitor with great reach across
the Internet industry. As part of the deal, AOL also is talking to
Sun Microsystems about a marketing and development agreement with
Netscape's electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape said AOL would exchange 0.45 share for each Netscape
share, valuing Netscape at $38.19, a 40 percent premium to its Nov.
13 close. Both stocks rose in Monday's trading signaling the
market's favorable outlook on the proposed deal. AOL traded most of
Monday in the high-$80s, making the deal worth between $3.8 billion
and $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, AOL also is talking to Sun Microsystems
Inc. about a marketing and development agreement involving Netscape
for electronic commerce and Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say if the deal goes through, AOL becomes a direct
competitor with Microsoft's internet business. Microsoft's lawyers
in the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against the
software giant said the proposed undermines the government's case
because it vividly demonstrates competition is present in the
industry. But the government's lawyers and some experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the AOL and Netscape combination were to reduce
Microsoft's market share of Internet browsing, ``(Microsoft still
has) the operating system,'' which is on 85 percent of all personal
computers said John Gardner, a policy analyst for Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co.'s Washington Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   If AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. produce a successful
operating system based on the Java programming language, Gardner
said, ``looking way forward . . . that would be real competition.''
Sun and Netscape have been trying to exploit Sun's Java ``computer
language'' technology to compete effectively with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   With 14 million subscribers and 20 million users, AOL is the
only online service that still continues to grow. AOL has always
been far ahead of its competition when it comes to online contents,
chat and shopping. Microsoft's online service has about 1.85
million users, according to Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   However AOL has never spent much time refining its Internet
gateway. Unlike the rest of the service, it's internet area has
always been clunky and clumsy, a far cry from its hallmark
intuitive interface.
</P>
<P>
   AOL now uses Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. As part of a
deal struck with Microsoft to use its browser, the blue and white
AOL icon pops up on the Microsoft desk when users launch the
Windows operating system. Users also have the option to download
the Netscape browser by using the key word Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   While portal wars have heated up around it, AOL has never
appeared to be interested becoming a ``portal player'' even though
the Web site AOL.com is considered a portal by Web measurement firm
Media Metrix. AOL frequently turns up at the top of Media Metrix's
list of most viewed Web sites along with Yahoo. In figures released
by Media Metrix Monday, Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft ranked as the top
three sites on the Web. Netscape's portal, Netcenter, was fifth. A
portal is a Website that provides a variety of services including
Web searching, news, white and yellow pages directories, free
e-mail, and links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Levy, founder of Atlanta-based Web measurement firm
Relevant Knowledge, now vice chairman of Media Metrix confirms that
the Web reach of an AOL/Netscape merger would be incredible.
``Seventy per cent of people online go to at AOL or Netscape at
least once in the course of a month, and that's a huge number.'' He
says a combined AOL/Netscape portal site would ``be by far the
largest consolidated domain on the Internet in our rankings. It
would push them ahead of Yahoo and make them the clear number
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Charron of Forrester Research says both AOL and Netscape
would benefit from the merger. ``AOL gets additional traffic,
advertising dollars and they get a browser,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Charron says AOL is essentially buying Netscape for its browser
and the Netcenter portal site, and its e-commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   In its current incarnation, AOL is both an access provider as
well as a media company. ``They've been the only ones to create a
company that has both access and content,'' Charron says. The
acquisition of Netscape will bring in additional advertising
eyeballs (some 35 million people have Netcenter, Netscape's start
page as their default homepage) as well as additional transaction
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape deal will also accelerate AOL's evolution into a
content player rather than an access provider. It would gradually
rely less on its subscription base as its main source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   As for Netscape, Charron says the potential deal offers its
portal site, Netcenter, a strong media partner and an international
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a graceful exit strategy for Netscape,'' Charron
says. ``They were in two businesses, software and media. They are
very different and can be difficult to succeed in for any one
company. Netscape was torn a little bit between both of those
business. This this gives them the opportunity to join with AOL, a
very strong media partner with very deep pockets. ''
</P>
<P>
   Through the deal Sun Microsystems Inc. would take control of
Netscape's business-level ``server'' software and, in return, AOL
would buy Sun's powerful workstation computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun is dying to get into the software business, so owning
Netscape's software business would increase their ability to get
into that market,'' said Stan Dohlberg, a consultant at Forrester
Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems would also gain a platform to foster the
implementation of its Java software which works on any computer.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say the potential deal is a pre-emptive
strike against the Microsoft Network which is planning its fourth
relaunch. AOL founder Steve Case is likely hoping the Netscape deal
will help build defenses against expected onslaughts from the
retooled Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   A concern that is well placed, says Mark Mooradian, senior
analyst at Jupiter Communications. `` You always have to be worried
with Microsoft. Anybody with that much cash trying to get into your
space is cause for concern. You've got to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is at least the fourth go-round for MSN at launching a
commercial online service and they are continuing to get better at
it. Is (the AOL/Netscape deal) a play against that? Yes. Is AOL
worried about that? Yes. I think that kind of thing is at the
forefront of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   MSN's new model competes more with Yahoo and AOL's Web site than
with the online service, Mooradian says but adds that the move to
buy Netcenter is an effort to capture more of the Web audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Charron says that should the deal go through it
would be a good move for both companies. `` It really will pose a
threat to Microsoft and Yahoo,'' he says. ``MSN is not yet a
portal, they are in the process of becoming a portal, but they have
too many assets to ignore. MSN will be a formidable competitor in
the portal wars, and Yahoo is left without a browser or a browser
partner,'' Charron says. ``But their position is that they probably
don't need one. I think the deal would strengthen AOL and is
further evidence of the consolidation we are going to see in this
space. ``

 &HT;    Masters tournament to change traditions
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A word not often associated with the Augusta National Golf Club
_ change _ is applicable once again.
</P>
<P>
   First, the club this summer altered four holes, adding 60 yards
to the course and putting more of a demand on accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Augusta National has taken another step under new chairman
Hootie Johnson, significantly revising its stipulations for
invitation to the season's first major. Three of the changes will
be effective for the 1999 Masters; the rest begin with the 2000
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Changes for the 1999 Masters include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The top 50 players from the World Golf Rankings at the end of
the calendar year will qualify, if they aren't otherwise in the
field. Those players in the top 50 four weeks before the Masters
also will qualify.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty players from the previous year's PGA Tour money list
will qualify, up from 30. Also, the three leaders on the current
money list, if not otherwise qualified, will be invited.
</P>
<P>
   _ The winner of the Players Championship will receive a
three-year exemption, instead of one.
</P>
<P>
   Additional changes beginning with the 2000 Masters:
</P>
<P>
   _ Winners from a PGA Tour co-sponsored event no longer will
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   _ The top four from the British Open, including ties, will
qualify. Previously, only the winner was invited to the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   _ The top 16 from the previous Masters will qualify, down from
24 .
</P>
<P>
   _ The top eight from the U.S. Open, down from 16, will qualify.
</P>
<P>
   _ The top four, including ties, from the PGA Championship, down
from eight, will qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are bold ones for the Masters, which has been
criticized for having an outdated qualification process. Although
current rules, which invite the U.S. Amateur runner-up, the
Mid-Amateur champion and the Public Links champion still apply, the
changes should increase the quality and size of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our existing qualification system has served us well,''
Johnson said. ``We think, however, our new methodology better
reflects the changes in golf and will ensure that the best players
worldwide are invited to the Masters each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Masters tournament committee will continue to invite any
international players it so chooses, if not otherwise qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new qualifications for 1999, Greg Norman, currently
No. 15 in the world after recovering from shoulder surgery,
automatically qualifies.

 &HT;    Lowes knows expansion, will buy Eagle
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse has strengthened its expansion
in the Western United States by agreeing to buy Eagle Hardware &AMP;
Gardens Inc. for $1 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated deal allows Lowes to pick up Eagle's 32
stores in nine Western states, with estimated 1998 sales of about
$1 billion. North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's operates the bulk
of its 465 stores in the Southeast and is the country's
second-largest home improvement retailer with estimated 1998 sales
of more than $12 billion. Atlanta-based Home Depot is No. 1 with
1998 estimated sales of $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's will pay $29 for each of Eagle's 34.5 million fully
diluted shares. The acquisition is expected to add ``modestly'' to
Lowe's fiscal 1999 earnings, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition doesn't tame Lowe's earlier plans to open 100
stores over the next three to four years in southern California,
Arizona and Nevada, said Lowe's Chairman and Chief Executive Bob
Tillman. With Eagle under its belt, Lowe's can jump-start its
Western competition with Atlanta-based Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has 150 of its total 724 stores in the Western United
States, and it has no plans to bump up its expansion plans based on
the Lowe's deal, said spokesman Jerry Shields. Home Depot plans to
double its store count in its Western division by the end of fiscal
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Renton, Wash.-based Eagle operates ``big-box'' stores similar in
size to Home Depot in Washington, Utah, Colorado, Hawaii, Alaska,
California, Idaho, Montana and Oregon. More than two-thirds of
Eagle stores compete in Home Depot markets.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle President and Chief Operating Officer Richard Takata will
retain his position after the acquisition in a separate division.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's closed at $41.25 Monday, up $1.68 3/4.

EUROPEAN UNION LIFTS BAN ON BRITISH BEEF EXPORTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The European Union voted Monday to lift its
32-month-old worldwide ban on Britain's beef exports, saying that
the country had finally put sufficient measures in place to halt
the spread of ``mad cow disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed the decision as ``genuinely
good news for farmers and British agriculture,'' although the first
resumed exports are not expected to leave Britain's shores until
March because of final safety inspections and other required steps.
And it will be years, if ever, before the British cattlemen reclaim
their lost markets.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Davies, a founder of the Great Beef Campaign, a group
formed to lobby specifically to lift the ban and that numbers Blair
among its signatories, said Monday's action in Brussels
nevertheless would be ``a great psychological boost for farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will signal things are beginning to turn for them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was imposed in March, 1996, after evidence emerged of a
possible link between mad cow disease, known formally as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, and the fatal degenerative
Creutzfeldt-Jakob brain disease that affects humans.
</P>
<P>
   The plan the European Union farm ministers approved Monday will
end export restrictions on deboned beef from cattle ages 6 to 30
months. The animals would have to have been born after August,
1996, when a potentially contaminated cattle feed from animal
remains, the suspected cause of the outbreak of the disease, was
removed from farms and feed mills.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty people have died of the disease, farm and livestock
businesses have gone bankrupt and political reputations have
suffered in the dispute over the European ban on British beef,
which led to increasing antagonism between Britain and its European
allies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the prime minister, John Major, briefly insisted on a
policy of noncooperation with Europe over its failure to remove the
ban. And his agriculture minister, Douglas Hogg, refused the
summons of the European Parliament in Strasbourg to discuss the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the problem deepened the Major government's
reputation for drift while in Europe it played on longtime
continental resentment of Britain as aloof and arrogant. It seemed
an improbable symbol of Britain's weakness in an emboldened Europe
since red meat is such a symbol of nationhood that the British were
once lampooned in France as ``les rosbifs.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday only Germany refused to back an end of the ban, with
Austria, France, Luxembourg and Spain abstaining. Nine countries
joined Britain in approving the move.
</P>
<P>
   Over the nearly three years of the crisis, the worse in European
agriculture since the creation of the union, more than 2.6 million
head of cattle were slaughtered in Britain in an effort to overcome
consumer fears about mad cow disease, and new rigorous hygiene
procedures were installed, particularly in slaughterhouses. Methods
of keeping track of meat from the birth of calves until their
slaughter _ in effect providing each animal a passport _ have been
put in place.
</P>
<P>
   European Union veterinary chiefs gave the system their approval
earlier this month. That led Frans Fischler, Europe's agriculture
commissioner, whose agency imposed the original ban, to say before
Monday's meeting, ``We have the backing from scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said, ``We have done
what we were asked to do and can justify Britain's position on the
basis of science and technical implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Britain had agreed to one further cull _ the
slaughter of 4,000 offspring born after Aug. 1, 1996, to mothers
infected with the virulent disease.
</P>
<P>
   The final step, considered a formality after Monday's vote, is
for a team of European Union inspectors to come to Britain to
certify that all the safety standards are in place. Brown said he
hoped that would take place within two months.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the British taxpayers to shore up failing businesses
and recompense farmers and slaughterhouses is expected to reach $6
billion by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures show that the incidence of mad cow disease
now stands at 1,799 cases in the United Kingdom so far this year
compared with a peak of 36,682 cases in all of 1993. The volume of
beef consumption at home has returned to levels existing before
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of regaining consumer confidence and recapturing
lost markets is evident from the experience of Northern Ireland,
which succeeded in having the ban on its exports removed in June.
Meat companies there report sluggish activity, with exports
reaching only one sixth of their pre-ban levels.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland was entitled to an early easing of European
restrictions because, as a security measure against cross border
raids and poaching, the province put into effect years ago a
computer-based tracking system for its herds that is now being
installed throughout Britain to meet the European demands.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ban is formally lifted, Britain's Meat and Livestock
Commission will send tens of thousands of promotional leaflets in
major European languages to importers, caterers and other customers
to try to persuade them to restock their shelves with British beef.
Phil Saunders, the government-based group's spokesman, said the
mission would be to ``bring everyone back up to date with the news
on British beef.''
</P>
<P>
   A National Farmers Union spokesman said, ``After almost three
years we are well aware that people have had to find their supplies
of beef from elsewhere. The job ahead is to get them to start
buying British beef again.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 Downing Street, Blair said, ``It is a piece of genuinely
good news for farmers and British agriculture, which has suffered
hugely as a result of BSE.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting beef sales back to where they were will take time and
further effort, and the government will now work to insure that we
can implement the scheme as quickly as possible and rebuild
confidence in British beef.''

NEWLY ILL, YELTSIN RECEIVES CHINESE LEADER IN HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After six weeks of labored effort to rebound from
bronchitis, most of it spent at resorts and dachas far from the
Kremlin levers of power, President Boris Yeltsin developed a high
fever and pneumonia on Sunday and spent Monday in Moscow's best
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring doctors' advice, as he often does, Yeltsin summoned
China's president, Jiang Zemin, to his suite at Moscow's Central
Clinical Hospital for a long-scheduled state visit. Russian
television broadcast silent film of the two men in conversation,
Yeltsin gesticulating forcefully, but looking wan in a black
cardigan sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion lasted 30 minutes, half of what was planned.
Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin called it ``a good working
meeting,'' and said the two men talked about international affairs
and prospects for a strategic alliance between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward how Yeltsin is feeling, Jiang said simply,
``Okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin hinted that not everyone agreed with that diagnosis.
``Doctors were not too excited about his meeting with the head of
the Chinese state today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is Yeltsin's fifth stay in a medical clinic _ and his
second bout with pneumonia _ since bypass heart surgery two years
ago which was supposed to restore him to robust health.
</P>
<P>
   Lately Yeltsin has had to struggle almost visibly with his
increasing irrelevance in daily affairs. A growing number of
federal legislators have called on the president to resign and make
way for new elections. Yeltsin insists he will remain in office
until his term expires in 2000, and on Monday he said he does not
intend to allow his frailty to loosen his grip any further on the
nation's top office, which gives him sweeping constitutional powers
and control of Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But political commentators talk of a ``creeping coup'' in which
Yeltsin gradually fades away and his rivals take control, and late
last month, senior aides said baldly that the president planned to
let Primakov run things while he turned his attention to
constitutional reform and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Yeltsin is in fact okay as Jiang claimed was hard to
tell. The 67-year-old president entered the hospital after spending
Sunday at his country residence with a fever as high as 102
degrees. Aides said he is being treated with antibiotics and bed
rest. Yakushkin assured reporters early in the day that Yeltsin's
temperature had vanished. But hours later, he said Yeltsin had
again developed a low fever and was neither better nor worse than
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Why Yeltsin became sick is anyone's guess. He has seemed
increasingly susceptible to lung infections in recent years, but
observers say he sometimes displays other symptoms of illness,
including trembling, inability to concentrate and difficulty
walking. On Monday Yakushkin speculated that the president became
ill out of grief over the murder of Galina Starovoitova, a
pro-democracy legislator and former Yeltsin adviser who was gunned
down last weekend in St. Petersburg. Her death has become a cause
celebre here among politicians and citizens alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a person he knew well, he worked together with,''
Yakushkin said, ``so he took the news to his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Pneumonia patients normally remain in the hospital eight to 10
days, Yakushkin said. He added that Yeltsin will stay as long as is
needed to recover completely.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin already had relapsed once during this six-week
recuperation from bronchitis, which began during a trip to
Uzbekistan on October 11. After two weeks under doctors' orders to
rest _ a prescription to which Yeltsin only partly hewed _ aides
said on October 23 that the president was ready for a trip the next
week to Vienna for a meeting with the president of the European
Union. But within days, Yeltsin was sick again, this time with what
doctors called physical and nervous exhaustion, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov was sent in his stead.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has been largely away from the
Kremlin, resting at a fully equipped medical center in the Barvikha
sanatorium outside Moscow, at a Black Sea resort or at his two
country homes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yeltsin has held meetings with foreign leaders,
including Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan, Primakov has effectively run the
government.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Primakov was issuing statements that were
simultaneously soothing and unnerving. Russia, he said, does not
plan to declare a state of emergency or take any steps that may
``lead to dictatorial aspects in government'' in response to a
rising tide of political violence and anti-Semitism. But
law-enforcement agencies must move to assure an orderly transition
to new elections which, he said, ``I hope will be held in 2000,''
perhaps a slip of the tongue reflecting the uncertainty surrounding
Russian politics these days.
</P>
<P>
   Russia at large seems to have become inured to the incapacity of
its elected leader. Yeltsin's illness did not lead some evening
newscasts here. The Moscow stock market, which adjusted months ago
to Yeltsin's wobbly health, showed no alarm at the news Monday and
actually ticked upward slightly.

 &HT;    AT MICROSOFT ANTITRUST TRIAL, MEANING OF AOL DEAL IS DEBATED
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp.'s lead antitrust attorney said
Monday that the possibility of a $4 billion merger between America
Online Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. ``pulls the rug out''
from under the government's claim that the software giant has
monopoly dominance of the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal would dramatically change the landscape of the
industry,'' Bill Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, told
reporters before Monday's session of the historic antitrust case
brought by the Justice Department. ``And it demonstrates a simple
truth, that there is vigorous competition in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   But government attorneys, led by chief counsel David Boies, were
quick to dispute talk that the deal undercuts their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether there's a deal or there isn't,'' Boies said, ``it
isn't going to erase the obstacles that have been put in the path
of competition by Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned union of AOL and Netscape would create a single
Internet powerhouse with reach across technology markets and the
possible clout to challenge Microsoft in key areas, including the
jackpots of Internet access _ browsers and portal sites.
</P>
<P>
   Another Microsoft rival, Sun Microsystems Inc., reportedly is in
on the deal too.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has been salivating to expand into the software business,
and the AOL-Netscape deal would quickly do that by granting it
control of Netscape's business-level ``server'' software.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies have testified for the government against
Microsoft in the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Under a contract that expires in January, Microsoft has agreed
to put AOL's icon on its Windows desktop as a potential internet
service provider (ISP). In exchange, AOL has agreed to favor
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser in its software for 14
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, AOL officials have said they expect to continue that
relationship because the Windows real estate is so critical to
their distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would continue to use the Microsoft browser'' even if
they owned the competitor Netscape, Boies said. That makes his
point, Boies said, that AOL needs to do business with Microsoft
because of its dominant 90 percent market share in the operating
system market.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the federal courthouse, as the trial entered its sixth
week, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara continued his
cross-examination of Frederick Warren-Boulton, an economic expert
called by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara spent the day trying to chip away at Warren-Boulton's
assertion that Microsoft enjoys monopoly status and that it has
raised prices of Windows by a significant amount above competitive
levels.
</P>
<P>
   He systematically asked Warren-Boulton to acknowledge or comment
on competition, ranging from Netscape's estimated 50 percent share
of the browser market to the flood of new applications being
written to run on Apple Computer's iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Lacovara couldn't resist from asking the witness
about the Netscape-AOL talks that dominated the day's headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does this tell you about the nature of competition in the
software market?'' asked the Lacovara, clearly trying to elicit
testimony that it was robust.
</P>
<P>
   But Warren-Boulton adroitly responded that his first thoughts
over breakfast were: ``Netscape has been forced to the wall ...This
is the unfortunate result of what Microsoft has been doing.''

 &HT;    Chandler 'doubtful' against Rams; Reeves criticizes officials
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons settled into wait-and-see mode
Monday on quarterback Chris Chandler, who needed the help of two
trainers to leave Sunday's 20-13 win over the Chicago Bears with a
sprained right ankle and knee.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said he expects to play Sunday at St. Louis, but coach
Dan Reeves said, ``If Chris practices at all this week, it probably
won't be until Thursday. I would have to say he's doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler wore a removable cast Monday to immobilize his high
ankle sprain, which is more serious than the knee injury. The ankle
has not had much swelling, but the injury is in an area that causes
great pain _ on the outside, just above the protruding bone. ``It's
sore,'' he said. ``But it's still early.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's condition is a big issue for the Falcons. Atlanta
(9-2) leads lead San Francisco (8-3) in the NFC West, but a loss to
a division opponent such as the Rams could leave the 49ers with a
tiebreaker edge if the teams finish with identical records. Each
team is 5-1 in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is 14-4 in games Chandlers starts and finishes and 2-7
otherwise. He is third in the NFC with a 93.2 passer rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sprain where the fibula connects with the tibia,''
trainer Ron Medlin. ``The pain is caused by strained ligaments.
It's day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has swelling, we'll try to slow that down (with ice and)
electrical current,'' Medlin said. ``Nothing really speeds up
healing, per se. We're trying to get the body to accommodate (the
healing process) quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler threw two touchdown passes Sunday to help Atlanta rally
from a 13-3 deficit. He was injured in the fourth quarter when
center Robbie Tobeck flinched and drew a false-start penalty, and
defensive tackle Mike Wells tackled Chandler, bending his leg
beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will send a tape of the play to the NFL office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Wells) could have stopped.'' Reeves said. ``I don't
see it as being flagrant, but I think the officials did a poor job.
We're sending it in strictly to see what their interpretation is.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he doesn't know whether Steve DeBerg or Tony
Graziani would start if Chandler can't play. When Chandler missed a
28-3 loss to the Jets on Oct. 18, DeBerg started, but Graziani
played most of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also are concerned about fullback Bob Christian, one
of the NFL's top blocking backs and an important part of the
passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Sunday, Christian aggravated a lingering injury to a band
of nerves in his neck and shoulder, causing numbness in his right
arm. He is not expected to practice Wednesday and might not
practice at all this week.

STUDENT VANISHED WITHOUT A TRACE

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ A thin layer of dust covers the dresser that
holds Kristin Smart's T-shirts and jeans _ the fine powder blankets
the top of a teddy bear, a doll, the red cap she wore as a
lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two years and five months since anyone saw Kristin.
The 19-year-old college freshman disappeared after she left a
fraternity party at the California Polytechnic State University at
San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   Since that moment, her parents, Stan and Denise Smart, have
searched the campus long after the police stopped doing so. Their
journey of grief, confusion and frustration is not unlike that of
untold other parents who have missing children. But their story has
a cruel and unusual twist.
</P>
<P>
   They believe they know who is responsible for her disappearance.
They have studied his face, tracked him from job to job, besieged
his family with letters, sued him and learned more about this man
than they ever thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Paul Flores, and the police say he is their only
suspect. But as yet there is no hard evidence, no weapon, no body.
Kristin Smart vanished, apparently leaving no clues behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like having an open wound and having someone
continually pouring salt in it,'' Denise Smart said, her voice
faltering. ``Having a missing child is just not something that gets
better over time. It's another dimension, and it just can't heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually from the beginning, Flores, his parents, his aunt and
his sister have all refused to discuss the case, and they declined
to respond to requests for comment for this story. Flores' former
lawyer, Greg Coates, would not comment other than to say there were
``no facts to indicate that Paul had anything to do with the
disappearance of Kristin Smart.''
</P>
<P>
   So the story has been left largely to the Smarts to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin was last seen alive on May 25, 1996, around 2 a.m. as
she and Cheryl Anderson, another student, left a party to return to
their dorm rooms. A fellow student, Flores, then 19, offered to
walk with them, according to a search warrant affidavit. Friends
said Kristin appeared intoxicated that night. She and Flores had
talked during the party.
</P>
<P>
   As Anderson turned to her dorm building, Flores, who lived in an
adjacent building, assured her he would see Kristin safely home,
the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin never got there.
</P>
<P>
   Flores gave two brief statements to the campus police in the
days immediately after Kristin vanished. He said they had parted
ways as they approached their respective dorms. For four weeks, the
campus police treated her disappearance as a missing persons case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first contacted us, like any parent, I was
frustrated to think that she'd done something embarrassing,''
recalled Stan Smart, a principal at Vintage High School in Napa.
But with each passing day, her parents' fear grew.
</P>
<P>
   The first two times the police approached Flores about Kristin's
disappearance, he answered their questions.
</P>
<P>
   According to police records, Flores had a black eye the morning
after Kristin disappeared. First, he told the police he got the
black eye during a basketball game. Then he said he got it fixing
his car. Later, he told friends that he had made up the basketball
story because he thought it would ``sound stupid'' if he told the
police he didn't know how he'd gotten the black eye, the affidavit
said.
</P>
<P>
   After those interviews, Flores refused to talk with deputies
again and, when called before a grand jury, entered and left the
room within five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, San Luis Obispo County sheriff's deputies
searched the campus with three dogs trained to detect the scent of
human remains.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs led investigators to Flores' dorm room, to his
mattress. But no evidence was found at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of inconsistencies in his activities, or claimed
activities during that period, we believe he has further knowledge
about what happened, and he is a suspect in her disappearance,''
said Sgt. Bill Wammock of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a frustrating case for us, for the parents, for
the press,'' Wammock noted, ``because we don't have an answer to
what happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, Stan and Denise Smart have tried to
pressure Flores into talking about the case.
</P>
<P>
   From their Stockton home, where a file cabinet in Kristin's room
is stuffed with police documents, legal paperwork and folders of
newspaper articles, they have sent photo collages of their
firstborn daughter to Flores' parents, grandparents and other
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Each packet has been opened and returned to the Smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Flores left school within months of Kristin's disappearance.
Private detectives volunteering for the Smarts have tracked him to
Southern California, where he now lives. Denise Smart said she and
her husband wanted him to know someone is watching him; they said
they did not want him to hurt anyone else. And, she said, they are
frustrated that he is ``living footloose and fancy free'' while
their lives are frozen in time.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Stan and Denise Smart visited Flores at a Central
California gas station where he was working, hoping to plead with
the young man. They said Flores refused to talk with them.
</P>
<P>
   They have traced him to other jobs. The Navy refused to allow
him to enlist after learning about the Smart case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the Smarts sued Flores for wrongful death, hoping to get
evidence in civil court, but there, too, Flores invoked his
constitutional right not to testify against himself. The Smarts
dropped the case, but say they may refile if evidence emerges.
</P>
<P>
   For all the pain she believes Paul Flores has caused her family,
Denise Smart said, she also believes he is the only person who can
help them find Kristin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not after Paul Flores; we're not trying to persecute
Paul Flores. We're after our daughter. We only want our daughter
back.''

CHILD ABUSE-ARIZONA (Undated) - Thirteen-year-old Andy wore two or
three pairs of underwear under his jeans and slept fully dressed in
the months after he got home from spending half a year in foster
care. Now 14, Andy averts his eyes when he talks about what
happened to him in that shelter in Mesa in late 1996 and 1997. Andy
was taken from his mother because child welfare officials said
their house was too filthy. `Basically,'' the boy says, sinking
down in a cushioned chair in his mother's office, ``I was raped.''
As many as 250 Arizona children were sexually abused while in
foster care over a decade, according to a lawsuit filed in Tucson

provide $76 million for the dilapidated Arizona State Hospital and
$12 million for construction of rural clinics and community health

surely the Valley has become a national hot spot for, of all

But now, I'm seeing pigs flying (no double entendre intended).
Phoenix police want to lead local law enforcement into an age of

BRITISH DEAL WOULD CREATE ENGINEERING GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a deal that would create the world's largest maker
of industrial controls and automation equipment, Siebe PLC of
Britain announced Monday that it would buy a rival engineering
company, BTR PLC, in a 3.7 billion pounds, or $6.13 billion, stock
swap.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is one of the biggest in 18 months of
acquisitions among British engineering concerns _ a sign of
pressures from a globalized industry clamoring for lower
development costs, broader product ranges and economies of scale.
``The engineering market is consolidating on a global basis,'' said
Robert Speed, director of research at Henderson Crosthwaite
Institutional Brokers.
</P>
<P>
   With cuts of about 5,000 jobs, or 4 percent of the combined
125,000-person work force, the two companies said the deal would
create annual savings of 250 million pounds within three years. On
the London market, the announcement of the deal pushed BTR stock up
almost 38 percent, and Siebe rose 13 percent despite earlier
worries about its vulnerability to global economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Siebe shareholders will receive 55 percent of the stock in the
new company, BTR Siebe, and BTR shareholders will get the rest. BTR
stockholders will receive 0.533 share in the new company for each
of their current shares. Owners of Siebe will retain their shares
in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the deal, which is subject to stockholders' and
regulators' approval, was calculated on the share price of the two
companies when the markets closed on Friday. BTR shares were at
95.5 pence, compared with a 1998 high of 2.31 pounds in May, while
Siebe shares were priced at 2.1425 pounds, compared with 3.83
pounds in May, giving a combined market capitalization of 7.6
billion pounds, or $12.6 billion. The combined annual sales of the
two companies are 8.7 billion pounds, or $14.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal brings together two venerable companies that have
worldwide operations. Only 20 percent of the assets of either are
situated in Britain, Speed said. BTR grew from a manufacturer of
waterproof clothing founded in 1798, and its waterproofing skills
enabled it to profit from the production of submarine cables in the
19th century. It now operates in 40 countries, manufacturing valves
and meters, motors and power-transmission components, sealing and
anti-vibration systems for the automotive industry and other
engineering products.
</P>
<P>
   Siebe was established 180 years ago as a marine-engineering
company whose founder, Augustus Siebe, invented the diving suit.
Much more recently, the company has been known for an aggressive
acquisition strategy under Allen Yurko, its chief executive, who
will become chief executive of the new company. Siebe says most of
its business is in control devices, ranging from power plants for
factories to control devices for household and commercial
appliances like refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Yurko said Monday's deal would give the merged company control
of 10.5 percent of the $110 billion world market in controls and
automation, making it the biggest in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Siebe's chairman, Lord Marshall, will become chairman of BTR
Siebe, and the chief executive of BTR, Ian Strachan, will be deputy
chairman. BTR will also provide the chief financial officer,
Kathleen O'Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we will be significantly more effective in gaining
new business, cutting costs, growing revenue and delivering greater
shareholder value than if we had remained separate organizations,''
Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Strachan said the deal ``makes industrial sense,'' adding, ``BTR
Siebe will be the clear No. 1 worldwide in the high-value-added
controls and automation industry.''
</P>
<P>
   An analyst said Siebe had completed the takeover at a ``minimal
premium'' after BTR shed many of the divisions it acquired earlier
as a conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these sales, it had been seen in recent months as a
likely takeover target as its share price slumped. Timed to
coincide with the merger announcement, Siebe reported a pretax
profit Monday of 254.6 million pounds in the six-month period
ending on Oct. 3, a 13.7 percent increase over 224 million pounds
in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the deal contributed to stock market rises in Europe.

PEARSON CLEARED TO BUY SIMON &AMP; SCHUSTER UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pearson PLC, the British media conglomerate, announced Monday
that it had received federal approval of its $4.6 billion purchase
of the education unit of Simon &AMP; Schuster, but it is moving forward
without a major investor, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, which backed
out of its part of the deal to buy the reference and business
publishing divisions for $860 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Each company gave a slightly different version of why they were
not able to conclude their agreement. Pearson said that Hicks,
Muse, the buyout firm based in Dallas, sought to renegotiate the
``price, financing and timing agreed in the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hicks, Muse issued a one-page statement from London
saying, ``Our ability to finance the transaction has never been at
issue.'' The company then added that the critical point was that
their own research indicated that the reference and professional
divisions had achieved results ``that were not in line with what
had previously been projected.''
</P>
<P>
   Shona Prendergast, a spokeswoman for Hicks, Muse, declined to be
more specific about the company's concerns about results, but she
stressed that ``the figures didn't match up.'' After several weeks
of trying to renegotiate the price, she said, Hicks, Muse decided
to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   A Pearson executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
insisted that the negotiations did, in fact, involve ``how much
they paid, how they paid and when they paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, Muse had planned to buy the divisions that included
Macmillan's computer, general and library reference programs.
Pearson will now merge the computer publishing business into its
technology publishing group. The library reference and business
publishing operations will join the education unit, though a person
involved in the deal said that other companies had expressed
interest in buying them.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust review of the deal by the Department of Justice
had lingered for several months longer than Pearson executives had
originally expected with the company undergoing a more intensive
analysis known as a second-level review.
</P>
<P>
   To gain federal approval, Pearson has to sell its elementary
science program along with 55 titles that gave the division too
much concentration in the market. Pearson intends to sell off
various titles involving engineering, biological science, economics
and teacher education. Together the elementary program and the
titles produced more than $35 million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education division is expected to
be finished by Friday. After the announcement, Pearson's chief
executive, Marjorie Scardino, said, ``The immediate task is to make
the most of these great businesses so that we can create the value
and deliver the earnings we have promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster is a subsidiary of Viacom Inc.

RULES OF GRAMMAR ARE GOING, GOING ... GONE, ALL BUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grammar ain't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, teachers whacked us on the knuckles when our subjects
and verbs didn't match up. College professors shamed us for not
never showing up for class. At least we knew right from wrong back
then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, anything goes. They tell us it's OK to knowingly split
infinitives. They say a preposition is a fine thing to end a
sentence on. And they say we can start a sentence with ``and.''
</P>
<P>
   And even ``but.''
</P>
<P>
   But only if we don't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   Linguists, lexicographers and grammarians disagree on what is
proper grammar these days. We who want to say it right (say it
correctly?) find ourselves tongue-tied by conflicting opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the rules, says ``The Grammar Doctor,'' Sue Coffman.
As a former high school English teacher, former college English
professor and now a Dallas-based writing consultant, Coffman has
guided generations through the rules of grammar.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman says there are two sets of rules _ real and artificial _
and the problem comes because we break them. First, there are real
rules we follow and real rules we break. Then there are artificial
rules. There are some we break and some we don't _ but we should,
Coffman says.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Blame it on your ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial rules that cause the most problems can be traced
to the first grammar guides of the late 18th and early 19th
centuries. The guides came at a time of scientific enlightenment,
when scholars deemed Latin the perfect language.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a time of social upheaval, when the wealthy sought
to separate themselves from the growing lower classes by using
language as a social determinant, says ``The Grammar Lady,'' Helen
Moody, who helps scientists and engineers improve their writing.
</P>
<P>
   A century later, we're stuck with the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Take the split infinitive rule. The rule came when intellectuals
took Latin grammar rules and applied them to English. But Latin
verbs are made of one word, and English verbs are made of two. So
Caesar couldn't split infinitives, but Shakespeare could. To split
or not to split. That is the infinitive.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was surprised when two new Oxford Press dictionaries
recently OK'd it for modern writers to consciously split their
infinitives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've long regarded it like wearing white shoes after Labor
Day,'' she said of the rule. ``If you want to get concerned about
it, of course you can. It's not critical to understanding. It's
mostly a matter of style.''
</P>
<P>
   Society has debated style for 100 years, and Bryan Garner is
amused every time split infinitives make news. He's a Dallas-based
lawyer and author of Oxford's new A Dictionary of Modern American
Usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts in usage have long rallied against these superstitions
as arrant nonsense, yet they retain a firm grip _ if not a
stranglehold _ on the average person's mind when it comes to
writing,'' Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   Take the rule that you never end a sentence with a preposition.
Garner says it came from Latin, when prepositions were the one word
a writer could not end a sentence with.
</P>
<P>
   Garner reminds us that we're talking about English, not Latin.
He cites Winston Churchill's quip about ending a sentence with a
preposition: ``That is the type of arrant pedantry up with which I
shall not put.''
</P>
<P>
   Another artificial rule that stuck with us _ and one that won't
go away _ is the double negative. Coffman says there's no reason we
don't never do that.
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer wrote with double negatives, and nobody harassed him
until an 18th-century minister questioned the logic behind the
construction. The minister asked whether two negatives canceled
each other and made a positive instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why these stick and why they don't, there's no explanation for
it,'' Coffman said. ``It sounded great to 18th-century ears, and
those people tended to be intellectuals and it made logical sense.
But of course, it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody, Coffman and Garner agree that clarity should be the
writer's goal, and they agree that most of the rules that
tongue-tie us are disappearing, slowly. Among those they predict to
fall:
</P>
<P>
   _ The who/whom rule. ``Who'' is the subject and ``whom'' is the
object, but when they are misused, neither affects a sentence's
meaning. For example, ``Who are you going to the movies with?''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule that you can't use ``since'' in the place of
``because.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule that you can never split a verb phrase. Example: ``I
am now going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule that you have to use ``shall'' instead of ``will''
with the subject ``I.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rule that you can't write a one-word sentence paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense!
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   Right.

KIDS ARE BUG-EYED OVER THESE `BUG'S LIFE' TOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so your kids haven't even seen the movie yet. But they're
probably already bugging you about the toys from ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The animated film, opening this week, is a variation on the old
grasshopper-and-ant fable. The lead grasshopper (Hopper, voice by
Kevin Spacey) demands a hefty portion of the ants' harvest (sort of
like an Insect Revenue Service). The humble ant-hero Flik (Dave
Foley of ``NewsRadio'') rounds up a motley crew of bugs to help the
ants confront the grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   This being Disney, opportunities abound for tie-in toys.
</P>
<P>
   But the star? Probably the Electronic Talking Hopper Room Guard.
The oversize plastic grasshopper is a talking toy that you _ uh, we
mean, your kids _ can program to respond to motion. Think of it as
a bug security system. Walk near the thing, and it will spout more
than 40 phrases like, ``Stop! This is grasshopper territory!'' and
``Hey! Welcome back, buddy! Did you bring me my food?'' It's by
Think Way and is about $20 at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   Other early favorites:
</P>
<P>
   _ The cuddly Talking Princess Dot doll says more than 30 phrases
in her smart-alecky young antlette way. Tweak her nose, hand or
tummy for lines like: ``I'm a princess, but you can call me Dot!''
By Mattel, $30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Action Flik moves his head and blinks his eyes while saying 30
different things like, ``Let's kick some grasshopper abdomen!'' By
Mattel, $30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hungarian pill bugs Tuck &AMP; Roll do just that; these bugs tuck
themselves into tight balls. They come with their own spider-webbed
trampoline. By Mattel, price varies.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giant Light-Up Anthill play set is the perfect home for
the complete ``Bug's Life'' line of action figures. Kids can fire
acorns and toadstools at attacking grasshoppers or use the
roller-coaster catapult to bash 'em with berries. By Mattel, $20.
</P>
<P>
   _ In another variation on the talking-doll theme, there's plush
Giggle Dot, who giggles, wiggles and says things like, ``I (giggle,
giggle) guess my nose is sort of ticklish.'' By Mattel, $30.

 &HT;    Biblical scholars groups are no longer 'an old white man's club'
 &HT;    By John Turnbull
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Biblical scholars meeting at Union Theological
Seminary in New York during the 1960s _ in the nation's biggest
city and at a prestigious center of theological learning _ did
little to draw attention to their debates.
</P>
<P>
   The annual gatherings of the Society of Biblical Literature met
between Christmas and New Year's. Participants slept in the
dormitory rooms of students who had left for the holidays. By day
they read papers and preserved a scholarly tradition that seemed to
notice few of the changes occurring in the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an old white man's club,'' said Gene Tucker, a former
biblical society president and Emory professor of Old Testament.
``Those who were young were not expected to speak. . . . The
meeting involved mostly the senior scholars who debated among
themselves and allowed us to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tucker attends his 40th annual meeting, which begins today
in Orlando, he will behold a ``much more complicated stew.'' The
biblical society, founded in 1880, now meets in combination with
the American Academy of Religion, its younger _ and some would say
less tradition-bound _ Atlanta-based counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Together the groups attract 8,000 scholars, graduate students
and publishers to four days of seminars, beginning the weekend
before Thanksgiving. Most of this year's 447 sessions consist of
readings of heavily subtitled papers on topics ranging from today's
discussion of Confucian traditions to Tuesday's meeting of the
``Kierkegaard, Religion and Culture Group.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding flavor to the Orlando gathering is the location at the
Walt Disney World Dolphin and Swan hotels, creating a clash of
which all participants seem aware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in Mickey's kingdom,'' said Kent Richards, executive
director of the biblical society. ``It is a very different place.''
</P>
<P>
   That the societies are meeting in the resort, however, points to
their steady growth and also to an awareness that the potential
audience for their discussions is expanding. Combined membership
stands at more than 15,000, although about 2,500 belong to both
groups. Both societies have boosted their rolls by more than 25
percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the societies moved into the Luce Center, a
granite and glass building on the Emory University(Ga.) campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly our meetings and membership in our organization
is the coin of the realm in the field,'' said Barbara DeConcini,
AAR's executive director. ``If you're a Brit or you're from Eastern
Europe or you're from Japan and you're a professor of religion, if
you're going to go to one meeting a year, this is the one to go to.
Why? It is the largest. It is the most diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando, professors on expense accounts and some with
children in tow will mingle with graduate students trying to
economize.
</P>
<P>
   Loyd Allen, now associate dean of the McAfee School of Theology
at Mercer University, remembers sleeping in a monastery when the
meeting visited Chicago. In Boston he slept on a floor.
</P>
<P>
   'The big circus'
</P>
<P>
   Participants offer several theories to explain how the meeting
has mushroomed into what Richards calls ``the big circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent growth in popular interest in religion, which
has helped make religious publishing a $2 billion industry, many
trace the true origins to the emergence of university religious
studies departments in the 1960s and the subsequent birth of the
AAR. The biblical society underwent a controversial restructuring
and started meeting with the AAR in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Both societies undertake projects to bring their work to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The biblical society, working with HarperCollins publishers, has
helped produce an edition of the Bible, a commentary and
dictionary. In the AAR, a committee devoted to the public
understanding of religion has gained permanent status.
</P>
<P>
   But Richards said that the biblical society, at least, needs to
do more. The society and Scholars Press have plans to begin
publishing a popular magazine on the Bible. The first issue is
planned for late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeing scholars shaping public debate, Walter
Brueggemann, professor of Old Testament at Columbia Theological
Seminary in Decatur, believes that public issues help shape
research. He says that women's liberation movements, for example,
have helped energize feminist interpretations of the Bible and have
brought more women into biblical studies.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Plaskow, the AAR's current president, counted three women
out of 236 participants on the society's program in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Brueggemann and others feel that both the academic fields of
religion and the societies supporting them _ once almost
exclusively white, male and Christian _ have become more
democratic, creating a ``big tent'' in which African-American,
Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay and lesbian, Jewish, Buddhist
and Muslim scholars can find a place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two generations ago you had half a dozen lead figures (in
biblical studies), and everybody knew who they were,'' Brueggemann
said. ``There weren't any others. I think it's much more
democratized now, so that you don't have to be at Yale or Harvard
or Union to be somebody who may be a defining figure in the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Bailey, professor of Old Testament at Atlanta's
</P>
<P>
   Interdenominational Theological Center _ a primarily black
institution _ acknowledges that the situation has improved since
the 1980s, when he was a doctoral student at Emory and says he was
discouraged from asking questions about African influence on the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the societies' efforts to recruit minorities into
advanced degree programs, the number of nonwhites earning Ph.D.s in
religion has only occasionally cracked 10 percent over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is space there _ not much _ but some space in the
(biblical) society for those who want to pursue questions of
African background, African contexts, African-American
interpretation,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four other places in the society where
those types of questions can be pursued, where that kind of
discourse is welcome. To that extent there is some hope. But there
are still significant pockets within the society where such
discourse is not welcome, where in fact it is discouraged.''

 &HT;    Blood 'N Fire needs volunteers
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Unlike other charitable groups planning Thanksgiving
Day meals, the non-denominational Blood 'N Fire Ministries is still
seeking help.
</P>
<P>
   Most other organizations have already filled their volunteer
needs and are discouraging would-be volunteers from showing up
unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hosea Williams, who plans to serve 30,000 people at his
Feed the Hungry Dinner at Turner Field in Atlanta, says last-minute
volunteers should call first (404-222-9999) to see whether their
services are needed.
</P>
<P>
   But officials with Blood 'N Fire say they welcome drop-in help
for the group's first community dinner at 188 Martin Luther King
Blvd., across from Capitol Homes in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are needed to set up for the feast and serve the meal
prepared by the Alliance of Independent Restaurateurs, whose
members include Brasserie Le Coze and McKinnon's Louisiane.
Clean-up help is also needed.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers may also bring along goods to donate to the
ministry's Building Hope shelter. Especially needed are coats and
blankets, new underwear, socks and pillows. Blood 'N Fire is also
encouraging volunteers to bring coloring books and crayons for the
children in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want volunteers to not just serve people but relate to
them,'' says spokesperson Toren Anderson. ``With everyone's
participation, lives can be changed,'' says senior pastor David
VanCronkhite. The daylong event begins at 7 a.m. Dinner is served
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and clean-up should be completed by 4 p.m.
For additional information, call 404-521-2424.
</P>
<P>
   Mennonites ask for help in hurricane relief
</P>
<P>
   The Mennonite Central Committee needs help in assembling
hurricane relief kits for immediate shipment to the victims of
Hurricane Mitch in Central America. The kits include wide-tooth
combs, toothpaste and antibacterial soap. They are designed to
assist in areas where water-borne diseases and dysentery are
causing serious health hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The goods should be placed in a five-gallon plastic pail, which
can be purchased from bakeries, paint or construction contractors.
People or groups making donations are encouraged to add a Christmas
card or letter of greeting and to paint the pails with cheerful
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Pails (boxes are also acceptable) should include a $10 check to
the Mennonite Central Committee. The money will be used to pay for
shipment of the goods and a Spanish-language Bible. The completed
pails must be delivered by Nov. 28 to either the Berea Mennonite
Church's Christian Education Building at 1088 Bouldercrest Drive,
Atlanta, Ga. or Ten Thousand Villages store at 1056 St. Charles
Ave. N.E., Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   For details on the contents of the relief kits, call Ruth
Altemus at 404-244-0289 or 404-297-8381 or Ten Thousand Villages at
404-892-5307.

<P>
   If what President Clinton said in his Nov. 7 radio address to
the nation has a sliver of truth in it, then I'm the criminal, not
him.
</P>
<P>
   How so, you ask? Because I've been known to frequent those
hotbeds of illegal activity, gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what the president would have you believe, gun shows
are not populated by neo-Nazis and militia members bent on
overthrowing the government and slaughtering innocents in their
beds. What you do see is a lot of normal people looking at the
latest product lines available for the shooting sports, from
'scopes and grips to gun locks and safes.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen spookier characters at Renaissance festivals.
</P>
<P>
   But in his latest move against the dragon he would most love to
slay after Kenneth Starr, Clinton vowed to use every means possible
to tighten the Brady law to stop gun shows around the nation from
becoming ``illegal arms bazaars'' for criminals and gunrunners.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton bases this baseless theory on a flat-out lie: that
background checks and waiting periods do not apply to gun show
purchases. He's ordered the Treasury and Justice departments to
recommend executive action by early January that will close a
``loophole'' in the gun-control law.
</P>
<P>
   One big hole in the Prince of Perjury's argument is that gun
show purchases from licensed dealers are NOT exempt from applicable
local and federal laws. The last time my police-officer husband
purchased a firearm at a gun show, he was subjected to a waiting
period.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't entirely accurate. The last time my husband wanted to
buy a new firearm at a gun show, I purchased the gun and gave it to
him as an anniversary present. In a quirk that is truly
characteristic of Texas law, certified police officers were not
exempt from the five-day waiting period prescribed by the Brady
law, but anyone with a concealed-carry permit was.
</P>
<P>
   The same will apply after Nov. 30, when the national instant
background check goes into effect. Texans with concealed-carry
permits won't have to go through the screening; everyone else,
including certified peace officers, will. Gotta love the Texas
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is attempting to change a federal law on the sly by
invoking executive action instead of properly going through
legislative channels. That's not legal, you understand, but then,
that's never stopped him before. Has this country reached the point
where it will sit back and let one man _ particularly this one man,
for heaven's sake _ run free rein over the Constitution? My copy
says Congress makes the laws, not the executive branch of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Korwin, author of ``Gun Laws of America: Every Federal Gun
Law on the Books, with Plain English Summaries'' wrote in a recent
column that any illegal gun dealing that might take place at a gun
show is just that, illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any people involved are subject to immediate arrest,'' Korwin
wrote. ``Do they know of such crimes? Are they making arrests
yet?''
</P>
<P>
   If truth be told _ and don't expect it from Clinton _ the target
of the president's recent proclamation wasn't gun purchases from
licensed dealers. He wants to stifle transactions between private,
law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In this great land of ours, citizens have the right to do what
they will with their private property. (Please, no letters from
ranchers or developers. I know y'all are getting hammered from
environmental zealots, but that's a different column.) If you want
to sell Grandpa Woody's old .22 squirrel rifle to the next-door
neighbor so his kid can plink cans off the fence post at the deer
lease, you have every right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the venue of the transaction from your garage to a gun
show, or to the want ads in the newspaper, does not negate your
right to sell or trade your property.
</P>
<P>
   The president would have it otherwise. Toward that end, Clinton
and his ilk have fabricated great dangers being fomented in the
5,000 gun shows that take place in America each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these gun shows have become illegal arms bazaars for
criminals and gun traffickers to buy and sell guns on a
cash-and-carry, no-questions-asked basis,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really, Mr. President? How about providing the hard
statistics to back that claim up? If your little army of federal
agents knows this for a fact, then prosecute the criminals and gun
traffickers under existing law. Any transfer of a firearm with
criminal intent is already a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the feds don't have the will to actually weed
out the small percentage of people with bad intent. It's much
easier to just restrict the rights of everyone.

CULTURE NOTES: EXHIBIT BY BLACK ARTISTS; CONCERT PIANIST AT 16;
AWARD FOR DIRECTOR SELLARS; SONGWRITER TAKES THE STAGE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Initially, it was to be a survey of work by
contemporary black artists in New York. But then the Schomburg
Center for Research in Black Culture ended up back at the drawing
board. The center unearthed a trove of works by distinguished
20th-century black artists, many with connections to the city.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries are at the core of ``Black New York Artists of
the 20th Century: Selections From the Schomburg Center
Collections.'' The center appealed to 43 young black New York
artists and 45 works were donated to the collection. These are
displayed alongside works by Aaron Douglas, Jacob Lawrence and
Augusta Savage, through March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Record Breaker
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 16, Karen Gomyo is a pro on the orchestral
circuit, having appeared as a soloist with the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra, the Norrkoping Symphony Orchestra in Sweden and the
National Symphony Orchestra in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, at the 92nd Street Y, she breaks the record
for the youngest artist to be presented in the 38-year history of
the Young Concert Artists series. The organization has helped the
careers of the pianists Richard Goode, Murray Perahia and Jean-Yves
Thibaudet, all of whom made their debuts with the organization at
age 18. Information: (212) 307-6655.
</P>
<P>
   Broad Minds
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch like the way Peter Sellars thinks. The revisionist
director, who has transported Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro'' to Trump
Tower in New York in the 1990s and Handel's ``Julius Caesar'' to
the present-day Middle East, will be honored for his rebellious
mind on Tuesday with this year's Erasmus Prize, presented by Prince
Bernhard of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1958, the prize is awarded for contributions to
European culture. Sellars and this year's other recipient, the
German composer Mauricio Kagel, are ``pioneering and nondogmatic
freethinkers,'' said a spokesperson for the Praemium Erasmianum
Foundation, which sponsors the awards. Past winners include Marc
Chagall, Charlie Chaplin and Ingmar Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Hum Along
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's his life, and who better to present it? That's
what the songwriter David Shire hopes when he takes the stage in
``The Story Goes On: The Music of Maltby and Shire,'' a three-week
revue opening Tuesday night at the Kaufman Theater on 42nd Street.
Shire, who, as half of the songwriting duo with Richard Maltby
produced classics like ``Baby,'' ``Closer Than Ever'' and
``Starting Here, Starting Now,'' will join the actress Loni
Ackerman. The show runs through Dec. 13.

SPIRIT OF `GOD'S FOOL' STILL PERVADES ASSISI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ We stood reverently gazing down at the brown
robe inside a glass case. The garment, made of coarse material and
patched in several places, had a familiar look, perhaps because it
is said to have been worn by the beloved St. Francis of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors to the city are genuinely moved by the sight of
this simple robe, symbolic of the remarkable life of St. Francis, a
man born to an affluent family who gave up material wealth and
became known as ``God's Fool.''
</P>
<P>
   After a journalists' conference in Rome, three of my fellow
religion writers and I had taken a sleek train to Florence. Once
there, we checked into $50-a-night rooms at the Sisters of St.
Francis of the Immaculate Conception convent.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters of the convent told us this inexpensive rate included a
curfew of 10:30 p.m. Sunday through Friday. On Saturdays, people
staying in the convent are allowed to stay out until 1 a.m. We were
also invited to attend the prayers and church services in the
convent.
</P>
<P>
   We spent our first afternoon in Florence walking to attractions
such as the Duomo or St. Maria del Fiore, the great domed
cathedral. Nearby is the oldest building in the city, the
Baptistry, believed to date to the 11th or 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   Rising early the next day, we rented a car and drove south on
modern highways cut through green Umbrian hills to the medieval
hilltop town of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   Innumerable pilgrims are expected to pour into Rome, Assisi and
other Italian cities in 2000 to take a millennial look at the
places where St. Peter, St. Paul and more modern saints, such as
Francis, made their contributions to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Rome, especially, is expected to be a place of pilgrimage at the
beginning of the new millennium. Many will visit the Mamertine
prison near the Forum where Peter and Paul were said to have been
imprisoned before their martyrdom. Nearby are the ruins of the
Colosseum, the Roman stadium where many Christians perished.
</P>
<P>
   Other Rome pilgrimage sites include catacombs, where early
Christians secluded themselves, and St. Peter's Basilica, believed
to have been built over St. Peter's tomb and the center of
Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has been calling for a major celebration of
Christian unity; millions are being spent to tidy up St. Peter's
and other buildings in the Vatican in preparation for the expected
flood of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Italy has places of pilgrimage other than Rome that were
important in early Christian history. There is Turin, where the
famous Shroud, thought by many to bear the image of the crucified
Christ, is housed in its cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   To many, though, Assisi is the most important point of Italian
pilgrimage outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Although he died at age 44, St. Francis left an eternal legacy.
He is remembered for his blessing of the animals and for the
eloquent prayer that begins ``God, make me an instrument of thy
peace.'' He traveled on foot through much of Italy, Spain and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Order of St. Francis he founded has missionary priests
serving in far-flung places such as the Amazon, South Africa and
even in all likelihood your city. Of course, his name and legacy
dominate the city of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   In Assisi, the Basilica of San Francesco is built on the side of
a hill once known as the ``Hill of Hell'' because it was a place of
Roman executions. During our trip, the church's simple architecture
was partially obscured by scaffolding as workmen made repairs after
the devastating earthquake last year that seriously damaged the
basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism slowed in Assisi after the earthquake but has recently
begun to pick up. During our visit, dozens of pilgrims were inside
the basilica lighting candles or kneeling before the tomb of St.
Francis behind its wire grate.
</P>
<P>
   The basilica is open daily for tourists from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
most of the year, but is closed from noon to 2 p.m. for lunch from
November through March. Only those attending worship services are
admitted on Sunday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in late afternoon, and guards already were preparing
to close a lower room, where we saw the brown robe, shirt and
sandals believed to have been worn by St. Francis. Also, a lock of
his hair was on display. No admission fees are charged, but
contributions are encouraged for upkeep of the basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a place of pilgrimage, the basilica contains some
of the most famous masterpieces of religious art in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the dimly lit lower church, we discovered the most famous
depiction of St. Francis. He is shown in the ``Madonna and St.
Francis'' fresco by Cimabue. The barefoot saint is presented
wearing a brown robe and with his hands bearing stigmata, marks
resembling the bloody wounds in the palms and feet of the crucified
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The basilica also includes the Chapel of St. Nicholas, the saint
from whom the legendary Christmas figure of ``St. Nick'' was
derived. Above the archway leading to the chapel is a large fresco
of St. Francis and St. Nicholas with Christ between them.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites connected with St. Francis can be visited in the
Assisi region. About two miles away is the Convento di San Damiano,
where St. Francis, at age 27, had his life changed. He ventured
into the church and later said a wooden crucifix talked to him,
telling him to ``repair the church.''
</P>
<P>
   That crucifix is now displayed in the Basilica of St. Clare,
just down the hill from the Basilica of San Francesco. It serves as
headquarters for the Poor Clares, an organization that aids the
impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   Another St. Francis pilgrimage site is about 21/2 miles outside
Assisi. The Eremo delle Carceri (Prison's Hermitage) is the spot
where Francis and some of his disciples cloistered themselves. A
gnarled holm oak tree there believed to be 1,000 years old is said
to be where birds came to listen to the sermons of St. Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Although we drove to Assisi from Florence, there are many ways
to undertake a pilgrimage. Day trips from Rome and Florence are
operated by tour companies. One-way bus tickets between Assisi and
Rome or Florence are under $20. One-way train tickets from either
city to Assisi are about $15.
</P>
<P>
   There are several hotels in Assisi starting at about $50 a night
for a single, and 20 religious organizations also have convents,
monasteries and religious-run hostels open to visitors. The
religious-run dwellings range in price from $30 to $50 for a
double.

`CRACKING UP': A MISUNDERSTOOD ARTIST, COUNTING THE IDIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Danny Gold, misunderstood performance artist,
does an act in Washington Square Park, the crowd is completely
enchanted. They laugh; they applaud; they throw money into a hat
while gazing at him with adoration. This may be too much to ask of
extras.
</P>
<P>
   Danny is played by Matt Mitler, who also directed, edited,
produced and, with Theodore P. LoRusso, wrote ``Cracking Up,'' a
disjointed tale of relationship and career disasters among the hip
and drugged on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens Tuesday at Anthology Film Archives in New York
City. Mitler says he made ``Cracking Up'' to give life to his
monstrous, attention-hungry alter ego and then destroy him. But if
you hadn't read Mitler's statement of purpose, you might think that
he had made the film to prove what idiots other people are. This is
a sympathetic point of view and a temptation familiar to many of
us, but it usually doesn't result in art.
</P>
<P>
   The first idiot appears in the first scene. Danny is doing a
brilliant impersonation of Marlon Brando in ``On the Waterfront,''
but this stupid man tells him he's getting it completely wrong and
instructs him to enunciate.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while Danny is auditioning his heart out, the men at the
desk _ who are supposed to be evaluating him _ are busy discussing
kayaking, plastic coffee stirrers and penis size.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine reporter is so insensitive that he asks Danny, ``How
long have you been an addict?'' with the same offhand casualness
that he might use to ask, ``Who was your favorite leading lady?''
Even the waiters are fools, especially the one who gives Danny a
judgmental look for having ordered borscht.
</P>
<P>
   Camryn Manheim, a recent Emmy Award winner for her role in the
ABC series ``The Practice,'' is given second billing in the
publicity release for the film, but her role, that of a nurse, is
the tiniest of bit parts.
</P>
<P>
   Various performance artists make appearances, but none have any
real impact. A couple of short scenes include full frontal nudity,
but it isn't startling. Mitler has by far the finest moments in
``Cracking Up'' when he impersonates Robert De Niro impersonating
Henny Youngman. (``Did you take my wife? Did (italics)you(end
italics) take my wife?'')
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the biggest collective fool in Danny Gold's life is
the people in the audience, because they just don't get it. But
maybe they do understand and just don't think the message is very
well expressed. &QL;
</P>

   CRACKING UP

   Produced, edited and directed by Matt Mitler; written by Mitler

AWAY FROM WASHINGTON WORRIES, CLINTON BASKS IN GUAM'S APPLAUSE 
</HEADLINE>

   HAGATNA, Guam _ Just for the words ``my fellow Americans,''
President Clinton received an ecstatic ovation Monday during a
sun-soaked rally on this speck of an island in the central Pacific,
a U.S. territory that seemed thrilled with the presidential
recognition provided by his afternoon visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is, `OK, we're not forgotten,''' said Dante
Buensuceso, one of thousands of Guamanians who gathered to cheer
Clinton on a strip of park land.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who has held only a handful of events open to the
public in recent months, was amply rewarded for his appearance
here. He was garlanded in leis; serenaded in the local language,
Chamorro; and introduced as a loyal friend of Guam and ``the
greatest man in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a group of smiling anti-abortion demonstrators objected
when it was suggested that they attended the rally to protest the
president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just here to express an opinion,'' said Arlene
Oltremaria, who was wearing a T-shirt that proclaimed, ``Guam Is
Pro-Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He always can change his mind,'' she added hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was so delighted at his reception that he joked
about returning to run for governor, spent the afternoon acting on
the proposition that all politics is local. He tended to matters
like appointing members to the federal Coral Reef Task Force and
announcing a final infusion of money to help build a 53-mile road
in the nearby island nation of Palau.
</P>
<P>
   But after four and a half hours here, he did not take time to
walk along the beach or play a round of golf before flying back to
Washington from his five-day trip, which also took him to Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   He returns home to face a welter of concerns. He hopes to work
on his budget proposal for next year as he monitors unstable
situations in Iraq and Russia, plans a trip to the Gaza Strip next
month and tries to fend off impeachment hearings in the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries may explain why he lingered for an hour to shake
hands in the crowd. But even before his warm welcome Monday,
Clinton had reason to be grateful to Guam. Its governor, Carl T.C.
Gutierrez, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the
president's re-election in 1996. The White House was accused of
adjusting policy to favor Guam in exchange, a charge it denied.
Before the rally, Clinton also attended a meeting here of leaders
from all over Micronesia. And on a hilltop overlooking the ocean,
he paid a visit to a simple memorial to the nearly 1,300 American
soldiers who died taking this island back from the Japanese in
1944. The memorial also commemorates the suffering of Guamanians
under the Japanese occupation.
</P>
<P>
   With gray bunkers crumbling beside the beach, Guam, with about
150,000 residents, has been transformed from a battleground to a
booming tourist playground. But it has a long list of things it
wants American help on.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before Clinton on Monday, Gutierrez pressed him for
help in securing the right for Guam's American residents to vote in
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in Washington needs to stand up and do what is right
by the Americans in Guam,'' he said, ``and we firmly believe, Mr.
President, that you are that man.''
</P>
<P>
   The president stopped well short of promising assistance in
getting Guam votes in the electoral college or even commonwealth
status, which would give it more control over immigration and the
application of U.S. laws. Clinton said he favored ``viable
alternatives'' that would provide ``more effective
self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would work to insure that ``you are consulted before
policies are made that affect your lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did promise more immediate help on another matter:
Guamanians' request for the return of land held by the U.S.
military. The military holds 44,800 acres here, almost a quarter of
the total. Clinton promised to implement a 1994 federal law to
transfer 3,213 acres, and to work to turn over another 7,300 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Blas, a 34-year-old resident of the island, said after the
rally that although Guamanians were considered ``second-class
citizens,'' he did not feel disappointed that Clinton had not
promised more help in getting the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' he said cheerfully. ``I know he has other things on
his mind. But it was nice of him, coming over here.''

   A Boston Globe article about psychiatric research misstated the
order of two sentences on a consent form used in a study at the
University of California-Los Angeles, and the time frame during
which a patient there went without being seen by a physician for a
year. The correct order of the sentences is: ``I understand that
because of the withdrawal of active medication, I may become worse
during this study and that either a relapse of my initial symptoms
or new symptoms may occur. &UR;  &LR; ... I understand that my condition may
improve, worsen or remain unchanged from participation in this
study.'' Antonio LaMadrid was not seen by a physician between
November 1989 and December 1990, but a doctor did see him in the
months before he committed suicide in March 1991.

NO DECISION ON REGIONAL TOLL-CALL COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Regulators Monday gave Bell Atlantic a 2 1/2-month
extension, until April 20, to prepare for looming competition in
the 1(plus) dialing market within Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and
Energy has not yet ruled on whether competitors will be allowed to
enter the regional toll-call market, as they have been in New York.
That decision is expected next month.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic strongly opposes opening the service to
competition from the likes of MCI Worldcom, AT&AMP;T, and Sprint,
because those carriers can offer local, toll-call, and
long-distance services. Under federal law, Bell Atlantic cannot
offer inter-state long-distance service until it opens the local
and toll markets to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful that the decision indicates a commitment by the
DTE to to have 1(plus) dialing on short-haul toll calling, as
Massachusetts consumers have waited years for competitive
services,'' said Robert Lopardo, Northeast regional policy director
for MCI Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials said the DTE decision gives them more
time to complete employee training and computer and software
installation so customers can easily switch from one carrier to
another. The company had said it could not meet the original
February deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel logic and fairness issues will prevail at the DTE
while we meet the new April 20 deadline,'' said Robert Mudge, vice
president of Bell Atlantic's Massachusetts operations. Bell
Atlantic recently told the DTE it plans to seek state and federal
permission in 1999 to offer long-distance service next November.
</P>
<P>
   Like long-distance service, for which consumers choose a carrier
for inter-state and calls outside their toll-call region (such as
calls between Boston and Springfield, Lowell and Lenox), Bell
Atlantic's rivals want to provide a similar choice for regional
toll calls.
</P>
<P>
   Those are calls made within and between the 617, 781, 978, and
508 area codes, which are automatically provided by Bell Atlantic
when consumers dial 1(plus) the area code. Last year revenues from
those eastern Massachusetts calls accounted for more than $350
million, or about 20 percent of Bell Atlantic's Massachusetts
revenues, according to a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those toll-call revenues are a high-margin business for Bell
Atlantic, and if they lose those to competition it will hurt,''
said Robert Norcrosss, a vice president in the telecommunications
practice of Mercer Management &AMP; Consulting in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which is designed to spur
local telephone competition, state regulators can order regional
phone companies such as Bell Atlantic to open up 1(plus) toll-call
dialing starting Feb. 8, 1999.

CHANGING FACES OF THE WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   When Judith Weaver entered the work
force in the 1970s, there were few career options for women and
even fewer female role models.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many women, she became a social worker and quickly learned
about discrimination. Weaver was turned down for a job because of
her religion and told to stay home and care for husband and
children even though she wasn't married.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward nearly three decades. Weaver is now a lawyer and
the number of women in the work force has doubled from 30 million
in 1970 to 60 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As so many women have joined the labor market, we have
significantly changed the workplace, according to Weaver and others
who participated in a panel on women and work at the Central
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the change has come about because of our sheer numbers.
Women now account for 46 percent of the labor force. As a result,
only 17 percent of families conform to the 1950s model of a
wage-earning father, a stay-at-home mother and one or more
children.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, women have climbed the management ranks and
are now making decisions about workplace policies.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, most companies had personnel departments that were
headed by men, said Loretta Summers, assistant vice president human
resources at Sprint Corp. Since then, they have been transformed
into human resources departments and many are now led by women who
know from experience the challenges of juggling family and work.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it has become routine for larger companies to offer
flexible scheduling, on-site child care, telecommuting and other
family friendly options.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the progress, women often encounter sexual
discrimination and harassment in the workplace, panelists said.
Frequently, it's the more subtle forms of sexism. Women often are
not informed about unwritten office policies.
</P>
<P>
   They also are not given the plum assignments because supervisors
assume that they don't want to travel or work long hours.
</P>
<P>
   Real or perceived discrimination has contributed to the dramatic
increase in the number of new businesses established by women, said
panelist Brenda Perkins, a principal of Joshua &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists and members of the audience agreed there are no easy
answers. But women need to find mentors _ male or female _ who will
guide them through the workplace maze. They also need to ask for
the assignments that will prepare them for promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think real progress has been made, but I think there are
still real issues that are cultural issues and will take much more
to change,'' said Weaver. ``I think we all have to be aware of
silent, unchallenged barriers.''

ACCOUNTING FOR ALL PEOPLE IS MASSIVE UNDERTAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   HONDURAS _ The government of Honduras is
intently accounting for all of its citizens in these days after
Hurricane Mitch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is as if the immensity of death in Honduras has reiterated
the value of those left living.
</P>
<P>
   But checking on the welfare of each person is a mammoth
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like the Garifuna of Bajamar, can only be reached
by boat. Too many bridges and roads are still blocked to visit them
by land.
</P>
<P>
   The Garifuna are descendants of shipwrecked or escaped African
slaves and South American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Lourdes Ramirez and a team of other government
workers from the city hall of Puerto Cortes packed a picnic lunch
and rented small fishing boats one day last week to find the
Garifuna of Bajamar. This Garifuna village is a coastal community
of concrete and cane homes in northwestern Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   As the boats motored up the coast the team could see where
Hurricane Mitch ripped chunks of land away, slipping rows of homes
into the Gulf of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredible, the destruction,'' Ramirez said as she
crawled out of the boat and stepped onto the surf.
</P>
<P>
   The land is a beach now, covered with sand from the gulf waters
and strewn with fallen palm trees, trash and pieces of what used to
be homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hurricane, it was a dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   The community's electrical lines lie fallen in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Garifuna here died in the hurricane, Ramirez said.
But many had to leave their homes and flee inland.
</P>
<P>
   Clipboards and sharpened pencils in hand, Ramirez and her crew
fan out. They ask for the heads of each household, checking on
medical and food needs. The team will visit each home that is still
standing.

   FAITH-SERIES-2TAKES (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ On a sunny fall morning
a small group of women snuggled into soft white couches or propped
themselves up on cushioned chairs in a circle. The brightness of
the day filled the room. Orange, gold and red leaves rustled in the
wind outside. ``Be aware that God is here,'' the group's leader
said. ``Open your hands to what you are releasing. Now cup your
hands into a bowl. What do you want God to fill you with today?''

 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo., _ transform our
lives.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the Rev. Robert Lee Hill, senior pastor of Community
Christian Church in Kansas City, suggests that people who only
practice do-it-yourself religion through books and tapes are
missing something significant _ the transforming power of religious
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming together with other people,'' Hill said,
``bouncing ideas off one another, sharing a project together,
worshipping, praying together that we work out, as the Bible says,
our salvation with fear and trembling.''  &LR; brk:Closer to God
 &LR; tx:Carol Meyer remains a practicing Catholic even as she expands
her spirituality quest. Last year she formed WisdomWays, through
which she leads retreats, classes and workshops to help people grow
spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to help people develop a profound relationship with God
in a holistic way that makes a difference in their total life,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Wolfgeher, 36, an Independence graphics designer, was
among those sitting quietly and following Meyer's directions on
their recent meditation retreat. Wolfgeher was raised in the
Catholic church, went to Catholic schools and is active in her
parish. About five years ago she sensed the need for something
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   She started participating in group counseling and began
``journaling'' _ writing an account of how the scripture texts
related to her _ as part of her parish's Lenten program two years
ago. She has kept it up, meeting with a small group for discussion
once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgeher routinely does visualization exercises, in which she
forms a mental picture of a desired outcome. And she attends events
at the House of Menuha, a women's retreat center. The events range
from lectures on angels to a session about American Indian
drumming. She sees learning to meditate as a means to ``get closer
to God and my soul, and to uncover a layer about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She gleans from these experiences and incorporates into her life
what fits her spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   And not everything fits. Like the drumming, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to find our own beat. I never found it. That
just wasn't for me, but it was an interesting evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgeher does not describe herself as a spiritual seeker: ``I'm
not lost; I'm not looking for anything. I'm fine where I am as a
Catholic. The other things just enhance my relationship with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Also following Meyer's instructions was the Rev. Patty Craft,
35, an ordained minister in the Church of the Nazarene. Craft said
her spiritual journey had ``real defined parameters'' within the
traditions of her church. An associate pastor who also develops
Sunday School curricula for the denomination, Craft said she wanted
to bring meditation into her life and her religious tradition to
develop a deeper spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often when you hear of someone on a spiritual journey, they
are searching for something,'' she said. ``I'm on a spiritual
journey to go deeper and to reach every part of my life. I have my
theology, and I'm comfortable and happy with the tradition where I
am. So I'm not searching for what my God looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   Many places of worship serve those who are seeking alternatives
by offering small-group activities. People will often meet during
the week, in homes, office buildings or over breakfast or lunch,
said Lyle E. Schaller of Naperville, Ill., an expert in church
life.
</P>
<P>
   Women's ministries, once organized mainly around missions, are
increasingly geared toward women's spiritual journeys, Schaller
said, especially if the congregations are trying to reach younger
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to deal with parenting, stresses of working mothers,
divorce and recovery, and other continuing groups are organized
around the agenda of the individuals rather than around the
church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood,
for example, hundreds of women participate in a weekly program
called ``Building Better Moms.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many observers say, the future of institutional
religion may rest on how it responds to the spirituality movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some church leaders are recognizing that the spiritual quest
is not an intellectual quest but a quest of the heart for truth
through experience,'' said Dan Benedict, of the United Methodist
Church in Nashville. ``Some churches are reading the spiritual need
and hearing the need and responding to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other congregations are very uncomfortable with this or don't
even know it's going on and continue to practice worship and offer
classes that don't take into consideration that there is this
longing. And in those churches there is an unrest among some
members, some of whom are looking elsewhere for this spiritual
hunger to be fed.''

 The eclectic quest for spiritual experience  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HELEN T. GRAY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo., _ On a sunny fall
morning a small group of women snuggled into soft white couches or
propped themselves up on cushioned chairs in a circle. The
brightness of the day filled the room. Orange, gold and red leaves
rustled in the wind outside.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Be aware that God is here,'' the group's leader said. ``Open
your hands to what you are releasing. Now cup your hands into a
bowl. What do you want God to fill you with today?''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Meyer's voice was inviting, soothing _ all the more
encouraging on this daylong retreat in which she was helping others
learn to meditate.
</P>
<P>
   Many spiritual seekers take paths beyond organized religion. But
Meyer, 55, a former Catholic nun and now a divorced mother of three
adopted children, is among the growing number of men and women who
create their own spiritual journeys even as they remain connected
to the institutions of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, BEGIN ITAL After Heaven END ITAL, Princeton
sociologist Robert Wuthnow writes of people today ``shopping'' for
spirituality, supplementing their church and synagogue attendance
with input from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   For many of them, spirituality means a personal experience of
the sacred, and it can take many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer's Roeland Park home tells the story:
</P>
<P>
   She arranges things with the help of BEGIN ITAL feng shui END
ITAL, the ancient Chinese art of placing items to enhance energy.
In her bedroom, a small table serves as an altar. On it two goddess
figures _ one she thinks is Hindu, the other Buddhist _ share space
with a Christian cross, a candle and a small rubber ball with the
world painted on it. In the yard, along with a wind chime and a
hammock, are another goddess figure and a statue of St. Francis of
Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed in being open to other spiritual
traditions,'' Meyer said. ``But I don't believe in jumping
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers report a resurgence of interest in spiritual
practices, such as meditation and prayer, that help deepen
individuals' religious experience. Often they go beyond the
traditions of once-a-week worship and tap into the spiritual roots
of their faith. A BEGIN ITAL Kansas City Star END ITAL survey on
religion, for instance, showed an increase in the last 20 years in
the number of people who participate in prayer groups, Bible
studies and other activities outside of regular worship.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Jews are discovering or expanding their spiritual
lives by studying the ancient mystical teachings of the Kabbalah.
Even within Islam ``a strong revivalist movement is trying to
revive the spirituality of Islam,'' said Sayyid M. Syeed, secretary
general of the Islamic Society of North America, Plainfield, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   In main-line Protestant churches, there is a revived interest in
the ritual traditions of the sacraments, said Dan Benedict,
director of worship resources for the General Board of
Discipleship, United Methodist Church in Nashville, Tenn. ``There
is the introduction of the element of mystery,'' Benedict said.
``The sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper are being seen as
a direct engagement with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people who search for spirituality in new directions
appropriate what interests them and bring it back to their
traditional denominations, said theologian and author Martin Marty.
</P>
<P>
   George Barna, of the Barna Research Group and author of BEGIN
ITAL The Second Coming of the Church END ITAL, notes that in their
quest for spiritual wisdom Americans have become quite comfortable
evaluating traditions other than their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past such explorations would have been conducted in
secret, as if examining faiths other than Christianity were immoral
or somehow disrespectful to God,'' Barna writes. ``Things are
different today. People brazenly evaluate a variety of faith
groups, while maintaining the Christian label.''
</P>
<P>
   One place many people are finding spiritual alternatives is on
bookstore shelves _ not only traditional religious outlets, but in
the megastore mainstream as well.
</P>
<P>
   Books and tapes on religion are ``a huge industry,'' said
Phyllis Tickle, religion editor for BEGIN ITAL Publishers Weekly
END ITAL, the book industry journal. She noted that sales have
risen at triple-digit rates in the last five years. Hundreds of new
titles a year, from BEGIN ITAL Buddha's Nature END ITAL to BEGIN
ITAL Sister Wendy's Book of Meditations END ITAL, beckon the
spiritually curious.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Beard, community relations coordinator for a Borders
Bookstore in Overland Park, says spirituality is one of the big
draws for author events. ``I know if I do a spiritual topic,'' she
said, ``I'm going to get a good crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Jomichael Stoddard, manager of Aquarius bookstore in Westport,
reports growing interest in non-traditional areas, such as New Age,
neo-pagan, wiccan, earth-based spirituality and Afro-Cuban
religion. In recent years, he said, he had seen middle-class, upper
middle-class and business customers ``who a few years ago would
have been afraid of a social stigma'' exploring.MDNM/ these
alternative paths to the sacred.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers have a deep distrust of the sort of eclectic
or ``mix-and-match'' spirituality they are seeing today.
</P>
<P>
   John Daido Loori Roshi, a Zen abbot in upstate New York,
captured that skepticism in a recent edition of the BEGIN ITAL Utne
Reader END ITAL: ``In most cases,'' he wrote, ``hybrid religious
paths are a reflection of our cultural trend of greediness and
consumerism. With all the possibilities, why give up anything? The
consequence of this attitude is that we entertain ourselves with
teachings that are meant to transform our lives.''

BAY STATE LAWMAKER MULLS OFFERING IMPEACHMENT COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House Judiciary Committee Monday privately
interviewed its first material witness in the impeachment case
against President Clinton, a Massachusetts Democrat became the
first member of the panel to say he may file a formal motion to
sanction Clinton short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William D. Delahunt, who has emerged as one of
the least partisan members of the bitterly divided committee, said
he considers an alternative to removing Clinton from office
``entirely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled panel is expected to approve articles
of impeachment against Clinton as early as the week of Dec. 7. But
the full House appears to lack support for impeachment, as moderate
Republicans have estimated that at least 20 GOP members will join
the nearly unified Democratic minority in opposing the president's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt's move toward an alternative provided the first clear
sign that a compromise plan could emerge from the Judiciary
Committee rather than from a back-room deal between party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm considering putting forth an alternative in the
committee,'' Delahunt said. ``Whether it's described as a rebuke, a
condemnation or a censure, it would be short of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt's possible compromise plan was seen as significant
because he is in regular contact with several committee Republicans
as a founder of a bipartisan group of Judiciary Committee members
who have maintained informal lines of communication amid the highly
rancorous proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there has been no sign that any GOP committee member plans
to oppose articles of impeachment against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt raised the possibility of an alternative plan after he
participated in a three-hour deposition with Daniel A. Gecker, a
lawyer for Kathleen Willey. She is a former White House volunteer
who accused Clinton of groping her and trying to kiss her in the
White House in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Gecker is the first witness the Judiciary Committee has
interviewed who may have direct knowledge of circumstances stemming
from Clinton's sexual affair with Monica S. Lewsinky and the
recently settled sexual harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin Jones
filed against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a group of scholars who discussed the standards for
impeachment, the only witness who provided testimony to the
Judiciary Committee before Gecker was the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, who oversaw the investigation of the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans wanted Gecker and three other witnesses
subpoenaed to determine if Clinton played any role in influencing
Willey's testimony in the Jones lawsuit. The committee also
subpoenaed Nathan Landow, a Democratic fund-raiser who met with
Willey about her allegation against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Landow was scheduled to testify behind closed doors Tuesday, but
the session was postponed until next week at Landow's request.
</P>
<P>
   When Landow was called before the federal grand jury
investigating the Lewinksy matter earlier this year, he reportedly
refused to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendent right
against self-incrimination. The Judiciary Committee is considering
whether to grant him immunity from prosecution to obtain his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The panel has also issued subpoenas for Bruce R. Lindsey, White
House deputy counsel and Clinton's long-time confidant; and Robert
S. Bennett, Clinton's private lawyer in the Jones case. Lindsey and
Bennett also are scheduled to participate in private depositions
next week.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Judiciary Committee plans to hear presentations
from the panel's chief Republican and Democratic investigators and
possibly from another constitutional scholar on impeachment before
voting whether to recommend removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has alleged that Clinton may have committed 11 impeachable
offenses stemming from the Lewinsky affair, including perjury,
witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and abusing the power of
his office.
</P>
<P>
   The full house is likely to be called back into session the week
of Dec. 14 to vote on articles of impeachment and a possible
compromise measure.
</P>
<P>
   If the House were to pass articles of impeachment, they would be
forwarded to the Senate for a trial. But lawmakers in that chamber,
where a two-thirds majority of 67 votes would be required to remove
Clinton from office, say the president would survive impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt was among three lawmakers on the 37-member House panel
who chose to participate in the Gecker deposition. He would not
disclose details of the session, citing secrecy rules imposed by
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But he described the deposition as ``an important constitutional
moment because we're finally taking evidence from a live witness.
To date, we haven't had any evidence whatsoever, only a recitation
of a version of the facts by Mr. Starr,'' said Delahunt, a former
Norfolk County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those really can't be called facts,'' Delahunt said.
``They're total hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   By moving close to weighing Clinton's impeachment without taking
direct testimony from any other major witnesses, Delahunt said,
``The process is really in a shambles at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Gecker declined to speak with reporters after the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans prevailed along party lines last week in a
vote to subpoena Gecker and the other three witnesses. Republicans
sought the subpoenas several days after Starr provided the
committee with two boxes of evidence on the Willey matter.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee Democrats accused GOP lawmakers of expanding
the investigation as part of an excessive effort to bring down
Clinton after they apparently fell short in rallying public support
for his impeachment in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   After Gecker's deposition, Representative Robert C. Scott, a
Virginia Democrat, argued that Gecker's appearance was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there has ever been any representation that he
would be relevant to any of the 11 counts before us,'' said Scott,
who attended the deposition with Delahunt and Representative James
E. Rogan, a California Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans countered that Gecker and the other three
witnesses may provide evidence that Clinton engaged in a pattern of
activities, including obstruction of justice and abuse of power,
that could warrant articles of impeachment.

US BACKS DOWN AS IRAQ DENIES DOCUMENTS TO UN TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Just a week ago, the US warned Iraq that it
would bomb without warning if Baghdad refused to meet its latest
pledge to cooperate with UN inspections. But after three days of
Iraqi refusals to hand over documents on its banned weapons, US
officials say they will give Baghdad another chance.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Monday the US would await the results of a
series of surprise inspections by UN arms experts _ a process that
could take weeks _ before deciding on military action. And an
American official in New York said US diplomats were bracing for
weeks of debate in the council over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Iraq's initial reactions are unacceptable,''
said White House foreign policy spokesman P.J. Crowley. ``But we'll
continue to give UNSCOM (UN Special Commission) the opportunity to
continue this dialogue with Iraq as it prepares for further
inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   The cautious reaction to Baghdad's defiance appears calculated
to prove that Washington has exhausted every possible diplomatic
effort before taking action. But analysts said Iraq is likely to
seek to take advantage of the crisis to weaken support for US
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Iraq's supporters on the council said Monday that the
latest clash between the UN and Baghdad demonstrated that the
Security Council should exert greater influence over the
inspections. And China blasted the chief UN inspector Richard
Butler for provoking the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe on some of the issues (Butler) has been too
aggressive. UNSCOM should be very cautious at this moment,'' said
Shen Guofang, China's deputy ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said the military option remains
open: ``We have in place in the gulf enough capability to carry out
any military options the president might decide would be
required.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain sounded even more belligerent. ``Saddam has got to
understand that there is going to be no messing around this time,''
said British Defense Secretary George Robertson.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The latest showdown between Iraq and the UN began after Butler
sent two letters last week requesting access to Iraq's military
archives and a series of government documents about Baghdad's
efforts to develop chemical and biological weapons after the Gulf
war.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi deputy prime Minister Tariq Aziz accused Butler of raising
the issue of the documents to undermine a promised council review
of Iraq's relationship with the United Nations. Baghdad hopes the
review will lead to the lifting of economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the gulf between the respective positions and the
different approaches adopted, we concluded that the requests of the
executive chairman are impossible to satisfy,'' Aziz wrote in a
letter to the Security Council Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's ambassador to the UN, Nizar Hamdoon, added that Baghdad
has given UNSCOM everything it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any more documents that we believe are related
to disarmament at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current flap created little sense of urgency at the United
Nations Monday, where the council met to approve a UN program
allowing Iraq to sell more than $5 billion of oil each six months
to purchase food and medicine. The humanitarian program is unlikely
to be affected by the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   In London, meanwhile, Britain's deputy foreign minister Derek
Fatchett urged representatives of 16 Iraqi opposition groups to
shelve their difference and come up with a plan to topple President
Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi dissidents are expected to meet with US
assistant secretary of state Martin Indyk today.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, meanwhile, announced that a senior Iraqi official, Izzat
Ibrahim, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in the holy city
of Karbala, in southern Iraq on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary Command
Council, was attending a religious ceremony when assailants threw
two grenades at him as he got out of his car. Several bodyguards
and bystanders were wounded; Ibrahim was not.

UN OFFICIAL URGES DEBT HOLIDAY IN AIDS-IMPACTED NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using a ``pay now or pay later'' argument, the chief of the
United Nation's AIDS agency Monday said that international lending
agencies should forgive debt owed by poor nations hardest hit by
AIDS if the countries agree to spend the money on combatting the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community really has to increase its
support'' for AIDS prevention, Dr. Peter Piot of UNAIDS said during
a conference call with reporters from London. ``If the western
world doesn't invest today, we'll have to invest far more later in
less productive things like food aid,'' as the mounting AIDS toll
devastates economies and development prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Piot's comments marked the first time the idea of cancelling or
scheduling international debt has been linked to the 17-year-old
AIDS epidemic. Some have recently advocated debt forgiveness to
help Honduras and Nicaragua rebuild after the ravages of Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The economic consequences of AIDS for some nations, especially
in southern and eastern Africa, ``constitute an urgent and massive
threat to development,'' said a UNAIDS update on the epidemic,
being issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven men, women, and children became infected with the AIDS
virus every minute this year, according to the report. The number
of people worldwide now living with the virus rose by 10 percent in
the past year, to 33.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only $350 million is being spent on AIDS prevention
worldwide, concluded a new study conducted by Piot and Daniel
Tarantola of the Harvard School of Public Health, a senior adviser
to the World Health Organization's director-general, Gro Harlem
Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need at least three times more,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago UNAIDS made news with the announcement that the rate
of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which
causes AIDS, had risen to 25 percent of all adults in the world's
two most severely affected nations _ Zimbabwe and Botswana, in
southeastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now those nations have been joined by Namibia and Swaziland,''
Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Average life expectancy will drop by 17 years over the next
decade or so in the nine African countries with adult HIV infection
rates over 10 percent, the UNAIDS report said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tanzania and Zambia, large companies report that AIDS illness
and death cost them more than their yearly profits in added
expenses, and some firms told the UN agency that their health bills
have doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hard-hit countries of Africa, the epidemic is
decimating a limited pool of skilled workers and managers and
eating away at the economy,'' the new report said.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS is targetting its prevention efforts in the coming year
on children, teenagers, and adults under age 25, since about half
of new HIV infections worldwide are occurring at these ages _ with
particularly far-reaching effects on social and economic
development for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are very vulnerable to HIV infection,'' Piot
said. ``Every year about 100 million young people become sexually
active, so prevention programs have to focus far more on young
people.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem in many countries, he said, is that ``often a first
sexual encounter is a forced one. Older men may think that having
sex with a younger girl or woman is safer. They have HIV in mind.
Also, there are many examples of injecting drug use starting at a
very early age, especially in eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belarus, over 80 percent of reported HIV infections are among
drug users in their teens and twenties, and in Lithuania, more than
half of infections are &UR;  &LR; in injecting drug users under age 25, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for targeting young people, Piot said, is the
evidence that they are more receptive to messages about behavior
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the chance, young people are more likely to protect
themselves than adults,'' the UNAIDS report said. It cited evidence
from such diverse countries as Senegal, where condom use with
non-regular partners rose from 5 percent to 40 percent since 1990,
and Chile, where condom use is highest among 15- to 18-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also noted trends toward safer sex or deferred sexual
activity in the United States and western Europe in recent years.
But Piot criticized North America and Europe for complacency about
AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's particularly appalling is there are basically no
programs in AIDS prevention in developed countries,'' Piot said.
``There has been a spectacular decline in AIDS mortality'' due to
expensive new drug treatments, ``but today we're seeing the same
number of HIV infections occurring as a few years ago.''

<P>
   KULA, Nigeria _ At ease in a speedboat shooting up a narrow
mangrove creek in the Niger Delta, Anthony Diepiriye, fuel
smuggler, could not stop grinning.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after arriving in the oil city of Port Harcourt, he
explained, he would rise at 7 sharp, go to a gas station and fill
10 55-gallon drums.
</P>
<P>
   Then the next day, he would ship the gasoline here to his
hometown _ a small fishing village on the Atlantic coast, a stone's
throw from oil wells where Shell and Chevron pump tens of thousands
of barrels of crude a day _ and resell it for a 33 percent markup.
</P>
<P>
   How about the mile-long lines at gas stations in Port Harcourt?
Diepiriye leaned back in his seat and flashed two rows of teeth,
pausing, it seemed, for tolerance' sake.
</P>
<P>
   A bribe of 500 naira per drum, or about $6, would shorten any
line, anytime, anywhere in Nigeria, Diepiriye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll take my containers to the front and fill them for
me,'' he added cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   When Diepiriye, 39, gave up construction work in 1996 for the
fuel-smuggling business _ an illegal activity, though merely in
theory _ the career change was a response to broader economic
forces sweeping Nigeria. Despite being the world's sixth-biggest
oil producer, Nigeria suffered from chronic gasoline shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rapacious government of Gen. Sani Abacha, who died
suddenly last summer after five years in power, Nigeria's four oil
refineries, including two in Port Harcourt, were left to fall into
disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha forced Nigeria to import gasoline through his own agents,
pocketing huge commissions and charging inflated prices at the
pump.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit was the Niger Delta. In part because much of the
delta tried to secede from the rest of Nigeria in the Biafra war of
the 1960s, the northern generals who have ruled the country since
independence from Britain in 1960 have kept it starkly undeveloped,
without roads, bridges, electricity or running water.
</P>
<P>
   So the villages and towns dotting the delta rely on men like
Diepiriye for fuel, because the delta _ the region producing the
crude oil that yields $10 billion a year to Nigeria _ suffers from
the simple, though astonishing, fact that it has virtually no gas
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The new president, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who has pledged to
hand over rule to a democratically elected civilian government in
May, has replaced Abacha's agents with oil companies like Shell and
Mobil. He has said the country's refineries will resume operations.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil industry officials said the four refineries,
operating at full capacity, could meet domestic demand. But because
two are still closed and the two others are working at just 60
percent of capacity, Nigeria finds itself in the position of having
to import refined oil from countries like Ivory Coast, which
produces plenty of cocoa but not a single drop of crude.
</P>
<P>
   So even as Nigeria lurches toward presidential elections in
February _ without the emergence yet of any figure capable of
unifying this country of 108 million people split along ethnic,
religious and regional lines _ gasoline shortages represent a
potentially explosive problem.
</P>
<P>
   The same way that the subject of apartments inevitably regulates
the rhythm of conversations in Manhattan, every conversation seems
to lead to gasoline in Nigeria, from international hotels in Lagos
to mud shacks in the Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Around noon in Kula, desperation was in the air in a small
harbor where children swam among idle boats and boat-taxi drivers
and fishermen stood listlessly on the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Asifamabia Amakiri, 33, a boat-taxi skipper, said few residents
here could afford trips to Port Harcourt now that he had been
forced to raise the one-way fee to roughly $9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that, I have no passengers, and now, as you can
see, I just relax,'' Amakiri said, his eyes blotted out by dark
wraparound sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   He and the others have been relaxing for almost a month, since
worsening shortages pushed up gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, gasoline costs about $3.40 a gallon in Port Harcourt,
which is about 40 miles northeast of here. After Diepiriye and
other smugglers ship the gas to Kula, aboard slow cargo ships that
take nine hours to navigate the region's labyrinth of creeks and
bayous, they resell the gasoline to local dealers for about $4.50.
The dealers charge residents about $6.80 a gallon, double the
original price.
</P>
<P>
   Local politicians say the price has disrupted almost every facet
of life in Kula, a poor town of 60,000 residents and just as many
incongruities. Kula has a brand-new town hall, built by Chevron.
Nevertheless, without a potable water system, many residents could
be seen drinking directly from wells, whose brownish-orange water
is referred to as ``Fanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the village clinic, a squat colonial-era concrete
building that stood apart from houses built of driftwood, the
nurse, Ekime Tekekuro, pointed to the empty medicine cabinet. The
village government, she said, can no longer afford to send her to
Port Harcourt to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the harbor, Prince Apiambo Dobuko, 28, said he could not
afford to take his boat out into the ocean to fish for barracuda
and shark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy!'' he said. ``Oil is produced here. We should buy oil
cheaper, because we are the oil-producing community. But we pay the
highest price.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Diepiriye sat aboard his speedboat. Soon it
overtook a cargo ship also headed to Port Harcourt with his blue
drums on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet you at waterside tomorrow morning!'' he yelled out to a
partner who was safeguarding his drums on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   He made this journey twice a month and earned about $190, not
bad in a country where the per capita income is about $21 a month.
Enough money, certainly, to make Diepiriye, an Anglican, look big
in church every Sunday. Enough money to feed himself, his two wives
and five children.
</P>
<P>
   In Port Harcourt it would take him just four hours to fill his
drums. Success would earn him half a day in the big city before
returning home to savor the other side of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't have any money left, I just relax,'' he said. ``If
I have money left, I buy beer and pepper soup. And maybe a fine
Port Harcourt woman. It's part of the enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuel smuggler squinted, not at anything he had uttered, but
at the wind that was blowing in his smiling face as the boat
gathered speed and moved farther from Kula.

MEDIA VOICES RISE AGAINST `DEATH AS ENTERTAINMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after 7 on Sunday night, Mike Wallace of CBS's ``60
Minutes'' asked Dr. Jack Kevorkian, ``Is he dead now?''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian replied: ``He's dying now, because his oxygen's cut
off and he can't breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, as videotape showed 52-year-old Thomas Youk's
head tilting upward as his life ended, television crossed a
dangerous line, according to several TV analysts who Monday
assailed CBS for broadcasting footage of Youk's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awfulness of death has been transformed into a form of
news entertainment,'' said Marvin Kalb, the former CBS News
correspondent who heads the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thistle, director of broadcast journalism at Boston
University, agreed, saying it was ``not only inappropriate, but
very disturbing'' that CBS televised a videotape of Kevorkian
administering a lethal injection to Youk, a Michigan resident who
suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ```60 Minutes' has been setting the standard,'' said Thistle.
``And if this is the new standard, then, God, we're all in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally disquieted was TV historian Steven Stark. In his book
``Glued to the Set,'' Stark singled out ``60 Minutes'' as among the
60 television shows that ``made us who we are today,'' but he
swiftly changed the channel Sunday night when the footage involving
Youk came on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pornographic,'' said Stark. ``It's just a
different kind of pornography. I'm not surprised that television
would do this, because television will do anything now, but for `60
Minutes' to cross the line is pretty significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Also troubling to Stark was the timing of the broadcast, early
on a Sunday evening. ``Sunday night still is traditionally the
night when families gather together to watch television,'' said
Stark. ``To put it on then, when any kid can see it, is just
horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy snowballed, CBS News Monday released a
statement: ``It is a hallmark of `60 Minutes' to explore complex
and often controversial issues in a fair and responsible way. Mike
Wallace's report on Dr. Jack Kevorkian goes to the core of an
important national debate. CBS News believes this program performed
a public service.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics argue that CBS actually rendered a service to
Kevorkian, who videotaped himself apparently causing Youk's death
on Sept. 17 and then brought the tape to ``60 Minutes.'' Kevorkian
has said he gave CBS the videotape because he wants to force
authorities to arrest him, thereby creating a legal showdown over
assisted suicide and euthanasia. ``The issue's got to be raised to
the level where it's finally decided,'' Kevorkian told Wallace,
adding, ``I've got to force them to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kalb nor Thistle saw the broadcast, but both were
dismayed by CBS's judgment. Kalb said he is troubled that CBS
allowed itself to be used as a forum for ``a cause as sensitive and
controversial as Kevorkian's,'' and also that the network took the
unusual step of airing footage it did not shoot itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very uncomfortable with the idea that a program as good as
`60 Minutes' allows itself to be used for a cause,'' he said. ``It
gets into tricky terrain when you begin to use tape shot by others
who represent causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Thistle: ``What bothers me is that the choreography of
this thing serves the individual, Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes'' broadcast aired during the final Sunday of
the all-important November ``sweeps,'' a period during which
viewership is closely measured to set future advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   A ``60 Minutes'' spokesman, Kevin Tedesco, denied that CBS aired
the footage to drive up ratings. ``We've never done anything for
sweeps,'' said Tedesco. He pointed out that ``60 Minutes'' has
included a foreign story _ often a turnoff among viewers _ in each
of its programs this month.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Sunday-night broadcast racked up higher
ratings than usual. Nationally, according to Tedesco, major-market
estimates showed ``60 Minutes'' receiving a 16 rating and a 24
share, compared with the show's recent average of a 14.4 rating and
a 22 share. In the Boston area, according to Nielsen Media
Research, more than 388,500 households tuned in to ``60 Minutes,''
as the broadcast garnered an 18.5 rating and a 28 share.
</P>
<P>
   The program's involvement in Kevorkian's battle may be just
beginning. Michigan prosecutors Monday subpoenaed CBS for an
unedited copy of the videotape to help them decide whether to
prosecute Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the show's incendiary content, protests were few in
Boston, where ``60 Minutes'' airs on WBZ-Ch.4. Michele Walsh, a
spokeswoman for Channel 4, said the station received only about 20

911'' had gathered and offered to Channel 7.

``Just because you can do something doesn't mean you do it.''

COMMENTARY: A PATTERN OF DECEPTION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Kenneth Starr was a smooth witness, a seeming Straight
Arrow. But when you look at what he actually said _ look at his
answers to questions _ he was as straight as a corkscrew.
</P>
<P>
   1. Monica Lewinsky was confronted by Starr's agents in a hotel
last Jan. 16. Wasn't it their purpose, he was asked in the House
Judiciary Committee hearing, to get her to wear a wire and record
Vernon Jordan or the president?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not,'' Starr said. Then he obfuscated that seemingly
flat denial by saying: ``We said one of the things that a
cooperating witness can do is assist us in consensual monitoring.
We described that at a high level of generality.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury _ in tears
_ that Starr's people had pressed her to tape Betty Currie, the
president's secretary, Jordan and possibly the president. Clinton's
lawyer, David Kendall, produced an FBI interview report showing
that Ms. Lewinsky's mother and father mentioned her not wanting to
wear a wire.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ms. Lewinsky, when surrounded by Starr's agents on Jan. 16,
immediately said she wanted to talk to her lawyer, Frank Carter.
The agents disparaged Carter and discouraged her from calling him.
Abbe Lowell, the Democratic committee counsel, asked about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not encourage someone who is involved in felonies, as
we thought at the time, to in fact reach out to a lawyer,'' Starr
replied. He added, ``There is a very clear distinction in the law
and in the rules of ethics between civil matters and criminal, and
Carter was representing her in the civil matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were astounding statements for a lawyer to make. The law
requires that a suspect who asks to talk to her lawyer be allowed
to do so. Federal regulations explicitly require a lawyer's
presence when an immunity deal is being discussed, as it was.
Prosecutors have no right to reject a suspect's choice of a lawyer
on the ground that he was retained originally for civil matters.
</P>
<P>
   3. Starr was asked in the hearing whether he had requested
Attorney General Janet Reno to assign the Lewinsky matter to him.
In 250 wandering words he seemed to deny that, saying he had
``worked collaboratively with the Justice Department'' on the issue
of jurisdiction. Ms. Reno's petition to the court to appoint him,
now public, said, ``Independent Counsel Starr has requested that
this matter be referred to him.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla, asked, ``Did your agents threaten
Monica Lewinsky with 27 years in prison?'' Ms. Lewinsky said they
did just that in pressing her to cooperate. Starr took 125 words in
reply, without answering the question.
</P>
<P>
   5. Kendall asked about the extreme pressure reportedly used by
Starr and his agents to make Julie Hiatt Steele, a witness in a
collateral matter, testify as he wished. Starr was indignant. Four
hundred words later he had not answered the question.
</P>
<P>
   6. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Kendall asked about what Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson has called ``serious and repetitive prima
facie violations'' by the Starr office of the law against leaking
grand jury material, rule 6(e) of the federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Starr bobbed and weaved over hundreds of words without answering
a straightforward question: Had he or his staff committed what the
court has defined as violations of 6(e)? He said that was ``an
unfair question.'' He said he could not answer because Judge
Johnson had ``sealed'' her inquiry into the leaks. But the judge's
order does not bar honest answers to the question.
</P>
<P>
   7. The New York Times reported last month that a partner in
Starr's law firm, Richard Porter, had helped steer Linda Tripp to
him. Asked about that, Starr said, ``I'm not recalling that
specifically,'' and ``I have not conducted an investigation.'' As
if he had never heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pattern of evasion, stonewalling, falsification. Starr
even said he would ``have to search my recollection'' to answer
questions as obvious as when he had concluded that President
Clinton was not responsible for Travelgate or Filegate.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Starr's defenders argue that it does not matter what he
did _ only his conclusions count. That way lies the rot of liberty
for all of us. To say that a prosecutor may abuse witnesses and
violate the law in pursuit of his quarry is to forget bitter
lessons of history.

FOUR QUIT GOVERNMENT POSTS OVER TELEBRAS TAPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Four senior government officials
resigned Monday, scalded by accusations that they might have tried
to influence bidding on the nation's giant telephone system this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The officials included Communications Minister Luiz Carlos
Mendonca de Barros, who had been favored to take a newly created
post as production minister next year; his brother, Foreign Trade
Secretary Jose Roberto, and Andre Lara Resende, president of the
National Bank of Economic and Social Development.
</P>
<P>
   The three offered their resignations on Sunday night in a
meeting with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Monday the vice
president of the development bank, Pio Borges, also stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations occurred two weeks after tapes of secretly
recorded conversations between the communications minister and the
bank president were leaked to the press. On the tapes the two were
heard discussing how to increase the chances for Banco Opportunity,
whose senior officers were former officers of the development bank,
to win in the bidding for one of the 12 companies sold in the $19
billion privatization of Telebras, the giant telephone holding
company, in July.
</P>
<P>
   In five hours of often stormy testimony before Congress last
week, however, Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros argued that the tapes
had been edited to malign him and that he was acting only to
increase the sale price and, thereby, government revenues, by
insuring the presence of strong competitors in the bidding.
Eventually the consortium led by Banco Opportunity dropped out of
the bidding for Tele Norte Leste, after it had bought into another
phone utility.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros was not directly
implicated, he said he was quitting out of solidarity with his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The case has temporarily distracted the Congress, which faces
votes on a series of austerity measures to bolster investor
confidence. The first task is to cut government spending and raise
taxes to reduce the 7 percent budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Political and economic analysts described the case as an opening
chapter in the larger maneuvering as Cardoso selects a Cabinet for
his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso has asked the ministers to remain in their posts until
he can nominate successors this week, suggesting that the president
did not have ready candidates. Nevertheless, few people expect the
four resignations to delay $20 billion in privatization efforts
next year, largely in electricity businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect will be greater monitoring on the part of the
market and the press than what was already done,'' the manager of
the research department at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo, Sidney Chameh,
said. ``But I don't see in any way the privatizations can stop
because of this process.''

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After six weeks of labored effort to rebound from
bronchitis, most of it spent at resorts and dachas far from the
Kremlin levers of power, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
developed a high fever and pneumonia on Sunday and spent Monday in
Moscow's best hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring doctors' advice, as he often does, Yeltsin summoned
China's president, Jiang Zemin, to his suite at Moscow's Central
Clinical Hospital for a long-scheduled state visit. Russian
television broadcast silent film of the two men in conversation,
Yeltsin gesticulating forcefully, but looking wan in a black
cardigan sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion lasted 30 minutes, half of what was planned. A
presidential spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, called it ``a good
working meeting,'' and said the two men talked about international
affairs and prospects for a strategic alliance between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward how Yeltsin was feeling, Jiang said simply,
``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin suggested that not everyone agreed with that
diagnosis. ``Doctors were not too excited about his meeting with
the head of the Chinese state today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is Yeltsin's fifth stay in a medical clinic _ and his
second bout with pneumonia _ since bypass heart surgery two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lately Yeltsin has had to struggle almost visibly with his
increasing irrelevance in daily affairs. A growing number of
federal legislators have called on the president to resign and make
way for new elections. Yeltsin insists he will remain in office
until his term expires in 2000, and on Monday he said he does not
intend to allow his frailty to loosen his grip any further on the
nation's top office, which gives him sweeping constitutional powers
and control of Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But political commentators talk of a ``creeping coup'' in which
Yeltsin gradually fades away and his rivals take control, and late
last month, senior aides said baldly that the president planned to
let Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov run things while he turned his
attention to constitutional reform and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Yeltsin is in fact as ``OK'' as Jiang claimed was hard
to tell. The 67-year-old president entered the hospital after
spending Sunday at his country residence with a fever as high as
102 degrees. Aides said he is being treated with antibiotics and
bed rest. Yakushkin assured reporters early in the day that
Yeltsin's temperature had vanished. But hours later, he said
Yeltsin had again developed a low fever and was neither better nor
worse than in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has seemed increasingly susceptible to lung infections
in recent years, but observers say he sometimes displays other
symptoms of illness, including trembling, inability to concentrate
and difficulty walking. On Monday Yakushkin speculated that the
president became ill out of grief over the slaying of Galina
Starovoitova, a pro-democracy legislator and former Yeltsin adviser
who was gunned down last weekend in St. Petersburg. Her death has
become a cause celebre here among politicians and citizens alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a person he knew well, he worked together with,''
Yakushkin said, ``so he took the news to his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Pneumonia patients normally remain in the hospital eight to 10
days, Yakushkin said. He added that Yeltsin would stay as long as
is needed to recover completely.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin already had relapsed once during this six-week
recuperation from bronchitis, which began during a trip to
Uzbekistan on Oct. 11. After two weeks under doctors' orders to
rest _ a prescription to which Yeltsin only partly adhered _ the
president was ready for a trip the next week to Vienna, Austria,
for a meeting with the president of the European Union, aides said
on Oct. 23. But within days, Yeltsin was sick again, this time with
what doctors called physical and nervous exhaustion, and Primakov
was sent in his stead.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has been largely away from the
Kremlin, resting at a fully equipped medical center in the Barvikha
sanatorium outside Moscow, at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, or at
his two country homes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yeltsin has held meetings with foreign leaders,
including Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan, Primakov has effectively run the
government.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Primakov was issuing statements that were
simultaneously soothing and unnerving. Russia, he said, does not
plan to declare a state of emergency or to take any steps that may
``lead to dictatorial aspects in government'' in response to a
rising tide of political violence and anti-Semitism. But
law-enforcement agencies must move to assure an orderly transition
to new elections which, he said, ``I hope will be held in 2000,''
perhaps a slip of the tongue reflecting the uncertainty surrounding
Russian politics these days.

MEDIA VOICES RISE AGAINST `DEATH AS ENTERTAINMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after 7 on Sunday night, Mike Wallace of CBS's ``60
Minutes'' asked Dr. Jack Kevorkian, ``Is he dead now?''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian replied: ``He's dying now, because his oxygen's cut
off and he can't breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, as videotape showed 52-year-old Thomas Youk's
head tilting upward as his life ended, television crossed a
dangerous line, according to several TV analysts who Monday
assailed CBS for broadcasting footage of Youk's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awfulness of death has been transformed into a form of
news entertainment,'' said Marvin Kalb, the former CBS News
correspondent who heads the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thistle, director of broadcast journalism at Boston
University, agreed, saying it was ``not only inappropriate, but
very disturbing'' that CBS televised a videotape of Kevorkian
administering a lethal injection to Youk, a Michigan resident who
suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ```60 Minutes' has been setting the standard,'' said Thistle.
``And if this is the new standard, then, God, we're all in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally disquieted was TV historian Steven Stark. In his book
``Glued to the Set,'' Stark singled out ``60 Minutes'' as among the
60 television shows that ``made us who we are today,'' but he
swiftly changed the channel Sunday night when the footage involving
Youk came on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pornographic,'' said Stark. ``It's just a
different kind of pornography. I'm not surprised that television
would do this, because television will do anything now, but for `60
Minutes' to cross the line is pretty significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Also troubling to Stark was the timing of the broadcast, early
on a Sunday evening. ``Sunday night still is traditionally the
night when families gather together to watch television,'' said
Stark. ``To put it on then, when any kid can see it, is just
horrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy snowballed, CBS News Monday released a
statement: ``It is a hallmark of `60 Minutes' to explore complex
and often controversial issues in a fair and responsible way. Mike
Wallace's report on Dr. Jack Kevorkian goes to the core of an
important national debate. CBS News believes this program performed
a public service.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics argue that CBS actually rendered a service to
Kevorkian, who videotaped himself apparently causing Youk's death
on Sept. 17 and then brought the tape to ``60 Minutes.'' Kevorkian
has said he gave CBS the videotape because he wants to force
authorities to arrest him, thereby creating a legal showdown over
assisted suicide and euthanasia. ``The issue's got to be raised to
the level where it's finally decided,'' Kevorkian told Wallace,
adding, ``I've got to force them to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kalb nor Thistle saw the broadcast, but both were
dismayed by CBS's judgment. Kalb said he is troubled that CBS
allowed itself to be used as a forum for ``a cause as sensitive and
controversial as Kevorkian's,'' and also that the network took the
unusual step of airing footage it did not shoot itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very uncomfortable with the idea that a program as good as
`60 Minutes' allows itself to be used for a cause,'' he said. ``It
gets into tricky terrain when you begin to use tape shot by others
who represent causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Thistle: ``What bothers me is that the choreography of
this thing serves the individual, Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes'' broadcast aired during the final Sunday of
the all-important November ``sweeps,'' a period during which
viewership is closely measured to set future advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   A ``60 Minutes'' spokesman, Kevin Tedesco, denied that CBS aired
the footage to drive up ratings. ``We've never done anything for
sweeps,'' said Tedesco. He pointed out that ``60 Minutes'' has
included a foreign story _ often a turnoff among viewers _ in each
of its programs this month.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Sunday-night broadcast racked up higher
ratings than usual. Nationally, according to Tedesco, major-market
estimates showed ``60 Minutes'' receiving a 16 rating and a 24
share, compared with the show's recent average of a 14.4 rating and
a 22 share. In the Boston area, according to Nielsen Media
Research, more than 388,500 households tuned in to ``60 Minutes,''
as the broadcast garnered an 18.5 rating and a 28 share.
</P>
<P>
   The program's involvement in Kevorkian's battle may be just
beginning. Michigan prosecutors Monday subpoenaed CBS for an
unedited copy of the videotape to help them decide whether to
prosecute Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the show's incendiary content, protests were few in
Boston, where ``60 Minutes'' airs on WBZ-Ch.4. Michele Walsh, a
spokeswoman for Channel 4, said the station received only about 20
calls complaining about the broadcast. Tedesco said that CBS ``has
not been inundated'' with complaints since the show aired.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the fact that a respected TV news program would
broadcast the death of a human being left many news veterans
feeling queasy and wondering whether less responsible outlets might
push the envelope even further.
</P>
<P>
   As he pondered the implications, Thistle thought back to the
night Carol DiMaiti Stuart was murdered in Boston in 1989. At the
time, he was news director at WHDH-Ch.7, and he had an opportunity
to air footage of the murder scene, which the TV show ``Rescue
911'' had gathered and offered to Channel 7.

   ``We never even thought of airing that,'' Thistle declared.
``Just because you can do something doesn't mean you do it.''

44 POLICE OFFICERS ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION ARRESTED IN MEXICO CITY 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In an anti-corruption crackdown ordered by Mexico
City's new police chief, detectives arrested 44 city officers
Monday on charges that included murder, rape, extortion and abuse
of authority.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's attorney general, Samuel del Villar, called the
roundup ``an unprecedented effort to impose the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrest warrants for some of the officers had been issued as long
as six years ago but had never been served. A week ago, Police
Chief Alejandro Gertz Manero, a former university rector who took
office in August, announced that violent crime is soaring because
mafia leaders are defying attempts to end police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, he ordered about 215 city police officers whose
names appeared on lists of arrest warrants compiled in Mexico City
and three neighboring states to report Monday morning to several
police precincts and a downtown police training academy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 officers who showed up were detained by scores of
city detectives, many wearing masks. But only 44 of them were later
identified positively as men whose names were included on the
arrest warrants, Del Villar said. Some of those summoned failed to
appear, he said, and others were able to prove that although they
may share similar or identical names with those sought for crimes,
they were not the wanted individuals. Del Villar did not give
details of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the officers who were arrested belong to the city's
Auxiliary and Banking Police, two government-controlled agencies
with a total of 59,000 uniformed officers whose services are rented
out to banks, corporations and wealthy individuals. The officers
stand sentry outside office buildings or serve as bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mexico City has 35,000 traffic and beat officers,
known as preventive police and 3,700 plainclothes detectives, known
as judicial police; none of those officers were arrested Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Del Villar and Gertz work for Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
who is expected to run for president in 2000 representing the
leftist party he formed in 1988. The success he and his aides show
over the next months in curbing violent crime is likely to be a
major factor in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' presidential opponents will include candidates from
President Ernesto Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party,
known as the PRI, and from the pro-business National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   If Monday's action was dramatic, it did little to reduce the
enormous number of Mexican police who are wanted for crimes but
remain at large, authorities acknowledged. Thousands of officers in
federal, state and municipal police agencies are still wanted in
connection with serious crimes, at least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who have have not been arrested are protected by
corrupt superiors. And others avoid arrest because chaos in the
country's judiciary and police systems prevents authorities from
matching the names of corrupt officers with the warrants for their
arrest.

AS EXPECTED, STUDENTS SCORE LOW ON ACHIEVEMENT TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ More than half of Massachusetts public school students
who took tough new tests last spring scored poorly, while the
results released Monday showed two encouraging areas among
elementary and middle school students.
</P>
<P>
   In all three grades tested _ 4th, 8th and 10th _ a majority of
students scored in the ``failing'' or ``needs improvement''
categories in English, math and science, with only one exception:
most eighth graders did well in English.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth grade students performed the worst overall, with 50
percent failing the mathematics test, the highest failure rate for
any subject.
</P>
<P>
   In science and technology, fourth graders did the best, with 48
percent scoring in the top two levels, prompting some state
officials to say education reform, which began when these students
were in kindergarten, is working.
</P>
<P>
   But that theory did not explain why 80 percent of fourth graders
scored in the ``needs improvement'' or ``failing'' categories in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results are unacceptable,'' said Gov. Paul Cellucci at a
press conference Monday. ``This is not where we want to be. But
there are some signs of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests, given to students in public, charter and pilot
schools, will be used as a condition of graduation for this year's
8th graders. The passing score for a diploma has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Parents will get their child's individual results in the mail,
or sent home in backpacks, toward the end of next week, perhaps by
Friday, Dec. 3. School districts will get their school-by-school
and classroom-by-classroom results starting Monday, with a general
release to the public Dec. 7, state education officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the test results announced Monday, while low, were
better than what state education officials had predicted. Education
officials have said the test was deliberately made to reflect
learning standards they want schools to work toward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have predicted 25 percent of fourth grade students
failing in every category,'' said Michael Sentance, chief
educational advisor to Cellucci. Fifteen percent of fourth graders
failed the English test, 23 percent failed the math test and 12
percent failed the science and technology test. ``I was pleasantly
surprised....I think it is ambitious to think everybody will be in
advanced and proficient'' categories, Sentance said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the ``needs improvment'' and ``failing'' categories
are used as a measure, the three worst areas of performance were
4th grade English, (81 percent in those categories), 10th grade
science (76 percent) and 10th grade math (74 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Using a combination of those who scored as ``advanced'' or
``proficient,'' the three best areas of performance were 8th grade
English (55 percent in those categories), 4th grade science (48
percent) and 10th grade English (38 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   In every grade, math gave students the most difficulty _ but it
was also where the greatest percentage of students ranked as
``advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators, state and teacher union officials stressed Monday
that school and district results _ the most detailed the state has
ever released _ will not indicate ``good'' or ``bad'' schools.
Instead, they said they will provide a unique chance for parents
and teachers to see exactly what each student's weaknesses are, and
work on them.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as schools receive their scores, they can start applying
for grants out of a $20 million state pot set aside to provide
remedial aid to students. Some remedial programs already being set
up include before and after school tutoring sessions and Saturday
school.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also announced he will file a bill, likely in January,
to test all state teachers for competency, not just teacher
candidates, who are already tested. Cellucci had filed a bill
earlier this year but it did not go anywhere in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the largest state teachers' union, meanwhile, said
the MCAS scores should only be used as a benchmark for improvement
in schools, not as a measure of how schools are performing now. He
said Cellucci was ``overstating'' the grimness of the scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are what they are,'' said Stephen Gorrie, president of
the Massachusetts Teachers Association. ``And we don't need to get
into whether they were higher or lower than expected. They are a
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and educators said that while it is inevitable that
comparisons will be made among districts, they intend to try to use
these scores mostly as a way to improve teaching in areas where
classes performed poorly. Many were waiting for their individual
child's scores as far more meaningful than the state averages.
</P>
<P>
   Most perplexing about the results, educators and parents said,
was the high level of achievement by eighth graders in English
Language Arts, and the poor achievement of fourth graders in the
same subject.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Statewide, elementary school literacy has been a cornerstone
of many school districts' reform efforts in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   After the test was administered, teachers and even state
education officials said that while the eighth grade test appeared
fair, some fourth grade English questions were for students as much
as two grades higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes hand in hand with what teachers were saying,'' said
Caridonio.

 &HT;    Jordan stays close to home, signs with Atlanta
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In another reaction to shortcomings of 1998, the
Atlanta Braves began Monday to refurbish their outfield by signing
free agent Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   A .316 hitter last season in a career year with St. Louis,
Jordan was second only to Bernie Williams in quality outfielders
available on the open market this offseason and will take over the
right field spot jointly held by since-traded Michael Tucker and
Gerald Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had to withstand a late rush by the Baltimore
Orioles, who over the weekend had modified their offer to Jordan to
cover five seasons at approximately $40 million. Atlanta
essentially matched that offer, paying Jordan $3 million next
season with a $4 million signing bonus. He will draw $7 million in
2000, $8.5 million in 2001, $6 million in 2002 and $9 million in
2003. The Braves also own an option for a $10.5 season in 2004,
when Jordan would turn 37, with a $2.5 million buyout clause.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees and Mets also showed serious interest, but
their resolve waned after the outfielder visited New York last
week.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival marks Jordan's second in Atlanta, the first in 1989
when he signed with the Atlanta Falcons and began an NFL career
that culminated in 1992, when he was named an alternate to the Pro
Bowl. Although Jordan spent his entire baseball career with the
Cardinals, he never moved away. His wife Pam and two children live
in Alpharetta, Ga.'s Country Club of the South, where his home is
just behind new teammate Tom Glavine's.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is the Braves' second acquisition this offseason,
following the Nov. 10 deal for second baseman Bret Boone, and
becomes the sixth new name in the lineup since Opening Day 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves might not be finished with the outfield, either.
Talks with free agent outfielder Steve Finley are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Although questions remain about Jordan's durability _ he has
been placed on the disabled list six times since arriving in St.
Louis in 1992 _ he showed last season the depth of his
capabilities. Jordan set career-high totals in average (.316),
homers (25), triples (7), runs (100), hits (178) and on-base
percentage (.316) and will give the Braves their highest offensive
profile at the position since David Justice left for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, he immediately improves the outfield. Both the
Orioles and Yankees pursued him as a center fielder for his
superior range, and Jordan's 12 assists attest to one of the league
strongest arms. In 1995, he made only one error in 272 chances,
narrowly missing a St. Louis record set by Curt Flood for an
errorless season.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting third and fourth in the batting order in previous
years, he was used last season either second or fourth, on either
side of record-setting homer-hitter Mark McGwire. With his speed,
the Braves could use him at No. 2, although he probably is destined
to hit fifth behind Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wrist injury to Galarraga in 1992 that accelerated
Jordan's arrival in the majors, his first season with the Cardinals
after signing a baseball-exclusive contract to end his three-year
Falcons career.

CONNECTICUT ALREADY CARRYING HEAVY DEBT, ANALYSTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State borrowing analysts say Connecticut is already
considered a high debt state, even before adding any financial
burden that may be incurred by financing a new stadium for the New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Moody's Investors Service ranks Connecticut first or
second in the two categories it uses to compare state debt.
</P>
<P>
   It ranks first in the nation in per capita debt, at $2,962 per
person. Massachusetts is third at $2,329 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut ranks second in the nation in debt as a percentage
of aggregate personal income, at 8.7 percent. Massachusetts is
third at 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Connecticut's indebtedness is already so considerable
the additional debt caused by the stadium financing won't be
significant enough to raise red flags on Wall Street, increase debt
so significantly that it would present major concerns for Wall
Street, or result in any rating change, some analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The state's total debt is already $9.7 billion, among the
highest in the nation, and borrowing even $500 million for the
stadium simply will not make that much difference for investors,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly a high debt state,'' said Timothy Blake, a
senior analyst for Moody's. ``But it is also the wealthiest state,
in terms of per capita income. In fact _ the wealthiest. Both of
those things are going to be weighed in any decision to increase
the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake and other analysts agreed the state has taken steps in
recent years to spend portions of budget surpluses on lowering the
debt and building revenues for the following budget year _ steps
Wall Street likes to see.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Connecticut has only begun to recover job
losses from the recession of the early 1990s, lagging far behind
Massachusetts in terms of job growth in the decade. And the stadium
deal might be perceived as a small dose of economic help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stadium proposal is consistent with what the governor has
done, to date, and what programs he has put out there for urban
areas,'' said Claire Cohen, the co-chairman of Fitch Investors.
``So there may be that argument to make when it comes time for more
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I am always a little leery of when you see
these stadium proposals come through that say they will have all
sorts of major revenue simply because you are bringing in a sports
team,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Connecticut's debt has paid for developing the
University of Connecticut campuses and for transportation
infrastructure.

MASSACHUSETTS LAWMAKERS WAITING FOR CONNECTICUT TO ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The game clock may be running out, but Beacon Hill
playmakers say they aren't about to try a Hail Mary pass to keep
the New England Patriots in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci took a wait-and-see attitude, saying
Monday there was little Massachusetts could do until the
Connecticut legislature comes to some decision about the deal
Governor John Rowland struck to bring the Patriots to Hartford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is'' anything the state can do, Cellucci
said, citing a clause in the Hartford deal that forbids Patriots
owner Robert Kraft from negotiating with another state until
December 31. ``I think the deal with Connecticut is an exclusive
deal until the legislature in Connecticut acts.''
</P>
<P>
   If Connecticut lawmakers don't pass acceptable legislation,
``then we will certainly try to go back to the table here,''
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Thomas Finneran, whose objections to having
the state acquire the land around the Foxboro stadium is widely
viewed as the sticking point to an agreement here, hold out little
prospects of reaching a compromise even if the Connecticut
agreement dies.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Finneran said he would then consult House members about
whether they wanted to do something more. But he added: ``Their
view hasn't changed for three years. ... They will help with
infrastructure, but they are not getting into bricks, mortar, or
land acquisition, which we think is a dreadful precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Cellucci said he didn't think the failure to strike a
deal that would keep the Patriots in Massachusetts necessarily
presaged problems in helping the Red Sox with a new field to
replace Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in much better shape in terms of the Red Sox
because I think you are going to see a lot more consensus,'' said
Cellucci. ``The mayor wants them, we obvious want them, and I think
that is going to easy to put together.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Finneran seemed uncertain on that score as well,
saying that any plan that would require the state to help a
franchise acquire land would be viewed skeptically in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I am still not convinced that we will cross the
line, create the precedent, and start subsidizing the Red Sox
because of this unfortunate decision made by the Patriots,''
Finneran said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the state does get into the business of land acquisition,
Finneran asked, what would happen if Edward Johnson III, chairman
of Fidelity Investments, comes to the state ``and says, `Hey that
was nice, the Red Sox have 50 employees and the Patriots have 100.
I have 15,000, build me my office tower.' ''

TYCO AGREES TO BUY AMP, TOPPING ALLIED SIGNAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyco International said Monday that it had agreed to buy AMP
Inc. for $11.3 billion, or $51 a share, topping a $9.7 billion
hostile takeover offer by Allied Signal for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The offer from Tyco, the largest provider of security systems
and best known for its ADT alarms, was widely expected to end
Allied Signal's almost four-month-old $44.50 a share battle for
AMP, a leading maker of electrical connectors.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts were predicting that Allied, also AMP's
largest shareholder, might try to block the deal, Allied said
Monday that if the deal was successful, it would sell its 20
million shares, or 9 percent holding, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price being paid by Tyco clearly exceeds the value we
place on AMP,'' said Lawrence A. Bossidy, Allied's chief executive.
``We believe our gain on the AMP shares we own will substantially
exceed our costs incurred in pursuing AMP.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if the Tyco deal is unsuccessful, Allied would still be
interested in buying AMP, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create a company with a total market
capitalization of approximately $54 billion, total annual revenues
of more than $22 billion, and operations in more than 80 countries.
AMP's revenues, about $5.5 billion in 1997, would account for about
25 percent of the revenues of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's chairman and chief executive, said
his company considered buying AMP after Tyco was approached by AMP
executives who were interested in a sale of the company. Almost
since the Allied deal was announced, AMP's board of directors and
Robert Ripp, the chief executive, have been opposed to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, after rumors began arising that AMP was seeking
a friendly offer to thwart Allied, and Ripp made statements
indicating that AMP would consider other purchase offers, many
believed that AMP executives were trying to keep the company
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Ripp will remain as president of AMP and gain a seat on Tyco's
board. Most members of AMP's senior management will keep their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlowski said the acquisition would add 12 cents a share to
Tyco's earnings in the current fiscal year, which started Oct. 1,
35 cents a share in the 2000 fiscal year and up to 50 cents a share
in the 2001 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Cost savings of about $210 million are forecast during the first
six months, with an additional $550 million expected in two years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, largely through cost savings, Tyco expects to
increase AMP's operating margin from about 9 percent to about 20
percent a year within two years.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts questioned whether the cost cuts and
increased profitability forecast by Tyco and AMP were realistic.
Some also wondered why Tyco had decided to make a bid for AMP. The
main business of the Harrisburg, Pa., company is considered
cyclical and had experienced slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a show-me company,'' said William Milton, an analyst
at Brown Brothers Harriman. ``There has been no sustained earnings
growth at this company in over 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Donnelly, a vice president and senior portfolio manager
at Federated Investors, which owns about two million AMP shares,
said aside from Ripp, who took command at AMP in late summer, ``one
thing that is disturbing is that they're sticking with the same
management team that has been failing for six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Tyco's closing price last Friday of $65.0625 a share,
each AMP shareholder would receive 0.7839 share of Tyco stock for
each share of AMP.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms, AMP shareholders could receive as much as
$55.95 a share. But if Tyco's share price falls below $60, either
AMP or Tyco could terminate the deal. AMP is prohibited from
entering into another merger agreement before Nov. 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, AMP shares rose $3, to $48.125, a 52-week high. Tyco
shares rose 43.75 cents, to $65.50. Allied Signal shares rose $1,
to $42.8125.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year and a half, Tyco had agreed to spend more than
$13.4 billion to expand its four main businesses: security systems,
medical products, valves and electronics. The AMP acquisition would
be Tyco's largest. Also Monday, Tyco announced plans to buy Sunbelt
Plastics for about $85 million in cash. The Monroe, La., company
manufactures film products.
</P>
<P>
   The Tyco-AMP deal would be accounted for as a tax-free pooling
of interests, meaning that the balance sheets of Tyco and AMP would
be combined. If the purchase had been a cash deal, the difference
between the price paid for AMP and the market value of its assets
would be recorded as good will, which would have to be written off
over a period of years.

CLINTON OFFERS SUPPORT TO GUAM CITIZENS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AGANA, Guam _ President Clinton made a rare public appearance
Monday before U.S. citizens who live 15 time zones from Washington
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has shied away from public events since the White
House sex scandal exploded in January, wrapped up a five-day trip
to Asia with a brief stop here to assure residents of Guam that he
supports their right to determine their own political status.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to Washington late Monday where an impeachment
inquiry by the House is under way. But a half a world away it was a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people gathered by a windswept shore to welcome
Clinton to this island, a key battleground in World War II and
still dominated by a U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous local residents, sweltering under a burning
afternoon sun, were reminiscent of a campaign crowd as they
applauded warmly and waved U.S. flags.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation into his affair with a White House
intern began in January, Clinton mostly has attended private
fund-raising dinners or events with invited guests. The president
has appeared in public events only a handful of times.

   Clinton came bearing gifts, prompting to establish a network of
senior White House and Cabinet officials to review the policy
concerning U.S. territories. He said Defense Secretary William
Cohen will designate an aide from his office to review Guam's
concerns on military issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our administration has reviewed your commonwealth proposals.
We have tried to offer viable alternatives. I want Congress to act
to help the people of Guam meet their challenges and give you more
effective self-government,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will also respond seriously if the people of Guam seek a
different political status. It is your decision to seek that,''
Clinton told the flag-waiving crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Guam, a U.S. territory, was confiscated from Spain during the
Spanish-American War in 1898. Japan conquered the island in 1941
after declaring war on the United States, but Americans retook the
territory in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are U.S. citizens with limited self-governing
authority similar to a state. However, they are allowed only
nonvoting representation in Congress, and they cannot vote for
president. They do not pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't get one single vote in a Guam precinct,'' U.S.
delegate Robert Underwood joked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to seek more money from Congress to help they
meet the needs of the thousands of Micronesians who are moving to
Guam for work, placing a financial burden on the island's education
and health systems.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the U.S. military would begin returning more unused
land to the territory, announcing a 7,300-acre former Naval Air
Station would be returned soon.
</P>
<P>
   Guam was the last stop on Clinton's Pacific itinerary which
included Japan and South Korea. The president sought to emphasize
the Asian economic crisis during his trip but North Korea's refusal
to allow Americans to inspect an underground bunker suspected of
being nuclear related dominated both stops.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also visited a war memorial in honor of the people who
died on the island during World War II and who helped U.S. soldiers
retake the territory from the Japanese.

UPROOTED LIVES GROUNDED IN SONG
</HEADLINE>
 REVIEW-HAUMAN-NYT  (ms) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American soprano Constance Hauman has immersed
herself in the cabaret and operatic music of composers who fled the
Nazis in the 1930s and wound up in Los Angeles working in the movie
business. Theirs is a story of lives tragically disrupted and of
artists forced to adapt their talents to commercial American
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   To present the music, and the story, Ms. Hauman has created a
multimedia concert called ``Exiles in Paradise,'' which she
performed on Saturday night at the 92nd Street Y. But, for all the
research and effort involved, the presentation was curiously
muddled.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the event was a concert of cabaret songs and
operetta arias by composers with lasting legacies, like Schoenberg,
Weill and Korngold, and by others whose ultimate achievement was
thwarted by the havoc of their exiles, like Frederick Hollander,
Emmerich Kalman, Walter Jurmann and Eric Zeisl (who, for example,
would later write the score for the 1943 movie ``Lassie Come
Home'').
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed between the songs, Ms. Hauman provided commentary
on the rise of the Nazis and the fascist crackdown on German
culture. In addition, there was a montage of film clips (``The Blue
Angel,'' ``San Francisco,'' Leni Riefenstahl's ``Olympiad'') and
video, slide and film collages conceived by Ms. Hauman and created
by Richard Baim and Louis Klahr.
</P>
<P>
   The background information was useful. But the music and the
effect of Ms. Hauman's singing were overwhelmed by the visual
imagery, some of which was powerful though familiar (goose-stepping
troops, Hitler taking Paris), some of which was trite (the
surrealistic film collages).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a major element that distinguishes cabaret from other
vocal music is the primacy of words, and in this regard, Ms.
Hauman's decision to perform many of the songs in German without
translations was unhelpful. And when she sang in English
translation, her diction was often unclear. Obviously, providing
printed texts would have diluted the dramatic effect she was after
in the darkened hall. But it would have been inconceivable to, say,
Schoenberg, that anyone listening to his ``Brettl-Lieder'' would
not understand the words.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hauman knows the style of this music, but her voice, though
strong, was occasionally tremulous and harsh in tone. She was much
better when she scaled back her sound for songs like Eisler's ``To
Those Who Come After.'' Her pianist, William Vendice, played with
stamina and elegance. Ultimately, however, this was a jumbled
context in which to hear some fascinating music.

GROUP CALLS FOR NEW METHOD TO JUDGE STUDENT KNOWLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Saying the MCAS tests are poorly written and lack a
``recognizable educational purpose,'' a coalition of educators
Monday said the state should scrap the test and find another way to
assess students.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-person panel includes Vito Perrone, director of teacher
education programs at Harvard Graduate School of Education; Deborah
Meier, winner of a MacArthur Foundation genius grant, many
teachers, and FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass. group that opposes
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the group said that many of the test questions
involved simply memorizing material or formulas that could allow
teachers to teach directly to the test. Passages were poorly
written and long-winded, they said, and some directions and
graphics were confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad test,'' said Meier. ``It's more incoherent than
most tests I've seen. Generally, when you give a test, you test on
a specific subject matter. There was a kitchen sink approach to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other educators want the state to grade each of the
state's roughly 200,000 students individually, based on a portfolio
of their work that would include examples of their work over
several years
</P>
<P>
   As an example of their complaints about the test, the group said
the following question on the 4th grade science/technology portion
was not ``straightforward:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which of the following is a trait that a dog does NOT inherit
from its parents?'' Students could choose from four answers: the
length of its fur, the shape of its nose, the size of its appetite,
or the color of its fur. The correct answer is the size of its
appetite.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release, the group asked, ``Is it possible that a
child would ask, ``Don't big dogs eat more than little dogs?'' Does
size have a tie to parentage? Is metabolism related to inheritance?
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the new exam said it was designed to test
students' depth in a subject. They say using some form of a
standardized test is necessary because most students will have to
take such tests to achieve goals like getting into college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows there are kinks to work out; this is the first
year,'' said Linda Neri, of Mass Insight, a non-profit group that
favors the MCAS as a teaching and learning tool. ``But it doesn't
mean there are major problems with the program.''

HYGIENE SURVEY REVEALS THE SMELLS IN FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The French invented perfume because they had to. In the
17th century, even Louis XIV seldom bathed.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 20th century, 96 percent of the French live in homes
equipped with showers or baths, even more than those with bidets.
But only 47 percent bathe every day, according to a roundup of
national surveys published in the daily Le Figaro last week, just
before a cold wave began and probably drove the average down even
further.
</P>
<P>
   Washing their dirty linen in public like this is something the
French seem to do every two or three years. In the latest survey,
only 60 percent of Frenchmen were found to change their underwear
daily, the same percentage of all French people who said they
regularly washed their hands after going to the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   This last figure led Bernard Pivot, host of a popular literary
television program, to wonder publicly on Sunday about the wisdom
of the French custom of shaking hands with co-workers at the start
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Pivot worried about what advice to give employees
who faced the hazard of running into the boss just outside the
office bathroom. Underlings not knowing what the hand that feeds
them might just have touched, he suggested, would be best advised
to forestall a handshake by picking up a voluminous file.
</P>
<P>
   Le Figaro assured readers that 85 percent of them said they
washed their hands before meals. But 6 percent said they never
washed them at all, perhaps explaining why the per-capita
consumption of toilet soap in France was four to five bars a year,
compared with a little more than twice as much in Germany and a lot
more than twice as much in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And even at that, Gerard Nirascou of Le Figaro wrote, people
might be lying. Are Frenchmen lying when only 50 percent of them
say they use deodorant? Unlikely, judging by recent experience in
overheated rooms _ unless some are saying yes when they haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Le Figaro's scent survey drew on sources ranging from the
Federation of Perfume Industries and the government-supported
Health Education Committee to the Sofres public opinion polling
organization. It led The Times of London to conclude in a headline,
``It's True: The French Really Are the Smelliest in Europe.''

FEDEX'S CULTURE OVERWHELMS ITS PILOTS

 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Callers to the message line of the Federal Express pilots union
just last Thursday were reassured that the pilots had Fedex on the
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pulling together to fight for our families and our
careers,'' Byron Cobb, the union's vice president, said in the
message. ``The plan is working.''
</P>
<P>
   But later that same day at an emotional meeting at the union's
cramped headquarters in Memphis, Tenn., senior pilot after senior
pilot stood up and pleaded with union leaders to call off a
threatened holiday strike.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots were worried that the company would do what Fred Smith,
Federal Express' founder and chairman had threatened: keep
shipments going without them by spending tens of millions of
dollars to contract out flights and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were people who knew Fred Smith, and said he was
serious,'' said Bob Clement, a union spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the fledgling union, which represents 3,500 pilots
at Fedex, raised the white flag, agreeing to suspend its strike
threat in exchange for the company's pledge to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express' stunning victory stands in stark contrast to
the experience of other passenger and cargo airlines, where pilots
have maximum leverage over management _ and are not reluctant to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, pilots at Northwest Airlines shut the carrier down
for 15 days. Earlier this year, the pilots at Fedex's archrival,
United Parcel Service, which was still recovering from last year's
strike by Teamsters, received the richest contract in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Federal Express, which Smith conceived in a 1965
Yale undergraduate term paper and which has since grown into the
world's largest express freight company, managed to succeed where
other companies have failed is a result of a seductive corporate
culture, a weak and inexperienced union and the skillful use of a
classic divide-and-conquer strategy that isolated the union
leadership and aroused the fears of its members.
</P>
<P>
   Whether vanquishing the pilots is ultimately a Pyrrhic victory
is another question. If Fedex, which has no other unions, presses
this current advantage too hard, it may be left with bitter and
resentful pilots at a time when some other Federal Express
employees are beginning to warm to efforts by unions to organize
them.
</P>
<P>
   The talks with the pilots, which resumed Monday, are expected to
result in a tentative agreement quickly. But the company has made
it clear that the cost of the planes and trucks that have already
been leased means that it will be forced to offer the pilots less
than the proposal they rejected last month.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have never been very popular with Smith, who is now
chairman of Fedex's parent, FDX Corp. He successfully fended off
several efforts by the Teamsters and others to organize workers in
the company's early years. His philosophy has been that if
employees are treated well, they will provide superior service to
customers _ and they will have no need to turn to organized labor.
(Smith declined requests to be interviewed.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, even part-time hourly workers who sort the 1.5 million
packages that whip by nightly on high-speed conveyor belts at the
giant hub in Memphis receive comprehensive health insurance,
tuition reimbursement and other benefits. Many of the workers are
students or have other full-time jobs but ``work the sort'' from 11
p.m. to 3 a.m. expressly for the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also made a point of promoting from within. An
impressive number of its managers _ including many at the highest
levels _ started their careers at Federal Express as hourly workers
and remain fiercely loyal to the company and its signature purple
color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got purple blood,'' declared Brenda Saulsberry, 42, a
mother of three, who has worked at Fedex for 10 years, most
recently in customer service. She spoke while attending an employee
rally last week to support Federal Express in its showdown with the
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally _ which was heavily supported, if not entirely
orchestrated, by the company _ thousands of Fedex workers took to
the streets in Memphis waving placards and singing the company
anthem. (``We carry dreams and plans to a hundred lands. We're the
best way to ship it everywhere.'')
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was so enthusiastic that it erupted into wild applause
after a Filipino employee delivered a statement of support in
Tagalog from workers at Federal Express' hub in Subic Bay. ``Did
you even understand what I said?'' she asked before reading a
translation.
</P>
<P>
   But as the company has tried to squeeze more productivity out of
its workers in recent years, many employees, especially those
outside Memphis, where Fedex is the largest employer, have started
to bridle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have actually been losing ground for the last eight or 10
years,'' said Dan Proffitt, a tractor-trailer driver in
Indianapolis who has worked for Federal Express for 23 years and is
now an organizer for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   It was the pilots, in fact, who helped establish the Fedex
culture. In the company's early days, they pitched in to load the
planes as well as fly them. Smith, a former Marine aviator who flew
missions in Vietnam, was known to hang out in the crew lounge.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, such camaraderie waned as the pilots complained
about heavy work schedules and pay that lagged behind those of
pilots at unionized companies. While Federal Express pilots earn on
average between $130,000 and $142,000 a year, they have not had a
substantial wage increase in more than 10 years and have fallen
behind their peers at several other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   And without union representation, the pilots were not entitled
under federal law to the same retirement benefits enjoyed by their
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pilots might have had a contract earlier if their
ranks had not been so divided. After the Air Line Pilots
Association narrowly won the right to represent them in 1993,
pilots rejected the contract the union had negotiated. Many felt
that the union, which has contracts at 50 airlines, was too
strident.
</P>
<P>
   Then in March, pilots voted down a second tentative agreement
negotiated by the Fedex Pilots Association, a more moderate
in-house union, which replaced ALPA in 1996, because the pact did
not deliver enough.

PATRIOTS, OFFICIALS CONCEDE REVENUE SHORTFALL IN DEAL FOR TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite original claims that the multimillion-dollar deal to
move the New England Patriots to Hartford would be paid for
entirely by new payroll taxes and increased ticket prices, both the
team and Connecticut officials conceded there would be huge
shortfalls, particularly in the first years after the football
team's relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Direct tax revenues generated by the Patriots in Hartford would
cover only about half of the annual interest payments associated
with the $350 million financing of the downtown stadium project,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to current estimates, the state's annual interest
payments on bonds issued to finance the stadium and surrounding
infrastructure will total about $25 million a year for 30 years,
according the state's Executive Office of Finance. But the Patriots
would directly generate between $12 million and $15 million in
income, sales, and usage taxes in 2001, when the stadium is
scheduled to be completed, team officials say.
</P>
<P>
   By those calculations, nearly half the debt would not be covered
by new revenue. At least not right away. Team officials estimate
payroll and other taxes will increase about 6 percent a year,
eventually reaching the amount necessary to cover the debt
obligations, which would be flat over the life of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The revenues start out slow and they build,'' said Dean
Pagani, spokesman for Connecticut Governor John Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   When asked at what year the new revenues would equal the
project's annual debt, Pagani said, ``I can't answer that question
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are three missing components to the revenue
estimates: the amount of money to be generated from games by the
University of Connecticut football team, which also will use the
stadium; revenue from any international soccer matches and as many
as five concerts at the stadium; and indirect economic benefits
such as tax revenues from new restaurants, hotels, and parking
lots.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding signed by
Rowland and team owner Robert Kraft Thursday, the state would
receive all revenue from Huskie games and other state-sponsored
events at the stadium, including a new 10 percent tax on tickets.
</P>
<P>
   This season, UConn's estimated income from game tickets,
programs, and concessions at the five home games at Memorial
Stadium in Storrs at $330,900. Ticket prices there range from $6 to
$12 in the 16,200-seat facility, according to Kyle Muncy, a
spokesman for the division of athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final numbers will be in the (auditor's) report,'' Pagani
said, referring to an independent consultant's report on the
financing package expected to be completed next week. ``Right now,
UConn revenues are not a major part of the formula considered when
putting this deal together. The biggest chunk of money would come
from NFL football,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That revenue would come from the Patriots' payroll, sales,
usage, and corporate taxes, scheduled to be at 7.5 percent in 2001.
Connecticut's personal income tax rate is 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is unclear how much other revenue the stadium will
generate outside of Patriots games.
</P>
<P>
   But Benson Cohn, head of Connecticut's Executive Office of
Finance, said preliminary feasibility studies show the bonding for
the stadium and associated costs _ including land, infrastructure
improvements, and architect and lawyer fees _ would amount to $25
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a reasonable number to use,'' Cohn said. ``And we are
pretty well within that (bond) cap and the stadium would not put us
over, though I don't know the exact numbers. But that's been
checked.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's bond cap is 1.6 times the previous year's net
general fund revenue, Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   On the revenue side, the Patriots generate nearly $10 million in
sales, income, and usage taxes in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Total payroll for the team and staff is currently $80 million.
The salary cap for players in the NFL is $53 million, but because
of signing bonuses, the team exceeded that ceiling this year.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap is expected to grow by 8 to 10 percent a year
and, by 2001, could be between $100 million and $110 million,
according to team vice president Jonathan Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Hartford deal, all tickets will have a 10 percent tax,
as will club seat and luxury box sales. Premium seats, if all are
sold, would generate $45 million a year, Kraft said, or $4.5
million in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That component of the tax is unprecedented on the premium
portion in the NFL,'' Kraft added. ``This is more lucrative to the
state because it will grow. Over 30 years it will grow in
proportion to the success of the team. It could grow to $25 million
a year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the state has guaranteed to pay for any unused luxury
seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not heard one rumbling about any uneasiness about the
deal,'' said Connecticut House Speaker Thomas Ritter, a Democrat.
``That guarantee is something the state will never have to step
into.... I can't believe that's going to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The total ticket tax revenue _ assuming an average $45 price on
60,000 seats _ would add another $2.7 million over 10 homes games.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, admission taxes would amount to about $7.2 million in
the first year, in addition to the $5 million in new income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not sales taxes or other things,'' Kraft said. ``This
is strictly a user tax that is financing this thing.... It's
revenue negative for the first few years. Then it grows.''

 UNDATED: deliver enough.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By this summer, widespread discontent had united the pilots
against the company. In particular, there was a growing sense that
the company had been taking advantage of the years of protracted
contract negotiations by unilaterally changing the pilots' work
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of working 14 days a month, you were working 16 days a
month for the same pay,'' said David Slatinsky, an Airbus A300
captain who began flying for the company in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Berwyn, who has been flying for Federal Express for 13
years, most recently as a DC-10 captain, said she became alarmed in
1996, when the company sent her a letter telling her that the time
she spent on pregnancy leave the year before was being deducted
from her length of service at the company, an important determinant
of pay.
</P>
<P>
   After she complained that she did not have the time deducted
following her two previous pregnancies, she was told that those
leaves would be deducted retroactively. ``This is the issue that
made me realize that we needed a set of rules that would be applied
fairly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever lingering doubts some pilots had about supporting
the union were erased in June after the company introduced a new
computer system to generate their complex flight schedules. The new
software sought to schedule the company's 326 jets as efficiently
as possible. But it sent many pilots on grueling trips across
dozens of time zones with only minimum rest between flights.
</P>
<P>
   Fedex acknowledged that there were problems but insisted that
they had been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pilots no longer trusted the company. More than 95
percent were now members of the union, compared with 62 percent
just a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   When contract negotiations began in July, the pilots asked for a
large wage increase on top of a one-time payment to make up for the
raises they had not received since 1993, increased retirement
benefits, and a series of new work rules.
</P>
<P>
   The talks dragged into the fall, and the union threatened to
strike during the peak holiday season. The results of the strike
authorization vote were scheduled to be announced on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, the company gave the pilots what it said was its
final offer and set a midnight deadline. The union said it needed
more time.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Federal Express withdrew from negotiations and
began leasing planes and trucks and assuring customers that it
would continue to serve them even if the pilots struck.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Fedex could have operated without its pilots will never
be known. But then the company was never planning to operate
without pilots: Its strike contingency plan was based in part on
the assumption that many pilots would cross the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many, but I know there is a large number
of Federal Express pilots committed to providing service to our
customers should there be a strike action by our union,'' Theodore
Weise, Fedex's president and chief executive, said in an interview
last week.
</P>
<P>
   No one understood the divisions among the pilots better than
Federal Express executives, as they sought to prevent the union
leaders from getting the more than two-thirds vote they needed to
call a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were told in letters from Weise that the company
would move forward with or without them. And last week's raucous
employee rally showed many pilots that unlike UPS, where most of
the workers are unionized, they could expect little support from
Fedex's 140,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The union leaders themselves did little to help their cause.
They were short on experience and had little support from the
national labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials who dealt with the Fedex union said they were
surprised by its lack of knowledge of the Railway Labor Act, the
arcane law that governs union activities in the airline industry.
And a Wall Street analyst who met with union leaders earlier this
month and insisted on anonymity said he was shocked when they told
him that they had a war chest of only $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is like playing poker and showing the other guy your
hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the pilots surrendered after the company leaked word
to them on Thursday that it was preparing to lay off 500 pilots
this week and to announce that it had leased more airplanes to be
flown by outside pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that Smith is an unconventional individual in the way
he responds to things,'' said Cobb, the union vice president,
sugarcoating the defeat, ``we had to do something unconventional to
get his attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb insisted that the union has not lost its leverage, because
it has agreed only to delay any potential strike for at least 60
days. But a walkout hardly seems likely, because package volume
drops precipitously after the holidays, making it easier for the
company to weather a strike.
</P>
<P>
   And while the rank and file could vote down an agreement _
indeed many pilots lashed out at union leaders at a meeting on
Sunday in Memphis _ that is also unlikely because it now appears
that any contract would be better than no contract at all.
</P>
<P>
   Like other workers at Federal Express, the pilots are once again
placing their faith in Smith's benevolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really will show his true colors to the world,'' Cobb said,
referring to the new contract negotiations. ``It's the greatest
opportunity for him to do the right thing.''

GERMANY'S GREEN PARTY POSITION CHALLENGES NATO NUCLEAR DOCTRINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ As NATO defines the new strategy it will unveil on its
50th anniversary next year, Germany's new government of Social
Democrats and Greens has irked the United States by tentatively
suggesting that NATO should renounce the possible first use of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The German position is no surprise. It was part of the coalition
agreement reached last month by the government, a clear concession
to the environmentalist Greens. The accord said the coalition would
press for ``the renunciation of the first use of atomic weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear to American officials at the time whether
Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democrat who is the new chancellor,
had accepted the phrase as an empty concession to the Greens or
would in fact move to question one of the central tenets of NATO
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is firmly opposed to any change in the
doctrine allowing first use of nuclear weapons, arguing that it
proved an effective deterrent during the Cold War and remains one
today against new threats like chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen brushed aside the German idea
during a news conference Monday at the Pentagon. He said the
alliance's policy on using nuclear weapons _ an extension of U.S.
policy _ was ``sound doctrine'' that had been reaffirmed after the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has always reserved the right to start a
nuclear war, arguing that the threat of nuclear strikes helps deter
attacks, both conventional and strategic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an integral part of our strategic concept,'' Cohen said,
``and we think it should remain exactly as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the alliance said Schroeder raised the issue
in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana in Berlin
two weeks ago. He did so in a highly tentative manner, asking what
response Germany's allies would give if the new government pursued
the renunciation of the first-strike option.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister and a member of the Green
Party, returned to the question in an interview in this week's
issue of the magazine Der Spiegel. Asked about the first use of
nuclear weapons, he said that he had raised the matter with Solana
and that ``we will have to discuss these matters because we see
things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Steinlein, a spokesman for Fischer, said Monday that the
foreign minister favored a discussion on the role of nuclear
weapons, but one undertaken ``in a framework of solidarity.'' In
any event, he said, Germany would under no circumstances isolate
itself in NATO.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States, Britain and France all firmly opposing
any shift in the approach to the use of nuclear weapons and with
unanimity required for any change, Germany's new position will not
alter NATO doctrine. But members are concerned that if Germany
presses the issue, a divisive debate could be ignited that touches
on the heart of the trans-Atlantic bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 200 nuclear weapons systems in Germany, Britain,
Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium,'' a NATO diplomat said. ``They
are a powerful deterrent, and their credibility would be undone
without the first-strike option. They are also the basis of our
link with America, and we must be careful to avoid any risk of
decoupling.''
</P>
<P>
   If Germany formally suggests a review of the first-strike
doctrine at NATO, it would be likely to gain some support from
Denmark, Canada and Greece. The United States is keen to avoid such
a discussion on basic doctrine when much work remains to be done on
other aspects of the ``new strategic concept'' that is due to be
announced at a 50th-anniversary NATO summit meeting in Washington
in April. The conference will try to lay out NATO's new roles in
peacekeeping, countering the spread of weapons, and defending
against chemical weapons, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Scharping, the German defense minister and a Social
Democrat, was scheduled to meet with Cohen and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in Washington Monday and Tuesday. He is certain
to be forcefully reminded of Schroeder's pledge to President
Clinton that his government would maintain ``continuity'' in
foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such continuity is particularly important on the fundamental
tenets of alliance nuclear policy,'' an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Scharping, apparently distancing himself from Fischer, said on
his arrival in Washington: ``I do not think there will be a problem
between Germany and the United States on first nuclear strikes. One
cannot consider this issue only from the German point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Germany swiftly drops the issue of first use of
nuclear weapons, its emergence reflects tensions between the Social
Democrats and Greens and the hastiness with which the government
program was put together.
</P>
<P>
   Karsten Voigt, a Social Democratic Party security expert, said
that in negotiations before the formation of the government, his
party's position was that the pursuit of a renunciation of a first
nuclear strike should not be in the program. ``But in the general
haste, we caved into the Greens, and now it is an unfortunate piece
of baggage that has become part of the government's commitments,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ludger Vollmar, a Green Party member who was particularly
adamant about the issue, is now a junior minister under Fischer.
Although the Greens have moved a long way from their initial
pacifism, strong anti-militarist currents persist in the party.
Fischer, a pragmatist, cannot ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said they hoped that some of the German concerns
would be assuaged by opening discussions on faster and steeper
moves toward nuclear disarmament. ``Beyond that, we are confident
that the Social Democrats will rein in the Greens and insure that
this matter is not aggressively pursued,'' one said.

   &UR; Leaving `Irrelevant' London &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tomasz Starzewski, the British designer whose shows have been a
staple of London fashion week, will establish a company and
introduce his collection in New York beginning in February during
the joint women's and men's wear presentations.
</P>
<P>
   The London shows, he said, are increasingly irrelevant to his
business, coming late in the season after he has filled most of his
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Starzewski, whose women's collection is sold in stores like Saks
Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Bergdorf Goodman, will
also introduce his first men's wear line on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   He has attracted a loyal following among women like Ivana Trump,
who has flown to London to attend his shows; Diana, the Princess of
Wales, was a steady customer.
</P>
<P>
   These clients tell much about Starzewski's style: showy, baroque
clothes. But the runway in February will display a new, sparer
look, which has been evolving for two years, he said. ``The
collection's changed a lot,'' Starzewski said from his London
studio Monday. ``Still, it has to be very feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   Starzewski makes no apologies for the overly dressy clothes that
made Princess Diana a 10-year customer and which he will continue
to sell by special order to those women in the public eye who want
them. ``She represented a lot of the older look,'' he said.
``Because of the requirements of her public position, you always
have to make clothes that stand out so they don't look like they're
mixing with the public,'' Starzewski said. ``I learned that it has
to be color. It can't be pared down. It can't be understated.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Tiara Evolves &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fashion must often dabble in extremes before it finds its
natural level of creative expression and acceptance. Out of the
fantastical trend for tiaras in the last year has evolved a less
flamboyant look: richly beaded and hand-painted barrettes or
jeweled hair bands, which are fixed in the hair with combs.
</P>
<P>
   These heirs to the tiara carry forward the romantic, dressed-up
look it heralded a year ago, but without the unwelcome drama.
Gerard Yosca has designed jeweled barrettes like little crowns,
which are sold at Bloomingdale's, Scoop, Neiman Marcus and Saks
Fifth Avenue. The fashion jewelers Erickson Beamon have created
beaded hair bands for Barneys New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tiaras are a little unwearable,'' Yosca said. ``This is a
little more discreet.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popular interest in accessorizing hair, magazines
are still pushing unadorned locks, Yosca noted. Yet the trend
toward hair ornaments is growing stronger. ``At retail and on the
street, it's all over,'' he said. ``It's a trend by the people, for
the people. It's getting in touch with your girlie side.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debut With Pythons &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The python hangers are the first clue: Cesare Fabbri is a
designer who cares about detail and luxury. Fabbri, an Italian, has
his first collection in American stores, including Linda Dresner,
Barneys New York, Neiman Marcus and Hirschleifer's in Manhasset,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many say the hangers must be a print,'' Fabbri said. But they
are not. And it is the craftsmanship needed to stretch the skin
over the frame and not the skin itself that makes them indulgently
expensive. (They are for display only.) Similarly, the fresh way
Fabbri _ who designed Oliver, Valentino's secondary line for four
years _ marries classic fabrics with handiwork makes his designs
notable.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, retailers were taken with his multibeaded sweaters and
subtle shadings of mauve, lavender and purple against the season's
gray. For spring, a dress in oatmeal-colored cashmere wraps around
the torso like a ruched column, or it can be unwrapped and worn
like a tube dress. A jacket patterned after an African djeballa is
decorated with a spray of beads along the front opening. A
golf-inspired leather jacket has elastic side gussets, mimicking
the stretch gussets in golfing gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way he uses his fabrics, it's very new,'' said Lori
Hirschleifer, a vice president of Hirschleifer's. ``The knits are
spectacular and eye-catching.''

AOL DEAL COULD IMPACT US CASE AGAINST MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The proposed buyout of Netscape Communications
Corp. by America Online Inc. offers help to people making two
contradictory arguments: that Microsoft Corp. has too much market
power, and that it has not much power at all.
</P>
<P>
   If one case can be made more forcefully than the other, it could
have an impact on the government's prosecution of Microsoft on
antitrust charges, which is now in its sixth week of trial.
</P>
<P>
   That trial is examining whether Microsoft illegally used its
market power to hinder rivals and limit competition in the software
market. The government's Exhibit A has been Netscape, whose browser
software once had a commanding lead among consumers _ until
Microsoft started producing its own browser.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Microsoft, according to the government, promoted its own
browser by forcing partners to sign deals that allegedly hindered
them from distributing Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial Monday, an economist testifying for the government
said the proposed merger between AOL and Netscape _ which is in
negotiations _ &UR;  &LR;  shows that Microsoft was able to hurt a key rival
so severely that it needed aid in the form of a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This potential merger is the result of Microsoft's actions in
these exclusive contracts, and other actions,'' said the economist,
Frederick Warren-Boulton. ``It is unfortunate to see the
disappearance of a firm like Netscape, ... one of the brightest,
newest stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft countered that the buyout shows that it has little
control over the software market. ``The proposed deal shows that
the government's case was, and is, unnecessary. Microsoft's
competitors have always had the ability and the resources to change
the competitive landscape, and to do that virtually overnight,''
said William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   That point could prove crucial. To prove its case, the
government must show that Microsoft holds monopoly control over a
portion of the software market, and that it used illegal means to
protect or extend that monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has argued that it is not a monopoly. One proof, it
says, is that the market changes quickly, and competitors can
appear from nowhere. The arrival of a combined Netscape-AOL &UR;  &LR; ,
aided by a new alliance with Sun Microsystems &UR;  &LR; Inc., could help
Microsoft make its point in court.
</P>
<P>
   Several antitrust experts said that both sides could cite the
proposed Netscape-AOL &UR;  &LR;  deal with validity in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both arguments can be true,'' said Lisa Wood of the Boston law
firm Nutter, McClennen &AMP; Fish. The Netscape deal ``shows that
strength is a temporary phenomenon that will soon be checked by a
new competitor that none of us has been able to imagine. But at the
same time, it shows the weakness of Netscape, if that was ever in
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed merger gives fuel to both sides in the case,
it will probably mean little to the outcome, said Eleanor Fox, an
antitrust specialist at the New York University School of Law.
``The trial concerns acts already done,'' she said. ``What happens
after the case goes to trial does not have a specific bearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Whyman, an Internet specialist at Legg Mason Precursor
Group in Washington, a research concern, said, ``This deal may help
Microsoft in the courtroom, but it might hurt them more in the
marketplace than it helps in court.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal could revitalize Netscape's browser as a rival to
Microsoft's, and it gives Sun a hand in promoting its Java software
as a partial replacement for Microsoft's Windows operating system,
Whyman explained. Those developments could hurt Microsoft, he said.

LIGHT SENTENCE IN CANADA MERCY DEATH IS OVERTURNED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ An appeals court on Monday overturned a light sentence
in a mercy-killing case and ruled that a Saskatchewan farmer,
Robert Latimer, must serve at least 10 years in prison for killing
his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   The tougher sentence has reopened one of the most passionately
argued issues in Canada and made it likely that the Supreme Court
will be put in the position of deciding difficult right-to-die
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The emotionally wrenching details have already deeply divided
Canadians. After Latimer's conviction a year ago, groups
representing the disabled and handicapped were outraged at the
two-year sentence he received for killing his daughter, who had a
severe but not terminal case of cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   They said such a light sentence cheapened the lives of people
with illnesses or disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But right-to-die groups saw the fact that he did not receive a
heavier sentence as proof that current laws did not adequately
reflect contemporary attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions were stirred again Monday when Saskatchewan's highest
court found that a lower-court judge had erred last year in
accepting a jury's plea for a reduced sentence for Latimer, 45,
after he was convicted of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been sentenced to life imprisonment, with no
chance of parole for 10 years. But Judge Ted Noble of the Court of
Queen's Bench, a provincial court, granted him a rare
constitutional exemption and sentenced him to just two years, with
half to be served on his farm in Wilkie, Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Saskatchewan Court of Appeals overturned the
earlier ruling and sentenced Latimer to life imprisonment, with at
least 10 years to be served before any parole.
</P>
<P>
   He surrendered to the police and was held briefly in the jail in
Wilkie until he was released on bail Monday evening, said his
lawyer, Mark Brayford. Brayford said he had filed an application
for appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Latimer has never denied that he killed Tracy in 1993 but
contended that she had been in constant pain and her weight had
dwindled to just 40 pounds.

STANFORD IS BUILDING ON THE FOUR-YEAR PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ As the clock wound down on Stanford's 76-51
victory over Southwest Missouri State on Friday night, the
rambunctious student section at Maples Pavilion decided to give its
team a proper send-off to one of basketball's biggest stages. It
began chanting, ``New York City! New York City!''
</P>
<P>
   The victory assured the third-ranked Cardinal (3-0) a spot in
Wednesday's semifinals of the preseason National Invitation
Tournament at Madison Square Garden. Stanford will be returning to
the Garden for the first time in seven years _ its third appearance
there over all _ to face St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Stanford played in the Garden, it captured the
1991 post-season NIT, defeating Oklahoma by 78-72. In 1936, the
all-American Hank Luisetti led Stanford to a 45-31 victory at the
Garden over Long Island University.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times for Stanford, whose basketball success has
usually been achieved by the women's program. Stanford has graced
the covers of several preseason publications as the No. 1 team in
the country, including Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven letter-winners, including all five starters, return from
a team that last season raced to an 18-0 start and made its first
Final Four appearance since 1942 before succumbing to the eventual
national champion, Kentucky, by 86-85 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not used to that here,'' said the junior forward Mark
Madsen, referring to the expectations. ``All the rankings has been
a surprise to a lot of us. Is there pressure? Yeah, there's a
little bit of pressure. But we have to always remind ourselves that
we're here to have fun. Let's enjoy the journey and let's not get
caught up in the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery, it is a pinnacle that he has
been building toward since he took over for Tom Davis in 1986.
Before departing after four mediocre seasons, Davis summed up his
coaching experience at Stanford by saying it was impossible to win
here. Twelve years later, Stanford finds itself not only winning,
but also expecting to win.
</P>
<P>
   In an era where many star players turn pro early, Stanford has
built a program whose players stay all four years and graduate on
time. But it is not a recent phenomenon at Stanford. In the last
nine years, Todd Lichti, Adam Keefe and Brevin Knight have all gone
in the first round of the National Basketball Association draft
after playing four years at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brevin's case, I think he needed that extra year to prove
himself,'' the senior center Tim Young, a teammate of Knight's for
three seasons, said. ``But a lot of it is liking the experience you
have here that makes you want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The seniors Kris Weems, Arthur Lee, Peter Sauer, Mark Seaton and
Young have a bond that has developed as the program rose from a
near-upset of Marcus Camby and No. 1 Massachusetts in the second
round of the N.C.A.A. tournament their freshman year to a first
Sweet Sixteen appearance the following year to last season's Final
Four run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Montgomery wants guys to stick around,'' Madsen said.
``He likes his players. He works us very hard, but he treats us
fairly. He's into improvement. He's into building a strong
basketball program, and that comes with having seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guys on the team like being here at Stanford. I
think they like going to class, and they want to get their degrees.
So from that standpoint, there's a certain incentive to stick
around.''

FASSEL ENCOURAGED BY WORK OF GRAHAM, JUREVICIUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A day later, Giants Coach Jim Fassel did
not try to sell Sunday's 20-0 victory over Philadelphia as anything
more than progress for a team that had been adrift. But Fassel was
not letting go of what worked for his team against the Eagles
either.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel affirmed his support of the new starting quarterback,
Kent Graham, and surprisingly intimated that Graham could not lose
his job even with a subpar performance against the San Francisco
49ers Monday night. Fassel also called the rookie wide receiver Joe
Jurevicius, who had a coming out party of sorts against the Eagles,
the future of the team.
</P>
<P>
   And Fassel insisted that the Giants would have to rely heavily
on the running game as they did against the hapless Eagles, even if
the opponent is San Francisco, which went into this past weekend's
games as the National Football League's sixth-best team against the
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are what we are,'' Fassel said. ``That's how we have to
play and that's fine. We haven't broken a lot of long runs but
that's how it's going to be. Last year, we would wear people down.
We'd win with a punishing-style running game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did run for 123 yards against the Eagles Sunday, but
the noteworthy plays _ at least as they related to the
attention-grabbing quarterback change _ were long pass plays from
Graham to Jurevicius and Amani Toomer. Fassel and Graham were asked
Monday to explain why Jurevicius and Toomer, who have been
generally underused this season, were suddenly getting more
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and Graham said it was not because Graham was more used
to working with the second-string receivers like Jurevicius and
Toomer, though on Sunday Graham admitted that he was a little less
familiar with the starting receivers, Chris Calloway and Ike
Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balls went to where the coverage dictated,'' Fassel said.
``That's how the game shakes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid was that Danny Kanell, whom Graham replaced, had
become predictable, rarely looking beyond Calloway and Hilliard,
even if the play called for him to turn toward Jurevicius or Toomer
if Calloway and Hilliard were covered. Among the most significant
mistakes Kanell made in his last start was throwing into double
coverage and rushing his decision-making so that downfield
receivers were not given proper consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Graham threw the ball downfield to Jurevicius for a 59-yard gain
after scrambling out of the pocket. He found Toomer for a 25-yard
pass play after reading a Philadelphia blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, against the Eagles, who fell to 2-9, it may have been
easier for Graham to have the time to consider all his options.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in San Francisco will clearly present a different set of
problems. In their last four games in San Francisco, the Giants
have not scored a touchdown, even though they won one of those
games _ the 15-12 victory in the 1991 National Football Conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll go after them confidently,'' the coach said of
the 49ers. ``I believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Graham's effort and progress, Fassel was
generally positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kent played a solid game,'' he said. ``I think he did
a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what it would take for Graham to lose his starting
status, Fassel said the criterion was much the same as it was for
Kanell _ Graham would have to appear to lose confidence, something
that negatively affected his decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought Graham could regress that much one game
later _ in other words, if Graham could lose his job in San
Francisco _ Fassel answered:
</P>
<P>
   ``He could. That's a small chance. I've seen it happen, but
talking realistically, you're talking about more than one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he did not know what it would take for him to hold
his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep winning, that would probably be enough,'' he said
with a smile. ``Otherwise, Jim hasn't told me anything different
than what he's said publicly. That's the way I figure it's going to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the Eagles' game as one step, but obviously I can
play a lot better. I know I'll have to be considering the test
we've got this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius enjoyed the aftermath of his first two-reception game
with the Giants, although he knew he would be reminded that he had
also dropped two passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a 50-50 game,'' Jurevicius, the team's
second-round pick, said. ``I did some things right, did some things
wrong. Overall, I think that's uncharacteristic of me. I can play
without the mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Joe,'' he said. ``He's a guy that is the future around
here. He's a young guy that can develop and go on. He's prone to
young mistakes, which is fine, but you can see that he played a
good game and is improving. That's what matters.''

HENRY HAMPTON, PRODUCED `EYES ON THE PRIZE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo. ) (rl) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Hampton, an Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker whose
series ``Eyes on the Prize'' was hailed by many critics as the
definitive look at the nation's early struggle over civil rights,
died on Sunday in Boston. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton had the bone marrow disease myelodysplasia, which arose
from a treatment for lung cancer. He had surgery last week to
repair a hematoma in his brain, said his nephew, Jacob ben-David
Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong chronicler of the poor and the disenfranchised,
Hampton began his career in 1963 as a spokesman for the Unitarian
Universalist Association in Boston, a strong voice in the
civil-rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's true moment of revelation would come two years later,
during the ``Bloody Sunday'' march in Selma, Ala. The event, led by
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., degenerated into violence when
police beat some 600 marchers trying to cross the Edmund Pettus
Bridge, a moment Hampton would later credit as inspiring him to
undertake ``Eyes on the Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who suffered from polio as a teen-ager and walked with
a limp, was near the back of the march and watched the violence
flare ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said he realized then was the enormous care and warmth
of the people involved in this terrifying event,'' said Judy
Richardson, the associate producer for ``Eyes on the Prize.'' ``He
wanted to show their strength, not their weakness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton returned to Boston and in 1968 founded Blackside Inc., a
film company whose mission, in his words, was to explore
``democracy, diversity, culture and civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of a book-stuffed office in Boston's South End,
the company produced more than 60 documentaries and films on
subjects ranging from the life of Malcolm X to the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Hampton undertook his most ambitious project, a
six-hour survey of the civil-rights movement that would eventually
be televised by the Public Broadcasting Service in 1987. It was a
concept born that afternoon in Selma and fostered by what Hampton
said was a lack of black perspective on the movement.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with most civil-rights films, Hampton said in a 1986
interview with The New York Times, was ``that they have always been
done by whites who depicted black folks as poor, downtrodden and
brutalized primitives.'' His version would show that ``it was the
strength of blacks that made the civil-rights movement happen, with
support from some whites.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the lynching of a 14-year-old Mississippi boy in
1954 and continuing through to the signing of the Voting Rights Act
of 1965, Hampton and his crew wove together narration, newsreels
and interviews into a series that explored the nation's first steps
in the direction of racial equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes on the Prize'' would win four Emmy awards and the Peabody
Award for excellence in broadcast journalism. After a brief
commercial release, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for
best documentary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Hampton would return to the subject for ``Eyes on the
Prize II,'' an eight-hour look at the civil-rights movement from
1965 to the mid-1980s. It, too, was well-received and won two
Emmys. The program was immediately preceded by a book by Hampton
and Steve Fayer with Sarah Flynn, ``Voices of Freedom'' (Bantam
Books, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   Hampton and his company continued to produce a broad range of
work, including a seven-hour examination of the Great Depression in
1993 and the five-hour series ``America's War on Poverty'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His work was widely hailed by political and arts organizations;
in 1990, Hampton received the Charles Frankel Prize from President
Bush for being one of five Americans who made outstanding
contributions to the humanities.
</P>
<P>
   After years of scraping for and charming his way into funding,
Hampton received an $800,000 grant in 1996 from the National
Endowment for the Humanities. The fruit of that money was ``I'll
Make Me a World,'' about African-American artists in the 20th
century, which is scheduled to be shown early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was born in St. Louis, where his father was a surgeon at
the city's black hospital and his mother was a homemaker. He
received a bachelor's degree in English at Washington University in
St. Louis, and later received 14 honorary degrees from universities
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sisters, Viva Hampton Zimmerman and Judith
Hampton, both of New York.

COURTING WOMEN BIG AND SMALL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The name Max Mara doesn't resonate with American
women the way Giorgio Armani's does, but the Max Mara company
outsells Armani around the world. At last count, it was $906
million to $846 million annually. Why? Because the clothes offer
timely fashion in luxury fabrics at less than astronomical prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still less known is Marina Rinaldi, Max Mara's plus-size
division, but by bringing youthful styling to a category that was
once dowdy and matronly, it has gone far to change the way women
who wear large sizes dress.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mara offers Italian-made clothing in silk, cashmere, alpaca,
leather and other fine fabrics, the same caliber of materials found
in designer clothing but at lower prices. If a woman wants a
cashmere blazer, say, she can find one with a Max Mara label for
less than $1,000, as opposed to at least $2,000 for one with a
designer name attached to it. While the company is known for its
classics, it also hops on trends like the leather skirts and
jackets and the mirror appliques in its spring 1999 collection.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Rinaldi also uses cashmere, silk and leather, generally
in sophisticated colors like gray, camel and black, in clothes with
simple slenderizing lines. Some of its new customers remember when
large-size clothing meant pastel polyester pants suits and tentlike
dresses with flounces. Marina Rinaldi was in the vanguard of
companies that brought fashion to the category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max Mara is not cutting edge, but classic fashionable clothing
in beautiful fabrics,'' said Lynne Ronan, a senior vice president
and general merchandise manager of Saks Fifth Avenue, which has an
in-store Max Mara boutique and sells the Marina Rinaldi collection
in its plus-size department, Salon Z. Marina Rinaldi's prices range
from $250 for a skirt to $5,000 for a mink-trimmed coat. Sizes are
10 to 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plus-size customer wants to look exactly like everybody
else,'' Ms. Ronan said. ``We work with a lot of manufacturers to
put more fashion into the clothes. Marina Rinaldi is an important
resource for us. It's a high-quality product, beautifully made, and
it has the right fit.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, fit was a prime concern in the plus-size
category, one that the Max Mara company recognized early on. ``We
started making large sizes in 1979,'' Luigi Maramotti, the
co-managing director of Max Mara, said on a recent trip to New
York. ``What we did was what everybody else was doing: stretch from
regular sizes. But that is totally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizing patterns upward in the usual way results in overly broad
shoulders and long sleeves, low waistlines and baggy crotches in
pants. But women who wear size 16 or 18 aren't necessarily taller
than a size 8. Mode, the magazine for plus-size women, estimates
that 62 percent of American women wear size 12 or larger. (Not all
those women can afford Marina Rinaldi or comparable prices and
still have a hard time finding fashionable clothes.)
</P>
<P>
   So Max Mara set up an independent company devoted to perfecting
pattern-making and called it Marina Rinaldi, after Maramotti's
great-great-grandmother, who owned a dress shop. There are now 170
Marina Rinaldi company-owned boutiques in Europe, Asia and the
Middle East, as well as in-store boutiques in Bloomingdale's, Saks
and Bergdorf Goodman. The label represents about 20 percent of Max
Mara's business.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mara has ambitious plans to make both the Max Mara and
Marina Rinaldi lines important players in the United States, as
they already are in many countries around the world with 700
company-owned stores.
</P>
<P>
   The big push started in 1994, with the opening of a Max Mara
boutique on 68th Street and Madison Avenue. That was followed by 14
more stores around the country, by the doubling in size this fall
of the Manhattan store, the opening of a Marina Rinaldi store on
Madison Avenue last month and the arrival this month of Max Mara
and Marina Rinaldi boutiques on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. A
party in Los Angeles on Dec. 3 will celebrate the opening of the
two boutiques. A dinner will follow a private screening of a
restored version of the 1948 film ``Joan of Arc'' starring Ingrid
Bergman. The co-chairwomen of the event are Jodie Foster, Isabella
Rossellini and Winona Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Avedon photographed the current Max Mara advertising
campaign, which features the model Maggie Rizer with a Joan of Arc
hairdo. Marina Rinaldi's ads, with the slogan ``Style is not a size
. . . it's an attitude,'' has a whimsical quality, with a
healthy-looking model making gravity-defying leaps. The ads run in
fashion magazines and on billboards and bus shelters.
</P>
<P>
   All this is in aid of a company that has never set the fashion
world on fire yet managed to attract customers like Ms. Rossellini,
Minnie Driver and C.Z. Guest.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Rinaldi is the first plus-size line to be carried by
Bergdorf's, said Joseph Boitano, the store's executive vice
president and general merchandise manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd always done some large sizes, but mostly on a
special-order basis,'' he said. ``We knew we had a customer who
wore large sizes and could buy other things here, but not
ready-to-wear. So we went into the market knowing that anything we
bought had to be on a par with the quality of the rest of the
store. Marina Rinaldi is at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   For spring, Bergdorf's will add the new Rebecca Moses large-size
line as a complement to Marina Rinaldi, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marina Rinaldi stores at 800 Madison Ave. (between 67th and
68th Streets) and at 319 Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills are the first
in this country, and will be watched closely by the parent company,
Maramotti said, to determine whether more will follow. The line has
already found fans in Rosie O'Donnell, Roseanne Barr (who dropped
$10,000 in one visit to Madison Avenue), Star Jones and Camryn
Manheim.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mara, which started in Italy in 1951 as one of the first
fashion houses to offer ready-made clothes to Italian women, was
founded by Maramotti's father, Achille. It is still family-owned,
with Luigi's brother, Ignazio, sharing the title of managing
director and their sister, Ludovica, chairwoman of one of the
family's six manufacturing firms.
</P>
<P>
   All the clothing is made in company-owned factories, three of
which are in Reggio Emilia, where the company is based. Max Mara is
now the largest ready-to-wear company in Italy, producing 20
collections. Among them are Sportmax, younger and more
fashion-forward than Max Mara; Weekend, which is casual, and
Pianoforte, the evening-wear division. Prices range from $450 to
$650 for jackets, $800 to $2,000 for coats.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other old-line houses looking to glamorize their images
and increase sales by hiring high-profile designers, Max Mara
depends on an anonymous design team headed by Laura Lusuardi.
Maramotti says his company is more interested in quality than
fashion, yet Max Mara regularly presents its namesake collection
and Sportmax on the runways in Milan during the semiannual show
seasons. The lines are reviewed as seriously as those of Armani,
Versace and Gucci, though not with the same superlatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the company's sales in this country have increased 500
percent since 1994, and with more boutiques set to open, the
Maramottis' hopes are high that the company's profile will also
keep growing.

MEREDITH GOURDINE, 69, ATHLETE AND PHYSICIST
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meredith (Flash) Gourdine, the 1952 Olympic silver medalist in
the long jump and later an engineer and physicist with 70 patents
that deal with thermal management and the conversion of gas to
electricity, died Friday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Houston. He
was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from multiple strokes, said
his son, Meredith Jr. He had also been suffering from diabetes and
had gradually lost his sight.
</P>
<P>
   Gourdine's success in track and field was more than matched by
his scientific achievements later. The companies he founded worked
on purifying the air and converting low-grade coal into
inexpensive, transportable and high-voltage electrical energy. They
produced a commercial air-pollution deterrent, a high-powered
industrial paint spray and a device to eliminate fog above
airports.
</P>
<P>
   His sports career flourished at Cornell University, where at 6
feet and 175 pounds he competed in the sprints and low hurdles and
the long jump. He won four titles in the championships of the
Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America and five
titles in the Heptagonal Games. In 1952, he helped Cornell finish
second to Southern California in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association championships, in which Southern California had 36
athletes and Cornell 5.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest achievement and greatest frustration in sports came
in the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Jerome Biffle, another
American, won the gold medal in the long jump at 24 feet 10 inches.
Gourdine finished second, an inch and a half behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have rather lost by a foot,'' he said years later. ``I
still have nightmares about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Charles Gourdine was born Sept. 26, 1929, in Newark. He
was raised in Brooklyn, where his father was a painter and a
janitor. After classes at Brooklyn Tech High School, he worked
eight hours a day on painting jobs with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The son recalled: ``My father said, `If you don't want to be a
laborer all your life, stay in school.' It took.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngster did not run until his senior year in high school
and never won a race there, but his swimming prowess earned a
scholarship offer from the University of Michigan. Instead, he went
to Cornell and paid his way most of the first two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, after he had earned a bachelor's degree in engineering,
Gourdine became an officer in the United States Navy. In 1960, on a
Guggenheim fellowship, he earned a doctorate in engineering science
from the California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   After four years in private industry, he borrowed $200,000 from
friends and opened a research and development firm, Gourdine
Systems, in Livingston, N.J. In 1973, he founded Energy Innovations
in Houston to produce direct-energy conversion devices. He was the
chief executive there until his death.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Carolina Baling; his son;
three daughters from a previous marriage, Teri Bruce of Englewood,
N.J., Traci of Davis, Calif., and Toni of Montclair, N.J.; five
grandchildren, and a sister, Charlotte Williams of Altadena, Calif.

   NEW YORK _ Glee shoved gloom aside Monday in the nation's stock
markets as the main gauges surpassed their summer peaks and reached
new highs.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who had clung to stocks by their fingernails through
the dark days of early fall now have outsized gains for the year,
even by standards set in this bull market's last few years. The Dow
Jones industrial average is up 18.54 percent for the year, while
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has risen 22.44 percent. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq has beaten them all, up 25.92 percent for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recent rally has not lifted all boats. Small stocks,
while back from the depths, are still underperforming their larger
brethren. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues closed
at 398.15, up 28 percent from its low in October. But it is still
14 percent below its July peak.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Dow rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to
9,374.27. The Nasdaq index jumped 2.55 percent, to 1,977.42, up
49.21 points. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 2.12 percent, or 24.66 points, to
1,188.21, a record.
</P>
<P>
   This performance represents nothing short of a screeching U-turn
in investor sentiment. Euphoria is back with a vengeance in stocks,
but confidence has also returned to the junk bond arena, fueling a
recovery in those securities from a moribund state two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a classic market cycle in a matter of weeks
instead of the months or even years that it used to take,'' said
John Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``We've
witnessed the world's first virtual recession, followed by the
world's first virtual recovery, and now we're seeing the world's
first virtual expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although concerns remain, such as a continuing deterioration in
corporate earnings, an Asia mired in overcapacity, uncertainty
about Japan's recovery plan and Latin America on the edge, Manley
said investors were focusing on something rosy farther down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism has also checked into corporate board rooms, as
evidenced by Monday's spate of merger announcements. Nine deals
were announced, intended or rumored Monday for a total of $40.4
billion, reflecting a belief among many chief executives that a
recession is unlikely next year.
</P>
<P>
   Merger experts also found it bullish that the companies doing
the deals spanned a range of industries. That most of the deals
were done using stock as the acquisition currency indicates how
crucial the recent rally has been to deal-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the stock market's performance is inextricably linked to
consumer confidence, its recent run should bolster consumer
confidence figures, which will be released Tuesday. These numbers
had been falling in recent months along with stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's impressive rally is vindication for Abby
Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., who
stayed positive on stocks throughout the downturn. Ms. Cohen never
bought the doomsayers' view, what she called FUDD _ for fear,
uncertainty, doubt and despair. Instead, she held fast to her view
that turmoil in world markets was unlikely to cause a recession in
the United States. Ms. Cohen looked particularly prescient Monday:
Her prediction on the Dow Jones industrial average for the end of
the year was about 9,300.
</P>
<P>
   But while investors who own index funds are jumping for joy,
many others are probably feeling left behind. That is because the
surge that shows up in the market indexes is, once again, not
showing up across the board. While shares of big-name companies
like IBM, Merck and Home Depot are at their all-time highs, many
stocks are still well off their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the broad market is only beginning to claw its way back.
According to Salomon Smith Barney, when the market bottomed out on
Oct. 8, the average Nasdaq stock was down 54.1 percent and the
average S&AMP;P 500 stock had declined 32.1 percent from their 52-week
highs. As of Nov. 20, the most recent data available, the average
Nasdaq stock was down 40.1 percent and the average S&AMP;P 500 stock
was down 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while the revival of mergers and acquisitions is an
indicator of optimism, the activity is still far below the levels
reached earlier this year. Monday's $40.4 billion in announced
deals brings the pace this month to roughly $70 billion. That is up
from the low of $51 billion in September, according to Securities
Data Corp., but nowhere near the spring's levels of $210 billion a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings are showing life, too. But a couple of
spectacular one-day gainers hide the fact that many recent
offerings are still hurting. So far in 1998, the average initial
offering has inched up only one-tenth of a percent. But separating
technology offerings from nontechnology offerings exposes a chasm
in performance. According to Securities Data, the average
technology offering is up 15.2 percent this year, while the average
nontechnology offering is down 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As for the volume of deals, investment bankers have raised $9.4
billion in 29 initial offerings since Sept. 1, but three deals _
Conoco, Fox Entertainment and Swisscom _ account for 80 percent of
the money raised.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Monday's move clearly gave investors something to be
thankful for this week. Analysts pointed to several factors driving
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest driver is the rapid rise in the nation's
money supply. The figure for M-2 _ the broadest money supply
measure that includes checking accounts, savings accounts, money
market funds and other assets _ has grown at an annual rate of 9.3
percent in the last three months. This is the biggest rise since
1987, and much of this money is flooding into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor propelling equity prices is the large number of
investors who are buying back shares to cover open short positions
they had taken on in recent months. A short position is created
when an investor borrows shares and then sells them. If the share
price falls, the investor can profit by buying shares at a lower
price to replace the borrowed ones. Conversely, if the shares rise
in price, the short-seller faces a loss. Uncovered short sales, or
those with open positions, are those shares that have been borrowed
and sold but not yet covered by repurchase.
</P>
<P>
   Those investors who thought share prices were headed for a fall
are now scrambling to cut their losses caused by the big move up.
As Christine Callies, investment strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston, points out, short positions at the New York Stock Exchange
dropped 5.4 percent for the month ended Nov. 13. That is the
largest decline in more than a year and indicates that pessimistic
investors are having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   It has not hurt, of course, that the Federal Reserve has cut
interest rates three times since late September. The benchmark
30-year Treasury bond is yielding 5.25 percent, an unappealing rate
for investors accustomed to double-digit gains. It seems that more
and more investors feel there is nowhere else to put their money
except in stocks or higher-yielding junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors also say there are more interest rate cuts to
come. Jason Trennert, vice president at International Strategy and
Investment in New York, says that continuing weakness in gold and
commodity prices is predicting further easing by the Fed. ``Most
likely monetary policy around the world is too tight,'' he said.
``We're of the opinion that the Fed left the door open for more
easings.'' Lower interest rates are a tonic for both stocks and
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, few strategists are willing to say this market's
run is over. ``Fear and greed are both contagious,'' Manley said.

SUSAN MCDOUGAL IS ACQUITTED OF EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGES IN CALIFORNIA
TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Susan McDougal, President Clinton's
former partner in the Whitewater real estate deal, was acquitted
Monday on all nine counts that she forged checks and credit card
receipts to steal $50,000 from the conductor Zubin Mehta and his
wife, Nancy, and then failed to pay state income taxes on the
money.
</P>
<P>
   As the clerk in Superior Court here read out verdict after
verdict of ``not guilty'' on Monday afternoon, Ms. McDougal seemed
to struggle to hold back tears, finally embracing her lawyers and
brushing her brow with her hand, as Mrs. Mehta sat impassively in a
front row seat in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overcome,'' a tearful Ms. McDougal said in a corridor as
she hugged friends and supporters after the verdicts. ``I just
thank everyone who's helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict ended an occasionally tumultuous 11-week trial, in
which Judge Leslie Light repeatedly admonished the voluble Ms.
McDougal to refrain from speaking out of turn. For months, Ms.
McDougal and her lawyer had contended that the embezzlement charges
were politically motivated, brought by the authorities here in
collusion with the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr _ a charge
both state prosecutors and Starr flatly denied.
</P>
<P>
   But the verdict did not end Ms. McDougal's legal odyssey. She is
due in federal court in Little Rock, Ark., in February to answer
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice charges stemming from
her refusal to answer Starr's questions in the Whitewater
investigation, and could face up to 12 years in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Since last spring, Ms. McDougal has been on probation from her
1996 conviction by Starr for her role in fraudulently obtaining a
$300,000 loan, some of which later went to pay debts of the
Whitewater Development Co., in which she and her husband were
partners with Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, she had been held in jail for 18 months on a civil
contempt citation obtained by Starr for failing to answer questions
in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's verdict, Ms. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos,
said exultantly of Starr, ``They're not going to be able to throw
this around anymore.'' And her longtime fiancee, Pat Harris, who
threw himself onto Ms. McDougal's brother, Bill Henley, in the
courtroom and sobbed as the verdicts were read, shouted in the
hallway: ``Tell Ken Starr we're coming to Arkansas. We're coming
home and this time, we're fighting back!''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Starr's office issued a statement saying the case
was ``unrelated to the work of this office'' and that it would
therefore be ``inappropriate to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief news conference after the verdict, several jurors
said that, after reviewing all the evidence, they were surprised
and even angered that the case _ first filed in 1993 _ had ever
been brought at all. But they made it plain that they voted to
acquit Ms. McDougal after three days of deliberations not because
of any conspiracy theories but because they did not accept the
prosecution's argument that Ms. McDougal, as a bookkeeper and
assistant to Mrs. Mehta from 1989 to 1992, bilked a trusting but
``essentially clueless,'' employer out of tens of thousands of
dollars in extravagant spending sprees. Instead, they said, they
saw the case as a friendship gone sour.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, Nancy Nieman, a professor at Santa Monica College,
described ``two women without very clear boundaries'' who had
``melded together,'' and added that ``when they break, it's very
brittle.'' Throughout the trial, the defense portrayed Mrs. Mehta,
a former actress, as the lonely spouse of a famous husband with a
wandering eye, who became obsessed with Ms. McDougal, showered her
with gifts and authorized most of the spending.
</P>
<P>
   The jury forman, Rufus Gifford, an actor, said the turning point
for him was Mrs. Mehta's own testimony, that there were ``too many
holes in her story,'' and that she should have known Ms. McDougal
was using a credit card issued in both their names. ``It just
didn't make any sense, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Jeffrey Semow, contended that Ms. McDougal stole
to recreate the wealthy lifestyle she enjoyed before the collapse
of her marriage and of the Arkansas business empire of her former
husband, the late James McDougal, with whom she ran the failed
Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan Co.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Zubin Mehta, the former conductor of both the New
York and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras, interrupted a concert
schedule to testify that his wife was not a compulsive shopper and
that their spending habits should not be on trial. But he
acknowledged that what he knew of the family's finances was told to
him by his wife of some 30 years, and the juror, Ms. Nieman, said:
``I don't think he knew what was going on in his home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal was originally charged with 12 felony counts,
accusing her of stealing more than $150,000 from the Mehtas while
working for them from 1989 through 1992. But 10 days ago, Light
granted a defense motion to dismiss three of the counts, relating
to Ms. McDougal's acquisition and use of a credit card in her and
Mrs. Mehta's name, and lowered the amount she was accused of taking
to $50,000.

 &HT;    Springer: Guests feel someone finally cares
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The life of a TV talk show host promoting his first big-screen
movie: Jerry Springer calls from a limo driving through Manhattan
on his way to a daylong parade of media interviews. The skyline
keeps breaking up his call, and Springer keeps calling back. His
handler becomes more impatient with each call.
</P>
<P>
   So we take what time we can with Springer to discuss his movie,
``Ringmaster,'' opening Wednesday in metro Atlanta. The film claims
to give insight into the lives of those who come on his TV show _
people whom even the movie's publicity calls ``the shallow end of
the gene pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer's limo is stuck in traffic around 12th and Broadway
while most of this conversation takes place:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's going on in this movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just a comedy written about two dysfunctional families
who come on my show. It's done by the people who did ``Dumb and
Dumber.'' They looked at me and said, ``Dumbest.'' I'd never done a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what's accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   A: It really answers the question I'm always asked: Where do you
find these people and why would anyone go on TV to reveal the most
intimate details of their private life?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do people go on your show?
</P>
<P>
   A: Different people go on for different reasons, but the reasons
. . . apply to a lot of people. This is an important moment in
their life: Somebody is listening. People in the media are
constantly asking celebrities, business leaders and politicians
their opinions. But most people in life are never asked anything
other than ``Do you have proof of identification?'' No one ever
listens to them _ their spouse doesn't listen to them.
</P>
<P>
   So we see in Angel and Connie (the daughter and mother in the
movie) that this was important. For this period of time, the focus
was on them. Not just on the show, but producers were calling to
make arrangements to fly them to the show, for the hotel. Someone
was focusing on their needs, and someone was listening to them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The actors were sure convincing as the kind of people who are
your guests.
</P>
<P>
   A: When I arrived on the set the first day, I had not met these
people. So I shook their hands and got into the scenes. Two or
three days later I go out to have coffee with some of them and,
honestly, all of a sudden they were talking regularly, they were
bright _ and I was shocked. I'd gotten involved in thinking they
had found people who had lived these lives and put them in the
movie. It didn't dawn on me that at some level they were acting. It
was really kind of embarrassing. I thought they'd just found people
who'd been on a talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do women really come up to you in public and show you their
breasts?
</P>
<P>
   A: All those things they put in the movie have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has one of your staffers dated a transvestite from the show?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Hesitates) I haven't had that happen. But things have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV Guide essay said you are either a joke or a vandal
scratching at the door of civilization. Which is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Do I get another choice? I think I'm starting to take credit
for the decline of Western civilization. I'm preparing an
acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Look, I'm just a shlub with a silly show.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much longer can you do it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'll do it five more years, then stop. I'll be 60.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Then what?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Starr unapologetic
</P>
<P>
   What did Kenneth Starr think the first time he heard of Monica
Lewinsky's involvement with President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   `` `Oh, my . . . do we really need this?' '' Starr says on
Wednesday's ``20/20'' (10 p.m. ESTon ABC ).
</P>
<P>
   ABC is parceling out excerpts from Diane Sawyer's interview with
Starr, conducted Saturday in Washington. While a full tape may not
be available for preview, here's one exchange involving the graphic
nature of the independent counsel's referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer: ``By somebody's account, I think there were 62 mentions
of the word breast, 23 of cigar, 19 of semen, and that there is a
way of summarizing these things and talking about the dates and the
times . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Starr: ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer: ``. . . I mean, this has been called demented
pornography, pornography for puritans. Were there mistakes made in
including some of this?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr: ``We felt, and we made a professional judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer: ``But looking back. You wouldn't take out a word?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr: ``Oh, I wouldn't say not take out a word, but in terms of
the thrust . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer: ``Or the tone of the way it was written?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr: ``Diane, don't fault career prosecutors for telling the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Moesha: Ready or not?
</P>
<P>
   After tonight, will 17-year-old Moesha (Brandy) still be a
virgin? She's thinking about crossing the line (``Moesha'' 8 p.m.
EST on UPN), she says, because she's ready and in love. The episode
has more clinical discussion about birth control than emotional
wrangling _ though there's plenty of the latter. And, ultimately,
it's a well-rounded, thoughtful episode for parents to watch with
older teens.

 &HT;    Internet stocks blast off amid hopes of huge things to come
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   News that a deal between Netscape and America Online was near
sent Internet stocks screaming upward Monday. But only some of the
screaming was related to the communal uptick good Internet news
tends to bring.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amazon.com, Yahoo! and eBay reaped the biggest
residual benefit, with Amazon.com and Yahoo! shattering the $200
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole sector has been on fire recently,'' said Jeff
Sadler, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta. ``Who's to
say why? It's tough to say what is market explosion and what is
AOL-Netscape benefits. Perhaps it's just healthy overall for the
Internet sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, the Internet search engine a pumped-up Netscape would
hope to compete with, closed at $221.43 3/4, up $30.43 3/4.
Amazon.com climbed $37.37 1/2, closing at $218. Shares of eBay, an
Internet auction site, shot up $46, closing at $193.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape was the most traded U.S. stock Monday. Its shares rose
$2.75, closing at $41.93 3/4 on news that a merger with AOL was
close. Shares of AOL closed at $89.62 1/2, up $4.75.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sun Microsystems, reportedly part of a side deal with
AOL and Netscape, closed at $71.31 1/4, up $3.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's share price languished as low as $16.30 as recently
as last month. Netscape's browser once was the windshield through
which most people viewed the Internet. But after Microsoft started
packaging the Explorer browser with its Windows operating system,
Netscape's market share dropped below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Internet access company MindSpring Enterprises
closed at $59.50, up $4.75. Shares of MCI WorldCom were up $1.06
1/4, closing at $58.56 1/4. MCI WorldCom owns much of the plumbing
that lets AOL's and the Microsoft Network's Internet customers
reach the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you put the partnerships together, you strengthen the top
tier of the Internet,'' Sadler said. ``It strengthens the
foundation, which increases the valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still an early-stage market _ it's at about 50 percent
penetration. So what is good for your competitor is still good for
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Brown, an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan, said it was not
clear whether the tech sector's surge was related to Netscape and
AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation also drove share prices up. Amazon.com announced a
stock split last week, and there was talk Monday that eBay would
announce a split soon, said PaineWebber's Jim Preissler.

 &HT;    Dunlap among Q-School grads
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 108-hole survival test known as the final stage of PGA Tour
Qualifying School concluded Monday in La Quinta, Calif., with 41
players earning cards for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   It took a six-round score of 10-under-par 422 to make the top 35
and ties at the PGA West Weiskopf Private Course. Scott Dunlap
finished precisely on the number with a final-round 73.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing one shot too high at 9-under 423 was Michael Clark,
who had a 71; Sarazen World Open challenger Edward Fryatt; and Todd
Demsey, who bogeyed four of his last six holes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an opening 75, left-hander Mike Weir of Canada took
medalist honors at 24-under 408 after a 64 Monday, earning $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the PGA Tour players regaining their cards were Dave
Stockton Jr. (-20); Mike Brisky (-19); P.H. Horgan III (-17); Rick
Fehr (-16, after a course-record 62 in the first round); Jay
Delsing (-12); Jay Williamson (-12); Chris Smith (-12), who chipped
in from 80 feet at the 18th; and Dicky Pride (-11).

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after threatening rapid and unannounced
military action if Iraq failed to cooperate fully with arms
inspectors, the Clinton administration has adopted a more cautious
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, in public and private comments Monday,
signaled a shift in policy from one of hair-trigger confrontation
to a more patient approach that will gauge Iraq's sincerity over
the next several weeks on the basis of several factors, from
handing over secret documents to allowing access to sensitive
military sites and inspecting off-limit sites.
</P>
<P>
   If President Saddam Hussein proves intransigent despite renewed
pledges of cooperation _ as has been his pattern over the past
seven years _ the United States will be in a much stronger position
to take military action, and will have broader support to do so,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the last confrontation, the United States reserved the
right to strike Iraq without warning if Hussein failed to comply
with U.N. demands. Defense Secretary William Cohen said at the time
that Washington expected to know ``within a short period of time,
as to whether he is going to fully comply.'' He added, ``I think
everyone understands that this is the last go-around.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Cohen indicated that the spat over documents was not
likely to put American bombers back in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to Iraq to fully cooperate,'' he told reporters at
the Pentagon. ``A failure to do so certainly leaves open the option
of whether or not the president would order a military option in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that the United States and Britain were waiting to
see how far Hussein will try to go to avoid full compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tactical diplomatic game to make sure our responses and
our public and substantive posture are all orchestrated toward
keeping them on the defensive,'' the senior official said. ``And
they're likely to shoot themselves in the foot again. That's
certainly been the pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials seem to be replaying a strategy they believe
worked in the most recent crisis, when the United States waited as
Iraq became increasingly defiant, eventually ending cooperation
with all inspections. By that point, Hussein was isolated from
traditional supporters in many Arab nations ned nations like Russia
and France, which repeatedly defended Iraq and opposed military
action.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past several days, the U.N. team has become
ensnared in a dispute with Baghdad over a set of documents that
inspectors believe might provide a road map to a part of Iraq's
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   While the Iraqis contend that many of the documents no longer
exist, the inspectors insist that they do, or had until recently,
because they had seen them or heard about them from Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive for Iraqi compliance, American officials
repeated that full compliance could permit the United Nations to
conduct the review of international sanctions that Iraq is
insisting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for them to cooperate with Unscom and
provide the documents that are necessary,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Monday, referring to the U.N. special
commission that conducts the inspections. ``We believe that they
need to provide the documents to allow inspection, before this
comprehensive review can go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how much time Baghdad would be given to comply,
Albright said, ``It's not matter of a deadlines, it's a matter of
coming forward with what's necessary to show that they're
cooperating.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright's comments came after a brief meeting with Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., who will become speaker of the House early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aborted a military strike in mid-November just minutes
before bombers and warships were to drop scores of bombs and
missiles on Iraq. The president said that Iraq's capitulation to
longstanding U.N. requirements for inspections caused him to stay
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said ``the dog ate my
homework'' was not an acceptable excuse from the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Richard Butler, chairman of the commission conducting
the inspections, was ``in the best position to know whether
particular documents are available.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the U.N. inspections' commission, not the United States,
would establish the level of Iraqi cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the judgments are made and understood to be
professional technical judgments,'' Rubin said, ``it is more likely
that we will get international support for a firm posture towards
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq continues to play cat and mouse with inspectors, it will
have made the case for military action to force compliance, a State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Monday that the aircraft carrier
Enterprise and its escort ships arrived in the Persian Gulf Monday,
replacing the carrier Eisenhower and its battle group, which are
returning to the United States. American and British warplanes
remain on alert at air bases throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen added that Iraq would be given time to resolve the
dispute over the documents and to demonstrate its willingness to
comply with other aspects of the inspection regime, including
access to suspected production sites and to individuals thought to
be involved in developing prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to continue to see the insistence on the
production of those documents and a clarification of, if documents
were destroyed, who destroyed them, under what circumstances, when,
where, et cetera,'' Cohen said. ``And I think a lot of questions
have to be asked and answered before there can be any resolution as
to whether or not they are, quote, `cooperating.'''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the administration will closely watch the
Iraqi response to a series of surprise inspections with began
Monday at nine sites in Iraq. Washington also is waiting to see how
Baghdad responds to demands to see sites that Iraq has declared
off-limits to monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Statements from top American officials suggest that the United
States will wait weeks before coming to a conclusion about Iraqi
compliance with the inspection program and deciding whether
military action is warranted or useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give Unscom some time to test Iraq to see if its
cooperation is genuine or not,'' a senior administration official
said. ``They've gotten inspectors back in, inspection program back
up and running, done a few small inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're willing to let this process work through for
some time. It's the way to conclude whether Iraq is or is not
sincere.''

 &HT;    Reeves afraid of Falcons 'believing all the Super Bowl talk'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves was quick after Sunday's
20-13 win over Chicago to praise the Bears for how hard they
played, forcing Atlanta to overcome a 13-3 third-quarter deficit to
win for the 15th time in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was another story.
</P>
<P>
   He said again that Bears played hard, but also expressed
disappointment in his team's intensity level. The Falcons (9-2)
were especially off in a 3-3 first half.
</P>
<P>
   A 48-yard TD pass to Tony Martin was called back because of an
interference call against TE O.J. Santiago, one of five penalties
in the first quarter. Wide receiver Todd Kinchen fumbled at the
Chicago 6 just seconds before halftime. Atlanta got beat on both
lines of scrimmage, including an especially galling 13-play,
67-yard drive that included 10 running plays between the tackles
for 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some guys, not a lot thankfully, that started believing
all the Super Bowl talk, and reading the press clippings,'' Reeves
said. ``If we're going to have players who have the attitude that
we're going to win football games just because of our record, we're
going to have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches were especially disappointed with the play of special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Ronnie Harris, signed two weeks ago when WR Jammi
German
</P>
<P>
   was placed on injured reserve, fair caught three punts. He tried
to return one, but fumbled it, and lost 1 yard after recovering.
</P>
<P>
   He and CB Elijah Williams averaged just 19.5 yards on four
kickoff returns, and brought a couple balls out of the end zone
they probably should not have.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the second half, Chicago's Glyn Milburn returned
a kickoff 61 yards to set up the Bears' go-ahead field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie LB Keith Brooking was penalized on a punt for being
downfield too early.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great indication of your intensity . . . is your special
teams,'' Reeves said, ``and this was probably the poorest job we
had all year.''
</P>
<P>
   There's good news, though.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie return man Tim Dwight, a WR/RB who has missed four
straight games since straining a medial collateral knee ligament
Oct. 25 against the Jets, is expected back for Sunday's game at St.
Louis (3-8). He was averaging 26.3 yards on kickoff returns,
third-best in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as ugly as Sunday's game was, the Falcons won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some plays in the second half, but we're not a
football team that can fall behind and say, 'Let's turn it on now,'
'' Reeves said. ``We've got to learn from this. It's nice we can
learn through a win.''
</P>
<P>
   DE Lester Archambeau said, ``If you want to be a division
champion, you've got to fight every week. The Bears are good, and
they made some plays. But the bottom line is we're better because
we made more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   While the Falcons monitor the sprained ankle and knee of QB
Chris Chandler, Sunday's opponent, St. Louis, likewise is watching
QB Tony Banks. He did not play after spraining his right ankle in
the first quarter of Sunday's 24-20 loss to the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   He will not practice Wednesday, as Steve Bono will work with the
No. 1 offense. If Banks doesn't practice Thursday, Bono will start.
</P>
<P>
   For the Falcons, FB Bob Christian still sore Monday after twice
reaggravating a injury Sunday where nerves in his neck and shoulder
were severely stretched. It first happened a few weeks ago when his
head was driven one way while the opposite shoulder was driven
down.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, which causes numbness in his right shoulder and arm
when aggravated, could mean that RB Gary Downs (6-foot-1, 218
pounds) and TE Brian Kozlowski (6-3, 255) will split time at FB.
</P>
<P>
   Downs (four catches, 31 yards) offers more speed, which could be
good on third downs, but Kozlowski (six catches, 76 yards, one TD)
has two advantages. He's a superior blocker, plus he could present
personnel problems for the Rams as it would be unclear whether he
is going to lineup at TE or FB.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff update
</P>
<P>
   It's still early, but worth a look at the Falcons' playoff
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   At 8-2, they lead San Francisco (8-3) by one game in the NFC
West, and trail Minnesota (9-1) for the race for best record in the
NFC.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons win out, they obviously win the division title,
just the second in the 33-year history of the franchise (1980).
</P>
<P>
   If San Francisco wins out, and Atlanta loses just one game, both
teams will be 13-3. Throw out the first tiebreaker, which is
head-to-head competition (the teams split two games).
</P>
<P>
   The second tiebreaker is record within the division, where both
teams currently are 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The third tiebreaker is record within the NFC, where Atlanta is
8-1, and the 49ers are 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   That means Atlanta could _ again, if the 49ers win out _ lose to
either of the AFC teams on the schedule, the Colts or the Dolphins,
and still win the division title with an 11-1 NFC record to the
49ers' 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who have won eight of their previous nine division
games, face an important test Sunday at St. Louis (3-8). They also
play at division rival New Orleans (5-6) Dec. 13, and have games at
home next week against the Colts (2-9), at Detroit (4-7) on Dec.
20, and at home against the Dolphins (7-3 before Monday night) Dec.
27.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers play at the Giants (4-7), at Carolina (2-9), vs.
Detroit, at New England (5-5 before Monday night), and vs. St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings play at Dallas (8-3) Thursday, vs. Chicago, at
Baltimore (4-7), vs. Jacksonville (8-3), and at Tennessee (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's win gave the Falcons their sixth season with at least
nine victories. The others: 1973 (9-5), 1978 (9-7), 1980 (12-4),
1991 (10-6), and 1995 (9-7). . . . Atlanta has scored 304 points,
and is on pace to score 442, which would surpass the franchise
record of 426 in 1981. . . . P Dan Stryzinski's son, Daniel,
finished second in the 8- and 9-year old division of the Atlanta
finals of the Punt, Pass &AMP; Kick competition. . . . Atlanta leads
the NFL with a plus-10 turnover ratio, and has scored 98 points off
of their 28 takeaways, including five defensive TDs. That's 32
percent of the Falcons' points. . . . The Falcons have won 15 out
of 19 before. They won their last game of 1979, went 12-4 in '80,
and won their first three games of '81 (before finishing 7-9) _ a
stretch of 16 wins in 20 games. . . . Atlanta is No. 1 in the NFL
in punt coverage, allowing just 5.4 yards per return.

PROSECUTOR DELAYS DECISION ON KEVORKIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nationally televised death of a Michigan man at the hands of
Dr. Jack Kevorkian appeared to be illegal, the prosecuting attorney
in Pontiac, Mich., said Monday, but a decision on whether to
prosecute Kevorkian could not rest on televised excerpts of the
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   The excerpts of the videotapes were shown Sunday night on the
CBS News show ``60 Minutes'' and helped boost the show's ratings on
the important last weekend of the November ``sweeps,'' when
audiences are measured to set advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``After viewing the edited portions of the video last night, it
appeared a homicide was committed in violation of the laws of the
state of Michigan,'' said David Gorcyca, the prosecuting attorney
for Oakland County. ``However, a charging decision will not be made
until the videotapes are viewed in their entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian wants to be charged with murder or a lesser crime for
his involvement in the death by lethal injection of Thomas Youk,
said David Gorosh, Kevorkian's lawyer. Kevorkian, a retired
pathologist whose license to practice medicine has been revoked in
Michigan and California, did not return telephone calls, but told
his lawyer he would give the prosecutor one week to file charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Gorosh said Kevorkian told him that if he is not charged, he
would consider Oakland County a ``euthanasia-free zone,'' and then
would continue helping others to die. Kevorkian has said he wants
to be charged and acquitted, or, if convicted, to die by a hunger
strike in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Youk, a 52-year-old accountant and race-car enthusiast who was
suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, died on Sept. 17 at home in
Waterford, Mich., with only Kevorkian present.
</P>
<P>
   Youk's wife, Melody, said on ``60 Minutes'' that she did not
consider his death to be murder.
</P>
<P>
   The case is apparently the first in which Kevorkian has
administered the lethal drugs himself. In other cases he has been
present during self-induced deaths in which his ``suicide machine''
was used.
</P>
<P>
   The death scene shown on ``60 Minutes'' was videotaped by
Kevorkian. The preliminary estimate for the much-publicized
broadcast showed a rating of 15.7, up 23 percent from the show's
average 12.8 for the fall season, a ``60 Minutes'' spokesman said.
The share of households watching the program was 25, up 19 percent
from the average of 21.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point represents 994,000 homes, so approximately
15.6 million households watched the show on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rating was the highest for the show this season. The
next-highest rating this season was a 15.2, for a broadcast on Nov.
8.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for ``60 Minutes'' said it would be wrong to
attribute all of the increase in audience share to the Kevorkian
segment. Ratings generally rise as the days grow shorter and the
weather cools, because more people are indoors and watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian could be charged under Michigan's new law against
assisted suicide, or could face a charge of murder or manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor would not tip his hand, but said at a news
conference, ``Consent is not a defense to homicide in the state of
Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor has been tried four times on lesser charges; three
trials ended in acquittals and one was declared a mistrial.
Prosecutors have tried in the past to charge him with murder but
judges have dismissed those charges. Now, however, the judicial
system is confronted by a doctor who acknowledged giving the lethal
injection himself.
</P>
<P>
   The key evidence this time is expected to be the videotapes. The
prosecutor said he had subpoenaed them from CBS News, which said it
has not decided whether to resist the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian said Monday through his lawyer that he would turn the
tapes over himself. But his lawyer, Gorosh, said he advised the
doctor against doing so. Whether Kevorkian would turn over the
tapes is unknown, Gorosh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hard man to predict,'' said Gorosh. He added that
Kevorkian had not consulted him before giving the tapes to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Gorosh noted that he is trying to keep out of prison a man who
wants to be charged with causing a death, and who has said he
intends to represent himself at trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prosecutor expressed skepticism on Monday about Kevorkian's
motives in supplying the tape to ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What was most disturbing about the segment that aired last
night,'' Gorcyca said, ``was the total lack of compassion exhibited
for Mr. Youk in the last few moments of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tape, Kevorkian is heard obtaining Youk's permission to
administer the lethal drugs. Viewers saw Kevorkian give Youk three
injections. Watching the scene on videotape while being interviewed
by ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Mike Wallace, Kevorkian said
flatly, ``He's dying now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a nonchalant, callous, businesslike approach involving
the death of a person for the purpose of satisfying an
attention-starved ego,'' Gorcyca said. ``It would have been more
appropriate to submit the tapes to local law-enforcement agencies
than a national TV show, if Kevorkian wanted to legitimately
challenge the statute in a court of law. If Kevorkian is serious
about challenging the validity of the assisted-suicide statute or
any other charges that may be filed, he will fully cooperate with
the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian's lawyer conceded that the scene appeared cold,
because only Kevorkian was present at the death, but said the Youk
family could not be present because they feared prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   If euthanasia or assisted suicide is made legal, Gorosh said,
the terminally ill could die at home with their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue comes down to whether the citizens of this community
feel what he did is a crime,'' Gorosh said. ``There is no criminal
intent here. There is no malice. How could mercy be considered
murder?''

BY THE NUMBERS, JETS ARE AMONG THE ELITE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Admitting for the first time this season that
he would be ``pretty hard pressed to find somebody who didn't play
well,'' Coach Bill Parcells turned his attention Monday to the
Jets' final five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had to win four out of six, and now we have to
win three out of five,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With an impressive 24-3 decision over Tennessee on Sunday, the
Jets, in fact, have won five of their last six games. The Jets have
a record of 7-4, and Parcells believes that it will take 10
victories to reach the playoffs. The stretch run includes home
games against the Carolina Panthers and Seattle Seahawks, followed
by back-to-back road games at Miami and Buffalo and the season
finale against the New England Patriots at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, winning four of five seems quite possible. Carolina is
2-9 and Seattle is 5-6, and the Jets have beaten Buffalo, Miami and
New England this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got three at home,'' he said. ``I don't say we're in
great position, but we're in position.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Despite the up-and-down aspects of the season, the
overall effect has been upbeat. Parcells likes to complain that his
team does not yet understand winning. Certainly, Jets fans have an
anguished history of holding their breath _ 30 years without a
division title. Still, statistically, the Jets have become a
leading team in the National Football League: only four offenses
generate more yards a game, and only three defenses permit fewer.
Against the Oilers, the Jets did so many of the positive things
that have turned the franchise around. The players show no signs of
forgetting how to accomplish them.
</P>
<P>
   --Stopping the run: Eddie George was held to 94 yards on 24
carries. No surprise there. Only two runners have gained 100 yards
against the Jets this year. In the season opener, Garrison Hearst
passed that figure, but it took his overtime 96-yard winning dash.
Since then, only the Patriots' Robert Edwards hit the figure _ in a
losing effort.
</P>
<P>
   --Generating the run: With his 123-yard performance, Curtis
Martin has hit the 100-yard mark six times _ with the Jets winning
five of those games.
</P>
<P>
   --Preventing touchdowns: The Oilers became the fourth team this
season to fail to produce a touchdown against the Jets. The Jets
have yielded the third-fewest points a game in the league: 16.1. At
this rate, they would also become the second-stingiest defense in
Jets history. (The 1993 team allowed 15.44 points a game.)
</P>
<P>
   --The Mo Lewis factor: The linebacker's one-armed grab of
George, after a 1-yard screen pass on a third-and-3, halted a drive
on Sunday. It forced the Oilers to punt in the final period while
trailing by 17-3. The Jets quickly scored to put the game out of
reach. Over all, Lewis had 10 tackles in one of his most active
games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   --Third-down success: It was 50 percent against the befuddled
Oilers. The Jets have surpassed the Broncos as the American
Football Conference's top team on third downs with a 44.4 percent
success rate. That is also fourth-best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   --Quarterbacking: The Jets do it well; the opponents don't.
Steve McNair was held to fewer than 6 yards an attempt. Opposing
quarterbacks complete only 53.1 percent of their passes, have
tossed 16 interceptions to only 10 touchdowns and average a meager
5.89 yards an attempt. Vinny Testaverde, meanwhile, is completing
almost 60 percent of his attempts, which average 7.71 yards. And
his 18 touchdowns to only 4 interceptions is one of the most
imposing quarterback statistics of the year, if not league history.
</P>
<P>
   Was Parcells planning to watch Monday night's matchup between
the Dolphins and the Patriots? A Dolphin loss would put the Jets in
a three-way tie with the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Parcells said when asked which team he wanted
to win. ``It doesn't make any difference to me.''

 &HT;    Georgian tapped for key budget post
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last week, Georgia Republican Rep. Saxby Chambliss
got a phone call that would make most congressmen salivate.
</P>
<P>
   Would Chambliss, who recently won his third term, like to become
vice chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee, asked Rep.
Bob Livingston (R-La.), the GOP's choice to be the next speaker.
</P>
<P>
   That invitation to leapfrog over more senior members of the
committee may be a bone of sorts for Georgia's 11-member
congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Following House Speaker Newt Gingrich's unexpected resignation
and fellow Republican Rep. John Linder's failed bid to hold on to
his leadership post, Georgia lawmakers have been concerned about
the delegation's loss of clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker (Gingrich) was important from a parochial
aspect,'' Chambliss said. ``I will do whatever I can to make sure
that Georgia's interests are represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss will be Livingston's point person on the panel, which
is responsible for crafting the nation's spending bill each year.
And increasing defense spending will top Chambliss' priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Livingston is a great admirer of Saxby Chambliss
and felt he was a guy that he could count on,'' said Mark Corallo,
Livingston's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   David Hobson, a Republican from Ohio, who was given the vice
chair post by Gingrich, is leaving the committee to become chairman
of a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, so his staff
said he was not upset by the elevation of Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), the next in command, said
he has no problem with Chambliss' ascension. ``His appointment as
vice chairman says the speaker believes he is a very competent guy
with his trust,'' Shays said. ``I concur that he is competent and
that he deserves the speaker's trust.''

EDITORIAL: A DEATH ON VIDEOTAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian is daring prosecutors to try him for
euthanasia now that he has gone on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' with a tape
showing him giving a lethal injection to a man suffering from Lou
Gehrig's disease. They ought to oblige him. His actions are almost
certainly illegal and can only disrupt the important debate over
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian has apparently tired of merely assisting terminally
ill patients by hooking them up to his ``suicide machine,'' by
which they flip a switch to administer the fatal dose. He may
believe there is no difference between providing the means of death
and actually administering the dose. But serious advocates of
physician-assisted suicide have been scrupulous in maintaining the
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics of assisted suicide demand that patients, not doctors
or anyone else, be in full control. Thus in Oregon, the only state
that has legalized physician-assisted suicide, a doctor may write a
prescription for lethal drugs, but may not administer them. An
adult patient of sound mind can get such a prescription only if
judged by two doctors to have less than six months to live.
</P>
<P>
   Lengthy regulations cover assisted-suicide procedures. A recent
survey found that only eight terminal patients had taken lethal
medications since November _ an indication the law is not being
abused.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian operates under no such regulations in Michigan. He
even opposed a Michigan ballot measure that would have legalized
assisted suicide, on grounds that the regulations were too strict.
But the public has been sympathetic to his crusade, and three
juries have already acquitted him of charges relating to five
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The nation clearly needs more humane policies for easing the
last days of the terminally ill. The rules must be drawn carefully,
with strong safeguards for patients and room for aggressive pain
relief. Kevorkian's ghoulish stunts can only hinder this process.

JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SCHEDULES ANOTHER PUBLIC HEARING ON IMPEACHMENT
ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to keep the public focused on charges that
President Clinton undermined the legal system, the House Judiciary
Committee on Monday scheduled a public hearing for next week on the
``consequences of perjury and related crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans say they hope the session will underscore
their view that the case is about serious legal issues, not simply
the president's sexual dalliance with Monica Lewinsky. They said
the probable witnesses for the Dec. 1 session include federal
judges, convicted perjurers, and military personnel who could talk
about the corrosive effects on the military code of honor of having
a commander-in-chief who has admitted misleading the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Morgan, a spokeswoman for committee Republicans, said
the witnesses would speak of the consequences of perjury on them
``personally _ because convicted perjurers may have personal
experiences they want to relate _ but also the broader consequences
on the judicial system on the whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The new hearing was scheduled as the committee at the center of
the impeachment inquiry met in a private session to take a
deposition from Daniel Gecker, the lawyer for Kathleen Willey, a
former White House volunteer who has said that the president made a
sexual advance to her. Gecker refused to comment to reporters as he
left after three-and-a-half hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed both Gecker's questioning and the newly
scheduled hearing as diversions that drew attention from the fact
that the committee, which heard from the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr last week, has yet to question any of the major
witnesses who were relied on by Starr to build his case against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been any testing of credibility,'' said Rep.
William Delahunt, D-Mass., on the committee. ``There hasn't been
any testing of memories. There have not been any live witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the hearing on perjury ``nothing but abject,'' saying
``We know what the law on perjury is.'' Delahunt said that if
Clinton is not impeached, he could still be tried for perjury after
he left office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton isn't above the law,'' he said. ``Bill Clinton
can go to jail if he committed perjury just like someone in the
military or a civilian or someone of any background.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kennedy, a White House spokesman, derided the hearing on
perjury as ``designed with more of a political partisan purpose
than a constitutional one.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, now
hopes that his committee can complete its deliberations on the
president during the week of Dec. 7. Republicans are predicting
that the committee will approve on a party line vote at least one
count of impeachment against the president for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave it up to the full House to decide whether
Clinton should be impeached. Democrats are pushing instead for some
kind of censure or rebuke of Clinton that would allow him to stay
in office.
</P>
<P>
   With all but a handful of Democrats expected to oppose
impeachment, moderate Republicans have become a closely watched
group by the White House and conservatives who support impeachment
because the moderates are likely to decide the outcome in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a number of the president's emissaries, including
Bill Richardson, the energy secretary who is a former congressman
from New Mexico, and Clinton's former chief-of-staff, Leon Panetta,
who served for years as a House member from California, have been
making calls in the past few weeks to sound out Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the issue, the conservative weekly
newspaper, Human Events, in its latest issue, called on
conservatives to telephone the Capitol and register their
complaints with those Republicans whom it dubbed the ``GOP's
pro-perjury caucus'' because they are leaning against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, paid a courtesy
call Monday on Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., who is the incoming
House speaker. Amy Weiss, a White House spokeswoman, said that
Podesta raised the impeachment issue with Livingston at the end of
their meeting when other aides had left the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the briefest of conversations on impeachment and
agreed it was a subject for members of Congress to decide,'' she
said. However, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Livingston, said
``Impeachment did not come up.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to questioning of Gecker, the Judiciary Committee
also plans to take depositions next week from Bruce Lindsey, the
deputy White House counsel; Robert Bennett, Clinton's personal
lawyer in the sexual misconduct case brought by Paula Jones; and
from Natahn Landow, a Maryland developer and Democratic fund-raiser
close to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey has said she had talked ``extensively'' to Landow
about her encounter with the president. Landow, who has denied
trying to influence Ms. Willey's testimony, invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination when called by Starr
before the Lewinsky grand jury.

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after threatening rapid and unannounced
military action if Iraq failed to cooperate fully with arms
inspectors, the Clinton administration has adopted a more cautious
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, in public and private comments Monday,
signaled a shift in policy from one of hair-trigger confrontation
to a more patient approach that will gauge Iraq's sincerity over
the next several weeks on the basis of several factors, from
handing over secret documents to allowing access to sensitive
military sites and inspecting off-limit sites.
</P>
<P>
   If President Saddam Hussein proves intransigent despite renewed
pledges of cooperation _ as has been his pattern over the past
seven years _ the United States will be in a much stronger position
to take military action, and will have broader support to do so,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the last confrontation, the United States reserved the
right to strike Iraq without warning if Hussein failed to comply
with U.N. demands. Defense Secretary William Cohen said at the time
that Washington expected to know ``within a short period of time,
as to whether he is going to fully comply.'' He added, ``I think
everyone understands that this is the last go-around.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Cohen indicated that the spat over documents was not
likely to put American bombers back in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to Iraq to fully cooperate,'' he told reporters at
the Pentagon. ``A failure to do so certainly leaves open the option
of whether or not the president would order a military option in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that the United States and Britain were waiting to
see how far Hussein will try to go to avoid full compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tactical diplomatic game to make sure our responses and
our public and substantive posture are all orchestrated toward
keeping them on the defensive,'' the senior official said. ``And
they're likely to shoot themselves in the foot again. That's
certainly been the pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials seem to be replaying a strategy they believe
worked in the most recent crisis, when the United States waited as
Iraq became increasingly defiant, eventually ending cooperation
with all inspections. By that point, Hussein was isolated from
traditional supporters in many Arab nations and nations like Russia
and France, which repeatedly defended Iraq and opposed military
action.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past several days, the U.N. team has become
ensnared in a dispute with Baghdad over a set of documents that
inspectors believe might provide a road map to a part of Iraq's
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   While the Iraqis contend that many of the documents no longer
exist, the inspectors insist that they do, or had until recently,
because they had seen them or heard about them from Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive for Iraqi compliance, American officials
repeated that full compliance could permit the United Nations to
conduct the review of international sanctions that Iraq is
insisting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for them to cooperate with Unscom and
provide the documents that are necessary,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Monday, referring to the U.N. special
commission that conducts the inspections. ``We believe that they
need to provide the documents to allow inspection, before this
comprehensive review can go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how much time Baghdad would be given to comply,
Albright said, ``It's not matter of a deadlines, it's a matter of
coming forward with what's necessary to show that they're
cooperating.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright's comments came after a brief meeting with Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., who will become speaker of the House early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aborted a military strike in mid-November just minutes
before bombers and warships were to drop scores of bombs and
missiles on Iraq. The president said that Iraq's capitulation to
longstanding U.N. requirements for inspections caused him to stay
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said ``the dog ate my
homework'' was not an acceptable excuse from the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Richard Butler, chairman of the commission conducting
the inspections, was ``in the best position to know whether
particular documents are available.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the U.N. inspections' commission, not the United States,
would establish the level of Iraqi cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the judgments are made and understood to be
professional technical judgments,'' Rubin said, ``it is more likely
that we will get international support for a firm posture towards
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq continues to play cat and mouse with inspectors, it will
have made the case for military action to force compliance, a State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Monday that the aircraft carrier
Enterprise and its escort ships arrived in the Persian Gulf Monday,
replacing the carrier Eisenhower and its battle group, which are
returning to the United States. American and British warplanes
remain on alert at air bases throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen added that Iraq would be given time to resolve the
dispute over the documents and to demonstrate its willingness to
comply with other aspects of the inspection regime, including
access to suspected production sites and to individuals thought to
be involved in developing prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to continue to see the insistence on the
production of those documents and a clarification of, if documents
were destroyed, who destroyed them, under what circumstances, when,
where, et cetera,'' Cohen said. ``And I think a lot of questions
have to be asked and answered before there can be any resolution as
to whether or not they are, quote, `cooperating.'''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the administration will closely watch the
Iraqi response to a series of surprise inspections with began
Monday at nine sites in Iraq. Washington also is waiting to see how
Baghdad responds to demands to see sites that Iraq has declared
off-limits to monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Statements from top American officials suggest that the United
States will wait weeks before coming to a conclusion about Iraqi
compliance with the inspection program and deciding whether
military action is warranted or useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give Unscom some time to test Iraq to see if its
cooperation is genuine or not,'' a senior administration official
said. ``They've gotten inspectors back in, inspection program back
up and running, done a few small inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're willing to let this process work through for
some time. It's the way to conclude whether Iraq is or is not
sincere.''

RENO NONCOMMITTAL ON GIVING GORE CASE TO SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several of Attorney General Janet Reno's close
aides advised her Monday in a private meeting at the Justice
Department that federal law required her to seek an independent
counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's political
fund-raising efforts, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But other advisers at the meeting disputed that interpretation
of the law. Reno, who must, according to the time constraints of
the independent counsel law, decide the issue by next Tuesday, is
still considered likely to reject such an appointment, the
officials said. That decision would spare Gore further scrutiny at
a critical phase of his attempt to solidify his presidential
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has remained taciturn. At the conclusion of Monday's
meeting, she informed her aides that she was unprepared to declare
whether she had decided to refer the allegations about Gore's case
to an outside prosecutor, the officials said. The debate, said one
official, was ``spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Gore's case is whether the independent counsel law
permits Reno to close an inquiry when there are relevant facts in
dispute _ in this case conflicting witness accounts of senior
campaign officials who, along with Gore, attended a Nov. 21, 1995,
White House fund-raising meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants of the meeting recalled discussing how the
funds raised by Gore would be divided for direct and indirect
campaign efforts; others said that was not discussed, and a few
could not recall the meeting's specifics, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the conflicting accounts, the split among her top
aides reflects a longstanding legal debate within the Justice
Department about how to interpret a key provision of the
independent counsel statute. One side said the law clearly dictates
seeking an independent counsel when contradictory evidence cannot
be resolved. The other side is arguing that Reno is not obligated
to seek an independent counsel because the case, partly based on
whether the money Gore raised was used legally, is so technical
that a prosecutor would be unlikely to obtain an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision in the Gore case represents the first of three
important independent counsel decisions that she must make in the
next two weeks. After Gore, she must decide next week whether to
seek an appointment in the case of Harold Ickes, the former White
House deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Reno must decide whether to seek an outside counsel
to investigate whether President Clinton and his aides broke the
law when they set up a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign
financed by the Democratic National Committee. Federal rules limit
such ad campaigns to generic party ads, but Federal Election
Commission auditors have said the ads directly supported the
Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has referred allegations against six Clinton
administration officials to independent prosecutors, has never
allowed an outside counsel to review any issue directly related to
how the Democrats financed the 1996 campaign, although she has
considered the issue on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   In part, officials said they believed that Reno's unwillingness
to open the Democrats to the potentially sweeping scrutiny of an
independent prosecutor stems from a view within the Justice
Department that the loosely written campaign finance laws offer
little traction for prosecutors attempting to seek evidence of
criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attacked
Reno, accusing her of blatantly using her office as a political
shield for the White House, protecting not only Clinton, but the
Democratic Party. She opened the inquiries into Gore, Ickes and
Clinton only after Charles La Bella wrote her a memo recommending
an independent counsel. La Bella's memo came after FBI Director
Louis Freeh had reached a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Justice Department, officials said Reno's narrow view
of the law _in the campaign finance context _ is based on a
different perception that some independent counsels have misused
the offices.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has been said by some aides to have expressed concern about
the conduct of more than one independent counsel. She has
disapproved of some tactics, like when prosecutors unfairly expose
low-level witnesses to the expense and embarrassment of criminal
inquiries that seemed to continue and expand long after
departmental prosecutors would have dropped them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno has been careful to avoid voicing her complaints
in public, some of her aides have criticized the conduct of Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, and Donald Smaltz, the prosecutor
who has investigated Mike Espy, the former agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, Reno opened a 90-day independent counsel inquiry
in September after a memorandum surfaced with an aide's handwritten
notes that seemed to shed new light on Gore's role. The aide's
notes suggested that Gore could have known much more about the
regulatory limits on his political fund-raising than the vice
president had acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that he did not realize that some of the large
contributions he solicited in phone calls from his White House
office would be divided into different Democratic Party accounts.
But the memo, in which Gore was to said to have remarked ``count me
in'' on making fund-raising phone calls, suggested that he could
have known that the money he raised would be split between hard and
soft money accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money contributions are unregulated, but can only be used
for limited purposes to finance general party activities like
registration drives. But hard money is regulated and subject to
limits, and was spent directly on Clinton-Gore re-election efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly technical question of whether Gore knew the
distinction between hard money and soft money is significant
because Reno has said that any solicitations for the Clinton
re-election effort _ that is, solicitation of hard money _ by the
president or the vice president, could have been illegal. She
reasoned that under election laws, Clinton and Gore were
prohibited, as federal officials, from soliciting funds on
government property.

 &HT;    Veterans say proof exists of radioactive exposure in Gulf War
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gulf War veterans accused the Pentagon on Monday of covering up
information that shows that hundreds of thousands of U.S.
front-line troops were exposed to radioactive depleted uranium
during the 1991 conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A map released by the Department of Defense late last week shows
vast troop movements through areas in Iraq and Kuwait where high
concentrations of armor-piercing depleted uranium (DU) shells were
detonated. U.S. and British forces fired more than 1 million DU
rounds, weighing 315 tons, during Desert Storm. It was the first
time that the toxic metal, a waste product left when natural
uranium is refined to make weapons or fuel, was used in warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans advocates and the Pentagon have been at odds for five
years over whether any U.S. troops were contaminated and
subsequently became sick. After years of denying any contamination,
the Pentagon recently concluded that 400,000 Americans came in
contact with DU. But the Defense Department still insists the
exposure caused no known health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf War veterans say they want to know how long the Pentagon
was aware of the level of DU exposure to which troops were
subjected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the strongest evidence yet that hundreds of thousands
were exposed to radioactive toxic waste and the Pentagon just sat
on it, leaving sick Gulf War veterans twisting in the radioactive
wind,'' said Paul Sullivan, director of the National Gulf War
Resource Center, which represents 54 veterans' groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Dian Lawhon said she did not know
how long the map has been in existence and referred questions about
it to Steven King, the Defense Department analyst who developed the
schematic. King did not return a message Monday left on his office
telephone machine and Lawhon said she could not reach him either.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon unveiled the map Thursday afternoon at a hearing by
the seven-member Special Oversight Board for Department of Defense
Investigations of Gulf War Chemical and Biological Incidents.
President Clinton appointed the board last year after widespread
veteran complaints that the Pentagon had not done enough to
investigate claims of service-related illness by more than 100,000
of the 700,00 Gulf War veterans who served in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this critical information was intentionally withheld
from veterans,'' Sullivan testified to the panel Friday. ``This
outrage must not be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokeswoman Lawhon said veterans were not notified
because the Defense Department does not consider them at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientific research and medical research does not indicate
that this type of exposure is harmful,'' she said. ``Since there's
no evidence to indicate any exposure about the safety level, there
was no requirement to notify people of something that was not
thought to be harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument did not wash with some observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are they to decide?'' said investigative reporter Seymour
Hersh, who earlier this year wrote a book critical of the Pentagon
handling of Gulf War illness. ``It's what we don't know that's
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Others take issue with Defense Department assurances that no
veterans became sick from DU exposure. Doug Rokke, who has a
doctorate's degree in physics and technology education, served with
the Army in Saudi Arabia from December 1990 through June 1991,
developing DU training programs and operational programs, none of
which have been fully implemented yet. From August 1994 until
November 1995, he directed the Depleted Uranium Project, in which
his troops recovered, decontaminated and shipped back to the United
States 31 U.S. vehicles destroyed by DU friendly fire.
</P>
<P>
   He says he and his soldiers developed a rash within weeks of
coming into contact with DU and he now suffers from kidney and
respiratory problems. Most other people with whom Rokke worked also
are sick, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they can say nobody is sick when they've
never tested the majority of the people who were exposed,'' Rokke
said from his Alabama home Monday evening. ``Can I say
unequivocally that exposure to depleted uranium has health effects?
No, I can't. But can they say it does not?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawhon counters that tests on uranium in general have been
carried out for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to go and test DU on its chemical toxicity
when you've got more than 40 years of research on uranium,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's this type of thinking that erodes Pentagon credibility with
veterans, Hersh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In context of all these people who are sick,'' he said, ``they
really don't have a sense of the big picture.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IMBALANCE IN BASEBALL COSTS STEINBRENNER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can the New York Yankees not be worth, say, four times as
much as the new Cleveland Browns? The answer to a question I
continue to hear and have wondered about myself is found in a
subtext to the widely speculated sale of George Steinbrenner's
team.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the Boss' effort to fortify the middle of his lineup,
and the meager number of teams with enough money to contest him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the champion Yankees and Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa and
retro ball parks and a basketball lockout, baseball is flirting
dangerously with the collapse of competitive balance. This
calamity-in-waiting obviously reflects in the range of the reported
sales prices of Steinbrenner's biggest deal ever, one that is said
to be in the late innings, with Cablevision's monopoly money
closer, Charles F. Dolan, warming up.
</P>
<P>
   The reported low figure is $550 million, and the high one is $1
billion, with the final price likely in between. I'm not implying
that Steinbrenner, like Kenny Anderson, might ever have to sell one
of his cars for some pocket change, for the deal ultimately will be
an American record. But what, then, are we to make of these figures
relative to Rupert Murdoch's $1 billion bid for the Manchester
United soccer team and Al Lerner's $530 million fee for that
expansion Cleveland football team not yet in possession of a single
shoulder pad?
</P>
<P>
   Millions of New Yorkers have been conditioned _ by Steinbrenner,
among others _ to believe that no property in the sports universe
could compare to a storied franchise whose broadcast rights netted
almost $500 million more than a decade ago, and comes with its own
collection of monuments to itself. Now a soccer team is worth more,
and a shell of a small-market football franchise almost as much?
</P>
<P>
   Believe it, said Andrew Zimbalist, the professor of economics at
Smith College who has written extensively on the industry and
claims the legacy of the Babe and Joe D. don't carry as much market
weight as a sound revenue-sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like saying Chrysler, because of its history, should
sell for more money than Microsoft,'' Zimbalist said. ``The fact
is, football is golden, with a massive television contract and
labor peace. Baseball is still in trouble because you have five or
six teams bidding for all the best players.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. As this free-agent season has evolved, when was
the last time anyone uttered the words Kansas City Royals? The are
just too many sad welfare cases which have, as the major league
baseball executive Sandy Alderson told Murray Chass in Sunday's New
York Times, practically ``given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson used to run one of them, the Oakland A's, which reminds
me of a weekday afternoon game in Oakland that I took my family to
last July. The crowd was a few thousand, half of them camp kids on
99 cents admission. After the game, in the souvenir shop, my sons
reached for batting helmets under a sign that read: $5, 50 percent
off.
</P>
<P>
   At the counter, I paid with a $10 bill, and received $5 change.
I held up a helmet in each hand. ``Two-fifty apiece,'' the guy
said.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked how he could sell merchandise that cheap, he said:
``Buddy, you see today's crowd? It's only getting worse.'' Maybe we
do have a distorted view of the game back home, I thought. Maybe
that helps explain those shrinking World Series ratings, Yanks or
no Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   As the media corporations dig into their pockets, the gulf
between rich and poor is only widening. Nobody, least of all
Commissioner Bud Selig, will acknowledge that Murdoch, owner of the
Dodgers and almost every television signal, has become baseball's
de facto czar. As such, he most likely will not even have his
hopelessly conflicted partnership with Dolan challenged, if and
when the Yankees' sale is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without knowing anything about the Yankees' books, I am
surprised that the sales price wouldn't be more in a media market
like that,'' said Tom Murdo, the manufacturer of children's
products who unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. ``In my opinion,
the Browns are not worth $530 million, but football is viewed as a
better industry than baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Yankees would be worth more if Steinbrenner waited
until after the city builds him luxury boxes. Or perhaps he senses
that baseball, with no meaningful global upside, like Michael
Jordan and Manchester United, has been artificially pumped up by
the home run derby. Whatever the deal, Steinbrenner will become
richer than ever, but must live on with one nagging thought.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, he still isn't that much bigger than
Cleveland, where he cut his teeth on a silver spoon.
</P>

GEORGIA SUPREME COURT INVALIDATES STATE SODOMY STATUTE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Twelve years after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
Georgia's anti-sodomy statute in a landmark decision, Georgia's own
Supreme Court invalidated the law Monday by ruling that private
consensual sodomy between adults is protected under privacy rights
guaranteed by the state Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Although top courts in other states have struck down similar
laws, the ruling Monday held special symbolic meaning for gay
rights advocates because it was Georgia's anti-sodomy law that had
prompted the U.S. Supreme Court to declare that ``the Constitution
does not confer a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in
sodomy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is especially sweet,'' said Stephen Scarborough, a lawyer
with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay rights
organization that filed a friend-of-the-court brief challenging
Georgia's law. ``I think that it really sends the signal to other
states who may be considering similar challenges that we are in a
day and age where the government simply does not belong in
bedrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's became the fifth top state court to reject anti-sodomy
laws since the United States Supreme Court, on a vote of 5 to 4,
upheld the Georgia law in its 1986 decision, Bowers vs. Hardwick,
Lambda officials said. In each case, state courts ruled that their
state constitutions afforded more extensive privacy rights than
those guaranteed by the United States Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's chief justice, Robert Benham, noted in the 6-to-1
decision Monday that ``it is a well-recognized principle that while
provisions of a state constitution may not be judicially construed
as affording less protection to that state's citizens than a
parallel provision in the Federal Constitution may provide, the
state constitution may provide more protection than the U.S.
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling leaves 18 states with anti-sodomy laws of some kind.
Thirteen prohibit both homosexual and heterosexual sodomy, while
five ban only same-sex sodomy. Georgia's law, which dated from
1833, defined sodomy as ``any sexual act involving the sex organs
of one person and the mouth or anus of another.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-sodomy statutes existed in every state as recently as the
early 1960's. Twenty-five states, including New Jersey and
Connecticut, have repealed their anti-sodomy laws, while top courts
have struck down the laws in seven states, New York among them.
Legal challenges are winding through the courts in several other
states, including Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the successful challenge to Georgia's law came in
a case involving heterosexual activity. In 1996, Anthony San Juan
Powell was convicted of sodomizing his 17-year-old niece after both
testified that he had had sexual intercourse with her and performed
oral sex on her.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was originally indicted on charges of rape and aggravated
sodomy because his niece maintained that the sex had not been
consensual, an accusation he denied. The jury acquitted him of
those charges but convicted him of sodomy after the trial judge had
made that option available. He was sentenced to five years in
prison and served 14 months before being released on bond pending
the outcome of his appeal, said his lawyer, Steven H. Sadow.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in 1986 focused on homosexual
sodomy, with Warren Burger, who was then chief justice, writing
that protecting homosexual sodomy as a fundamental right would
``cast aside millennia of moral teaching.'' But the Georgia
decision made clear that any sexual activity that is consensual,
adult and private would be protected under privacy rights that,
though not made explicit by the State Constitution, have been
recognized by Georgia courts since 1905.
</P>
<P>
   That recognition, Benham wrote, does not mean that the court
condones homosexuality. But he added, ``While many believe that
acts of sodomy, even those involving consenting adults, are morally
reprehensible, this repugnance alone does not create a compelling
justification for state regulation of the activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone dissenter, Justice George Carley, accused his
colleagues of ``acting as social engineers rather than as
jurists.'' He said the decision would call into question any
criminal statute proscribing a consensual act that does not harm
anyone but the participants, including laws against consensual
incest and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Sheldon, the chairman of the conservative Traditional Values
Coalition, echoed that concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the Georgia Supreme Court is willing to allow
incestual relationships and moral indecency to occur all in the
name of `privacy,''' he said in a statement. ``Apparently laws can
be discarded if they are broken privately.''
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutions under Georgia's sodomy statute have been
rare, gay rights advocates said the statute had been used to
stigmatize homosexuals and to deny them jobs and child custody and
visitation rights. Indeed, in 1991, Michael Bowers, then the
Georgia attorney general, rescinded a job offer to a lawyer, Robin
Shahar, after learning that she was a lesbian. Among other reasons
given for his decision, Bowers said his office's ability to enforce
state laws would be compromised by hiring someone who, he assumed,
was breaking the sodomy statute.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Ms. Shahar, a senior assistant city attorney in Atlanta,
said she was thrilled by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sodomy has really been used as a tool by people who want to
discriminate against us, even when the statute doesn't apply,'' she
said. ``And the courts have been letting them get away with it.''

CAREFUL COURTSHIP BROUGHT BANKERS TRUST TO MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past year, companies as diverse as Bank of New York,
Mellon Bank, and State Street Corp. approached Bankers Trust Corp.,
a New York bank, about buying portions of its business.
</P>
<P>
   But Bankers Trust _ finding it increasingly difficult to remain
independent but determined to keep its businesses intact _ decided
to enter merger talks with German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were then negotiated, beginning with a meeting
at New York's St. Regis Hotel last summer and continuing through
subsequent talks at an international banking conference in
Washington and at the home of Deutsche's chairman in Frankfurt,
Germany, over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Deutsche confirmed that it was close to acquiring
Bankers Trust for about $9.67 billion, in a cash transaction that
would create the world's largest financial-services concern.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche said the deal, in which Bankers Trust shareholders
would receive $93 per share, still required the resolution of
certain legal and tax issues before it could be presented to both
companies' boards of directors for final approval on Sunday. Each
board voted its preliminary approval of the deal over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working diligently to finalize all terms in preparation
for the Sunday meeting,'' said Rolf Breuer, Deutsche Bank's
chairman. ``We have scheduled high-level meetings with regulators
in New York and Washington this week to describe our proposed
transaction. I remain optimistic that all final details will be
resolved satisfactorily.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust's shares rocketed more than 9 percent, to $84.25,
in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Deutsche Bank's
shares rose less than 2 percent, to 109.9 marks, in trading Monday
on the stock exchange in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   While the German banking giant will spend this week lobbying
regulators on the merits of its deal, it will need more time to
convince analysts that the purchase makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Once the merger is completed, the new bank will have more than
$800 billion in assets. But some analysts doubt whether Deutsche,
traditionally a staid commercial bank, will be nimble enough to
compete effectively in the investment-banking market _ the main
business it is seeking to bolster by acquiring Bankers Trust. And
others question the price of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought it would be hard to get out of the 70s
per share for Bankers Trust, and you begin to wonder whether the
financial expectations can support a higher price,'' said Judah
Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``You have a hugely
motivated buyer here who is clearly willing to pay whatever is
necessary to enter the U.S. capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche initiated the merger talks last summer when a Deutsche
board member, Ronaldo Schmitz, invited Bankers Trust's embattled
chairman, Frank Newman, to dinner at the St. Regis.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who had lost his board's support because of problems
with trading losses at Bankers Trust and his own overly exuberant
spending habits, followed up in a meeting with Breuer at an
International Monetary Fund conference in Washington in September
and then at Breuer's Frankfurt home last month.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the transaction were worked out at the New York law
offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz. Executives involved in
the talks pointed out some of the merits of the deal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the merger would give Deutsche a strong presence
as a securities custodian _ the very business other companies had
tried to convince Bankers Trust to sell to them earlier this year _
and provide it with more than $500 billion in assets under
management.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche will take a one-time, pretax restructuring charge of
about $1 billion early next year to account for the merger, but it
expects annual pretax cost savings of about $1 billion. Those
savings will be achieved largely through the elimination of
low-level ``back office'' positions and through layoffs of Bankers
Trust employees in Europe and Deutsche Bank employees in the United
States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Deutsche, known for its rigid and bureaucratic
corporate culture, has made a series of expensive blunders in
earlier forays into investment banking, executives involved in the
talks with Bankers Trust said that this combination had a better
chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be Germans interacting with Bankers Trust's
people,'' said one executive who requested anonymity. ``It will be
Americans working for Deutsche Bank interacting with Americans
working for Bankers Trust, and some of the past cultural problems
they've had in the past aren't relevant here.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. is advising Deutsche Bank in the
negotiations, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is advising Bankers
Trust. The New York law firm of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell is also
advising Bankers Trust, while Cleary Gottlieb Steen &AMP; Hamilton is
the New York law firm advising Deutsche.

PEARL JAM'S LIVE `BOOTLEG ALBUM GETS THUMBS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ arl Jam now has an official ``bootleg'' album.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle band's first authorized live album _ a powerful,
uncluttered 16-song collection titled ``Live on Two Legs'' _ is due
in stores Tuesday on Epic Records.
</P>
<P>
   Like many bands with rabid followings, Pearl Jam has a legion of
fans who enjoy taping the band's live shows as souvenirs. The band
doesn't really mind the unauthorized tapings, as long as
sophisticated equipment isn't used. So most are of poor quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live on Two Legs'' is a live collection worthy of the Epic
label. It's Pearl Jam's first album since last year's ``Yield,''
the followup to the commercially disappointing ``No Code,''
released in 1996 during a low point in the band's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live'' was skillfully recorded and mixed by Brett Eliason,
Pearl Jam's sound engineer. Eliason has also worked with the
Screaming Trees, as tour manager, and produced for Mad Season, the
band formed by Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready, Alice in Chains
lead singer Layne Staley and Screaming Trees drummer Barrett
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The album was recorded during Pearl Jam's recent North American
tour, which began June 20 in Missoula, Mont., and concluded Sept.
23 in West Palm Beach, Fla. But tracks aren't identified by city,
and songs flow one into another as if all of them were recorded at
one show.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual live album features several songs from ``Yield,''
among them ``Given to Fly'' and ``Do the Evolution.'' But ``Live on
Two Legs'' doesn't come across like a ``Yield II.'' The collection
spans Pearl Jam's entire career, as well as any 16-track live
recording could.
</P>
<P>
   There are rambunctious rockers as well as tender, moving
ballads. The album opens with ``Corduroy'' and closes with an
exploding-guitar version of Neil Young's ``Fckin' Up.'' In between
are such songs as ``Hail Hail,'' ``Daughter,'' ``Better Man'' and
``Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead singer Eddie Vedder's rugged voice is drop-dead gorgeous on
``Better Man,'' the set's most tender song. But it nearly
self-destructs on a careening version of the Beatle-esque ``Do the
Evolution'' (``It's evolution, baby!'' Vedder growls).
</P>
<P>
   The album is as straightforward as a live album can get.
Vedder's between-song patter is surprisingly sparse and nonchalant,
as it was during the group's two Seattle concerts at Memorial
Stadium in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Vedder's words are heavy with emotion when he sings. The
sense of melancholy in ``Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a
Small Town,'' introduced as ``the longest title in the Pearl Jam
catalog,'' is enough to put a lump in any listener's throat.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder may overshadow bandmates Jeff Ament, Stone Gossard, Mike
McCready and former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron in star
quality, but he doesn't outperform them on this masterful live set.
Guitarists Gossard and McCready are on fire on ``Even Flow'' _ one
of the album's best songs _ adding pyrotechnics missing from the
original studio version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live on Two Legs'' is available on single CD or cassette, or
as a two-LP vinyl set.

YANKEES TURN TO PLAN B, AS IN BELLE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All along, Bernie Williams has been Plan A for the
Yankees. But now the Yankees are fully committed to pursuing Plan
B, as in Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Yankees' front office met Monday in Tampa, Fla.,
to review their options, and according to one club official who
requested anonymity, the team is ready to consummate a deal with
Belle, the productive slugger with the reputation for consuming
selfishness. Williams met with Dan Duquette, the Boston Red Sox
general manager, and Jimy Williams, their manager, on Sunday night
and again Monday in Atlanta, and it may be that the cleanup hitter
and center fielder of the team that won 125 games in 1998 could
play for the Yankees' archrival in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette would not say whether the Red Sox had made an offer to
Williams, but at the least, he discussed contractual parameters
with the player and his agent. ``We were just trying to get a
general idea of what his expectations are in a contract,'' Duquette
said. ``We tried to sell him on the pluses of playing in Boston. We
had a nice talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing outfielder Brian Jordan is no longer an option for the
Yankees, now that he has agreed to a five-year deal with the
Atlanta Braves. The Yankees offered a five-year, $60 million deal
last week to Williams, but were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Many among the Yankees' decision-makers, sure that Williams
cares only about signing for a higher offer, were prepared to sign
Belle last week. But George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal
owner, seemed more reserved in his approach, delaying the full
pursuit of Belle in the hope he could lure Williams back into the
fold. He met with Scott Boras, Williams' agent, at the end of last
week; but without progress, Steinbrenner maintaining that he did
not increase his offer to the center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Steinbrenner has been told by those around him _
Manager Joe Torre among them _ that Belle could be successfully
incorporated into the Yankees' family. Neither Steinbrenner nor
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, could be reached for
comment, but in the past 48 hours Steinbrenner apparently gave his
blessing for a full-blown pursuit of Belle. ``Everybody is on the
same page,'' one club official said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Belle's offensive capability is enormous:
Belle hit 49 home runs and drove in 152 runs for the Chicago White
Sox last season, and he would fit perfectly into the Yankees'
lineup, a right-handed hitter between the left-handed-hitting Paul
O'Neill and Tino Martinez. The Yankees may be able to sign Belle,
who could choose to return to Chicago for the three years and $30
million remaining on his contract, with the same offer of five
years and $60 million they dangled before Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Belle also carries risk and complication. He is infamous
for his explosive self-centeredness, though his behavior seemed to
improve in the past two years. Signing Belle, a subpar left
fielder, would mean the Yankees would have to move Ricky Ledee to
center or trade for somebody else. They have had regular
conversations about Rondell White with the Montreal Expos, who have
asked for at least three top-notch prospects, and with the Anaheim
Angels about Jim Edmonds. (The Angels want an pitcher in return.)
</P>
<P>
   Williams, too, would assume great risk in leaving the Yankees.
In Torre's clubhouse, Williams is established and respected, and
his teammates understand his quiet intensity. He is the cleanup
hitter, but surrounded by the likes of Derek Jeter, O'Neill and
Martinez, Williams has never solely borne the pressure of being
expected to carry the team.
</P>
<P>
   Williams would go to Boston amid those expectations, because he
would be replacing a local icon _ first baseman Mo Vaughn _ who
played amid that pressure, with great success. Vaughn won the Most
Valuable Player award in 1995, driving in 126 runs, and over the
past four seasons he has averaged 120 r.b.i., banging a total of
158 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a different type of player than Vaughn, with far
more speed and far better defensive skills, a switch-hitter coming
off a year in which he won the American League batting title. But
Williams has never hit 30 home runs, he has never driven in more
than 102 runs, he has never been in the vortex of the sort of hope
and hype that will follow him into Fenway Park. Vaughn was a
visible presence, outspoken and out front; Williams has never
carried such responsibility alone.
</P>
<P>
   Should Williams sign with the Red Sox _ at the moment, the only
other team pursuing Williams is the Arizona Diamondbacks _ his
departure from the Yankees would energize an ancient rivalry that
has been essentially dormant the last two decades. There would be
comparisons between this and another transfer of a player between
the Red Sox and Yankees: the Red Sox sold the young outfielder Babe
Ruth to the Yankees, and as all of New England knows, Boston has
not won a World Series since.

ZAPATISTAS REFUSE TO ACCEPT GOVERNMENT PEACE DOCUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ At the end of three days of
rocky peace meetings a government representative tried Monday to
deliver new peace proposals directly to top rebel commanders here
but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the government asked a panel of 16 lawmakers, de facto
intermediaries, to hand the proposals to the Zapatistas in two
sealed envelopes. But in a two-hour meeting on Sunday night with
the legislators, four commanders refused to accept the documents,
saying that the legislators were not official mediators.
</P>
<P>
   With television cameras rolling around him Monday morning, a
member of the government negotiating team, Alan Arias, walked to
the gate at the convention center where the rebel leaders were
staying, displaying the envelopes. The Zapatistas told him no one
would accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government will have infinite patience and continue to
develop new peace proposals,'' Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   Direct talks between the government and the rebels collapsed two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 29 rebel delegates who came out of hiding for the talks
returned to their villages in convoys led by the International Red
Cross. Police officers protected the rebels at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas agreed to meet again with the lawmakers' panel.
But no channel exists with the government.

 &HT;    Despite big win, loss to Michigan State still stings
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ A season-ending victory over rival Michigan,
winners of eight of the last 11 vs. Ohio State, can help heal even
the deepest Buckeye wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But while players, coaches and fans reveled in OSU's 31-16
defeat of the Wolverines Saturday, the hurt from an earlier loss to
Michigan State still lingered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're very disappointed,'' senior QB Joe Germaine
said. ``Our goal from the beginning of the season was to go to (the
national championship Fiesta Bowl in) Tempe (Ariz.). And for us to
be able to do that now, a lot of things have to happen that are
really not likely.''
</P>
<P>
   So as in 1996, Ohio State (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten) must settle for a
co-Big Ten Championship and a spectator's view of the national
title game, which this year will be played in Germaine's home
state. The Buckeyes will instead play in either the Orange, Sugar
or Citrus bowls.
</P>
<P>
   They'll know for sure where they're headed on Dec. 6, the day
after the college regular season ends and bowl assignments are
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   No matter their destination, the Buckeyes will again be left to
wonder, ``What if?'' as they did in 1995 and 1996 when they also
lost just one regular-season game. (Michigan was the spoiler.)
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach John Cooper insisted Saturday he wasn't thinking about
what could have been if his team had defeated Michigan State Nov.
7. ``No, no, I don't ever think of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How can you not wonder how OSU, the top-rated team in the
country for nine straight weeks, lost, 28-24, at home to a
struggling Michigan State (6-5, 4-3 Big Ten) squad? How can you not
wonder how the high-powered OSU offense, which piled up an average
of 500-plus yards and 36.9 points per game this season, failed to
score against the Spartans in the final two minutes on first and 10
from MSU's 15-yard line?
</P>
<P>
   So the Buckeyes are ranked sixth in the latest Bowl Championship
Series standings, which were released Monday. They are fifth in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Who really knows why OSU lost to Michigan State: Overconfidence?
Complacency? Lack of preparation? A combination of all three?
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the Buckeyes squandered a 15-point lead,
failing to put the Spartans away when they had the chance. They
allowed them to stay in the game and, as Cooper said afterward, let
MSU believe it could win.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's no running away from the defeat; no erasing that
blemish that makes a perfect season impossible. There's only the
lingering question: ``What if . . . ?''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State junior wide receiver David Boston has been named the
Big Ten's Offensive Player of the Week for the second straight
week. Boston was a key force in the Buckeyes' victory over
Michigan, collecting 10 receptions for 217 yards and a pair of
touchdowns (30, 43 yards).
</P>
<P>
   He broke his own OSU record for receptions in a single season by
reaching the 74-catch mark. (He had 73 catches in 1997). Boston
also moved into second place among OSU's career receiving yardage
leaders with 2,750 yards, surpassing Cris Carter's 2,725. Boston is
just 43 yards shy of breaking Gary Williams' mark of 2,792 yards
(1979-82).
</P>
<P>
   Senior cornerback Antoine Winfield has been named one of five
finalists for the Football News' Defensive Player of the Year
Award. He is one of only two defensive backs among the finalists.
The winner will be announced Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Football Writers' Association will announce its 1998
All-America team today in Columbus. The three Thorpe Award
finalists also will be selected today by a special selection
committee. Winfield is one of 10 semifinalists for the Thorpe.

AOL ON BRINK OF DEAL TO GOBBLE UP NETSCAPE  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - NETSCAPE   c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online and Netscape Communications scrambled yesterday
to clear the way for a $4 billion takeover of Netscape that would
turn AOL into an Internet superpower.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement for AOL, the world's largest online service, to
acquire Mountain View-based Netscape was supposed to have been
finalized on Sunday. But at the last minute, Sun Microsystems, a
third party to the negotiations, apparently balked.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape and Dulles, Va.-based AOL yesterday confirmed reports
that they are discussing a merger. They said the deal would take
the form of a stock swap in which Netscape shareholders would
receive 0.45 shares of AOL stock for each share of Netscape stock.
The deal would value Netscape stock at $40 a share as of the close
of trading yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was fashioned during marathon talks over the
weekend, reportedly calls for AOL to get Netscape's popular Web
browser as well as its Netcenter, which is one of the most
trafficked sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sun would acquire the rights to Netscape business software used
to set up and run Web sites. AOL would be guaranteed some revenue
from the software, but apparently the terms weren't acceptable to
Mountain View-based Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very careful about how they use their cash,''
said one investment banker. ``This blockbuster deal stuff makes
them nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Sun came close to acquiring Apple Computer, but
pulled out when it couldn't get the price it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always hard in a three-way deal to get all the parties
aligned,'' said Javier Rojas, managing director of Broadview, an
investment bank specializing in mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how much of a bargain does the third guy need
to make all the numbers work?''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said AOL badly wants to pull the deal off. ``I gotta
belive they can create a deal that Sun can't refuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Sun declined to comment, saying the company
doesn't speculate on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of all three companies involved in the talks jumped on
the news of a possible deal, which was first reported Sunday.
yesterday.  &LR; AOL's red-hot stock added $4.38 to close at $89.25,
while Netscape, which also has been rising lately, closed up $2.75
at $41.94. Shares of Sun were up $3.81 to $71.31.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, which had planned to release its quarterly earnings
yesterday, postponed that announcement until today, hoping to be
able to pair it with news of the merger agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many, if any, jobs might be eliminated
following a merger, although typically consolidation occurs at the
company being acquired. Netscape has about 2,500 employees, all but
a few hundred of them in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape employees said they received an office-wide e-mail
message yesterday morning instructing them to not to talk to
reporters. One employee said there was surprisingly little talk
about the deal during the day _ ``a little bit in the morning and
then business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The buyout would enable AOL to pose the biggest threat yet to
Microsoft, which has spent most of the past three years trying to
extend its domination of personal computer software to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AOL boasts some 14 million subscribers, who use its service for
news, entertainment, chatting, e-mail and as a gateway to the
Internet. Acquiring Netscape would give the company access to tens
of millions of Netscape users. The combined reach would far surpass
that of any other Web site or Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that AOL would incorporate the Netscape
browser into its software, replacing the Microsoft browser that is
currently bundled with it.
</P>
<P>
   For Netscape, a buyout would be the climax to the story of a
company that triggered the ``big bang'' of the Internet and became
the most well-known name in the emerging industry.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994 by Silicon Valley veteran Jim Clark and Internet
prodigy Marc Andreessen, Netscape, then known as Mosaic, got the
jump on the rest of the world by developing the first easily usable
browser for the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, Netscape went public in the most hotly
anticipated stock offering in history. The shares finished the
first day of trading at more than double the asking price, making
instant multimillionaires of Clark and Andreessen.
</P>
<P>
   By the following year, however, Bill Gates had revved up
Microsoft's juggernaut to focus on the Internet, and Netscape began
to feel the heat. By giving away its Web browser (something
Netscape started doing this year), Microsoft was able to eat into
Netscape's once-overwhelming market share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also incorporated its Web browser into the Windows
operating system, a move that gave the browser to virtually
everyone who bought a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape hurt itself by not acting fast enough to develop its
Web site into an Internet portal _ a one-stop gateway including
news, sports, financial information, entertainment and shopping. By
the time Netscape embraced the portal concept this year, others,
such as Yahoo and Excite, were further along, and better positioned
to attract advertising.
</P>
<P>
   After posting its first annual profit in 1996 ($20 million),
Netscape lost $115.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape wanted to be the premier company on the Internet, and
there was a while back in the mid '90s when that was a credible
claim,'' said analyst Barry Parr of International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think Netscape was really able to change as
quickly as the Net changed. And they were up against the strongest
competitor (Microsoft) in any industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Netscape would not constitute an admission of
failure on the part of the company. ``But neither would it be an
honorable exit,'' said David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School
professor who co-authored ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons
from Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere in between,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported that Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale
would join the AOL board. and that Andreessen is negotiating to
work at AOL.

AOL STEPPING UP TO CHALLENGE GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the world has waited for a rival to challenge
Microsoft Corp. as the computer industry's dominant player.
Hopefuls have included Apple Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems &UR;  &LR; Inc.
and Netscape Communications Corp., but all failed to dislodge
Microsoft, the Redmond, Wash. software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Now stepping up is America Online Inc., poised to launch the
most serious challenge to Microsoft to date. Monday, Dulles,
Va.-based AOL said it is negotiating &UR;  &LR; to buy Internet software
pioneer, &UR;  &LR; Netscape, for stock worth about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, plus a possible side agreement with Sun, could give
AOL the technological depth needed to dominate new standards for
the growing world of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they buy, it will set AOL up at the center of an
anti-Microsoft axis,'' said Jim Preissler, an Internet analyst at
PaineWebber Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The potential three-way alliance could give AOL a chance to
dominate much of the shopping, banking and other electronic
transactions fueling the Internet's growth. Most observers regarded
the potential deals favorably because they would allow AOL to adapt
Netscape's software to new devices such as interactive televisions
and handheld computers that Sun and others could market.
Previously, many expected that only Microsoft had the scale to make
such devices widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely makes it a more difficult landscape for
Microsoft,'' said Jill Frankle, an electronic commerce analyst at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ``This would give AOL
a lot of marketing power and depth that Netscape didn't have
before.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL Monday said its talks center on a pooling-of-interests
transaction in which Netscape stockholders would receive 0.45 share
of AOL stock for each of their Netscape shares. AOL shares rose 4
3/8 Mondayto 89 1/4 in Nasdaq trading, valuing the potential
agreement at about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Shares in Netscape, Sun and Microsoft all rose as well.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also confirmed it is in discussions with Sun to give the
Palo Alto, Calif., company marketing and development rights for
certain new products based on Netscape's technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at AOL, Netscape and Sun and Microsoft &UR;  &LR; all declined
to comment on most aspects of the discussions, leaving investors
uncertain as to when a deal might take place. Netscape is expected
to divulge more details Tuesday, when it &UR;  &LR;  discloses results for
the year ended Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's rise as Microsoft's possible arch rival would have
surprised many as recently as six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's courtship of Netscape follows the on-line service
provider's success in gaining a dominant share of the consumer
market for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Many regarded that access as a niche market. Yet connectivity
that has proven powerful in recent years, as consumers rushed to
zap out e-mail, to surf the World Wide Web and to adopt other norms
of the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   Although best known as a proprietary service with 14 million
subscribers, AOL also runs a free site on the World Wide Web that
ranks second in popularity, according to Jupiter Communications LLC
in New York. The site, aol.com, attracts about 23.3 million
individual visitors a month &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; trailing only the famous
search-engine site Yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Based on technology created by a group of students at the
University of Illinois, Netscape is best known for ``browser''
software that allows users to surf the Web, the graphics-rich
portion of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape grew quickly but ran into stiff competition starting
from Microsoft, which rolled out its own Internet Explorer browser.
The two companies now each have about 40 percent of the browser
market, with the remainder split among &UR;  &LR; much smaller players
including IBM Corp., SpyGlass and others, according to
Computerworld Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has stumbled financially in recent quarters, partly
because it was late to recognize that Web users expected its home
page to offer extra features such as sports news, stock quotes and
automobile advertising. Web &UR;  &LR; sites with these services today are
known as ``portals,'' and Netscape's own ``Netcenter'' has
attracted a significant business audience of late.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company has the opportunity to combine that market with
AOL's own consumer-oriented traffic, said Danny Rimer, analyst at
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you could claim that AOL was the on-line service
for beginners and then you graduate to the Internet and to
Netscape,'' Rimer said. ``This gets rid of the myth.''
</P>
<P>
   A deal would also give AOL access to commercial software
developed by Netscape's server product division, which runs Web
sites and writes software for customers like American Airlines,
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and bookseller Amazon.com. Together these
services account for a majority of Netscape's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of these services run in conjunction with networks
built around Microsoft software, AOL will be limited in how
aggressively it might market the server software, said Michael
Cusumano, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and
author of a recent book on Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Others said Microsoft shouldn't be counted out and noted its
stock also rose 5 9/16 Monday to close at 119 3/16, as investors
bet that Microsoft could cite the deals to counter the government's
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Netscape rose 2 3/4 to 41 15/16 in Nasdaq trading.
Shares in Sun rose 3 13/16 to 71 5/16.

AMERICA ONLINE TAKES A GIANT STEP  
 BY JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - AOL   c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The ``cockroach of cyberspace'' is about to get even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few years, America Online has transformed itself from
a rudderless startup to an unstoppable force _ and its status could
soon become dominant, if it seals the deal on a reported $4 billion
acquisition of Netscape Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase would cement AOL's status as the Net's primary site
for consumers and advertisers, by adding tens of millions of
``eyeballs'' from Netscape's Netcenter Web site and Navigator Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is about expanding AOL's audience into other markets
_ it's not about AOLizing Netscape or Netscaping AOL,'' said David
Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments in New York.
``It is all about creating critical mass from which to leverage
advertisers and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For AOL, this means a more pronounced public Internet
presence,'' said analyst Julia Pickar of Zona Research Inc. in
Redwood City. ``They just gained a whole lot of content (from
Netcenter). It really brings AOL beyond its own proprietary network
to the Internet in full force.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's greatest asset is Netcenter, which is among the top
Internet portals _ all-in-one super sites providing news,
entertainment and online shopping. It attracts 20 million visitors
monthly. Add to that AOL's 14 million subscribers, and you have
``an online media powerhouse,'' said Tony Scott, managing director
of Global Technology Practice in Redwood Shores.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Parr, an analyst at IDC, said 58 percent of all Internet
users log onto either AOL.com or Netcenter. That makes the
combination No.1, ahead of Yahoo, which has less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, AOL would inherit Netscape's Navigator Web
browser, which is still the market leader with 70 million users
despite a withering marketing assault from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 14 million paying customers, AOL reaches as many
homes as cable operator TeleCommunications Inc., and it has more
subscribers than Newsweek, Time and People combined.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  During peak hours, the number of people logged on reaches
about 820,000 _ or more than watch CNN or MTV at any given time. An
estimated 40 million e-mail messages course through the company's
worldwide system every day.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's proposed purchase is the latest in a series of buyouts it
has engineered this year to establish itself as the leading source
of e-commerce. It faces competition from Yahoo _ the leading
directory with 25 million registered users _ Microsoft, Excite,
Infoseek and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying that the only way to move the needle in the
portal business is by merging,'' IDC's Parr said. ``We see this as
the beginning of a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Given its troubles in the past, analysts say it is ironic that
AOL has emerged as Microsoft's biggest rival in the Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago hardly anyone would have expected AOL to be
at the forefront of any Internet market. AOL has survived separate
hostile buyout overtures on the same day in May 1993, from
Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen; a meltdown of its
online service in 1996; and a $19 billion bid from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The Dulles, Va., company has come a long way since December
1996, when it replaced its $2.95-per-hour charge with flat-rate
pricing of $19.95 per month. (It has since raised its monthly rate
to $21.95.) But the ensuing crunch among eager customers
overwhelmed AOL's overburdened service, knocking out service and
springing enough technological leaks to sink the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online has reinvented itself from cyberspace's
Public Enemy No.1 to an American icon prominently featured in the
upcoming Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan movie, ``You've Got Mail.'' AOL's
current $40.9 billion market valuation dwarfs those of Eastman
Kodak, Caterpillar and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround started in 1996, when AOL spent $700 million to
fix its network and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, unassuming AOL CEO Steve Case and Bob Pittman,
the charismatic co-founder of MTV who is AOL's chief operating
officer, pioneered the business of selling ``eyeballs'' to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, AOL acquired rival CompuServe, allowing it to
capture about 60 percent of home use of the Internet, and bought
Israeli startup Mirabilis Ltd. and its popular Internet chat
technology, ICQ, for $287 million in cash. In addition, AOL bought
NetChannel Inc., a WebTV competitor, for an undisclosed sum in
April.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't stop there. AOL plans to introduce AOL Direct, a
personalized online newspaper that users can download to their PCs,
and Hometown AOL, where home pages can be grouped by common hobbies
or regions.

RENO LEANING AGAINST GORE INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno is inclined not to seek
an independent counsel to investigate campaign fund-raising matters
involving Vice President Al Gore, Justice Department sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has until today to inform a special three-judge panel of
her decision, and within two weeks she must decide whether to ask
for an independent counsel to investigate campaign fund-raising
questions surrounding President Clinton and former White House
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department source said Reno was still undecided on an
independent counsel for Gore, but had sent signals that suggest she
was leaning against seeking such an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The source said Reno was not far enough along in her examination
of the evidence in the Clinton and Ickes cases to have made a
decision, though other legal sources speculated that the
allegations against Ickes made him more vulnerable to an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has until Dec. 7 to make a decision on Clinton and Nov. 30
to decide in the Ickes matter.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming decisions represent a critical phase in the Justice
Department's probe of fund-raising practices by the 1996
Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans on Capitol Hill, frustrated by Reno's refusal
so far to seek an independent counsel to look at campaign
fund-raising, want to make the topic part of the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, the chairman feels (Reno) should do the smart
thing and appoint an independent counsel to investigate the entire
matter,'' said John Williams, a spokesman for Representative Dan
Burton, an Indiana Republican who heads the House Government Reform
and Oversight Committee, which conducted hearings on campaign
fund-raising last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has conducted a 90-day review to
determine whether Gore lied to FBI agents investigating the
legality of fund-raising calls he made from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, after a similar 90-day review, Reno decided
against seeking an independent counsel to investigate Gore. Reno
said the 45 telephone calls Gore made from the White House in 1995
and 1996 were not in violation of a law forbidding fund-raising on
federal property. She said the law applied only to federally
regulated contributions known as ``hard money,'' while Gore was
soliciting unregulated contributions, or ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno reopened the question in August when the Justice
Department obtained a memo that seemed to suggest Gore knew he was
soliciting hard money. In the memo, a Gore aide, David Strauss,
wrote that the fund-raising would be ``65 percent soft, 35 percent
hard.'' The memo quoted Gore as saying ``count me in'' on the
fund-raising calls.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said Monday, ``Wherever this
process takes us, we are confident it will ultimately conclude
favorably. ... Everything the vice president did was proper.''
</P>
<P>
   If an independent counsel is not appointed, it would remove a
possible obstacle as Gore prepares to run for president in 2000.
But if one is named, the vice president may still be able to
overcome it, said a White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, President Clinton was reelected with an independent
counsel hanging over him, and in 1988, then-Vice President George
Bush was elevated to the presidency when he was being investigated
by an independent counsel,'' the aide said, referring respectively
to the Whitewater and Iran-Contra probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, it seems that independent counsels are
almost a prerequisite to be a successful presidential candidate,''
the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, he faces the possible distinction of becoming
the first president investigated by two special counsels if Reno
decides to seek one to determine whether he illegally benefited
from campaign ads paid for by the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry focuses on whether Clinton and the White House
coordinated with the Democratic Party to assist his reelection
through the use of issue-advocacy ads the party ran. If so, that
may have violated the federal spending limits he agreed to when he
accepted taxpayer financing of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and DNC have denied wrongdoing and say both
parties used issue ads in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a problem with them, then the problem continues,''
said a senior White House official. ``Campaign finance reform is
the way to deal with them, not these endless investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ickes's case, Reno is trying to determine whether he
committed perjury when he testified before a Senate committee
investigating whether he helped the Teamsters with a labor dispute
because of the union's campaign contributions.

NETSCAPE, AOL DEAL COULD AID MICROSOFT  &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - ANTITRUST   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The proposed America Online-Netscape-Sun Microsystems deal could
help Microsoft from a legal point of view because it gives the
software giant more competition in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal surfaced as the government's antitrust case
against Microsoft entered its sixth week before U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could point to the AOL-Netscape alliance as fresh
evidence bolstering its defense that it can't monopolize an
industry that is constantly changing. A combined AOL-Netscape would
create a formidable foe against Microsoft in the fight for control
of the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger is a very ill-timed development for the
government,'' said antitrust attorney Hillard Sterling of the
Chicago firm Gordon &AMP; Glickson. ``The merger (shows) evidences &LR; 
 &LR; the vibrancy of competition throughout the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wasted no time in trying to spin the development in
its favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the
government,'' Microsoft General Counsel William Neukom said.
``Microsoft's competitors have always had the ability and the
resources to change the competitive landscape and to do that
virtually overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal could undercut some of the sanctions Microsoft might
face if it loses the case, said Michael Cooper, a Washington, D.C.,
antitrust attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``A conceivable outcome is for the judge to say, `Yes, Microsoft
is a very bad boy, but today, because of the circumstances, there
is no way we can provide an effective remedy,''' said Cooper, a
former senior counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on
Antitrust, Monopoly and Business Rights and a partner with the law
firm Bryan Cave.
</P>
<P>
   If AOL adopts Netscape's browser for its 14 million users, ``I'd
have a hard time seeing the judge order Microsoft to include
Netscape on all operating systems as an icon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may change the landscape of the Internet and the
lightning fast high-tech industry. Antitrust experts say that poses
an unusual dilemma for a methodical judicial system that is used to
dealing with evidence from the past, not evidence in the present
that is constantly evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson cannot ignore these shifts in the competitive
landscape,'' said Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors said the deal won't affect their case,
which contends that Microsoft used its market-dominating Windows
computer operating system to squeeze Netscape out of the Internet
browser market.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Miller, who headed a Justice Department's Microsoft
investigation in 1994 and is now a partner with Folger Levin &AMP; Kahn
in San Francisco, said the merger will not undermine the
government's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice has painted a very clear picture of
Microsoft engaging in a series of anticompetitive acts in order to
preserve its dominant position,'' said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to use the AOL-Netscape deal as an
example of how Netscape was so weakened by Microsoft that it
couldn't remain a viable independent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do agree that there is competition out there, but this
(deal) doesn't necessarily indicate that the competition is
healthy,'' said Mike Elgan, editor of Windows magazine. ``This is
not what companies do when they are succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being acquired doesn't mean you can compete,'' said Julia
Pickar, an analyst with Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City. ``This
is not competing. In some cases, you could say this is a defeat.
The deal is no small sum, but without Microsoft (and its actions)
who knows what Netscape would have been worth.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Sterling said the strongest moment of the government's case
so far came in testimony that AOL chose to use Microsoft's Internet
Explorer not because of its technical merits, but to gain a
prominent spot on the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
   That evidence could be undermined if AOL switches to Netscape,
leaving prosecutors with a case based on complaints from
competitors that Microsoft played hardball, Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal raises antitrust issues, experts do not expect
the Justice Department to block an AOL-Netscape-Sun alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The current court case is meant to ensure competition in the
marketplace, so the Justice Department ``would be foolhardy to try
to block Netscape from becoming more competitive,'' Sterling said.

THE SECRETS OF CHEAP AIRLINE SEATS  
 BY REBECCA SMITH
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - FLIGHT   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
O ne of the best, and most easily overlooked, ways to lower air
fares is to shop airports as avidly as airlines. Picking the right
airport combination can net huge savings.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers heading to Long Beach from the Bay Area have two
choices: a $1,200 America West flight out of San Francisco or a $78
round trip out of Oakland on WinAir, which started service Sunday
in a niche that America West has had to itself.
</P>
<P>
   That's an unusually glaring example, but many trips from Bay
Area airports to other cities reveal price disparities worth
exploiting.
</P>
<P>
   When priced last week, Boston-bound flights on America West were
nearly $200 cheaper for departures from San Jose or San Francisco
($298) than from Oakland ($486), for example.
</P>
<P>
   In canvassing for the lowest prices, it pays to consider all the
options, especially for flights between metropolitan areas with
multiple airports. Consumers going from the Bay Area to New York,
for instance, have nine flight routes to consider, because each
metropolitan area has three nearby airports.
</P>
<P>
   A spot survey last week showed that the cheapest round-trip
ticket from San Francisco International Airport to New York's
LaGuardia, the closest airport to downtown New York City, was $549
for a midweek flight on American Airlines (nonrefundable, seven-day
advance purchase, Saturday stay required).
</P>
<P>
   A simple route adjustment _ flying into Newark, N.J., which is
only 20 miles from downtown New York _ dropped the ticket price on
American to $388.
</P>
<P>
   The rock-bottom New York ticket was a $281 round-trip fare from
San Francisco to Kennedy International Airport on Tower Air. Great
as that sounds, Tower's limited departure schedule _ only one
flight out of SFO daily at 9 p.m. _ means it's impractical for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are many factors that travelers might want to
consider in addition to price, such as whether flights are nonstop,
the convenience of getting to and from different airports,
long-term parking fees, the quality of in-flight meals (if any) and
frequent-flier incentive programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, frequent-flier miles are more important than
the price,'' says Paula Quon, owner of Supreme Travel in San
Francisco. In general, she finds that there has to be at least a
$50 difference in ticket prices before people will switch airports.
</P>
<P>
   For those willing to make adjustments, the rewards are ample.
Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _For those headed to Washington, D.C., a nonstop U.S. Airways
flight from San Francisco to Washington-Baltimore International
Airport was $349 last week, $71 cheaper and two hours faster than
American Airlines flights out of SFO to National or Dulles that
required plane changes.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore is 35 miles from Capitol Hill, Dulles is 28 miles and
National is four miles.
</P>
<P>
   _You'll save $129 by flying to Chicago's O'Hare Airport from San
Jose on TWA ($287) rather than out of Oakland on Southwest ($416)
to Chicago's Midway Airport.
</P>
<P>
   _Miami is reached more cheaply from Oakland ($313) on United,
with 21-day advance purchase, than either San Jose ($341) or San
Francisco ($484).
</P>
<P>
   In order to understand why prices seem to be all over the lot,
it helps to understand the thought process used to set prices.
Airlines often match competitors' prices to hold market share.
</P>
<P>
   But they also use elaborate methods to forecast demand and do
whatever it takes to keep their own planes flying full. The
selection of an airport by a traveler simply becomes another
component of demand.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since deregulation of the airline industry began in 1978,
the industry has been busy perfecting ``yield management'' software
that predicts demand and rations the sale of cheap seats
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What carriers always are evaluating is, `How many seats do I
have left and what will the remaining demand be,''' says Garrett
Van Ryzin, professor of business at Columbia University in New
York. ``They don't want a flight leaving with empty seats, but
neither do they want to fill up a plane with $69 fares.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport demographics are factored into demand projections. That
often means routes with lots of business travelers, such as from
San Francisco to New York, have fewer cheap tickets available in
anticipation of last-minute business travelers who may be willing
to pay more. By contrast, leisure routes with more price-sensitive
vacationing travelers, such as Oakland to Miami, tend to get more
discount fares.
</P>
<P>
   The task of pricing tickets to meet demand is daunting for all
carriers. Consider the challenge for United Airlines, the nation's
No.1 carrier, with 580 aircraft in its fleet. That means its annual
inventory is 140 million seats on 780,000 flights.
</P>
<P>
   United recently spent $20 million for a new computer system
whose name is familiar to many Americans. ``Deep Blue,'' IBM's
massively parallel-processing computer, defeated the world chess
champion, Garry Kasparov, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a copy of that machine is running state-of-the-art software
developed by United to track seat sales for every flight. Deep Blue
compares current sales with past sales, makes forecasts of future
demand and adjusts prices daily.
</P>
<P>
   If sales are slow, Deep Blue releases more budget-priced
tickets. It also calculates how many seats should be set aside for
last-minute business travelers who will pay top prices. That means,
for example, it may nix cheap tickets for flights from San Jose to
Las Vegas during Comdex, the giant computer show held last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Deep Blue to enhance our revenues by at least $100
million a year,'' says Bob Merz, United's director of domestic
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Other strategies also are helping airlines enjoy record
earnings. They buy new planes, which can cost $200 million apiece,
only when they need replacements or when they believe demand is
sufficient to fill a plane nearly as soon as it's introduced.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has proved successful during the past eight years
of a booming economy. Planes are flying fuller today than at any
time since 1945-46, when the nation emerged from war short of the
capacity it needed.
</P>
<P>
   Once consumers understand that airlines are trying to hug the
demand curve, ticketing becomes more intelligible. Things that had
seemed entirely illogical suddenly looks sensible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you've had the experience of booking a budget ticket and
been told only middle seats were available when you requested a
seat assignment, you've probably experienced another offshoot of
yield management.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines often set aside premium seats _ window and aisle seats
in the forward part of the plane _ in anticipation of selling
last-minute tickets to business travelers. They don't want to
antagonize the highest-paying customers by sticking them in middle
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to find the best fares is to use an experienced
travel agent who's willing to check out the different airport
options and report back. Never assume you know the cheapest route
based on past experience. It's a fluid, dynamic process.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who enjoy hunting the Internet should consider airline
Web sites that offer special deals, often seats at discount fares
that airlines are trying to move quickly as a flight approaches.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Also, online ticket services such as Preview Travel
( &LR; www.previewtravel.com &LR; ), (CQ) &LR; Cheap Tickets Inc.
( &LR; www.cheaptickets &LR; .  &LR; com &LR; ) (CQ) &LR; and Travelocity
( &LR; www.travelocity. &LR;   &LR; com &LR; ) (CQ) &LR; constantly survey the market and
can issue tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who is flexible on airports as well as airlines can
do the best,'' says Michael Estill, a third-generation travel agent
and general manager of the Western Association of Travel Agents in
Los Altos, a trade group. ``There are some dramatic differences in
fares out there.''

PALMER'S IRE UP FOR IRISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took until the last regular-season game, but
USC quarterback Carson Palmer finally admitted he is ``mad'' about
something.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who has been remarkably unflappable this season,
acknowledged he has a special feeling for this week's opponent,
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to commit there my junior year,'' Palmer said. ``I
went there for a football camp and fell in love with the campus.
Then they told me I needed to bring up my SAT score 100 points. If
they wanted me, I thought they could try to get me in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me mad. After that, I started to look around. I've
been waiting for this game for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame game isn't the only thing that has stirred
Palmer. He's gotten a complete taste of the rivalry with UCLA the
past few days, thanks to a barrage of critical remarks from the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA linebacker Brandon Ayanbadejo said Palmer was ``terrible''
and that the Bruins' redshirt freshmen quarterbacks were better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll cut that out and remember it for next year,'' Palmer
said. ``I was a little surprised he said that, whether he thinks
that or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally amusing to Palmer was that he allegedly fired up the
Bruins with remarks he made during a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some reporters asked me what I thought about UCLA. I said I
thought they were beatable,'' Palmer said. ``That's all said. I
didn't trash talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the game, UCLA players did not remember what
Palmer said or when he made the comments, but said he had been
critical of the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Even without his extra motivation to play Notre Dame, Palmer
believes the Trojans will have no problem being motivated to play
the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be hungry for a victory,'' he said.
``Everybody's upset (about the loss to UCLA).''
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem: USC coach Paul Hackett said he doesn't feel any
extra pressure trying to protect the Trojans' two-game winning
streak over the Irish. On the surface, it would seem to be a little
more stressful situation than snapping a seven-year losing streak
to UCLA that two previous coaches (Larry Smith and John Robinson)
had already started.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett said perpetuating the winning streak is not an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pressure for this team,'' Hackett said. ``It's about
now. How we respond is the mark of this team. In the past, we have
responded well to losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett will not be making his debut against the Irish as a head
coach. He went 0-3 against Notre Dame when he coached at
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   What about Soward? After a week of focusing on wide receiver R.
Jay Soward's sprained ankle, it doesn't figure to be much of an
issue this week. Soward ran plays during Sunday's practice and did
not seem to be bothered by his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Matock returns: Defensive lineman Marc Matock, who said he
wouldn't play against UCLA, actually participated in several
goal-line situations. He missed just six games after fracturing his
ankle against Arizona State in October.

 HOW TO SELL LEAST-TAXED SHARES
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - MONEY BAG   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: &LR;  Suppose I purchase stock in the same company at different &LR; 
 &LR; times and different prices and then sell part of my holdings &LR; 
 &LR; later. How do I determine my cost basis in computing the &LR;   &LR; capital
gain or loss? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: A capital loss? Goodness, what happened to the stock market
this year?
</P>
<P>
   When you decide to sell shares, you can pick and choose the ones
that best suit your tax situation. Ordinarily, you will want to
sell shares that show a capital loss to offset your income. If all
your shares are profitable, you might want to sell those with the
smallest gains.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is simple enough if you have physical possession
of the stock certificates. Just deliver the appropriate
certificates to your broker.
</P>
<P>
   But if, like most investors, your stock is held by your broker
in street name, you must tread carefully.
</P>
<P>
   You still can choose which shares to sell, but you should tell
your broker in advance. Specifically state that you want to sell
100 shares of XYZ Co. that you bought on July 11, 1994, or
whatever. After the transaction is complete, get the broker to send
you written confirmation that those were the shares you sold.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a hassle and it seems hokey. But if you are audited by
the Internal Revenue Service, the written confirmation will
forestall any arguments and perhaps save you money.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the necessary documentation and the IRS wants
to play hardball, it legally can insist that you calculate your
profits or losses on a ``first in, first out'' basis. That means
the shares you sold first have to be the ones you bought first. You
may be forced to amend your return, and your tax bill for the year
might increase.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Odd-Lot Buyback
</P>
<P>
   Q: I own fewer than 100 shares of Motorola. They sent out a
letter asking stockholders with less than 100 shares to either sell
their shares back to the company or buy enough to bring the total
to 100. Selling my shares is the last thing I want to do; I'm in it
for the long term. Purchasing the difference would require me to
produce at least $2,600, which I don't have. Why do people who want
to start saving have to face hassles rather than encouragement?
</P>
<P>
   A: First of all, relax. I called Motorola, and their investor
relations department assured me that their odd-lot elimination
program is ``purely voluntary.'' They say you have a third choice,
which is to hold on to your shares and  &LR; do nothing.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the years, many companies have tried to eliminate the
number of odd-lot shareholders by offering to buy back their shares
or encouraging them to increase their holdings. The companies
explain that it costs them big money to process dividends, send out
financial reports, solicit proxies and perform all the other tasks
imposed on them by regulators. The fewer shareholders they must
service, the better they like it.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a company legally cannot force you to redeem your
shares or buy more, says John Heine, a spokesman for the Securities
and Exchange Commission. He adds, however, that it can accomplish
this as a byproduct of other activities that are legal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it might negotiate a merger whose terms include
cash buyouts of all odd-lot shareholders. Or it might declare a
reverse split _ distributing, say, one new share for every 100 old
shares you hold, with the stipulation that those who own fewer than
100 shares will receive cash instead.
</P>
<P>
   Both such maneuvers are extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Muni-Bond Yields &QL; 
Q: My credit union pays taxable interest of 5.75 percent. I am
thinking about transferring my money to a municipal-bond fund that
is exempt from federal and California income taxes. I am in the 36
percent federal tax bracket. What is the minimum interest rate I
would need from such a fund to increase my after-tax income?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can calculate the answer by feeding the numbers into the
following formula:
</P>
<P>
   Taxable equivalent yield equals tax-free yield divided by (1
minus your tax bracket).
</P>
<P>
   First, we have to adjust your tax rate to 42 percent from 36
percent. That takes into account both the fact that you are taxed
by the state at 9.3 percent and also that your state taxes are
deductible on your federal return.
</P>
<P>
   So in your case, the formula becomes 5.75 X/(1 minus 0.42),
where ``X'' is the interest rate you are wondering about.
</P>
<P>
   Solving the equation for X, we come up with an answer of 3.34
percent _ the tax-free interest rate that is equivalent to your
taxable credit-union rate. Any tax-free yield greater than 3.34
percent would increase your after-tax income.
</P>
<P>
   The formula _ along with a table that displays an array of
combined and adjusted federal/state tax rates _ appears every
Monday in The Chronicle Business section, on the Data Bank page. It
is of practical use only for people whose federal tax rate is 28
percent or higher. Below that bracket, investors seldom if ever
benefit from tax-free bonds or funds.

MARKET ROARS BACK TO RECORD LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three months after plunging on fears of a global
financial crisis, the US stock market roared back into record
territory Monday, extending a stunning comeback and easing concerns
that the bull market of the 1990s had played itself out.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices were carried aloft by continued optimism about the
Federal Reserve and news of 10 mergers valued at more than $1
billion, the largest number ever disclosed in a single day,
according to Securities Data Corp. The Fed is widely credited with
having pulled the financial world back from catastrophe by cutting
interest rates three times since late September.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The market's lightening recovery seemed to leave some
investment professionals almost as shaken Monday as they were by
its precipitous fall following Russia's debt default in August. But
it also produced predictions of good times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a day for the bulls and there are going to be a lot
more of them,'' said Ben A. Hock Jr., portfolio manager for the
$700 million John Hancock Growth fund. ``We're in a bull mode
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrial average, comprised of 30 stocks repesenting
the cream of corporate America, climbed 214.72 points, or 2.3
percent, to close at 9374.27. That is well above its previous
record close, reached in July 17, of 9337.97, and nearly 25 percent
above the low point of 7539.07 hit Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a barometer for the wider
market overall, also reached record territory, rising 24.66 points,
or 2.1 percent, to 1188.21. That is just slightly higher than its
previous record and 28 percent above its summer low.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's runup, the eighth daily gain in a row, renewed hopes
that the market can reach what until recently were thought to be
unreachable heights, and unleashed a veritable torrent of merger
deals. It also fueled what some see as a near-hysteria for Internet
stocks like Amazon.com and eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the mood of the market is that we're going to a
10,000 Dow,'' said Byron Wein, chief equities strategist for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``That's definitely the psychology; it's
not a question of whether, it's only a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment professionals said that the rush of mergers, which
reversed a fall-off in company buying in recent months, was the
product of the market's upward climb and would likely to continue
through at least the end ofthe year. Although that might seem
counter-intuitive, since buyers are making their purchases when
prices are rising, not falling, analysts said that most of the
deals are stock swaps, which means that the buyers' shares are
going up along with those of the seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard for companies and their boards to pull the
trigger on deals with stock prices so volatile,'' said Rick
Escherich, a mergers and acquisitions specialist with J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co. But with prices now on an upward swing, firms that had been
holding back on mergers are beginning to to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pretty healthy backlog so we anticipate the market
(for mergers) will be fairly robust,'' Escherich said.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest of Monday's deals, Tyco International Ltd., whose
executives office are in Exeter, N.H., offered to buy electronic
components maker AMP Inc. for $11.3 billion in stock, topping a
$9.8 billion cash bid by AlliedSignal Inc. Tyco is best known for
its ADT security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Among the closely watched deals was Deutsche Bank AG's
announcement it close to buying New York-based Bankers Trust Co.
for about $8.86 billion in cash in what would be the largest ever
foreign takeover of a US financial firm.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, disability insurer Unum Corp, based in Portland,
Maine, said it would merge with Provident Cos. in a $4.75 billion
stock swap, and Boston-based Fleet Financial Group Inc. confirmed
it had agreed to buy Sanwa Bank Ltd.'s US finance unit, reportedly
for $700 million plus assumption of a substantial amount of debt.
</P>
<P>
   This year's merger total, which already surpassed last year's
record-setting levels before Monday's deals, is now likely to top
the $1.5 trillion mark, according to Richard Peterson of Securities
Data. And, like much else about 1998, it was largely unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began the year with the Dow at about 7900 and analysts
predicting that stock prices would rise only modestly because of
the dampening effects of the Asian crisis. Instead, fueled by
Asian-related interest rate declines, the market average took off
like a bat and had added more than 18 percent to its value by
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   But almost as swiftly as they had risen, stocks began tumbling a
month later when Russia abruptly devalued the ruble and defaulted
on part of its foreign debt. The default, which by most objective
measures should have been comparatively minor event, turned into a
rout that drove the Dow down more than 20 percent and looked for a
time in late September as if it would spread to Brazil, a key
market for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly troubling was the refusal of investors to assume
anything but the lowest of risks. Stocks, even blue chips,
cratered, with money rushing into ultra-safe short-term US Treasury
notes.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point that the Fed announced the first of three
interest rate cuts that have sent stock prices back upward,
substantially increased lending, and seem likely to gun the
economy. ``As long as (Fed chairman) Alan Greenspan is going to
print this much money, the market is going to rise,'' said Maureen
F. Allyn, chief economist with Scudder Kemper Investments in New
York. ``It's a liquidity-driven market.''
</P>
<P>
   Allyn and some other analysts worry that the problems that set
off last summer's global rout could eventually resurface. ``There's
a fundamental headwind here,'' she said. ``It doesn't blow as
strongly as liquidity, but it blows steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   However such concerns were not in much evidence Monday,
especially among Internet stock investors who sent shares of eBay
Inc., a California-based on-line auction firm, up an astounding 46
to 193. The same company's stock was selling for 25 only six weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index is now up
25.9 percent for the year, outpacing the Dow's gain of 18.5 percent
so far this year and a jump of 22.4 percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's rise was accompanied by a fall in bond prices
Monday as investors pulled money out of less risky debt instruments
in order to pump it into riskier equities. The price of a 30-year
Treasury fell $5.31 per $1,000 bond Monday, pushing its market
interest rate up to 5.25 percent.

MARK VEVERKA/STREET SMARTS  
 YAHOO'S RISE SHOWS HOW WACKY IS THE WORLD OF INTERNET STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - STREET SMARTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
If Wal-Mart were in serious talks to buy Sears, Roebuck, would
Dayton Hudson's stock soar 16 percent in response to the news?
</P>
<P>
   I doubt it. But just because America Online and Netscape are
slow-dancing cheek-to-cheek, Yahoo's stock vaulted nearly 31 points
yesterday. (Sun Microsystems is also expected to figure in the
deal.)
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Wall Street would often punish a stock if a key
rival was  &LR; were close to making a blockbuster acquisition. The
psychology being that one competitor would be on the verge of
getting bigger and badder while the other stood still.
</P>
<P>
   But such is not the case in the wacky world of Internet stocks.
Yahoo zealots are rationalizing the share rise as an affirmation
that their investment has a better business model than AOL. Hence,
the impetus for the AOL-Netscape combination.
</P>
<P>
   AOL merely jumped around 6 percent percent, while Yahoo took off
like the space shuttle. Of course, Internet stock aficionados would
argue that Yahoo and AOL are not competitors. They would say that
AOL is an online service, and Yahoo is an Internet directory,
stressing the point that each company is a leader in its respective
``space.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's bunk. AOL and Yahoo may boast different business
models, but they are both Internet portals. And they are competing
to be the most widely used Internet media companies on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And because their stratospheric stock valuations are based on
revenues expected during the next millennium, it would seem logical
to consider that by 2005 the two companies will resemble each other
as much as Wal-Mart and Dayton Hudson do today. That is to say, if
they both survive as independent entities, you can bet that AOL and
Yahoo will share more similarities than differences several years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if you apply old-school stock market logic (hey, work with
me on this), Yahoo and other portal stocks should be taking it on
the chin about now.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet ``stocks should be going down, not up,'' says
David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   If AOL successfully acquires Netscape's browser and Netcenter
businesses for nearly $4 billion as reported, AOL could be getting
a steal given the high-octane valuations that investors place on
leading Internet stocks, Simons says. For example, using Yahoo's
price-to-sales ratio of 286, Simons figures that Netcenter alone
should be worth five times more than what AOL is offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I was surprised by how Yahoo's stock
responded,'' says financial analyst Derek Brown of Volpe, Brown in
San Francisco, who has a ``hold'' recommendation on Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) we've been noticing all year that category leaders on
the Internet stocks have benefited disproportionately to investor
enthusiasm,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Oftentimes, mergers beget mergers. Does Brown think that Yahoo
might hatch some kind of counter move to AOL's potential deal with
Netscape? ``Yes, probably, but I wouldn't even guess what that
would be,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the AOL-Netscape-Sun talks are having an effect on
Internet stocks similar to the buyout-spree of portals last summer.
When Disney bought a chunk of Infoseek and General Electric's NBC
bought pieces of Cnet and its Snap search engine, the Internet pack
got frothy. And it's possible that more consolidation is in the
offing, says Bruce Lupatkin, the former Hambrecht &AMP; Quist research
director who is starting his own technology investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, he's not certain sure &LR; that Yahoo should buy another
Net company just to add eyeballs. &UR;  &LR; ``I think Yahoo has to continue
to do what they've done so far'' building its  &LR; their business,
Lupatkin says. ``I don't think they need to rush out and buy
another search engine company, for example.``
</P>
<P>
   But what if Yahoo were to buy or merge with a quality electronic
commerce site, one with a real business model? Say Amazon.com?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would make a whole lot more sense. I think
everybody is hanging their collective hat on e-commerce,'' Lupatkin
surmises.
</P>
<P>
   And a bunch of Yahoo shareholders are hanging their hats on AOL,
Netscape and Sun.

 &HT;    Sodomy law violates Georgia Constitution, Supreme Court
decidesBy Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday overturned the
state's controversial anti-sodomy law because it had a case with
just the right facts: consensual, unforced sex in the privacy of a
home, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In a powerful 6-1 decision, the court said the 165-year-old law
violates the state Constitution's protection of the right to
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision set conservative legislators seeking ways to
reinstate the provisions when the lawmakers reconvene Jan. 11. Just
two years ago, the court had upheld the statute, but this case
involved the solicitation of sodomy at a public rest area off I-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot think of any other activity that reasonable persons
would rank as more private and more deserving of protection from
governmental interference than consensual, private, adult sexual
activity,'' Chief Justice Robert Benham wrote for the majority.
``We conclude that such activity is at the heart of the Georgia
Constitution's protection of the right of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, courts in three states _ Montana, Tennessee and
now Georgia _ have overturned laws that criminalize sodomy. Similar
challenges are being considered in Arkansas, Louisiana, Maryland
and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen states still criminalize sodomy, which is oral or anal
sex, even if consensual. Of those, 13 criminalize sodomy regardless
of gender and five make it a crime if it's committed by
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Supreme Court overturned the sodomy conviction of
Anthony Powell, convicted in Gwinnett County for sodomizing his
17-year-old niece. Although Powell was charged with raping his
niece, the jury acquitted him of that charge, allowing criminal
defense attorney Steve Sadow to argue that the sodomy was
consensual.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made this precisely the kind of case that allowed the law
to be overturned,'' said Howard Hunter, dean of Emory University
law school. ``This involved unforced sexual behavior between
consenting adults in the privacy of a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights groups applauded the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the law applied to everybody it was
disproportionately invoked against our community,'' said Stephen
Scarborough, staff attorney for the Lambda Legal Defense and
Educational Fund. ``We're no longer branded criminals because we
have consensual sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Georgia's sodomy law in
the landmark case, Bowers v. Hardwick, by ruling that consenting
adults have no constitutional right to private homosexual conduct.
But Benham noted that the right of privacy guaranteed under
Georgia's Constitution is far more extensive than that guaranteed
under the U.S. Constitution.

 &HT;    Sodomy law may gain new life through legislatureBy Bill Rankin

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Supreme Court's decision Monday to throw
out the state's anti-sodomy law may be the final legal decision
unless state legislators are able to muster the support for a
voter-approved Constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 6-1 ruling cannot be appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court because the justices decided the case on the basis of the
Georgia Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen states still criminalize sodomy, which is oral or anal
sex, even if consensual. Of those, 13 criminalize sodomy regardless
of gender and five make it a crime if it's committed by
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know that the state Constitutions are alive and
well and we don't have to hitch our fates as citizens solely to
protections under the U.S. Constitution,'' said Harvard Law School
professor Laurence Tribe, who unsuccessfully challenged the Georgia
law before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986. ``This is a fine opinion
on the right to privacy, one that is going to be in the vanguard of
a national trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative lawmakers expressed disappointment with the opinion
and said they will try to make it void.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue is whether or not the state is going to condone
sinful behavior,'' said Georgia Senate Minority Leader Eric Johnson
(R-Savannah). But Johnson noted it will take a two-thirds majority
of the General Assembly to approve a proposed constitutional
amendment, which then must be approved by voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what direction we will take,'' said State
Rep. Len Walker (R-Loganville), a Methodist minister. ``I do know
it will be addressed.'' He said social conservatives fear the
decision will have longterm implications on issues such as same-sex
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But House Judiciary Chairman Jim Martin (D-Atlanta) said he will
scrutinize any legislation that comes through his committee and
bucks the court decision. ``I'd hate to think we'd be so silly as
to try to amend the Georgia Constitution to take away person's
individual liberty rights in this area,'' Martin said. ``There is a
point of personal liberty beyond which government shouldn't
intrude. That's a consevative theory, not a liberal one.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's sodomy law has a rich legal history and was thrust
into the national spotlight when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld it
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Attorney General Mike Bowers defended the statute in the
case of Bowers v. Hardwick. It was his aggressive defense of the
law that later caused him to fire an attorney in his office.
Because attorney Robin Shahar planned a religious commitment
ceremony with her female companion, Bowers said Shahar's employment
would be a conflict for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Shahar sued but her lawsuit, after numerous appeals, was
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Shahar, now a senior staff attorney for the city of
Atlanta, was exurberant. ``You never know when you're going to get
victories,'' she said. ``You never know how long it's going to take
the courts to catch up with society's vision of what is just and
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said he expects a legislative challenge, adding, ``I
can't imagine how they made such a ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Steve Sadow, who represented defendant Anthony
Powell, said it was the court's standard of review that made all
the difference in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who once lived in Norcross, was sentenced to five years
in prison for sodomizing his 17-year-old niece. He served 14 months
before being released on bond pending his appeal, and now lives in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the sodomy law,
challenged by a man convicted of solicitation of sodomy at a public
rest area. In that case, the state's highest court required
prosecutors to prove the state had ``a rational basis'' for the
anti-sodomy law. The rational-basis test gave prosecutors a low
burden of proof, Sadow noted.
</P>
<P>
   But during his arguments in May before the Georgia Supreme
Court, Sadow urged the justices to hold the state to a tougher
standard of review _ making prosecutors show the state has ``a
compelling interest'' in maintaining the sodomy statute because it
infringes on the right to privacy. And the court followed his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, it was a whole new ballgame,'' Sadow said. ``This
involved private, consensual conduct that the state has no
compelling need to prosecute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the majority opinion, Chief Justice Robert Benham relied
heavily on a 1905 Georgia Supreme Court opinion in which the court
recognized that the state's citizens have a ``liberty of privacy''
guaranteed under the state Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Georgia recognizes the right of privacy as a
fundamental constitutional right, having a value so essential to
the individual liberty in our society that (its) infringement
merits careful scrutiny by the courts,'' Benham wrote. ``(Powell)
was convicted for performing an unforced act of sexual intimacy
with one legally capable of consenting in the privacy of his home.
Accordingly, appellant's conviction for such behavior must be
reversed.''

IRAQ WRITES U.N. A 3RD TIME EXPLAINING WHY IT'S RESISTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For the third time since international arms
inspectors returned to Iraq last week, Baghdad sent the Security
Council a letter on Monday explaining why President Saddam Hussein
has no intention of giving the inspectors documents they are
seeking to round out their knowledge of his weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed 18-page letter arrived as the United States laid
out for the first time here what it defines as adequate cooperation
from Iraq. Peter Burleigh, the American representative to the
United Nations, said on Monday evening that the United States was
looking not only for Iraq's willingness to turn over requested
documents but also for interviews with key people and the freedom
to inspect anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is prepared to give the Iraqis time to
demonstrate cooperation on all fronts, Burleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi explanations in Monday's letter were familiar, if more
elaborate or even legalistic than the more impassioned statements
of defiance voiced in Baghdad in recent days. The letter, written
to the Security Council by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
describes a dozen categories of requested documents as largely
nonexistent or irrelevant to the arms inspectors' work.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz was responding to a letter to the council on Friday by
Richard Butler, executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission,
laying out his most recent problems with Iraq. After the Persian
Gulf war in 1991, the commission, called UNSCOM, was charged with
monitoring the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz's core complaint was summarized in one paragraph of his
lengthy reply: ``The position of the executive chairman boils down
to this. That Iraq should always answer any request in the
affirmative regardless of the limits of the possible and it is not
entitled to make any explanation; otherwise Iraq, in the view of
the executive chairman, will not be cooperating.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other documents sought by Butler is a paper found in Iraqi
Air Force headquarters in July by one of his inspectors and
snatched away by Iraqi officials. He has also requested journals
and other records kept by specific Iraqi officers in key jobs,
documents that the Iraqis say were long ago destroyed. Inspectors
are sure the documents exist, or did until recently, because they
either saw them or were told about them by Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh said on Monday that he had ``full confidence that
UNSCOM wouldn't ask for them if they were not significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Iraq is seen to be cooperating with UNSCOM, there is no
chance of beginning the comprehensive review of its obligations
that the council promised Saddam's government in return for lifting
his ban on arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is in the process of extending the ``oil
for food'' program, which allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of
oil to buy civilian goods. It put off discussion of Aziz's letter
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are also disagreements with Iraq over the oil sales
program. It wants a two-month extension of the current round of
sales. The Security Council is likely to start a new six-month
phase, which Iraqis interpret as a sign that sanctions will stay in
place well into the future.
</P>
<P>
   After the council meeting on Monday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock,
Britain's representative, called the exchange of letters and
accusations ``rather disappointing and discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're interested in is compliance and cooperation and a
spirit of working together between Baghdad and UNSCOM,'' Greenstock
said. ``We're not seeing that at the moment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the controlled Iraqi press continued to level criticisms
at Butler, weapons inspectors went out unhindered on Monday to make
the rounds of a number of sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leadership, under some pressure to manage tensions
with the United Nations or risk an attack by the United States, got
a jolt Sunday from an assassination attempt against Saddam's deputy
on the Revolutionary Command Council, who was visiting the southern
Iraqi city of Kerbala, Iraqi television reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Izzat Ibrahim, was not seriously wounded, the
report indicated. But grenades thrown as he left his car wounded
guards and bystanders. He was attending a festival commemorating
the birth of a grandson of Mohammed, Hussein, who is greatly
revered by Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Kerbala is a Shiite holy city, and Iraqi Shiite groups in the
region have a history of opposition to Saddam, who is a Sunni.
Shiites led a rebellion against him after the Iraqi defeat in the
gulf war. The Iraqi military harshly quelled it.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Ibrahim, a powerful but not very public figure who
is also deputy commander of the armed forces, came a day before
Iraqi opposition organizations gathered in Britain. The meeting of
16 groups heard the message from the British government that there
must be unity against Saddam and a common front ready to take over
Iraq without splitting it, if or when Saddam's rule ends.

CULTURE CLASH BETWEEN AOL AND NETSCAPE IS NARROWING

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Marc Andreessen and his fellow whiz kids from the
University of Illinois arrived in Silicon Valley in 1994 to found
Netscape Communications Corp., the brash new darling of the
digerati was the antithesis of America Online, which was widely
perceived as a shelter for technical ``newbies'' unprepared for the
brave new world of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   That the two are now on the brink of merging is a measure of how
much the divide between Internet sophisticates and mere
computer-using mortals has narrowed. This month's scheduled release
of the movie ``You've Got Mail,'' a romantic comedy starring Meg
Ryan, Tom Hanks and America Online, serves as final proof, if any
were needed, that cyberspace has gone mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But however sound the business sense of such a combination might
be, the vestiges of the culture clash were reflected Monday in
currents of dark humor circulating through the Internet. And the
results could be anything but funny. It is a clash, say industry
analysts, that could color the future of the two companies if their
merger is completed as expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think AOL still has all the stigma that it always had, as
far as image goes,'' Jamie Zawinski, a Netscape founder who now
oversees part of the company's browser development, wrote in an
e-mail message to a reporter Monday afternoon. Alluding to his own
e-mail address, he wrote, ``My friends keep saying `jwz(AT)aol.com'
and then laughing uncontrollably.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the jibes making the electronic rounds were spoof lyrics
meant to be sung to the tune ``The Night They Drove Old Dixie
Down'': ``The lesson is you can't live long/ Unless you market to
the clueless throng/The night they sold old Netscape down/And all
the browsers went corporate ...''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, America Online partisans did not waste time
crowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle is over. AOL wins,'' announced a posting to one
Internet news group. Such juvenile exchanges may be more of a
throwback to the elitist sparring of times past than a harbinger of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   But the very numbers that make the merger appealing also
underscore the extent to which the two most potent icons of the
Internet appeal to different audiences. According to the tracking
firm NetRatings, the users of the two companies' Web sites only
overlap by about 23 percent
</P>
<P>
   Still, the more pressing question for many who would like to see
Netscape's Navigator browser survive as a viable alternative to
Microsoft's competing Internet Explorer is what America Online will
do with the company's technology-development arm.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Netscape released the source code to its
browser, allowing anyone to submit changes and new features. While
the company had little to lose in the move, since it was also
announcing free distribution of its Navigator browser, the gesture
was greeted as a sign that Netscape's values were in the
traditional open spirit of the Internet, which the geek elite
believe is the best strategy for developing bug-free technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., in contrast, epitomizes the closed, proprietary
model of software development.
</P>
<P>
   James Love, director of the Washington-based Consumer Project on
Technology, a group affiliated with Ralph Nader, said his
organization would oppose the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in finding out how AOL will deal with
Netscape's plans for support of its browser as an open-source
product that can be freely distributed,'' Love said. ``This is a
deceptively deep issue from a policy point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   But America Online, based in Dulles, Va., perhaps most famous
for its ubiquitous disks that pop up in everything from computer
magazines to cereal boxes, has based its success on marketing
prowess, not cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has been a driven and focused consumer marketing
company,'' said Gene DeRose, president of Jupiter Communications, a
New York-based consulting company. ``But they've had an uneasy
relationship with technology. Steve Case has always said, `I don't
care where the technology is; we just have to be where the action
is.'''
</P>
<P>
   To those for whom Netscape continues to symbolize an alternative
to Microsoft, the merger will probably never be quite palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Said David Cassell, an America Online critic who runs the
AOLwatch mailing list: ``They're both huge corporations. Now it's
going to be like watching Godzilla fight Mothra and not being sure
who you're rooting for.''

EX-SUPERVISOR CHARGES LOGAN SECURITY BREACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A former security supervisor at the Logan International
Airport gate for AirTran Airlines _ the new name for ValuJet _ has
complained to federal officials that X-ray, metal, and explosive
detectors there are not in working order, and no one is doing
anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   An AirTran spokeswoman said the airline was unaware of the
complaints, which relate to its security contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas M. Ross of Boston, who supervised security personnel
as an employee of Globe Aviation Services, said an X-ray machine at
the AirTran gate failed a Federal Aviation Administration test in
August, is undependable, and has not been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Globe Aviation Services is employed by AirTran to handle its
passenger security.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said Monday he lost his job at Globe Aviation Services
after making his complaints, though the company offered him other
positions not in security. He said he wrote to the Federal Aviation
Administration in late October and last week to Peter Blute,
executive director of the Massachusetts Port Authority, which
operates Logan.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Peters, a spokesman for the New England region of the
FAA, said, ``We're aware of the allegations, and we are looking
into them. We take these kinds of allegations very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to Blute, a copy of which was obtained by the
Globe, Ross said he had ``continuously reported the failure of our
X-ray, metal detector and Ionscan (Number) 400 to act in a
deterring manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barringer Ionscan is a device that detects explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Crockford, a spokesman for Massport, said Blute had not
received any material from Ross. ``If we were to get a letter like
this, we would do what we are doing now, which is talk to the FAA
and make sure that everything checks out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for AirTran, Cara Maruskin, said a company
official was investigating but had found no communication
concerning the allegations from either the FAA or Globe Aviation
Services.
</P>
<P>
   No official from Globe Aviation Services could be reached for
comment Monday. A Globe Aviation employee, reached at the airport,
said he believed Ross had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter and backup material he said was mailed to Blute on
Nov. 16, Ross outlined the periodic failure of all three security
machines at the AirTran passenger entrance at Terminal D.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the first FAA test failure of a Heimann X-ray machine
occurred Aug. 28. ``Since as CSS I was standing behind the X-ray
operator I knew that the operator saw nothing,'' he wrote. CSS
stands for security checkpoint supervisor, the position Ross says
he held at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``After putting the bag through a second time we clearly saw the
test object,'' he continued. ``Contrary to FAA procedures the agent
did not write the test failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he noted the failure in his own daily log and called
his supervisor at home to notify him.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the metal detector at AirTran had been shown to be
defective on Aug. 5. He said he reported the devices' failures
through the rest of August and September.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a month and a half after that I kept on _ every day I
would have to put in my log the failure. `We can't clear this
thing,' I kept on writing,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, Ross said, a technician tried without success to
repair the X-ray machine, ``which meant that the ... X-Ray machine
would be nothing more than a stage prop.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said that Globe Aviation took over the Logan security
contracts of a company called Service Master on Sept. 1. He said he
had worked for Service Master and then Globe and was dismissed
``after two years of faultless work.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Ross notes other problems. ``For 48 days I dealt
with the failures of my new company to pay its employees on time,''
he said. He has also filed an age discrimination suit against
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   He added in his letter to Blute: ``Because I am articulate and a
student of airport lore I knew that my employer would use the FAA
as the most efficient way to terminate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross alleges that on Oct. 18, two days after the unsuccessful
attempt to fix the X-ray machine, his superiors arranged for him to
be on duty at an understaffed security checkpoint when another FAA
test was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was asked to check a bag by hand but refused, because
he wanted to establish that the X-ray machine was faulty. Ross said
he was then removed from his security position.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to an FAA official in East Boston, Ross said that
Globe ``did not want me back at the checkpoint. ... The only
openings that I could immediately get are both in plane cleaning or
south cargo,'' not in security.
</P>
<P>
   He signed his letter, ``a reluctant whistle-blower.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said when he returned to work after the Oct. 18 incident,
he was told, ``We're not going to put you at another checkpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he waited several weeks to see if the FAA would take
action before going to the media, but nothing happened. ``I wanted
somebody to say, `We know about this thing, we're going to correct
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Logan, the airlines are responsible for keeping security
equipment in working condition. Security personnel, Ross said,
``are not well paid, scared to death, and when they see something
like this they're not going to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe Aviation Services also does security for Northwest
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tools we have are totally useless,'' Ross said. ``To sit
there and throw a thing at me and say we're getting rid of you
because you are the problem, that is outrageous.''

WINFREY IN PARTNERSHIP FOR NEW WOMEN'S CABLE NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oxygen Media, the cable television and online company formed by
Geraldine Laybourne, the former president of Nickelodeon, has
entered into a partnership with Oprah Winfrey and
Carsey-Werner-Mandabach Co. to create a cable television network
aimed at women.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which will be announced Tuesday, creates a partnership
of leading women in the television industry. It brings Ms. Winfrey
into Oxygen as a third equity partner, along with Ms. Laybourne,
who built Nickelodeon into one of the most successful channels in
cable television, and Marcy Carsey, of Carsey-Werner-Mandabach, a
highly successful television production company that was
responsible for such comedy hits as ``The Cosby Show,''
``Roseanne'' and ``Third Rock From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously think this is a very big deal,'' Ms. Laybourne
said, ``to bring in partners like this to help me create a network
to superserve women, who are the most underserved audience in cable
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey, whose talk show has been television's leading
daytime program for much of the last decade, has branched out into
acting in and producing movies. She has committed to produce
programming for this new venture through her studio, Harpo
Productions, and to contribute the library of shows that Harpo owns
as soon as previous deals expire.
</P>
<P>
   Carsey-Werner-Mandabach will serve as the chief programmer for
the network, which is to be called the Oxygen Channel, and will
supply programs from its own library when they become available.
</P>
<P>
   The partners are planning a network that will offer programming
ranging from comedies and movies to business and personal advice
focused on women. Ms. Laybourne said the channel would be an analog
channel, perhaps the last one that will try to achieve wide
national distribution before the television industry completes its
switch to digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is expected to multiply greatly the number of
channels each program service will provide. Ms. Laybourne set the
start date for the Oxygen Channel at Jan. 1, 2000, ``so we can
usher in the new millennium properly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and then, she said, she will concentrate on building
up commitments from cable operators to carry the channel, a task
that has become more daunting in recent years as analog space on
cable systems has become scarce. Many cable operators have plans
for channel expansion, but they are also looking forward to the
beginning of digital service. In recent years, few new cable
channels have been able to achieve the widespread distribution they
need to become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laybourne said she was confident that the Oxygen service
would fill a need for a specialized women's channel and that Ms.
Winfrey and Carsey-Werner-Mandabach ``give us a lot of clout.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen has one commitment so far, Ms. Laybourne said, from
Tele-Communications Inc., the United States' largest cable
operator, for 7 million cable subscribers. Ms. Laybourne, who most
recently served as president of Disney's cable channels, has wide
contacts in the cable industry from her days leading Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gallagher, the president of another cable operator,
Century Communications, said he had spoken with Ms. Laybourne about
Oxygen and called it ``about the most exciting concept to come into
cable'' in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Though his systems may not have open channels for up to two
years, Gallagher said, ``We will probably be looking at some of the
existing channels and see if the viewers will be better served by
the content on Oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey said she was enthused to be ``one of the founding
mothers'' of the new company. She also said she intended to provide
``input and ideas'' in the short-term before she is free from other
commitments to produce more programming for the channel.
Specifically, she said she had never sold rerun rights to the huge
library of editions of her daily talk show and ``This seems like
the perfect place to release them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caryn Mandabach, one of three executives who run
Carsey-Werner-Mandabach _ the third one is Tom Werner _ said she
expected ``the vast majority of programs on the channel to be
original.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carsey, her partner, said initial plans call for Oxygen to
offer different blocks of programs for different parts of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The morning block, called The Hive, will be talk-oriented but
with a heavy component of interaction through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The midday block, Working Lunch, will emphasize issues for
working women. Ms. Laybourne noted research predicting that ``by
the year 2000, 80 percent of new businesses will be started by
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, the channel will go to a teen-age block,
hoping to reach girls who Ms. Laybourne said are not being served
well by other channels.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, the channel plans a comedy block, though
Ms. Carsey emphasized that ``this will not be comedy with a
big-budget network license fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the channel will try new, women-oriented comedy spins
on old formats such as the game show ``I've Got a Secret,'' and it
is looking into investing in foreign-made animated shows. As they
end their sales in syndication, such Carsey-Werner shows as
``Cybill,'' ``Grace Under Fire'' and ``Roseanne'' may also wind up
in the comedy block, Ms. Carsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, there will be a movie block, and this will include
commentary from a female host, perhaps delivered from her bed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carsey said her company would continue to produce new
comedies for broadcast networks, and Ms. Winfrey emphasized that
she had a commitment to produce her talk show for syndication and
movies and other special programming for ABC.

ANALYSIS: IS AOL + NETSCAPE AND SUN (GT) THAN MICROSOFT?
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR and JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online Inc. wants to become the ``next Microsoft'' in
two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just
another company _ the Internet media business and electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   With its proposed purchase of Netscape Communications Corp.,
AOL, the nation's largest dial-up online service with more than 14
million subscribers, hopes to take a significant step toward that
ambitious goal.
</P>
<P>
   If the $4 billion deal is completed _ the companies had not
reached a final agreement as of Monday night _ AOL would acquire a
leading Internet brand and enlarge its wired audience by absorbing
the millions who regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site
on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role
as the premier Internet media company,'' said James F. Moore,
president of Geopartners Inc., a consulting firm. ``America Online
is assembling the kind of audience numbers that will convince
people the Internet is becoming a mainstream media.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new media business, as in traditional media like
television or newspapers, eyeballs translate into advertising
revenue. But what really intrigues media executives and consumer
marketers about the new media _ news, entertainment and services
rendered in computer code _ is that it is inherently a two-way
medium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the
click of a mouse button
</P>
<P>
   The interaction that advertisers and marketers want to see, of
course, is buying. And it is the potential for exploiting an
instant, direct connection to consumers that has fueled all the
recent optimism about electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Today, companies are selling everything from books to baby
clothes over the Internet. Most companies have not progressed
beyond the experimentation stage, but there are a handful of
encouraging success stories like Amazon.com, the on-line bookstore.
By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business is analyzing
trends in cyberspace, projects that Internet commerce could reach
$3.2 trillion, or 5 percent of all sales worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is at the forefront of this convergence of media and
commerce converge, and integration reflected in the lineage of its
leaders. Steve Case, the chairman, was once a new-product manager
for Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, while Robert Pittman, the president,
is a former MTV executive.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also investing heavily in new media and electronic
commerce. It has an online service, MSN, which competes with AOL,
as well as information-and commerce Web sites that focus on travel,
cars and real estate. It also owns Sidewalk, a network of local
sites that list movies, restaurants and stores in cities around the
country including Seattle and New York. Its MSNBC Internet news
service is half of a joint venture with NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is expected to be a formidable competitor in the
media-and-commerce business. It has no shortage of bright people
and it has more money than any rival. Besides deep pockets,
Microsoft has the built-in advantage in any computer-based medium
because its Windows operating system runs more than 90 percent of
personal computers sold today. Its control of the Windows desktop
gives it the most valuable piece of commercial real estate in the
information age. In theory, at least, owning that desktop screen
should help Microsoft steer consumers to its online offerings _ an
issue that is key to the government's antitrust suit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Microsoft has started slowly in the fields of
Internet media and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft may want to, but it does not dominate these new
markets,'' said Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic
Partners, a research firm. ``America Online recognizes that the big
opportunity is in these emerging growth businesses like electronic
commerce instead of trying to take Microsoft on head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Netscape deal is completed, AOL will also find
itself in the software business in a way it has never been in the
past. Netscape is known as the pioneer in the commercial
development of software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
Microsoft saw the browser software as a direct threat to its
industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively, bundling
its own browser with its Windows and giving it away free _ tactics
that have been challenged by the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Netscape no longer generates revenues from its browser,
which it now also distributes for free, but from the sale of
heavy-duty software sold to corporations. Much of this software is
used as the technological ``back office'' for electronic commerce _
used in building Web sites and processing transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising element in the proposed deal is that AOL intends to
hold onto Netscape's corporate software business instead of selling
it off to an established software company. ``America Online just
doesn't have credibility in that market,'' observed Michael A.
Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to AOL explain the decision as the need to
provide full-line offerings for electronic commerce, from corporate
Web site to the computer screens of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL has decided it needs help to preserve and strengthen
Netscape's corporate software business. To do that, it has brought
in Sun Microsystems Inc. in a side deal, which has complicated the
transaction considerably. AOL, according to executives close to the
proposed deal, will own Netscape, but it will have a joint
marketing and development partnership with Sun. As part of the
deal, AOL will agree to purchase about $300 million worth of Sun's
computers for its service, while Sun will apparently agree to
purchase sizeable amounts of Netscape software, which Sun's sales
force must sell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, AOL and Sun have a longer-term objective as well _ one
that promises to place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft.
For nearly a year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, has
been working closely with AOL, according to Sun executives.
</P>
<P>
   A former Harvard economics professor who taught Scott McNealy,
the Sun chairman, Raduchel has focused on Sun's Internet
programming technologies, called Java and Jini, both of which are
seen as potential threats to Microsoft's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   By combining Sun's technology prowess with AOL's powerful
consumer brand, the Sun executives say, there is the potential for
a kind end-run around Microsoft's grip on desktop computing. In its
research laboratories, Sun has been working on a stripped-down
network computer _ a simple-to-use information appliance, which
could cost as little as $200 or be given away as part of a
subscription service.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is that AOL's Internet media and electronic commerce
services could be delivered to many more homes than today because
many people still shun the expense and difficulty of using a
personal computer. The appliance would be mainly a receiver and
screen, with most of the computing power residing on vast central
computers serving up information as users request by tapping a few
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's technological specialty is this kind of centralized
``network'' computing. If the long-term AOL-Sun vision ever
materialized _ certainly a three-to-five year bet, at the least _
it could give both companies a boost and technological independence
from Microsoft.

DIANE SAWYER TO INTERVIEW STARR FOR ``20/20''  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, has given his first
substantial interview to Diane Sawyer of the ABC News magazine
program ``20/20,'' which will broadcast an hourlong program on
Starr and the investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer interviewed Starr on Saturday in Washington, and also
interviewed three prosecutors who work for him, in an office often
criticized for apparent leaks of information to the press. ``We
will see some of the faces of these people who have been called his
pit bulls,'' Ms. Sawyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She said there had been no ground rules for the interview, but
added, ``There are obviously certain areas he can't go into, like,
is he going to indict the president.'' The program is scheduled to
be broadcast on Wednesday at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is the second major figure in the Lewinsky matter to be
captured by ABC News. Monica Lewinsky agreed this month to an
interview with Ms. Sawyer's colleague, Barbara Walters, that is
scheduled to be broadcast sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer asked Starr for his personal views on extramarital
sex and about Clinton, questioned him about why certain portions of
his report to Congress were so graphically detailed and about
whether ``the country has a sense of proportion that he doesn't
have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tackle the subject of where politics and strict
letter-of-the-law issues intersect,'' she said. ``In a sense, it's
where they collide.''

RENO NONCOMMITTAL ON GIVING GORE CASE TO SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change ``next Tuesday'' to ``Tuesday'' in 2nd graf.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several of Attorney General Janet Reno's close
aides advised her Monday in a private meeting at the Justice
Department that federal law required her to seek an independent
counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's political
fund-raising efforts, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But other advisers at the meeting disputed that interpretation
of the law. Reno, who must, according to the time constraints of
the independent counsel law, decide the issue by Tuesday, is still
considered likely to reject such an appointment, the officials
said. That decision would spare Gore further scrutiny at a critical
phase of his attempt to solidify his presidential credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has remained taciturn. At the conclusion of Monday's
meeting, she informed her aides that she was unprepared to declare
whether she had decided to refer the allegations about Gore's case
to an outside prosecutor, the officials said. The debate, said one
official, was ``spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Gore's case is whether the independent counsel law
permits Reno to close an inquiry when there are relevant facts in
dispute _ in this case conflicting witness accounts of senior
campaign officials who, along with Gore, attended a Nov. 21, 1995,
White House fund-raising meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants of the meeting recalled discussing how the
funds raised by Gore would be divided for direct and indirect
campaign efforts; others said that was not discussed, and a few
could not recall the meeting's specifics, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the conflicting accounts, the split among her top
aides reflects a longstanding legal debate within the Justice
Department about how to interpret a key provision of the
independent counsel statute. One side said the law clearly dictates
seeking an independent counsel when contradictory evidence cannot
be resolved. The other side is arguing that Reno is not obligated
to seek an independent counsel because the case, partly based on
whether the money Gore raised was used legally, is so technical
that a prosecutor would be unlikely to obtain an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision in the Gore case represents the first of three
important independent counsel decisions that she must make in the
next two weeks. After Gore, she must decide next week whether to
seek an appointment in the case of Harold Ickes, the former White
House deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Reno must decide whether to seek an outside counsel
to investigate whether President Clinton and his aides broke the
law when they set up a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign
financed by the Democratic National Committee. Federal rules limit
such ad campaigns to generic party ads, but Federal Election
Commission auditors have said the ads directly supported the
Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has referred allegations against six Clinton
administration officials to independent prosecutors, has never
allowed an outside counsel to review any issue directly related to
how the Democrats financed the 1996 campaign, although she has
considered the issue on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   In part, officials said they believed that Reno's unwillingness
to open the Democrats to the potentially sweeping scrutiny of an
independent prosecutor stems from a view within the Justice
Department that the loosely written campaign finance laws offer
little traction for prosecutors attempting to seek evidence of
criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attacked
Reno, accusing her of blatantly using her office as a political
shield for the White House, protecting not only Clinton, but the
Democratic Party. She opened the inquiries into Gore, Ickes and
Clinton only after Charles La Bella wrote her a memo recommending
an independent counsel. La Bella's memo came after FBI Director
Louis Freeh had reached a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Justice Department, officials said Reno's narrow view
of the law _in the campaign finance context _ is based on a
different perception that some independent counsels have misused
the offices.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has been said by some aides to have expressed concern about
the conduct of more than one independent counsel. She has
disapproved of some tactics, like when prosecutors unfairly expose
low-level witnesses to the expense and embarrassment of criminal
inquiries that seemed to continue and expand long after
departmental prosecutors would have dropped them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno has been careful to avoid voicing her complaints
in public, some of her aides have criticized the conduct of Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, and Donald Smaltz, the prosecutor
who has investigated Mike Espy, the former agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, Reno opened a 90-day independent counsel inquiry
in September after a memorandum surfaced with an aide's handwritten
notes that seemed to shed new light on Gore's role. The aide's
notes suggested that Gore could have known much more about the
regulatory limits on his political fund-raising than the vice
president had acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that he did not realize that some of the large
contributions he solicited in phone calls from his White House
office would be divided into different Democratic Party accounts.
But the memo, in which Gore was to said to have remarked ``count me
in'' on making fund-raising phone calls, suggested that he could
have known that the money he raised would be split between hard and
soft money accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money contributions are unregulated, but can only be used
for limited purposes to finance general party activities like
registration drives. But hard money is regulated and subject to
limits, and was spent directly on Clinton-Gore re-election efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly technical question of whether Gore knew the
distinction between hard money and soft money is significant
because Reno has said that any solicitations for the Clinton
re-election effort _ that is, solicitation of hard money _ by the
president or the vice president, could have been illegal. She
reasoned that under election laws, Clinton and Gore were
prohibited, as federal officials, from soliciting funds on
government property.

FOR TOBACCO STOCKS, A SESSION OF SURGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the $206 billion tobacco settlement freshly signed and
record price increases looming, shareholders who have come this far
may be wondering what's next for tobacco stocks?
</P>
<P>
   The stocks, which had been held down by concerns about how much
the settlement might cost, began a recovery last week that
continued Monday. As the stock market in general rose to record
highs, the Philip Morris Companies rose $2.50 a share, to $58.25;
the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. climbed $1.1875, to $31.625, and the
Loews Corp. rose $3.0625, to $104.375.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Brooke Group rose $6.4375 a share, to
$17.4375, though investors were also responding to the announcement
Friday that the company was selling domestic rights to three of its
best-known cigarette brands to Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   While the settlement puts a price tag on what had been a large
uncertainty, other issues that could have a significant impact on
tobacco stocks remain unresolved. Among them is a class-action
lawsuit pending before the Florida Supreme Court that accuses
leading tobacco companies of causing illness.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are also concerned about the effect that price
increases _ long expected to finance the settlement costs _ will
have on cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the effect will not be drastic; others are less
optimistic. A widely held belief is that sales drop 4 percent for
every price rise of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The price increases are expected to be as high as 40 cents to 50
cents a pack, a rise of at least 20 percent more than the $1.95
average cost now. Philip Morris led the way Monday with a 45-cent
jump, which a company spokeswoman said would affect shipments
starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rises would be the highest in the industry's history and,
while expected to be offset somewhat by discounting, will almost
certainly mean diminished sales in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line they're walking,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an
analyst for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``If you're selling Marlboro or
Camel, you hate for people to leave your major brands and go down
to something cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Cohen, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., has already
slashed his earnings estimates based on what he sees as falling
demand from consumers and merchants alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think cigarette prices are going to rise by 45 to 50 cents
a pack in 1999,'' he said, ``and the consequence is that
consumption is going to fall by 9 percent. In addition, we expect a
de-stocking by wholesalers and retailers that is going to cause
industry shipments to fall by 13 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another huge cost is promotional spending, which Cohen said had
``skyrocketed over the last year'' and shows no signs of abating.
He has cut his 1999 earnings estimates for Philip Morris by 20
cents a share, to $3.30, and reduced estimates for RJR Nabisco by
55 cents, to $1.80.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about spinning off the food businesses at Philip
Morris and RJR Nabisco seem to be on hold pending resolution of the
Florida case and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The individual units of Philip Morris, which owns Kraft General
Foods, have been thought to be worth more if split off than when
packaged with the domestic tobacco business. The same might hold
true for RJR Nabisco, though the food unit there has struggled for
the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are going to be disappointed by the speed at which
those spinoffs happen,'' Cohen said. ``And they are unlikely to
happen in the case of Philip Morris.'' Other analysts also believe
spinoffs, which can increase the value of a company, are at least a
year away.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the deal announced last week, in which Philip
Morris paid the Brooke Group and its subsidiary, Liggett Group,
$300 million for domestic rights to the L&AMP;M, Chesterfield and Lark
brands.
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst believes that deal could cause a major
realignment in the tobacco industry, since it could signal another
corporate raid on RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett S. LeBow, the principal shareholder of Brooke Group,
would benefit by divesting those brands since Brooke's market share
would become too small to be included in the overall tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's got a clean balance sheet, he could borrow a bunch of
debt, and the world has been turned upside down,'' said Gary Black,
a tobacco analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, referring to LeBow, who
waged an unsuccessful proxy fight for control of RJR in 1996.
``He's the big winner in this. He will try to make another run at
RJR, using his clean balance sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to approval by the Justice Department, but
Philip Morris has apparently expressed confidence in its success:
Black said half the purchase price, or $150 million, was
nonrefundable under the terms to which the company agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission also said Monday that it would drop
its lawsuit against RJR Nabisco over the use of the Joe Camel
character in ads for its Camel cigarettes. The settlement includes
a prohibition on cartoon characters in advertising.

   LOS ANGELES _ Like a lot of golfers, Jay Larson always felt the
pace of the game was too slow.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, he felt it was (begin ital)really(end ital) too
slow.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the former Southern California teaching professional
and world-class triathlete, who once finished 11th in the Hawaiian
Ironman competition, founded the International Speed Golf
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is creating another format in golf for the
fitness golfer,'' Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   What he and others _ nearly 500 in five test events last year _
are doing is literally running from shot to shot with little
apparent adverse effect on their scores.
</P>
<P>
   Larson, 42, set the standard in May at the first official ISGA
event, shooting 2-over-par 74 in just 40 minutes and 17 seconds at
Rancho Bernardo Inn and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one speed golfers showed up for that competition in San
Diego County. No player needed more than 80 minutes to finish. More
than a third of the field broke 90 in a tournament that was
completed by 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point Larson hopes to emphasize with his fledgling
organization _ that good scores and satisfaction need not be bound
to rounds lasting five hours or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be better than golf,'' Larson said. ``This
is just another way for golfers to enjoy the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit different _ the flagstick is left in the cup on all
putts _ but for the most part speed golf is just like regular golf,
except for getting players on and off the course a whole lot
faster.
</P>
<P>
   In ISGA competition, players are seeded by how fast they play.
They tee off in three-minute increments, fastest players first.
From there, it's regulation golf on the run.
</P>
<P>
   A caddie, driving a cart, stays ahead of his golfer and yells
out the yardage remaining to the green as the golfer sprints down
the fairway after his shot. The golfer yells back which club he
wants, grabs it from the caddie much like a baton in a relay, and
the leapfrogging process continues nonstop throughout the round.
</P>
<P>
   American-record miler Steve Scott has been credited with
launching speed golf in 1979, when he played a round in less than
29 minutes in a successful attempt to break the old mark in the
Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has played as fast and as well in the same round as
Larson, who got started in speed golf as a participant in the
celebrity events spawned by Scott's inaugural run.
</P>
<P>
   Larson set the world speed-golf record of 111.55 (the
combination of strokes and elapsed time) by shooting even-par 72 in
39 minutes, 55 seconds during a round at Rancho Bernardo. Scott was
10 minutes faster than that during his Guinness record bid in '79
but shot 95 that day _ an effort that would have given him a
speed-golf score of more than 124.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scoring system (which assigns the same value to a stroke
as a minute) favors golfers,'' said Larson, who thinks that aspect
will attract more golfers than runners to ISGA events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it felt more like a running event,'' Larson said.
``Now it feels like very fit golfers playing.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't all play as fast as Scott, most play fast enough
to like the concept, according to ISGA president J.T. Visbol,
Larson's boyhood friend who serves as speed golf's caretaker and
publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have players in our tournaments who have shot the lowest
rounds they have ever shot,'' Visbol said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not too surprising to Larson, who has long believed
standing over a ball is a detriment rather than a plus. Visbol
contends it's also not that much fun for those doing the watching
and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen the player who stands over the ball for like
five minutes, fidgeting or waggling, and then hits the ball in the
water,'' Visbol said. ``He could have done that in 30 seconds. I
want that four and a half minutes of my life back.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson and Visbol are hoping similar opinion will help increase
the popularity of speed golf, which the ISGA officials say is
already attracting interest in Europe, Asia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are under way for a U.S. national championship in late
1999 or early 2000, preceded by 10 regional qualifying tournaments.
Beyond that, Visbol hopes to promote speed golf on a local basis
nationwide if he can persuade some clubs to set aside early morning
time once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Any such accommodation would need to be an early morning,
first-off-the-tee arrangement because of the pace of play. But
Visbol thinks that brisk pace could be a successful argument in
persuading courses to give speed golf a try _ perhaps on a
nine-hole basis played on back nines while regulation 18-hole play
goes off on front nines.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a businessman, I don't often have five hours to devote to
golf,'' Visbol said. ``But if could play nine holes in an hour, I
would look to do more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, players looking for opportunities to play speed
golf will have to settle for the ISGA's tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Woodley Lakes Golf Course in Van Nuys is one of the busiest
public courses in the Los Angeles area, with nearly 200,000 rounds
played there since January of 1997. But Woodley head pro Larry
Atlas speaks for many of his fellow pros at other daily fee courses
when he says he doesn't know of any daylight hours not regularly
scheduled for golf _ on back or front nines.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Atlas addresses the subject many golfers consider
important when they regard golf at any speed:
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to take time to smell the roses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Kessler, president of the Public Links Golf Association of
Southern California, likewise suspects speed golf will remain a
tournament or specialty event rather than sharing time with
regulation golf on crowded courses.
</P>
<P>
   But he likes the message Larson and Visbol are promoting with
their Carlsbad-based ISGA:
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone can play a round in one hour, it's realistic for
all of us in foursomes to play in four and a half hours rather than
six,'' Kessler said. ``And to the extent this focuses attention on
that aspect, it's good for the game.''

RALLY PRODUCES RECORDS AS MERGERS FEED ENTHUSIASM 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)

c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices vaulted to record levels Monday,
furthering a recovery that as recently as two months ago seemed
nearly unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were in the most serious correction since 1990,
but I never thought or wrote that the bull market was over,'' said
Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP;
Co. ``Now it seems all of that is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 points, or 2.34
percent, to 9,374.27. The record is the first since July 17, when
the Dow closed at 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 31, when the Dow stood at 7,539.07 after a steep
slide, the blue-chip gauge has risen more than 24 percent. For the
year, the Dow is up 18.54 percent and has a chance of rising more
than 20 percent for a fourth consecutive year, something never
accomplished before.
</P>
<P>
   Broader averages also climbed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set a record, rising 24.66
points, or 2.12 percent, to 1,188.21. The Nasdaq composite index
did not reach a new high but posted the biggest percentage gain
Monday, rising 49.21 points, or 2.55 percent, to 1,977.42. And the
Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues gained 3.86 points, or
nearly 1 percent, to 398.15.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action was energized by a daily record for the number
of mergers and acquisitions valued at $1 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announcements not only prompted investors to change
estimates of how much companies were worth but also indicated
coming declines in the outstanding shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a supply-demand story, where demand for stocks is
rising and the supply of stock is reduced as one company after
another merges,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at
First Albany Corp. ``The flow of money into mutual funds is fairly
strong, and there is pressure on managers to put that money to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Two deals seemed to be catalysts for broad swaths of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   News that Bankers Trust may be close to accepting an $8.9
billion offer from Deutsche Bank of Germany heightened interest in
financial-services and bank stocks. And word that America Online
may acquire Netscape Communications for $4 billion in stock powered
Internet and other technology stocks to even loftier valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial companies, J.P. Morgan gained 6 1/16, to 115
11/16. American Express was up 4 3/8, to 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch
jumped 4 3/8, to 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 3 9/16,
to 42}.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape was the most active stock Monday, gaining 2}, to 41
15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, to 89\.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet stocks also surged, and analysts said the group,
which has seen meteoric gains in recent weeks, was ripe for a steep
correction. Yahoo and Amazon.com both became $200 stocks on Monday.
Yahoo rose 30 7/16, to 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, to
218.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance of the Internet stocks is an unsettling
sign,'' Wien said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more-established technology shares also had a very good
day. IBM rose 7, to 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, to 119 3/16.
And Intel closed at 113 9/16, up 1{.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's big price moves, Wien said that according to his
calculations, stocks were about 10 percent overvalued. By contrast,
in the middle of July the market was 20 percent overvalued, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the market's recovery, which has been buttressed by
three cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, has left
many longtime Wall Street hands grasping for historical parallels.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we are in new ground,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who
heads his own market research firm. ``At the beginning of the year,
I said my target for the Dow was 10,000 by the end of 1998. If
anyone had asked when the market went through what now looks like a
corrective blip, I would have said my new target would have been
about 9,000. I am surprised the 10,000 figure came back on the
table'' for this year.

COWBOYS CONFIDENT DESPITE INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Memo to the high-flying Minnesota Vikings: bring
it on.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (8-3) acknowledge that the Vikings (10-1), led by
rejuvenated quarterback Randall Cunningham and rookie sensation
wideout Randy Moss, should be considered a big challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And that challenge gets even tougher with the six key injuries
the Cowboys suffered in Sunday's 30-22 victory against the
Seahawks. Most prominent of those are to receiver Ernie Mills
(perforated small intestine) and guard Everett McIver (torn ACL in
left knee) who are both lost for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders is questionable for Thursday's game
with his sprained left big toe, and running back Emmitt Smith
(sprained ankle), tackle Erik Williams (sprained knee) and running
back Chris Warren (strained groin) are hobbling as well.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cowboys maintain that it would be wrong to think
that the Thanksgiving Day showdown at Texas Stadium will be a
one-sided affair.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying the growing confidence of a team on a four-game
winning streak, the Cowboys are conceding nothing. And even
bristled at suggestions that the NFC Central-leading Vikings will
serve as a measuring stick for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the game might say how good Minnesota is too,''
quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``We are not step children over here,
trying to show that we belong in this league. It's a game where a
lot of things will be evaluated on their side of the ball as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who said his ankle has improved from Sunday and even
participated in the Cowboys light workout, agreed with Aikman. He
said the Vikings defense will be tested by the improving Cowboys
offense, which has scored at least 30 points six times this season
and is ranked fourth in the NFL in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more concerned about how we are going to deal with
them and how we are going to defense them,'' said Smith, who is
listed as questionable for the game. ``Nobody's asking them how
they are going to stop us. They got a good ball club. But I think
we got a good ball club. This game will have a lot of importance
for Minnesota as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey liked the confidence his players are
showing _ though he hoped it doesn't roll into cockiness because
``we are not that good yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What they have been good about all season is overcoming
injuries. Gailey would like to see the Cowboys continue that trend
against the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've had somebody go down, somebody else has
stepped up,'' Gailey said. ``I always believe, don't gripe about
what you don't have, get excited about what you do have.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie guard Flozell Adams will again replace McIver, who has
already missed five games with a sprained right knee. The Cowboys
will rely on Jeff Ogden and Patrick Jeffers to fill in for Mills,
who had flourished in the Cowboys multiple receiver sets.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Cowboys would be hard-pressed to get excited about
a defensive secondary, possibly featuring reserve Charlie Williams
in place Sanders going against the Vikings vaunted passing attack.
Williams has been burned for three touchdown passes the past two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Nickel safety George Teague admitted that it will be a challenge
to contain the Vikings without Sanders. But he said nobody is
backing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is afraid,'' Teague said. ``Everybody is going to stand
up and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries that could be most crucial to the Cowboys chances
are Smith and Warren, considering the importance of the running
game to the Cowboys offense. Gailey said Smith is closer to being
ready than Warren, but refused to predict if either would be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, third in the NFC in rushing with 1,063 yards and eight
touchdowns, will need to be ready if the Cowboys are to employ what
he said is the best weapon against the Vikings attack, ranked third
in the NFL in total offense and second in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to police their offense is to keep their defense
on the field,'' Smith said. ``If we can maintain the ball, manage
the clock and put points on the board, hopefully, our defense can
stop them. Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.''

LIBRARY CAN'T FILTER INTERNET, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision supporting unfettered access to the Internet in
public libraries, a federal judge on Monday struck down the Loudoun
County, Va., library's policy of using filtering software on all
computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a policy offends the guarantee of free speech in the
First Amendment and is, therefore, unconstitutional,'' Judge Leonie
Brinkema of the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., said in the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Brinkema wrote that the use of the filters, made by a
private company, to limit Internet access was also a form of prior
restraint on distribution of speech and asserted that ``a defendant
cannot avoid its constitutional obligation by contracting out its
decision making to a private entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Brinkema issued a permanent injunction against the
filtering policy, but the decision leaves unanswered whether it
would be constitutionally acceptable to use filters on terminals
that are set aside for children.
</P>
<P>
   Loudoun library officials made no statement about an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of libraries have installed filters on at least
some of their terminals, according to a recent survey from the
American Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit challenging the library policy was brought late last
year by a civic organization called Mainstream Loudoun as well as a
handful of individual patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Later, publishers of eight Web sites, from a safe-sex page to an
online publication examining ethical issues, joined the suit,
saying their speech had been censored by the policy. All eight
sites had been blocked at one point by the filtering software,
called X-Stop, but were unblocked after the suit was filed,
according to Ann Beeson, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties
Union, which represented the publishers.

A DAY FOR MERGERS, WITH $40 BILLION IN PLAY  

</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if the old days are back. The heady
mergers-and-acquisitions wave that crashed in August has returned
in full force, with nine combinations worth $40.4 billion either
announced or under negotiation Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While that is less than half the $90 billion price tag put on
two bank deals in one day last April, it is a record all its own:
On no other day have so many deals valued at $1 billion or more
been announced, according to Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   But there were several factors on Monday _ a day, as well, of
surging stock prices _ that distinguished it from all the busiest
days that have preceded it this year. Deals are crossing many
industry lines _ a departure from the
bank-and-telecommunication-heavy combinations earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   And executives are more eager than ever to find partners abroad.
Witness Deutsche Bank AG's potential acquisition of Bankers Trust,
which is expected to be one of several purchases of U.S. companies
by foreign businesses in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, too, is expected to see a major boom in merger activity,
although not quickly. There are still significant obstacles, such
as the tax and accounting rules that vary from country to country,
as well as likely opposition from labor unions unused to
American-style corporate layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And in the short term, there are sure to be clashes as companies
are compared with their peers in other countries, something that
has not been the practice in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sets up a dynamic that you'd better run your company
better or get taken over,'' said Richard Sapp, head of the European
mergers-and-acquisitions department at Goldman Sachs International.
``And if you lose your job, are you likely to move from Germany to
France? That would be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, there has been a shift in the mind-set in
corporate boardrooms since late summer. Executives who retreated
after financial turmoil in Russia and in much of Asia ravaged
stocks at home have become bolder and are ready to conduct business
as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic objectives did not change one iota,'' said Gary
Parr, head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, whose firm advised five of the companies that made
announcements Monday, including those at Bankers Trust, Netscape
Communications and UNUM Corp. ``A lot of deals were waiting to be
done when the market stabilized. Now that markets have bounced back
nicely, managements feel comfortable and are willing to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental reasons to merge _ competitive advantage _ have
not changed. Take for instance, the proposed combination of
Netscape and America Online, which could also include a joint
marketing agreement between America Online and Sun Microsystems. In
all, the complex combination is meant to strengthen these
companies' positions against Microsoft, which is at the center of a
landmark government antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   And bank and insurance mergers, which have been most pronounced
this year, are likely to continue for the short term despite
concerns about possible disruptions to computer systems in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think computer issues are going to make a difference
for deals that are compelling,'' said Rodgin Cohen, a banking
lawyer with Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, who specializes in mergers advice.
And he warns that deals are less likely to be a reaction to other
mergers, despite what the timing may suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and Norwest Corp. have merged if
Nationsbank and BankAmerica hadn't gotten together?'' he asked.
``Absolutely.''

   BC-SCI-SIDS-CLUES-NYT (moved on Monday, Nov. 23)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Nov. 23,
about a study of sudden infant death syndrome, misstates the nature
of the research at one point. The study was based on blood samples
of infants who had some of the known risk factors for the syndrome;
it was not based on autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   BC-MEDIA-TALK-NYT (moved on Sunday, Nov. 22)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, Nov. 22,
about the Museum of Modern Art's refusal to allow a CBS segment on
a major exhibition there misspelled the surname of the artist
involved. (The name was also misspelled on Nov. 8 in the Dining Out
column of the Connecticut section; on June 29 in a fashion review
from Milan; and in an Arts &AMP; Ideas article on June 20 about the
state of arts criticism in America.) The artist is Jackson Pollock,
not Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   The report yesterday also misspelled the given name of the
museum official in charge of the exhibition and misstated his
title. He is Kirk Varnedoe, not Kurt, and he is the exhibition's
curator, not its director.

California's Headwaters Forest. Redwoods, with their ability to
process fog moisture, may actually contribute water to their
habitats. During a foggy night, a single redwood can douse the

POLICE SEARCH YIELDS NOTHING IN GACY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ More than two decades after his arrest and four years
after his execution, serial killer John Wayne Gacy again captured
the attention of this city Monday as the Police Department dug up
the yard of an apartment building where they believed more of his
victims may have been buried.
</P>
<P>
   But after an afternoon digging around the fenced-in yard,
detectives emerged with the news that they had found a marble, a
saucepan, a slab of concrete _ but no bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived before dawn to cordon off the block around the
house, and later erected a tent to obstruct the view of circling
news helicopters and of cameras on nearby roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the evidence we had, we had no choice but to dig,''
said Officer Pat Camden, a department spokesman. ``We had an
obligation not only to the community, but to anyone who has missing
kids out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Police received information several weeks ago from a citizens'
watchdog organization called the Better Government Association that
bodies may have been buried at the site, a three-story apartment
building on the city's northwest side where Gacy's mother once
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Brunner, the organization's director, said it had received
a tip from a Police Department detective, no longer with the force,
who claimed to have seen Gacy outside the building in 1975 with a
shovel in the early hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog group decided to check the site with a new radar
technology scanner that can penetrate the ground. When the results
indicated the potential existence of human bones under the yard and
an asphalt parking lot adjacent to the building, the group
contacted the police.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same Dutch-made scanner, the police department scanned
both areas Monday and then had workers dig two four-feet deep
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Sullivan, a prosecutor in the Gacy case 20 years ago, said
it would not have surprised him if police had found bodies.
``There's not reason to believe Gacy didn't kill 100 people,''
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gacy was arrested in 1978 after what is believed to be a
six-year period in which he lured young boys and men to his home
and killed them. After the arrest of Gacy, a building contractor
and part-time clown, the police found 29 bodies buried below or
near his house outside Chicago. Four more were found in a nearby
river. Gacy was executed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's search, the police announced that the Gacy
investigation was again at an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are done,'' said Cmdr. John Thomas. ``This part of the
investigation is now closed.''

EDITORIAL: JANET RENO'S WAY OUT  (ms) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno's resistance to the obvious need for
an independent counsel on the Clinton administration's campaign
fund-raising scandals is about to be put to a series of tests.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Reno is to rule on whether to ask for the
appointment of a counsel to investigate Vice President Gore's
fund-raising calls. Soon she must also decide on Harold Ickes'
alleged misstatements about his own campaign role and whether the
Democrats illegally used their ``soft money'' war chest. The public
is weary after months of impeachment talk, but that weariness
cannot be an excuse for shortchanging the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Since fall 1996 it has been obvious that Reno had a legal
obligation to appoint an independent counsel who lacked her
built-in conflict of interest when it came to investigating the
reckless fund-raising practices involving her boss and other highly
placed administration figures.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process took the heat off Reno. But not before
warnings from Louis Freeh, director of the FBI, and Charles La
Bella, her hand-picked campaign-finance prosecutor, forced her to
order preliminary inquiries into several aspects of the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although her subordinates shamed her into action, Reno slowed
things down by cutting the inquiries into slivers _ like Gore's
phone calls _ and by ignoring such big-picture questions as a
possible Chinese government conspiracy to funnel money to the White
House re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Reno argued erroneously that the law required her to move in
this fragmented way. In fact, the Independent Counsel Act's
discretionary clause gives her authority to appoint a counsel who
can explore all aspects of the most corrupt fund-raising year since
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   We urge the attorney general to authorize a consolidated
investigation that looks at all the campaign issues, including the
possibility of Asian contributions in exchange for favors to China
or businesses in the region. The subject here is not sex and lies,
but corruption of the very essentials of government.
</P>
<P>
   The initial word about Reno's attitude is anything but
encouraging. According to reports by David Johnston of The Times,
the attorney general may opt for the narrowest of possible rulings
involving the most benign interpretations of the activities of Gore
and others. That would be a dodge to turn attention from
potentially momentous violations of the Federal Election Campaign
Act.
</P>
<P>
   For example, President Clinton's videotaped remarks to
contributors suggest that his campaign knowingly circumvented
contribution and spending limits by using unregulated soft money
for ``issue ads'' that were really disguised campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, of course, knows that Freeh and La Bella both believe that
an independent prosecutor was needed to look into these charges.
Moreover, an audit subpoenaed by the Justice Department from the
Federal Election Commission apparently finds that the ads violated
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Honest people can disagree about whether Clinton's lying under
oath is an impeachable offense. But there can be no disagreement
that the law requires Reno to step aside and allow an independent
investigation. Inaction will deliver another blow to the public's
faith. It could also tempt Congress to add campaign finance to the
impeachment inquiry or to undertake hearings on a matter that,
under law, belongs to an independent counsel.

COLLEGE BOARD STUDY SHOWS TEST PREP COURSES HAVE MINIMAL VALUE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The College Board, sponsor of the SAT, the nation's leading
college entrance exam, has found in a comprehensive new study that
test preparation courses, a multi-million-dollar industry, fail to
produce anything other than minimal score increases.
</P>
<P>
   The study was immediately and vigorously attacked by spokesmen
for the two leading tesing companies, Kaplan Educational
Centers and Princeton Review. They said they had clear data showing
their courses produce significant increases on an exam that, given
the growing competitiveness of college admissions, produces terror
in the hearts of high school students.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board study of some 4,200 students who took the SAT
in 1995-96 found that the roughly 12 percent who took out-of-school
coaching courses raised their scores an average 19 to 38 points
more than those who were uncoached in the verbal and math sections
combined, a small gain. The maximum combined score is 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   The rise was bigger in math _ an average of 19 points _ than in
the verbal test, where it averaged nine points. And the study found
that Kaplan and Princeton Review's coaching both pushed scores up a
little more, up to 19 points on verbal and 38 points on math. But
most score changes fell within the test's standard error of
measurement, which is about 30 points up or down on each section,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every coached student who went up 100 points or more,
three either had no increase or their scores went down,'' said
Wayne Camara, executive director of research at the College Board.
``The major unique feature of this study is that not only have we
looked at gains of coached but also of non-coached students.
Coaching firms don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan Educational Centers, the New York City-based firm that,
with Princeton Review, dominates the multi-million-dollar test
coaching industry, says that the average Kaplan score increase is
120 points from the PSAT to the SAT, and that 28 percent of Kaplan
students surveyed improved scores by at least 170 points. Princeton
Review advertises a typical increase of 140 points.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the companies say they have used outside firms to
survey their students on scores before and after testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest percentage of our students who come to us do it
through word of mouth, and we work with 30,000 students a year,''
said Kevin McMullin, spokesman for Princeton Review. ``We must be
doing something right. I would also point out that the College
Board markets its own SAT preparation books and materials. If
scores can't be improved by preparation, why sell the materials?''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan and Princeton have long been locked in a public relations
battle with the College Board over the effectiveness of coaching
and, in recent years, over shares of the test preparation book
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For the College Board, it is important that the SAT and the
numerous other entrance exams it sponsors be seen as objective
measures of a student's academic skills. If coaching could
significantly improve scores, those who can afford high-priced
coaching courses would have an unfair advantage and the value of
the tests will be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has taken on an added charge in the past couple years
as race-conscious admissions practices at universities have come
under attack both legally and politically. Minority students, who
tend to score lower on the SAT, have been admitted over whites with
higher scores to add racial diversity to campuses.
</P>
<P>
   With such practices under attack, the role of the SAT has come
under increasing scrutiny, with some minority-rights advocates
urging colleges to reduce their reliance on it.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board says it publishes preparatory material for the
SAT because familiarization with the test, its pattern and pace,
improves scores. But commercial coaching, it argues, has minimal
value.
</P>
<P>
   The report, being issued Tuesday, was written by Donald Powers,
a research scientist at the Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J., which the College Board hires to administer the
SAT, and Donald Rock, an educational consultant.
</P>
<P>
   It was subject to peer review, meaning that researchers who were
not told its authors' names examined it for scientific validity. It
will be published in the Journal of Educational Measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Jane Becker, an educational statistician at Michigan State
University who has read the manuscript and has examined and written
about coaching studies, said she considered it to be perhaps the
finest piece of coaching research yet published.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is thoughtful, it uses statistical methods to very good
advantage and left nearly no stone unturned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new study is the first to query students seeking coaching
about themselves and compare it with those who did not go to
coaching institutes. Those who seek coaching, it found, included
more Asian-Americans, came from better-educated and higher-earning
families, had slightly better grades in school, higher ambitions
and had taken more rigorous courses in school than those who had
not been coached.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both the coached and uncoached populations reported
doing a fair amount of individual preparation either through taking
sample tests or by using materials provided by the College Board or
one of the coaching companies to prepare for the SAT. Nonetheless,
those who used coaching courses tended to have done more such
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fuzzy lines,'' Powers, the principal author of the
study acknowledged. ``But if you ask people why they pay for
coaching, it is to increase their scores by substantial amounts. We
are saying that that is unlikely to work.''

COWBOYS FANS NEED TO COME TO GRIPS THAT MOSS SLIPPED AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ I'm sick of hearing about Randy Moss and he
hasn't even crossed the city limits yet.
</P>
<P>
   The no-ethics mouthpieces who were clamoring during the draft
last spring for the Cowboys to take a flier on every scumbucket,
pot smoker and woman-beater who could run with or catch a football
are rattling their cages again.
</P>
<P>
   Their poster boy is coming to town and he has certainly given
them something to scream about. It's going to be the theme of the
week, of course, and it threatens to ruin what should otherwise be
a pretty interesting matchup.
</P>
<P>
   So let's dispense with The Question first and get it out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't the Cowboys take Moss, the man with the fleet feet
and the golden hands, with the eighth pick of the draft instead of
old what's his name?
</P>
<P>
   Because they'd painted themselves into an ethical and moral
corner and simply couldn't take the risk.
</P>
<P>
   It's a case in which their bad-boy past probably prevented them
from making the smartest football decision they might have made at
the time, but that's how it is and it's time to live with it and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen other teams made the same decision the Cowboys did (the
Bengals passed twice) and, as someone pointed out last week, the
team that finally took Moss with the 21st pick was the one that
didn't have an owner in place to veto the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys fans, quit pining and drooling over Moss and pray that
the Cowboys can figure out a way to cover him when he and his
Vikings teammates show up at Texas Stadium for Thanksgiving dinner.
It would have been fun to see Moss one-on-one with Deion Sanders,
but that probably won't happen, now that Deion's listed as doubtful
for Thursday's game with his sprained big toe.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse news for the Cowboys are the losses of guard Everett
McIver (knee) and wide receiver Ernie Mills (abdominal injury).
McIver is out for the rest of the season. Mills underwent surgery
Monday after taking a blow to the abdomen in the Cowboys' 30-22
victory over Seattle. Mills might be back for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever chances the Cowboys might have had against the 10-1
Vikings have diminished as the injury news turns worse and worse,
but quarterback Troy Aikman refuses to bow to the inevitability of
a Minnesota victory.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman took a stand at his locker Monday, basically demanding to
know who'd died and annointed the Vikings three-time Super Bowl
champions in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   His message was simple. If the Vikings plan on beating the
Cowboys Thursday, they'd better bring a lunch and plan on staying a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming into ``our'' backyard, they're coming into
``our'' stadium,'' center Mike Kiselak said. ``We've got the
attitude that we want to win every game. I've got to play a game
and they've got to play me. We don't back down to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, meanwhile, completed the changing of the guard in
the NFC Central with Sunday's 28-14 victory over Green Bay at the
Metrodome. It completed a season sweep of the Packers for the Vikes
and stamped them as favorites to win the NFC and advance to the
Super Bowl against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   This is a complete team the Cowboys will face Thursday and by
far their biggest test since the second game of the season against
the Broncos. If things go right, it could also be the first of two
meetings between the two teams, with a lot more riding on the
second one, perhaps in the NFC championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Moss has been at the heart of the Vikings' success, including an
eight-catch, 153-yard, 1-touchdown performance Sunday against the
Packers in which the talented rookie told reporters he actually
keeps one eye on the Jumbotrons at each end of the Metrodome field
as he runs his routes so he'll know when the ball's on the way from
quarterback Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see Randall's arm slinging back,'' Moss said, ``I know
it's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidding or not, Moss sealed the Vikings' win with a 49-yard
fourth-quarter touchdown catch, his ninth reception of the season
of 40 yards or more. He and Cunningham have made the game look
easy. Randall throws it as far as he can, and Moss either runs
under it, comes back for it, or wins a jump-ball with shorter, less
athletic cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   That, Packers' GM Ron Wolf said, is why the Vikings have beaten
the Packers twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to find anything to stop that
pitch-and-catch thing with Moss,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would have been nice to see that happening with Aikman
at one end and Moss at the other. But it in this case, both parties
_ the Cowboys and Moss _ were dragging too much baggage to make it
work. The Cowboys could not afford one more potential jailbird, at
least not one with a rap sheet like Moss'.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Cowboys used that eighth pick in the draft to
select old what's his name. He's a good guy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll make a tackle Thursday.

NFC'S BEST TEAMS ARE REFLECTIONS OF THEIR COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ When Denny Green's mind takes a break from
coaching the Vikings, he thinks about changing diapers.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Holmgren's mind takes a break from coaching the
Packers, he thinks about changing teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the Metrodome, the Vikings' 28-14 victory against
Green Bay marked a shift in power. Meanwhile, the three other NFC
title contenders, San Francisco, Atlanta and Dallas, all asserted
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure a team always morphs into the image of its coach,
but it's sure true in the case of the NFC's Big 5:
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are mercurial under second-year coach Steve Mariucci
(before beating New Orleans, 31-20, they were behind 10-0) because
he is mercurial. Insiders call his behind-the-scenes displays of
emotion embarrassingly juvenile. But at 8-3, his passion works for
him more than it works against him. After all, it is Mariucci's
private temper tantrum that will probably win him a new contract
extension through the year 2005, a deal that could come this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are, at their core, ``a bunch of players who fit the
image Dan (Reeves) has of a football player,'' says Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey, a Reeves protege. ``Dan's always believed in power
running, solid defense and work ethic, with the occasional trick
play thrown in. His players are achievers, just like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that ``overachievers.'' Who expected the Falcons to be 9-2?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys under first-year coach Gailey are suddenly all about
efficiency, consistency, commitment. This franchise had spent so
much time strutting about celebrating past wins that it forgot to
win in the present. But no more. ``This team doesn't take victories
for granted as it once did,'' says quarterback Troy Aikman of the
8-3 Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And then the two teams that most seem to be taking their
behavioral leads from their coaches:
</P>
<P>
   If Holmgren's Packers are drooping like his walrus-like
moustache, maybe it's because they've accepted losing _ losing
their coach and games.
</P>
<P>
   Talk persists that Holmgren will quit after this year for a
general manager/coach job elsewhere. It may be time, anyway, after
what happened in Minnesota. Like the Cowboys under Barry Switzer,
the 7-4 Packers might be in need of a new fuel on their fire. How
else to explain Brett Favre and other Packers' genuinely jovial
mood as they exited the locker room and headed to the buses Sunday
afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   Green's Vikings are bouncing around with the enthusiasm of a
newborn baby, the sort of enthusiasm Green has always brought to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step for us is a big step, a fun step,'' says Green, the
proud papa of both a 10-1 team and of a newborn son. He's Zachary
Dennis William Green, and his two middle names offer the first
evidence all year that coach Green is an indecisive play-caller.
THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vs. Vikings on Thursday: One scout predicts Dallas will
be crushed unless Deion Sanders is freed from playing a side to
chasing Randy Moss man-to-man. ``Of course, if Deion does that,
Cris Carter catches eight passes against somebody else, or Jake
Reed does, or Carter lines up in the slot like he did against Green
Bay and then he gets the safety,'' the scout says. ``Can Dallas
score about 38 points? They'll need to.'' ... The Saints, having
registered a sack in 59 consecutive games, were planning a
celebration Sunday to commemorate tying the NFL record of 60. They
got their sack, but ... oops. The Redskins' mark of 60 wasn't the
record. The Cowboys have it. From 1976-80, Dallas had sacks in 68
in a row, and from 1988-72, Dallas had 61 consecutive sack games.
... The Jets planned to wear helmet decals honoring the late Weeb
Ewbank, their former coach. But somebody either lost or stole the
decals. ... Everybody knows Fox broadcaster Pat Summerall, who
partners with John Madden for Thursday's Cowboys-Vikings match, now
makes his home in the Fort Worth-Dallas area. But did you know
Madden is a native Minnesotan? ... The Redskins' four losing
seasons in six years are more than they had in the previous 24
years. ... After Denver defeated Kansas City at Arrowhead Stadium
in Week 10 for the Chiefs' third consecutive loss at home, the
Broncos' Shannon Sharpe taunted Chiefs fans. ``Go home! This is our
home!'' he barked. ``The lease is up! You haven't paid your rent in
three weeks!''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Glee shoved gloom aside Monday in the nation's stock
markets as two of the main gauges surpassed their summer peaks and
reached new highs.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who stayed with stocks through the downturn in the
fall now have outsized gains for the year, even by standards set in
this bull market's last few years. The Dow Jones industrial
average, which set a record Monday, is up 18.54 percent for the
year, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, also a
record-setter Monday, has risen 22.44 percent. Although the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index did not hit a record
Monday, it has beaten the other gauges for the year, up 25.92
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recent rally has not lifted all issues. Small stocks,
while back from the depths, are still underperforming their larger
brethren. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues closed
at 398.15, up 28 percent from its low in October. But it is still
14 percent below its July peak.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Dow rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to
9,374.27. The Nasdaq index jumped 2.55 percent, to 1,977.42, up
49.21 points. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 2.12 percent, or 24.66 points, to
1,188.21.
</P>
<P>
   This performance represents nothing short of a U-turn in
investor sentiment. Euphoria is back for stocks, but confidence has
also returned to the junk bond arena, fueling a recovery in those
securities from a moribund state two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a classic market cycle in a matter of weeks
instead of the months or even years that it used to take,'' said
John Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Although concerns remain, such as a continuing deterioration in
corporate earnings, an Asia mired in overcapacity, uncertainty
about Japan's recovery plan and Latin America on the edge, Manley
said investors were focusing on something rosy farther down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism has also checked into corporate board rooms, as
evidenced by Monday's spate of merger announcements. Nine deals
were announced or under negotiation Monday for a total of $40.4
billion, reflecting a belief among many chief executives that a
recession is unlikely next year.
</P>
<P>
   Merger experts also found it bullish that the companies doing
the deals spanned a range of industries. That most of the deals
were done using stock as the acquisition currency indicates how
crucial the recent rally has been to deal-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Because consumer confidence is inextricably linked to the stock
market's performance, the recent run-up in stocks should bolster
consumer confidence figures, which will be released Tuesday. These
numbers had been falling in recent months along with stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's impressive rally is vindication for Abby
Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., who
stayed positive on stocks throughout the downturn. Ms. Cohen never
bought the doomsayers' view, what she called FUDD _ for fear,
uncertainty, doubt and despair. Instead, she held fast to her view
that turmoil in world markets was unlikely to cause a recession in
the United States. Ms. Cohen looked particularly prescient Monday:
Her prediction on the Dow Jones industrial average for the end of
the year was about 9,300.
</P>
<P>
   But while investors who own mutual funds that mimic the stock
indexes are enjoying big gains, many others are probably feeling
left behind. That is because the surge that shows up in the market
indexes is, once again, not showing up across the board, with many
stocks still well off their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the broad market is only beginning to claw its way back.
According to Salomon Smith Barney, at the starting point of this
market surge, on Oct. 8, the average Nasdaq stock was down 54.1
percent and the average S&AMP;P 500 stock had declined 32.1 percent
from their 52-week highs. As of Friday, the most recent data
available, the average Nasdaq stock was down 40.1 percent and the
average S&AMP;P 500 stock was down 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while the revival of mergers and acquisitions is an
indicator of optimism, the activity is still far below the levels
reached earlier this year. Monday's $40.4 billion in deals brings
the pace this month to $70 billion. That is up from the low of $51
billion in September, according to Securities Data Corp., but
nowhere near the spring's levels of $210 billion a month.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings are showing life, too. But a couple of
spectacular one-day gainers hide the fact that many recent
offerings are still hurting. So far in 1998, the average initial
offering has inched up only one-tenth of a percent. But separating
technology offerings from nontechnology ones exposes a chasm in
performance. According to Securities Data, the average technology
offering is up 15.2 percent this year, while the average
nontechnology offering is down 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As for the volume of deals, investment bankers have raised $9.4
billion in 29 initial offerings since Sept. 1, but three deals _
Conoco, Fox Entertainment and Swisscom _ account for 80 percent of
the money raised.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Monday's move clearly gave investors something to be
thankful for this week. Analysts pointed to several factors driving
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest driver is the rapid rise in the nation's
money supply. The figure for M-2 _ the broadest money supply
measure that includes checking accounts, savings accounts, money
market funds and other assets _ has grown at an annual rate of 9.3
percent in the last three months. This is the biggest rise since
1987, and much of this money is flooding into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor propelling equity prices is the large number of
investors who are buying back shares to cut their losses on open
short positions, or bets that stock prices would decline. A short
position is created when an investor borrows shares and then sells
them. If the share price falls, the investor can profit by buying
shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed ones.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces
a loss. Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, are
those shares that have been borrowed and sold but not yet covered
by repurchase.
</P>
<P>
   Those investors who thought stocks were headed for a fall are
now scrambling to limit their losses caused by the big move up. As
Christine Callies, investment strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston, points out, short positions at the New York Stock Exchange
dropped 5.4 percent for the month ended Nov. 13. That is the
largest decline in more than a year and indicates that pessimistic
traders are having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   It has not hurt, of course, that the Federal Reserve has cut
interest rates three times since late September. The benchmark
30-year Treasury bond is yielding 5.25 percent, an unappealing rate
for investors accustomed to double-digit gains. It seems that more
and more investors feel there is nowhere else to put their money
except in stocks or higher-yielding junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors also say there are more interest rate cuts to
come, although the Fed has signaled it would prefer to hold off on
further reductions. Jason Trennert, vice president at International
Strategy and Investment in New York, says that continuing weakness
in gold and commodity prices is predicting further easing by the
Fed. ``Most likely monetary policy around the world is too tight,''
he said. ``We're of the opinion that the Fed left the door open for
more easings.'' Lower interest rates are a tonic for both stocks
and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, few strategists are willing to say this market's
run is over. ``Fear and greed are both contagious,'' Manley said.

ANDERSON KEEPS THE CAR, BUT GIVES AWAY TURKEYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   No, he has not sold the Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson's fleet of eight automobiles remains intact _
four weeks after he was quoted in The New York Times saying,
jokingly, that the financial strain of the National Basketball
Association lockout might force him to part with one of his luxury
rides.
</P>
<P>
   The cars are not targets of the repo man. Instead, they have
come under siege from an angry public that can barely afford to see
Anderson play. Columnists took their satirical shots, calling him a
whiner. Talk-show callers who had barely heard of the New York
schoolboy legend wanted to know what world he was living in. In his
weekly HBO monologue, Chris Rock teased him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Kenny, they said. He might have to do without tinted
windows.
</P>
<P>
   When the hype finished escalating, Anderson, the Boston Celtics'
28-year-old point guard, had become the emblem of the disconnected,
filthy-rich athlete. In the NBA, Kenny's cars had become Imelda's
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine Anderson as the same unassuming,
slump-shouldered guy who handed out 400 free turkeys in a small
room of an apartment complex in Rego Park, Queens, on Sunday. But
there was Kenny Anderson, shaking hands, signing trading cards and
dealing with old neighbors who said, ``Wow, I didn't know you had
eight cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked at the luxurious and materialistic things, but I
don't think they looked at the financial picture,'' Anderson said
of the article in The Times. ``I guess I found out, being in the
business I'm in and dealing with the media, people are going to
have their own opinions about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The turkey giveaway was not a lockout-inspired image boost.
Hardly any news media knew about it, and only one photographer
showed. The fact is, Anderson has been donating time and money to
the community since he signed his first professional contract in
1992. He still owns an apartment in this modest complex, using it
as his home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   The people who filed out of the apartment complex's basement
with their Thanksgiving dinner bundled up in plastic did not hold
him in awe as much as they did in esteem. ``This is so nice of
you,'' said a hard-featured woman of maybe 50. Anderson thanked her
for coming. Moments later, a teen-age boy approached Anderson with
a trading card from when he played with the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got another pen?'' Anderson asked, thinking that black
felt tip might be better than ink. ``Oh, wait. This works.'' The
kid smiled.
</P>
<P>
   When the article about Anderson's finances ran, I never expected
him to become a target. The idea was to show where a $6 million
salary goes and how an NBA player is not the average worker in a
labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Few noticed his fledgling business, which provides work for
friends from his old neighborhood, or the monthly mortgage payment
for the house he bought for his mother. Instead, the focus was on
the extravagances, the $75,000 a year in car insurance and
maintenance and his personal monthly allowance _ $10,000 of what he
called ``hanging-out money.'' What else do millionaires spend their
money on?
</P>
<P>
   The backlash Anderson suffered made me wonder if I should have
followed around an NBA owner to see how he spent his money. If the
season ever does get under way, Anderson will be the victim of a
few chants behind the bench. For a warped fan, it's plenty of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The day the article ran, union officials called Anderson's
accountant, Scott Bercu, and lambasted him for saying, ``These guys
have got to concede for a very simple reason: they're losing money
every time they don't play a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Anderson: ``I didn't hear anything personally from them,
but I know a lot of people are thinking about it. I can't lose any
sleep about that. You wrote the article. I didn't feel it was bad.
I didn't feel it was great. But it was out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found out is, people are going to have opinions about
things and they might not be the same opinions that other people
have.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that the numbers obtained from his accountant were
skewed, but would not go into specifics. ``I'm very smart with my
money,'' he said. ``I know the value of a dollar and I know the
value of my money. So I'm not going to be stupid enough to just
spend it like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, I'm going to live my life. I'm on my
second contract in the league. I came in the league making great
money. That's when I bought all my cars. I had a car fetish. Now,
in 1998, most of those cars are considered old. If I would've known
what I know now, I probably wouldn't have that many cars. But that
was my life. It's not as bad as it might seem.''
</P>
<P>
   The turkeys were gone Sunday in 90 minutes, with word spreading
quickly on 57th Avenue that the great point guard from Archbishop
Molloy was handing them out along with his family and friends.
Anderson, his mother, Joan, his sisters Danielle and Sandra and the
volunteers Renee Harris, Al Blake and Loretta Henderson had made
sure everyone went home with something. After the last turkey had
been given out, the man with eight cars went upstairs to eat his
mother's cooking and watch the Jets game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a lot of lumps in my career,'' he said, smiling. ``I
don't feel like I took a lot of lumps for this, believe it or not.
Some people don't even know of The New York Times. They don't even
read The New York Times. I'm not knocking anybody. I mean, the
corporate world probably reads it. But a lot of my friends who I
deal with, they read the New York Post comics and look at the
pictures.''

LIBRARY SYSTEM IN SEATTLE GETS GIFT FROM GATES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp. chairman, and his
wife, Melinda, will give $20 million to the Seattle Public Library
system on Tuesday, officials of the William H. Gates Foundation
said Monday. The gift is believed to be the largest donation from
individuals to a public library system.
</P>
<P>
   The donation will provide $15 million to help expand
neighborhood libraries, $4 million to support additions to the book
collection, and $1 million to support literacy, English as a second
language and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melinda and I are supporting the Seattle Public Library
because we hope children from across the city will get the same
chance that we did to succeed through reading and exploring new
ideas,'' Gates said through a spokeswoman. ``Neighborhood libraries
are a free and wonderful place for lifelong learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates has a net worth estimated at $40 billion, making him the
wealthiest person in the United States. He has been criticized for
not being more generous with his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he and his wife, who live in Medina, Wash., a suburb of
Seattle, pledged $200 million to bring computers, computer training
and Internet access to libraries in low-income areas in the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In April, they gave the New York Public Library $640,000 to
expand public access to computers and the Internet. They have also
given $20 million in scholarships at Duke University and have
donated more than $17 million to the University of Washington for
its law school and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   This month Seattle residents passed a $196.4 million bond issue
to nearly double the space of neighborhood libraries and build a
new central library. It was the most extensive library capital
measure undertaken by an American city, said Deborah Jacobs, the
city librarian, who called the Gates gift ``a phenomenal example of
generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Public Library Foundation president, Jack Faris,
said the gift was a call to action to other contributors and said
that the foundation would increase its fund-raising goal from $40
million to $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, 80 percent of residents hold library cards, a higher
percentage than in most other cities of its size.

MICROSOFT SAYS PROPOSED NETSCAPE DEAL SUPPORTS ITS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. argued in federal court Monday that
the proposed acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. by
America Online seriously undermined the government's antitrust suit
against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out
from under the government,'' William Neukom, Microsoft's senior
vice president for legal affairs, said Monday morning on the
courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning behind this assertion, Microsoft says, is that the
proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software
industry are healthy and vibrant _ even with all of the illegal and
anti-competitive practices alleged in the government's suit.
</P>
<P>
   But David Boies, the government's lead attorney, said all of
that was irrelevant. ``Whatever the deal ends up being _ if there
ends up being a deal _ is not going to remove any of the obstacles
that Microsoft has placed in the path of competition in this
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a
government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested
to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition
undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed
toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match
the one it apparently holds in operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   After all, about 22 percent of Americans who use the Internet
reach it through America Online. And at present AOL uses
Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, as the service's
default choice. In exchange for that, Microsoft places an AOL
advertisement and Internet link in Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara asked the witness whether, once AOL's service contract
expires in January, he would ``expect AOL to continue to distribute
Microsoft software.'' Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. ``It is not at
all clear to me that AOL's incentive to do this is changed by this
proposed merger with Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that America Online officials had said their need to be
among the online services featured in Windows forced them to accept
Microsoft terms _ establishing Internet Explorer as the default
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton the question that lay under
his entire cross-examination of the witness _ and Microsoft's
larger assertion Monday about the proposed Netscape-AOL deal.
``Surely this combination,'' he asked, ``tells you something about
the nature of competition in the software industry?''
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton's answer was probably not the one Lacovara had
been after.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that this potential merger is the result of
Microsoft's actions with these exclusive contracts and other
actions,'' he said, ``it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of
a firm like Netscape, the brightest, newest star.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton's purpose on the stand for the government is to
establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system
software; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a
Microsoft operating system. That is the foundation under most of
the government's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain
behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that faces
healthy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara
tried to make the case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share
was ephemeral. The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving,
he suggested, that Microsoft could be toppled from its position at
any moment _ a point of view the company encourages among its
employees.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other
companies are placing other operating systems on the market, and
some software companies _ principally Microsoft's greatest rivals _
are writing software for these new systems. But Warren-Boulton
argued that ``the existence of these fringe competitors in the
operating system market does not mean in any way that Microsoft
does not have monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made an issue of the success Apple
Computer Co. is having selling its new iMac computer. He entered
into evidence an Apple news release issued last month showing,
among other things, that 12.5 percent of the people buying Apple's
new iMac computer had previously owned a Windows machine. Apple
computers use a different operating system, Mac-OS.

COWBOYS LOSE MILLS, McIVER TO INJURIES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys learned Monday that wide
receiver Ernie Mills and right guard Everett McIver will miss the
remainder of the regular season with injuries suffered in the
club's 30-22 victory against the Seattle Seahawks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Mills, the club's second-leading wide receiver,
was the most serious.
</P>
<P>
   Mills underwent surgery at a Dallas hospital Monday to repair a
small perforation in his small intestine. He was hurt when he was
hit hard in the midsection on a tackle by Seattle's Fred Thomas. A
CAT scan Monday showed some fluid in Mills' abdomen and an
operation was performed to repair the damage. He was to remain in
the hospital overnight.
</P>
<P>
   He could be back in time for the playoffs, Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   McIver tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee when
his leg was caught underneath a pile of players. The club placed
him on injured reserve Monday. He had already missed five games
this year after spraining his right knee on Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took it hard,'' coach Chan Gailey said. ``You work so hard
and then you hurt your other knee. He wanted to have a great season
and now that's not going to be able to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, 30, had resurrected his career in Dallas after struggling
in Pittsburgh and Carolina the past three seasons because of a
severe knee injury. He had the most extensive knowledge of Gailey's
offense and had split time with Billy Davis as the No. 2 receiver
behind Michael Irvin. He ends his season with 28 receptions for 479
yards. He leads the team in touchdown receptions with four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood our offense and was very instrumental with
helping everyone understand the little quirks that happen,'' Gailey
said. ``Hopefully we are far enough along now that everyone knows
what we are doing. Losing him now is better than losing him in the
second game of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mills out, and Deion Sanders (toe injury) limited on
offense, that means more action for players such as Jeff Ogden,
Eric Bjornson, and former Fort Worth Country Day star Patrick
Jeffers.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden had a career high four receptions for 26 yards against the
Seahawks. Jeffers caught two passes for 40 yards, including a
21-yard reception at the end of the first half that set up the
go-ahead field goal. KICK RETURN DUTIES
</P>
<P>
   Chris Warren, who was returning punts and kickoffs in place of
Sanders and Kevin Mathis, is listed as questionable for the Vikings
game with a strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said cornerback Kevin Smith and Ogden would return punts
if Warren can't go. Ogden, Billy Davis, and Sherman Williams would
be the leading candidates to return kickoffs, Gailey said. INSTEAD
OF MOSS
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys rookie defensive end Greg Ellis will come face to face
Thursday with the player many observers thought the Cowboys would
pick in the draft last spring: Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   While Moss has carved out rookie-of-the-year type statistics,
Ellis has put together a nice season as well, with 41 tackles, 2.5
sacks, and 11 quarterback pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he is aware of all the fuss that has been made about
Moss. But he added, ``nobody has ever come to my face and said,
`Yeah, they should have picked Randy over you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy's a good player,'' Ellis said. ``Mr. Jones knew he was a
good player when he didn't take him. He realized the best thing to
do for this football team was to take me. Randy, as everyone can
see, is an excellent football player. But they needed a defensive
lineman here.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman, who missed 51/2 games with a fractured
left collarbone, needs 15 passing attempts against the Vikings to
qualify among the league's leading passers this season. Aikman's
passer rating of 99.6 would be fifth best in the league, behind
Minnesota's Randall Cunningham (108.9), Denver's John Elway
(102.3), San Francisco's Steve Young (101.5), and the New York
Jets' Vinny Testaverde (100.4). ... The Cowboys added
practice-squad player Terry Billups, a defensive back, to its
active roster. They signed linebacker Brandon Tolbert to the
practice squad.

CONNECTICUT CUTS AN EXPENSIVE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.)  (rl) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Connecticut Gov. John Rowland offered the New England
Patriots a sweet deal to build a $350 million stadium in Hartford
last week, he must not have done his research about the many sweet
deals in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland did the standard stuff, like most government officials
eager to make their cities big-time by bringing in the NFL: He
would build the stadium at no cost to the Patriots' owner, Robert
Kraft, would let the team keep all revenues except a 10 percent
ticket tax that would go to the state, and would have Kraft invest
$75 million in a hotel in the downtown Adriaen's Landing
development for which the stadium would serve as an anchor.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual kicker is the proposal for the state to
guarantee the sale of club seats and luxury suites. A quick call
around the league would have informed Rowland that if it is
anyone's job to guarantee sales of the most expensive seats in the
joint, it is the business community's, not the government's.
</P>
<P>
   But in the memorandum of understanding between the state and the
Patriots, Rowland agreed to pay up to $10 million if the sale of
6,000 club seats brings in $20 million or less, and as much as $7.5
million if the sale of 125 luxury suites brings in $5 million or
less.
</P>
<P>
   And Rowland promised to sweeten his promise by offering to raise
the guarantees when leaguewide club seat and luxury suite prices
rise. Club seats are more comfortable seats with waiter service.
Luxury suites are the special enclosed boxes with seats and
refreshments.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the state's guarantees is a dangerous assumption:
that the Patriots can market club seats at the huge price of $5,000
each for a season.
</P>
<P>
   There are club seats that cost $5,000, but only at Giants
Stadium, which created only 120 of them this season for the Jets
and Giants. Nowhere else do club seats sell for more than $2,975.
In rabid Cleveland, no Browns club seat costs more than $2,500. At
year-old Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, Washington Redskins fans pay $995
to $2,500 for 15,044 club seats.
</P>
<P>
   But 6,000 club seats at $5,000 per seat in Hartford? ``That's
just way overpriced,'' said John Moag, chairman of the Maryland
Stadium Authority, which built Ravens Stadium. ``It could be very
significant exposure for the government. It's a huge risk.''
</P>
<P>
   During his talks with Art Modell, the Ravens' owner, Moag said
that financial guarantees for premium seating were not discussed.
``It's the team's job to sell those seats,'' he said. Of Rowland's
guarantees, Moag said, ``It's a backdoor subsidy for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rowland said that all elements of the package were
required to get the deal done. ``Every one of the items was
carefully negotiated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pricing of the proposed luxury suites, at an average of
$100,000 each, is more sensible, but still on the high end. An
average of $100,000 assumes that some will be higher, some will be
lower, and may have a price range similar to those at Cooke
Stadium, where they sell for $45,000 to $160,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   That may be fine for the wealthy Washington market, but will
such pricing play for the Patriots if they move from a dump of a
stadium in Foxboro, Mass., to a palatial 68,000-seat estate in
Hartford? Will fans buy club seats, which they have never had to
buy before, or pay a hefty increase from Foxboro's 35 luxury
suites, which cost from $33,000 to $125,000?
</P>
<P>
   The club seat pricing may be part of a strategy to reap income
at the higher level to keep regular ticket prices moderate. The
thought is noble but probably impractical. Given that club seats
selling at $5,000 are 68 percent pricier than any other in the
league outside Giants Stadium, well-heeled Patriots fans would have
to think that Kraft is nature's nobleman to pay so dearly for a
cushioned seat and waiters.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum that Kraft would reap from selling all club seats
and luxury suites is $42.5 million _ $45 million if 150 sky boxes
are built. Kraft could achieve it with a scintillating marketing
plan _ ``Buy a Club Seat, Sit With Steve Grogan!'' _ that
legitimately sells all the pricey perches, or he could sell most of
them and Uncle John would pay off on the ones that go unsold.
</P>
<P>
   ``To succeed, they're going to have to market to a very wide
area,'' said Sean Brenner, editor of Team Marketing Report, a trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   For Kraft, Rowland's guarantee was irresistible. Who would
reject such generosity? But savvier thinking should inform the
final lease, if the terms of the memorandum are approved by the
state legislature by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   First, Connecticut is being generous enough to build the
stadium; it should not further subsidize a private business.
Second, the price of the club seats and luxury boxes should be cut
to accommodate the local market. Hartford is not suburban Baltimore
or Charlotte, and the Patriots are not some virgin market's
expansion team or a Super Bowl winner.

RANGERS TURNING TO CLOUTIER, THE HOT GOALIE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE, N.Y. _ Dan Cloutier, who has started the New York Rangers'
last two games, is again scheduled to start against the Sabres in
Buffalo on Wednesday. But coach John Muckler insisted Tuesday that
Mike Richter remained his No. 1 goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Cloutier is unbeaten in his last four starts and was superb last
week in a victory in Los Angeles and a tie in San Jose, allowing
just three goals on 69 shots. Since losing to the Devils on Oct.
16, Cloutier is 2-0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cloutier has played well the last two games, so we figured
we'd go with him,'' Muckler said of his decision to start Cloutier
in Buffalo and Richter on Thursday in Pittsburgh. ``Cloutier is the
hot goalie at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler added: ``Richter is the No. 1 goalkeeper. And he will
see the majority of the games. They know what their roles are. I
have no problem about playing either one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to play some back to back games,'' Cloutier
said after Monday's practice. ``They want to bring me along slow. I
still got to learn a lot of things in this league. I know I'm not
going to get in 50 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter, who has gone five games without a victory, said he
understood Muckler's decision to go with Cloutier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know that when I'm not playing well or when I
need a rest, there's a guy right there who can step right in,''
Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Richter is 3-7-4 with a 2.73 goals against average.
During the five-game streak without a victory, Richter is 0-4-1
with a 3.31 goals against average.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could be without several key players when they face
the Sabres. The team's biggest defensemen, Jeff Beukeboom
(concussion) and Ulf Samuelsson (strained groin), did not practice
Monday. Beukeboom will not play against the Sabres and Samuelsson
is questionable, though Samuelsson's reputation for playing in pain
would suggest he might try to play. Also missing practice because
of injuries were Aleksei Kovalev (shoulder) and Todd Harvey
(elbow).

ADVERTISING: ONLINE MEETS OFF LINE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another demonstration of the blurring of the lines
between online and off-line advertising and media realms, a leading
Internet marketer is naming the world's ninth-largest agency to
handle duties ranging from global brand-building to creating
campaigns for television, magazines and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel.com Inc., which operates a popular online car-buying
service, will announce Tuesday the hiring of Grey Advertising in
New York as its agency for those traditional tasks, which will
supplement the marketing efforts the company makes in cyberspace
through the Grey interactive division.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel.com, which is based in Irvine, Calif., plans to
increase total spending considerably next year from the $20 million
that was budgeted for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Grey, with billings of more than $7.6 billion, works for such
giant blue-chip marketers as Conagra Inc., Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and
SmithKline Beecham. The decision by Autobytel.com to join their
ranks is indicative of the growing presence of Internet advertisers
in conventional media as they seek to appeal to cyberspace newbies
_ or even to those consumers who think ``online'' refers to a
telephone call or a fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large traditional marketers built their brands with large
traditional agencies,'' said Anne Benvenuto, senior vice president
for marketing at Autobytel.com. ``To help us become a household
name like P&AMP;G, we wanted an agency known for building brands
globally with expertise beyond the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was time to build more of an emotional bond with
consumers,'' she added, ``and you do that through traditional
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benvenuto discussed the decision to hire Grey in an
interview Monday in midtown Manhattan. She was joined by executives
of Grey and RBI Communications Inc., an advertising and public
relations agency in Hollywood that created Autobytel.com spots for
the 1997 and 1998 Super Bowls. RBI will continue handling corporate
communications for Autobytel.com.
</P>
<P>
   The increased attention and business generated by those Super
Bowl spots underscored for Autobytel.com ``the power of traditional
media like television,'' Ms. Benvenuto said, and ``the need to take
the traditional side more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance between driving the sale and driving the brand is
what we're looking for,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interactive marketers that have also recently hired
traditional agencies to produce advertising off line are Snap, a
search engine controlled by the NBC unit of General Electric Co.,
which selected the San Francisco office of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, part
of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, and ZDTV, a cable network operated by the
Ziff-Davis unit of Softbank Corp., which chose the San Francisco
office of Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, owned by True North
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   As cybermarketers look beyond agencies specializing in online
advertising, mainstream shops are beefing up their interactive
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Wickersham Hunt Schwantner in Boston, for instance, which is
owned by Snyder Communications, has agreed to acquire Berenson
Isham &AMP; Partners, a Boston agency with billings estimated at $40
million that manages interactive assignments for such advertisers
as Club Med, The Financial Times and Fidelity Investments. That
deal was for cash and stock valued at $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Grey Advertising by Autobytel.com comes seven
months after the company named the agency's online unit, Grey
Interactive, to handle a variety of marketing communications
assignments that included brand advertising and campaigns to run in
traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   But ``we needed to take things to the next level,'' Ms.
Benvenuto said, ``because I don't think you can build a brand with
the Internet alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to seed the likely prospects who will be online
next year, we have to start developing preferences for our brand
off line,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rasmussen, the vice president at Grey Advertising who is
group management supervisor on the Autobytel.com account, said the
agency would ``operate as an integrated resource with all our
disciplines working together,'' particularly as Autobytel.com
expands internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites are in the works for the first quarter of 1999 for
Britain and the Nordic countries, to join the site operating for
the United States and Canada (www.autobytel.com).
</P>
<P>
   The media services for the creative work produced by Grey
Advertising and Grey Interactive, Rasmussen said, will be handled
by Grey's Mediacom Worldwide (off line) and Media.com (online). A
mainstream campaign from Grey Advertising is due early next year.
</P>
<P>
   If executives at Autobytel.com are, as Ms. Benvenuto put it,
``maverick marketers,'' the choice of Grey Advertising is at odds
with the old perceptions that the agency's creative output was as
colorless as its name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creative is very important,'' Ms. Benvenuto said, ``and Grey
has strong creative. But there's also a lot to be said for strategy
and strong account management.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M LEARNS FROM REPEAT `MISTAKE'
</HEADLINE>
 A&AMP;M-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who learn from their mistakes are less likely to repeat
them _ a homily that does not necessarily translate into the
once-burned-twice-shy theory.
</P>
<P>
   That at least is true where Texas A&AMP;M football coach R.C. Slocum
was concerned last summer when he cast the Aggies' campaign hat
into the Kickoff Classic ring against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the plan this year _ and I was questioned and
second-guessed for it _ was taking the game with Florida State,''
Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   That move, many felt, ran contrary to what the A&AMP;M coach with
more victories than any other should have learned from the
experience of playing Brigham Young in the 1996 Pigskin Classic.
From that 41-37 loss, A&AMP;M tumbled to the only non-winning season
(6-6) of Slocum's 10 as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Slocum was confident of his decision to play the Seminoles
for several reasons. And in this case, foresight was 20-20.
</P>
<P>
   Ten consecutive victories after the well-played 23-14 loss to
the then-No.2 Seminoles on Aug. 31 are testament to Slocum's sound
judgment. Sixth-ranked A&AMP;M (10-1, 7-0) has climbed back to national
prominence and enters Friday's traditional clash with Texas as Big
12 South Zone champion for the second consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Not even during a 12-0 regular season in 1992 _ which had two
open dates _ did the Aggies win on 10 consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we had a chance to be a good team, and I was
concerned that we had an open date on the first available playing
day (Sept.5),'' Slocum said. ``If we'd stuck with that, we would
have had the last reporting day of any (team) in college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (it would be beneficial) to get the extra practice
by playing the early game and making the statement that we weren't
ducking anybody. And I did a better job before and after the game
than I did with the Pigskin Classic against BYU.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said that two years ago he misjudged the significance
attached to the early season BYU game. He was determined this time
to orchestrate the attitude _ win or lose against the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I was naive enough to think that we'd been rolling
along pretty good (51-8-1 in the previous five seasons) and
wouldn't be affected that much by losing one game by four points,''
Slocum said. ``(But) I let the players be affected too much by it.
This time we took the approach that we'd play the game, let people
say what they wanted _ win or lose _ and not worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd played the No. 2 team in the country, we were ahead at
halftime and had a chance to win in the fourth quarter if we'd made
another play or two. That's what I stressed to our team and I think
they left that game with more confidence, knowing that we'd taken
our best shot and played on even terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum handled the situation well enough that his key players
indeed look back on the Kickoff Classic experience as the
springboard to this season's success, in particular the significant
28-21 victory against Nebraska on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we played Florida State,'' tight end Dan Campbell
said. ``We wouldn't have beaten Nebraska if we hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dat Nguyen agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we played Nebraska, they were No.2 just like
Florida State was when we played them,'' Nguyen pointed out. ``We
knew we'd played well against Florida State. Nebraska was coming to
Kyle Field and we felt that playing at home could push us over the
top with a breakthrough win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think we would have had that same type confidence
if we hadn't played Florida State. That gave us something to build
on in our 10-game winning streak.''

MOVE FROM DEFENSE PUTS TEXAS RECEIVER IN RECORD BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An emotional game against Baylor was barely
under way when Texas wide receiver Kwame Cavil bumped into a
familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   Bears' defensive end Charles Foster, a former teammate at Waco
High School, greeted Cavil after making a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kwame, you'd better tell them about me,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Cavil grabbed his first of a team-high six
receptions. This time, he sought out Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't saying nothing about you,'' Cavil said, nodding toward
the Bears' huddle. ``But you'd better tell them about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus ended another typical exchange in Cavil's weekly game
within in the game. A self-described trash talker, Cavil thrives on
one-upmanship and has introduced himself to defenders in both word
and deed this season as part of the most prolific receiving tandem
in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil and Wane McGarity have combined for 1,724 yards, setting
the school's single-season record for a receiving duo, and will try
to add more in Friday's 10 a.m. game against Texas A&AMP;M in
Royal-Memorial Stadium. Most of the yards belong to McGarity, a
deep threat who leads the Big 12 in yards per catch (19.8) and
touchdown receptions (nine).
</P>
<P>
   But the receptions have been divided almost evenly, with 52 for
McGarity and 46 for Cavil. In Cavil's case, ranking fifth among Big
12 players in catches (46) and receiving yards (692) represents
significant production for a former linebacker who ran his first
regular-season pass route Oct. 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a minute that Cavil misses a chance to drive
home that fact to defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real cocky. When I beat you, I'll let you know,'' said
Cavil, whose 63 catches over the team's past 13 games represent the
most by any Longhorn during that stretch. ``I like to trash talk on
the field. It helps me get focused. And sometimes, it gets the
defensive back thinking more about me than about what he's supposed
to be doing. That's the edge I try and get over another person.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that will work Friday, when Texas (7-3, 5-2) meets No. 6
Texas A&AMP;M (10-1, 7-0), remains to be seen. But the 6-foot-2,
200-pound sophomore has no plans to alter his approach, and his
teammates do not intend to try and change him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks a lot, but he keeps it in perspective,'' quarterback
Major Applewhite said. ``He doesn't let it get out of hand. He uses
it as a tool to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, few receivers in the Big 12 have played better
than Cavil. Although limited to two receptions Nov. 14 in a 42-35
loss to Texas Tech, Cavil grabbed 28 passes for 453 yards and two
touchdowns in the five games that preceded Texas' trip to Lubbock.
Included was a team-high 70 receiving yards in a 20-16 upset of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Cavil also grabbed a career-high nine passes for 109 yards in a
37-34 victory against Oklahoma State. He scored a pivotal touchdown
in the team's 30-20 victory against Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   In the estimation of Texas coach Mack Brown, Cavil's greatest
assets are his 39-inch vertical leap and his ability to run after
the catch. Applewhite describes him as a ``skilled technician'' in
terms of running routes. McGarity points to something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never changed from that linebacker mentality,'' McGarity
said. ``He kept that aggressive mindset on offense, and a lot of
defensive backs can't handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, teammates say Cavil _ a former high school
basketball player _ is adept at using his wide wingspan to create
open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he's clearing out the low post in basketball,''
Applewhite said. ``Once he does that, it's easy throwing to
Kwame.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavil, who switched to receiver during two-a-days in August
1997, described last year's skills as ``raw footage'' compared to
what he can do today. The big difference, said Cavil, has been
working with wide receivers coach Darryl Drake.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, former Texas offensive coordinator Gene Dahlquist
coordinated both the quarterbacks and receivers but concentrated
most of his time on the quarterbacks. As a result, said Cavil: ``I
was more of a sandlot player, just running around trying to get
open. I'm still not real comfortable right now. But I'm way more
comfortable than I was because of coach Drake.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he can be considered a finished product at receiver,
Cavil said he must improve his blocking. Brown said Cavil is making
strides in that area, describing his progress as ``phenomenal'' for
someone in only his second year at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll end up being one of the best wide receivers
we've ever had play here,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents can tell you he's already one of the chattiest.

EDITORIAL: INCORRIGIBLE IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has gotten off to a shaky start in honoring its latest
pledge to cooperate with U.N. arms inspections. By promising
Washington that it would halt all interference with the inspectors'
search for biological and chemical weapons and prohibited missiles,
Baghdad won a last-minute reprieve from American air and missile
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Saddam Hussein seems to be trimming back that commitment.
Iraq is implausibly contending that it does not have any of the
weapons documents the inspectors have asked to see and is
suggesting that when full-scale inspections resume next month, the
U.N. investigators may not be able to go everywhere they want. For
now, more routine monitoring inspections have resumed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is right to seek clarification of Iraqi
intentions. But if Baghdad is back to its familiar game of
thwarting the search for biological and chemical weapons and banned
missiles, American military action may become unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The documents sought by the inspectors would show how much
weapons material Iraq had before the Persian Gulf war. By
subtracting what they have discovered and destroyed in seven years,
inspectors can get a good fix on how much Baghdad has left. Iraq
complicates the inspectors' work and delays completion of their
efforts by insisting that no such documents exist. The U.N. must
insist that these documents be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council must also insist on unhindered access to
all sites that Iraq promised to provide. Washington can quickly
renew the threat of military force. Additional American troops and
equipment are continuing to arrive in the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections, if they can proceed freely, are still the most
effective way to track down and eliminate Iraq's terror weapons.
But if Iraq will not permit the inspectors to do their jobs,
Washington will have no choice but to reduce Iraq's arsenal of
deadly germs and chemicals by military force. &QL;

LEADING DISABILITY INSURERS AGREE TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Tenn.)  (rl) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creating a disability insurer that will dominate the business,
UNUM Corp. and Provident Cos. agreed Monday to merge in a deal that
valued Provident at $4.75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates a real powerhouse,'' said Gloria Vogel, an
independent insurance analyst for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   While both companies portrayed the deal as a merger of equals,
they said Provident stockholders would receive 0.73 share of the
new company, based on UNUM's closing price on Friday of $48.125,
for each Provident share. That puts the share price of Provident at
$35.13, or $1.756 over its price at the end of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   UNUM, based in Portland, Maine, has been the national giant in
group disability insurance. Provident, of Chattanooga, Tenn., is
the leader in individual disability insurance. Together they will
be, by far, the largest in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   One strategy of the new company, to be called UNUM Provident,
will be to try to sell individual disability insurance as a
supplement to people who are already covered under group plans sold
by UNUM. Typically, group disability insurance pays disabled people
60 percent of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   UNUM also has been the leader in long-term care insurance, and
the new company will offer that coverage to former Provident
customers. ``The combined company has the potential to provide
genuine one-stop shopping for large corporations seeking disability
coverage,'' said Eric Berg, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. ``But
the threshold issue is: Will companies want to buy at one stop? My
judgment is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, the sale of individual policies to people
already in group plans should be an efficient practice. ``You get
access to a clump of people rather than going to them one at a
time,'' said Joan Zief of Goldman, Sachs. The new, more efficient
company should be able to undercut the prices of competitors, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market applauded the deal Monday, lifting the price of
both companies. UNUM shares rose $4.50, or 9.4 percent, to $52.625
on the New York Stock Exchange, and Provident rose $4.125, or 12.4
percent, to $37.50, also on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Provident has done business exclusively in the United
States and Canada. With the merger, its products will be offered
through UNUM's 20 overseas offices in places like Britain, Germany,
France, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ending on Sept. 30, UNUM reported $4.5 billion
in revenue compared with $3.9 billion for Provident. UNUM's market
value was $6.6 billion; Provident's, $4.5 billion. UNUM reported
assets of $14.9 billion; Provident, $23.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   James Orr III, chief executive of UNUM, will become chairman and
chief executive of the new company, and Provident's leader, Harold
Chandler, is to become president and chief operating officer. On
July 1, the two have agreed that Chandler will become the chief
executive, and that Orr will remain as chairman. Eight UNUM board
members and seven directors of Provident will make up the new
board.
</P>
<P>
   Orr and Chandler said they expected to save up to $130 million
as a result of the merger by combining some of the 105 offices the
two companies operate in the United States. They also plan to
eliminate duplicate computer systems and to cut an unspecified
number of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, for the next year or two, we should have strong
earnings from this new entity, just based on the expense savings,''
Ms. Zief said.
</P>
<P>
   Disability coverage is one of fastest-growing parts of the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have long recognized the risk of dying early or losing
their home,'' said Vanessa Wilson, an analyst with Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, ``but only recently have individuals focused on
protecting their paycheck with disability insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is a business with lots of room to grow. Specialists in
the field estimated that no more than 40 percent of corporate
employees were now covered by disability policies, and even fewer
in small companies.

WILLIAM DOUGLAS, 76, DOCTOR FOR ASTRONAUTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, N.M.)   (ms)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Kennedy Douglas, the Air Force doctor who cared for Lt.
Col. John Glenn and the United States' six other original
astronauts, died on Nov. 15 at Lewisville Medical Center in
Lewisville, Texas, near Dallas. He was 76 and lived in Albuquerque,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a viral infection, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas fell ill as he and his wife were driving back to
Albuquerque from Cape Canaveral, Fla., after watching Glenn return
to space with the launching of the shuttle on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, a lieutenant colonel, took leave from the Air Force
from 1959 to 1962 to work for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and became one of the earliest practitioners of
space medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center at Langley Air Force
Base, Va., he was personally responsible for the medical care and
flight preparation of the seven Mercury astronauts. He stayed with
NASA through the nation's first four manned space flights, those of
Alan Shepard, Virgil Grissom, Glenn and Scott Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the service in 1977 with the rank of colonel, he
joined McDonnell Douglas Corp. as life sciences director to help
with the design of an orbiting space station. In 1988, he retired
to Albuquerque and the life of an amateur radio operator. He was
inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in Alamogordo,
N.M., in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas was born in Estancia, N.M., near Albuquerque, took his
premedical training at the University of New Mexico and Texas
Western College, and received his medical degree from the
University of Texas Medical School in Galveston. He did
postgraduate work at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the Air Force in 1949 and was board-certified in
aviation medicine in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mariwade McIlroy Douglas; their son,
Michael of Tijeras, N.M., and two grandchildren.

SPITZER REMAINS IN LEAD OVER VACCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling its count of machine and paper ballots in the race for
attorney general virtually complete, the state Board of Elections
said Monday that Eliot Spitzer remained in the lead, with 21,191
more votes than Dennis Vacco, the Republican incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The board said the only votes left to count statewide were
recorded on fewer than 1,000 paper ballots from Erie County.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Spitzer, the Democratic challenger, declared victory
and began putting together a transition team. But Vacco's campaign
aides have raised allegations of widespread irregularities in the
balloting in New York City and have gone to court to force further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns met in state Supreme Courtin Manhattan again
Monday, where lawyers for Vacco's campaign said more than 1,000
ballots might have been cast in the names of voters who had died
before the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   In court last week, the lawyers said they had discovered a
37,000-vote discrepancy in New York City. They acknowledged Monday
that that allegation could not be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Thomas Keegan allowed the Vacco campaign to spend a few
more days looking through voting records to clarify the claims of
voting irregularities. He asked a representative of the Board of
Elections to return to court on Monday with results of the voting
machine tally and asked the Vacco campaign to report its findings
then.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the judge told officials of both campaigns, if
Spitzer's lead remains ``at or about 20,000, it would appear that
this election would be over.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's updated tally does not include nearly 22,000 paper
ballots that have been set aside because of objections by one or
both of the campaigns. The Vacco campaign has asked that the
ballots remain unopened until it completes its scrutiny of the
results from the voting machines used in New York City. But
Spitzer's campaign wants the ballots to be opened and counted.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Republican and Democratic Parties had expected a
close race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Alfonse D'Amato, a
Republican, they agreed several months ago that any paper ballot in
any race that either side contested would be set aside. Under the
agreement, the state Supreme Court would review them and rule on
their validity.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's lawyers and campaign officials denounced the Vacco
campaign's request for additional time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a big smoke screen,'' said Martin Connor, the
state Senate minority leader and a lawyer for the Spitzer campaign.
``The Republican State Committee is trying to make up excuses for
why they did so poorly this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor insisted that there was no reason for the challenged
ballots to remain unopened and uncounted. ``They are ultimately
going to be counted and they are going to increase Eliot Spitzer's
margin,'' he told reporters after his court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thomas Spargo, Vacco's campaign lawyer, acknowledged
that the disputed ballots would probably raise Spitzer's total
count.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 paper ballots cast by voters in New York City,
where Spitzer won the voting-machine count by more than 3-1, were
challenged. The remaining challenged votes, nearly 9,000, were cast
elsewhere in the state. But many of those ballots were cast in
Democratic strongholds in other urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Spargo said the Vacco campaign conducted a computer search that
matched the names of more than 1,000 people who voted Nov. 3 with
names that appeared in records of the Social Security
Administration indicating that death benefits had been paid to
their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the opportunity to go into the books and to determine
whether or not the votes that have been cast in this election have
been properly and legitimately cast,'' Spargo said. ``It's very
close. But you need the time and access to go in and check and
double-check the records.''

 &HT;    2 charged in Georgia shooting after cart 'clipping'
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With less than a week to go before the frenzied
Christmas shopping season officially kicks off, things already are
getting ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, a Florida man was shot in the face during a
fight that broke out after two shopping carts bumped at a Wal-Mart
in Conyers. Two Newton County, Ga. men were arrested in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jernigan, 20, of North Titusville, Fla., was shot once in
the face on Saturday outside the store after allegedly clashing
with Russell David Jackson, 28, of Oxford, Ga. and David Lee Hill,
31, of Covington, Ga. Jernigan's friend, Nicholas Jones, in his
20s, of Conyers, also was involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been charged with aggravated assault and aggravated
battery. Hill has been charged with being involved in a fray.
Jernigan is in serious condition at Georgia Baptist Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers police said the incident occurred about 1 p.m. when Hill
and Jackson, who were standing in a check-
</P>
<P>
   out line behind Jernigan and Jones, moved the shopping cart they
were sharing to get into a different check-out lane. In doing so,
their cart allegedly ``clipped'' one being used by Jernigan and
Jones, said Conyers police Capt. David Spann.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Jernigan allegedly told the men never to bump their
buggy again, which began a verbal exchange. Jones and Jernigan then
told Hill and Jackson that they would wait for them outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure enough they were outside when the two guys came out of
the store,'' Spann said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, brandishing a tire iron, struck Hill, while Jernigan and
Jackson began fighting, Spann said. At some point, Jackson, who had
a gun on him, allegedly shot Jernigan. Police have not found the
gun.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing, and additional charges may be
possible. Conyers police have a Crime Prevention Unit at the store,
and two off-duty policemen were working for Wal-Mart at the
time.Leon Stafford writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
Atlanta, Ga.

CITY UNION CHIEF CONCEDES VOTE FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The executive director of the union representing
120,000 New York City municipal workers acknowledged Monday that
there was vote fraud in the 1996 ratification of his union's
contract, which included an unpopular two-year wage freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hill, head of District Council 37, announced that two of
his top assistants, including one who ran the union day to day,
were resigning. Union officials said the two had admitted carrying
out fraud in the vote for a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's admission came four days after it was revealed that
prosecutors were investigating allegations of vote fraud, tainting
what was widely considered as Mayor Rudolph Guiliani's most
important labor relations victory. The two-year pay freeze helped
Giuliani balance the city's budget. And Giuliani used the District
Council 37 contract, which covers social workers, engineers, data
processors, clerks and dozens of other categories, as a lever to
pressure firefighters, sanitation workers and other unionized
workers to accept similar two-year pay freezes.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he knew nothing about the fraud allegations until
Friday, when The New York Times reported that the Manhattan
district attorney was investigating claims by a union official that
thousands of fraudulent votes were stuffed into ballot boxes in a
clerical workers' local during the 1996 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who resigned are Martin Lubin, the union's
associate director, and Mark Shaplo, Lubin's top assistant. Hill
had worked with both men for nearly three decades. Neither man
could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hill acknowledged that his union was in ``crisis,'' but said he
would not give in to calls to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and
several other unions seized on Hill's admission to demand that
Giuliani renegotiate their contracts. But it appeared unlikely that
the fraud would invalidate the district council's contract, which
called for a pay freeze and no layoffs for the first two years and
a 13 percent pay increase over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Estreicher, a labor law expert at New York University
School of Law, said: ``The common law is that if the bargaining
agent has the authority to sign a contract on behalf of the union
employees, they're bound by it. It's a problem because the
employees were apparently manipulated here, and it has an impact on
other unions. It's a terrible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fraud allegations are part of a wide-ranging investigation
by Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau into the council
and its 56 locals. The inquiry covers allegations of embezzlement,
falsifying records, flying girlfriends to meetings and taking
kickbacks from caterers, travel agencies, law firms and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation produced its first charges last week when the
head of a highway workers' local pleaded guilty to committing
embezzlement and vote fraud in his own local. Lawyers knowledgeable
about the investigation say the official, Joseph DeCanio, was the
first person to provide prosecutors with specific evidence of fraud
in the 1996 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that when the allegations became public on Friday he
questioned Lubin and Shaplo, and they admitted they had known about
the fraud. On Saturday he consulted with the president of the
District Council's union's national parent union, the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and then he
demanded the resignations of the two men.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, on the very day that Hill announced the
contract had been ratified, the presidents of two of the largest
locals in District Council 37 asserted that the contract had been
ratified through fraud. But until DeCanio came forward, there were
no specific allegations to buttress those suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   In the clerical local that DeCanio identified as the center of
the fraud, the official tally showed 10,002 votes for ratification
and 2,265 against.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the council's official count was 19,513 votes for
ratification and 14,438 against, but without the clerical workers'
vote the contract would have been defeated by more than 2,500
votes.

COURTSIDE VIEW  
 TALE OF TWO CHEFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Walter Mitty fantasies go, this is big: Being on
the same tennis court with stars like Martina Navratilova or
Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Note that that sentence says being on the same court. It does
not say anything about playing against Ms. Navratilova or Ms.
Davenport. Which explains what Wendy Baum was, and was not, doing
at the Chase Championships at Madison Square Garden last week. She
was a ball person, retrieving serves and smashes, pitching the ball
back to big-name players and, by the way, making a case for a
sex-neutral name for a ball boy.
</P>
<P>
   In her other life, Ms. Baum is vice president for finance with
NPD, a market-research firm in Port Washington, N.Y. But several
years ago, sitting in the crowd at the U.S. Open, she wondered
about working as a ball girl. She figured the view would be better
and the admission free. She is not a frustrated tennis player who
did not make the team way back when. ``I played softball in
college,'' she said. ``That's where the throwing came from.'' She
plays tennis ``just recreationally.''
</P>
<P>
   She worked at the gold-medal matches at the 1996 Olympics and
Ms. Navratilova's last match at the Garden. ``I haven't done the
big fall in front of 20,000 people,'' she said. ``I have been
yelled at by some of the best tennis players in the world. They
don't like to be distracted if you're late throwing the ball. I
remember thinking, `I have a day job; I don't need this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Who has yelled at her? ``Conchita Martinez can be a little
cranky. Nathalie Tauziat can be a little cranky. The real
sweethearts to work for are Seles and Graf,'' she said, referring
to multiple-title winners Monica Seles and Steffi Graf. ``Nothing
but a thank-you out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   She was on the court on Wednesday when Ms. Davenport defeated
Sandrine Testud in a tiebreaker. She was back when Ms. Seles
defeated Anna Kournikova. She had left a company retreat in White
Plains, N.Y., a day early to work at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew where I was going,'' she said. ``I think they
understood it more when I was a little younger. They keep thinking
retirement's around the corner. I told them before I'm 40, I'll
stop. I'm 35, and feel it. It used to be I could go out and throw a
match. Now I've got to go to the gym, like, two months before it
starts and get the body loose again.''
</P>
<P>
   Unrecognized &UR;  &LR; Without a Halo &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes celebrities go unrecognized, even when they have a
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   That is the only explanation for what happened at Picholine, the
well-scrubbed country French restaurant on the Upper West Side,
when Alain Ducasse arrived for lunch the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse is one of the world's most famous chefs _ ``the chef-god
of the moment,'' the chef at Picholine, Terrance Brennan, described
him. Ducasse's restaurants in Paris and Monte Carlo received a
total of six stars from the Michelin guide earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Brennan knew that Ducasse was coming. But he arrived with
some other people, and Brennan did not recognize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't introduce him as Monsieur Ducasse,'' Brennan said.
``I didn't realize until after I had said, `Good afternoon, sir,'
that, wait a minute, that looks kind of like him.'' But when
Brennan met him several years ago at Louis XV, Ducasse's restaurant
in Monte Carlo, he had a beard. And in Brennan's memory, he was
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse talked about his newest restaurant in Paris, Spoon,
which he said would open next month. ``Not one of his grand formal
restaurants,'' said Liz Herman, a spokeswoman for Ducasse's
publisher, Artisan, which arranged the lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ducasse left, Brennan took him to the cheese room, next
to the wine room. ``He said, `Get rid of all these wines and have
more cheese,''' Brennan said. Doing so would involve discarding, or
at least moving, about 1,200 bottles.

LITTLE PROGRESS IN JERSEY CITY NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ After negotiators failed to come up with a
settlement in a nine-hour session that ended shortly after 3 a.m.
Monday, public school teachers stayed off the job for a third day,
leaving schools with few adults in charge and many students absent.
</P>
<P>
   The city's five high schools remained closed, and district
officials said they probably would be closed again on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The grammar schools, with children from pre-kindergarten through
eighth grade, were again reduced to half-day schedules. District
officials said attendance Monday was about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made small progress last night,'' said Frank Sinatra, the
district's business administrator. ``We at least narrowed the
number of people who will sit at the negotiating table to two for
each side.''
</P>
<P>
   But both sides said there was little if any progress on issues
such as salary increases, teacher evaluations and the district's
proposal to extend the school day and the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for Thomas Favia, president of the
Jersey City Education Association, which represents the 2,500
teachers and 1,000 support personnel, said teachers were more
concerned about an evaluation system that does not give them much
chance to respond to reports by teams of educators who come in,
unannounced, to review their classroom work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joseph said that at the session that ended early on Monday,
union representatives typed up a proposal on ways to change the
evaluation system that was similar to one in place at the Newark
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between the two sides, she said, illustrated why
there had been such little movement since last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their answer was no,'' Ms. Joseph said. ``In most
negotiations, one side gives the other side a proposal, and the
other side comes back and says, `Well, I can deal with this, but I
want to modify that.' You get an idea for what the other side can
live with. No _ you can't live with that kind of attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the two sides were to meet again tonight for
an informal session.
</P>
<P>
   If the strike continues until Tuesday, the union risks being
fined $100,000 a day. Union lawyers will be in court Tuesday to
argue against the fine, and against the back-to-work order imposed
last week by Judge Martin Greenberg of Hudson County Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra said that the district is intent on making teachers more
accountable about the work they perform, because the district has
been under state control for about 10 years for poor performance,
and has to demonstrate that it is serious about making changes.

SKATING RINK WON'T ALLOW CONDOM-ADORNED CHRISTMAS TREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A plan to raise a Christmas tree adorned with condoms
in the Central Park skating rink for an AIDS-prevention event was
canceled Monday after a Catholic group urged the rink's private
operator not to allow the tree, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Parks Department, whose approval would have been
needed, had also expressed concerns about the appropriateness of
the event, which was to include a concert and a tree-lighting
ceremony on Dec. 1 at the Wollman Rink, parks officials said. The
event was to have been sponsored by Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious
and Civil Rights, said he was delighted when officials of the
Makkos Organization, which operates the rink, told him they would
not allow the event. Makkos officials did not return numerous
telephone messages Monday evening seeking to confirm that the event
had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue had threatened to call for a holiday-season boycott of
Levi Strauss if the tree went up in the rink.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss officials said they had not heard from the Makkos
Organization. They said another venue for the event would be found
if it were not allowed to be held at Wollman Rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about Wollman Rink,'' said Cassie Ederer, a
spokeswoman for Levi Strauss, which is based in San Francisco.
``It's about AIDS awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ederer said Monday was the first she had heard that the
event was in danger of being canceled. She said Makkos had cashed a
$5,000 check as a deposit and sent Levi Strauss a contract for the
event last week; the jeans maker returned the contract by fax
Monday morning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss' plan was donate $1 to a music-industry
AIDS-awareness group, Lifebeat, for every person who came to the
tree-lighting ceremony and concert; the best-selling rapper
Canibus, was scheduled to perform a new song advocating safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The tree itself, Ms. Ederer said, would be an artificial
35-foot-tall pine covered with condoms in their wrappers, in many
different colors. ``It will be a tasteful tree,'' Ms. Ederer said.
``It will be the Tree of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, had
questioned whether it was possible to cover a Christian symbol in
contraceptives in a tasteful way. He called the Levi Strauss plan
``one of the most idiotic ideas I've ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the Parks Department, said parks
officials told Makkos that parents might not want their children to
see a Christmas tree decorated with condoms. The department's
approval is needed for all special events at the rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``What concerned us was the controversial nature of such a
display in what is essentially a family setting,'' Skyler said.
</P>
<P>
   Exposing young people to images of condoms, however, was exactly
what Levi Strauss wanted to do, Ms. Ederer said. She said Levi
Straus had donated $20 million to AIDS education and awareness
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said Levi Strauss was trying to promote homosexuality.
``They're really in the vanguard of setting the agenda for the
corporate culture along the lines of the radical gay movement,'' he
said, ``and this is one more demonstration of their ideology.''

NEW HOTEL FOR TIMES SQUARE GETS EUROPEAN FINANCING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three European banks will finance the construction of
a 455-room hotel to be built on top of an entertainment and retail
complex in Times Square, state officials announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The $120 million Doubletree Hotel is the seventh hotel planned
for a once dismal neighborhood that has rapidly evolved into one of
the most desirable commercial addresses in midtown Manhattan. A
joint venture of the Forest City Ratner Cos. and the Promus Hotel
Corp., the 25-story hotel will be built on top of a 25-screen AMC
movie multiplex and a Madame Tussaud's wax museum that are now
under construction, and will be priced to attract families as well
as business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks _ Credit Lyonnais, Bayerische Hypo-und
Vereinsbank and Deutsche Bank _ will also finance the construction
of the first hotel in Battery Park City in lower Manhattan, state
officials said on Monday. That hotel, the $123 million 463-room
Embassy Suites, will also be developed by Forest City Ratner and
Promus and will be part of a project that includes a multiplex
movie theater, a health club and a conference center.
</P>
<P>
   Both hotels are scheduled to be completed in 2000, said a
spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner.
</P>
<P>
   The master plan for Times Square did not include the Doubletree
Hotel, which will be located between 41st and 42d Streets, close to
Eighth Avenue, and will be less than a block from another new
proposed hotel. The Tishman Urban Development Corp. is seeking
financing to build a much larger hotel on the east side of Eighth
Avenue between 42d and 43d Streets, adjacent to another
entertainment and retail complex under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Redevelopment
Corp., which is overseeing the development of Times Square, said
the hotels would cater to different segments of the market. The
45-story Tishman project will have 900 rooms and is intended to be
more upscale.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kielar, a Tishman spokesman, said his company never
viewed the Ratner project as competition. Financing for the $230
million Tishman hotel is expected to be in place by next spring, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters Monday, Gargano said the developers were
not getting a tax reduction. But afterward, officials in his office
said the state and city will help minimize the developers' risk by
enabling them to defer as much as $1 million in taxes a year for
the next 20 years if their profits do not meet expectations. But
their taxes will increase if they exceed projections.

 N.J. ASSEMBLY OKs PANEL TO REVIEW SALARIES  
(bk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Moving with a nervousness and stealth exhibited
only by lawmakers about to grant themselves a pay raise, the state
Assembly on Monday voted to establish a commission to review the
salaries of all three branches of state government, including the
Legislature itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for elected officials across the country to
distance themselves from measures to increase their own pay,
because they fear that political opponents might use the issue
against them in future elections. In New Jersey, a state with high
property taxes and a volatile electorate, some representatives grow
downright twitchy when discussing the issue. Last year, New Jersey
officials asked a retiring state senator to propose a pay increase
during a late-night session, but it was eventually killed in the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   This year, legislators decided to create a commission to provide
themselves political cover. That way, they can insist they are
motivated not by their own salaries, but by concern that the
state's judges are adequately paid.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the state's 120 legislators say they work an
average of 50 hours a week on government affairs, their offices are
considered part-time positions, and pay $35,000 a year. That
salary, which was last increased in 1990, ranks as the 14th highest
state legislature salary in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But some tax watchdog groups said lawmakers are already amply
paid for their public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a part-time job, these people are making more than the
average salary of most full-time employees in New Jersey,'' said
John Budzash, founder of the Hands Across New Jersey tax relief
organization. ``I don't think they should get a raise until we see
the salaries of most New Jersey workers go up first.'' In a vote
without any debate, the Assembly passed the measure, 64-8. But a
sponsor of the bill, Assemblyman Leonard Lance, a Republican, said
there was no guarantee that the panel would recommend a raise for
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a pay-raise commission, it's a salary
commission,'' Lance said. ``I have no idea what it will recommend.
Maybe it will conclude that things should stay as they are. I just
want to be certain that the quality of our judges remains high.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure will be introduced in the Senate next month,
according to the Republican majority leader, John Bennett, who is a
co-sponsor. If, as expected, it passes, Gov. Christie Whitman,
Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz and legislative leaders would
appoint the seven commissioners. Any recommended salary changes
would have to be approved by the Legislature and the governor and
would not take effect until Jan. 1, 2000, after the next election.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey judges are paid $110,000 per year. Whitman's salary
is set at $130,000, but she accepts only $85,000 because her
predecessor, Jim Florio, refused to accept a pay raise that was
approved before he took office.

bull market's last few years.
</P>
<P>
   This performance represents a U-turn in investor sentiment.
Stock euphoria is back, with the Dow rising 214.72 points, or 2.34

its proposed purchase of Netscape, America Online hopes to take a
big step toward its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued in federal court that the proposed acquisition
of Netscape by America Online seriously undermined the government's
antitrust suit.

LATEST BANKRUPTCY FILING THREATENS SERVICES AT H.M.O.

<P>
   Efforts to maintain uninterrupted services to the 194,000
customers of the financially troubled HIP Health Plan of New Jersey
hit a new roadblock on Monday when the company providing medical
services to the plan's members sought to liquidate itself in
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   The medical management company, Pinnacle Healthcare Enterprises,
moved in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., to convert
its week-old Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing _ in which it had sought
to reorganize itself _ into a Chapter 7 filing, under which it
could sell off its assets to satisfy creditors. If granted, the
move could pave the way for the sale of the 23 health centers where
HIP's members now receive their primary health care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the earlier filing, Pinnacle sought to stay in business in
the state and remain protected from its creditors while it
reorganized itself. At the very least, it would have been able to
keep the centers open.
</P>
<P>
   But with Monday's filing, the company proposed to sell off its
assets, pay as much of its debt as it could and then cease doing
business. Its chief asset is the network of health centers that it
purchased from HIP 18 months ago for $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Pinnacle was triggered by a state court judge's
ruling on Friday that state regulators should take over the
operation of the centers, direct H.I.P. to break the contract with
Pinnacle and then place HIP, the state-licensed insurer, under its
supervision until its financial condition improved. The ruling, by
Judge Jack Lintner of State Superior Court in New Brunswick, was
made in defiance of a Federal Bankruptcy Court's issuance of a
temporary restraining order earlier on Friday blocking any state
action that would harm Pinnacle as it sought to reorganize.
</P>
<P>
   In the state ruling, Judge Lintner cited a ``public health
emergency'' in the possible financial ruin of HIP and issued his
order in an effort to insure care to HIP's members. He directed
state regulators to ask the bankruptcy judge, Joseph Farnan, to
remove any restraint on state action against Pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers on Monday, Pinnacle officials said they were
forced to file for liquidation because the court-ordered seizure of
their centers by regulators effectively blocked any chance of
reorganization under Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what effect the Chapter 7 filing
might have on promises that state officials made late last week
that there would be no disruption in members' services.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Wright, a program director for the New Jersey Citizen
Action, the state's largest consumer watchdog group, said the move
by Pinnacle ``throws a monkey wrench'' into the state's efforts to
keep the centers open and functioning. It is possible, he said,
that the state may have to take on the cost of shifting thousands
of people to other plans or of stepping in to provide services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a legally murky situation to begin with, and this move
to Chapter 7 liquidation by Pinnacle just makes it murkier,'' said
Mr. Wright, whose group had long opposed the arrangement between
HIP and Pinnacle because of what it called ineffective monitoring
by the state.

EDITORIAL: INCORRIGIBLE IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS to rewrite 2nd graf for precision.)  (ms/mk) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has gotten off to a shaky start in honoring its latest
pledge to cooperate with U.N. arms inspections. By promising
Washington that it would halt all interference with the inspectors'
search for biological and chemical weapons and prohibited missiles,
Baghdad won a last-minute reprieve from American air and missile
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Saddam Hussein seems to be trimming back that commitment.
Iraq is implausibly contending that it does not have most of the
weapons documents the inspectors have asked to see and is
withholding those it has. Iraq also suggests that when full-scale
inspections resume next month, the U.N. investigators may not be
able to go everywhere they want. For now, routine inspections have
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is right to seek clarification of Iraqi
intentions. But if Baghdad is back to its familiar game of
thwarting the search for biological and chemical weapons and banned
missiles, American military action may become unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The documents sought by the inspectors would show how much
weapons material Iraq had before the Persian Gulf war. By
subtracting what they have discovered and destroyed in seven years,
inspectors can get a good fix on how much Baghdad has left. Iraq
complicates the inspectors' work and delays completion of their
efforts by insisting that no such documents exist. The U.N. must
insist that these documents be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council must also insist on unhindered access to
all sites that Iraq promised to provide. Washington can quickly
renew the threat of military force. Additional American troops and
equipment are continuing to arrive in the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections, if they can proceed freely, are still the most
effective way to track down and eliminate Iraq's terror weapons.
But if Iraq will not permit the inspectors to do their jobs,
Washington will have no choice but to reduce Iraq's arsenal of
deadly germs and chemicals by military force. &QL;

<P>
   A major new international study shows that American high school
graduation rates, for generations the highest in the world, have
slipped below those of most industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Monday by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development in Paris, which helps coordinate policy
for 29 of the richest countries, suggests that the changing picture
is less a matter of American backsliding than of substantial recent
progress by other nations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1990, the average number of years an American
5-year-old was expected to attend high school or college was the
world's highest, 16.3. In 1996, the latest year for which data was
available, the American score was 16.8, but 11 other countries,
including Canada, Spain and Finland, had surpassed that number.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report found that the United States devoted a
smaller percentage of its national income to teacher salaries than
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The United States remains on top in the percentage of students
who enter college, but a pattern similar to high school graduation
rates is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entry rates to college education in the U.S. are still the
highest in the OECD but that is likely to change soon,'' said
Andreas Schleicher, principal administrator at the OECD and one of
the study's authors. ``While enrollments in the United States
remained relatively stable between 1990 and 1996, they increased by
more than 25 percent in 16 OECD countries.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the United States also has one of the highest
university dropout rates in the industrialized world _ 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the fifth such study issued by the organization
since 1991, when it started examining educational trends in member
countries. Schleicher said that over the last three years the
report has been the OECD's best-selling publication.
</P>
<P>
   The report offers far more data than analysis, but it suggests
that growing emphasis in other countries on high school graduation
is a result of ``the desire of employers to have better skilled
workers and, hence, from individuals who see that educational
qualifications improve their life chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Schleicher said other nations in his organization had placed
enormous emphasis on improving access to education, bringing them
in line with and surpassing American achievements.
</P>
<P>
   The shifting balance is likely to cause concern in the United
States, because the quality of American education has been the
focus of growing attention and debate for 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should be quite alarmed by this,'' said Gerald
Graff, professor of English and education at the University of
Chicago, who is writing a book on what he considers the dangerous
gap between the thinking classes in America and the rest of the
society. ``We've never fully committed ourselves to the democratic
idea of education. There is a kind of silent bargain between
schools and many of its students that says, `We'll leave you alone
if you just sit there and don't bother us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the results of a mathematics and science test
of 12th graders in many countries showed the United States to be
among the least knowledgeable. Earlier tests showed the lowest 25
percent of 8th graders in Japan and South Korea to outperform the
average American student.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Education was widely viewed as having been the top concern of
voters in the elections for state and federal office held earlier
this month with candidates of both major parties vowing increased
spending on teacher training and school improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The issue most recently gained a high profile in 1983 with
publication by the U.S. Education Department of an alarming report
on American education entitled ``A Nation at Risk'' which said that
if a foreign power had imposed such a low level of education on the
United States, it would rightfully have been perceived as having
engaged in an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, numerous efforts have sprung up, from
alternatives to public education like charter schools and voucher
plans, to projects to improve teacher quality, widely perceived as
the system's Achilles heel. Some states are now testing student
teachers more rigorously and offering signing bonuses and plans to
forgive student loans to encourage better candidates to enter the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Many states also are instituting tests at various stages in
school to insure that students do not graduate without basic skills
and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report shows that Americans between the ages of 55 and
64, who graduated high school some 40 years ago, have a graduation
rate of 77 percent, the highest in the OECD. Among those ages 24 to
34, who graduated about a decade ago, the United States slipped to
eighth. Today's graduation rates, with the United States at 72
percent, place it second to last in the 29-nation group, above
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that the shift reflects higher standards for
graduation in the United States because comparisons of adult
literacy rates in the study show Americans to be among the
industrialized world's least literate populations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the United States' expenditure per
pupil is still among the highest in the group at all levels of
education. It particularly stands out in the way it has brought the
private sector into college and university education, leading the
way in a growing international trend, according to Schleicher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the OECD, students in both public and private colleges
are being asked to pay more for their education,'' he said.
``Unlike in the United States, however, this spending has, in many
countries, supplemented rather than displaced public spending on
education.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the United States spends a great deal on education in
absolute terms, its expenditure is about average when examined as a
percentage of gross domestic product. Moreover, teacher pay viewed
through the same lens shows the United States to be among the
lowest, while demands on teacher time in class are among the
highest.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced high school teacher in the United States earns
1.2 times the gross domestic product per capita. Among the 29 OECD
member states, only the Czech Republic, Hungary and Norway pay
their high school teachers less when measured as a percentage of
their GDP's. In Germany, Ireland, South Korea and Switzerland,
among others, teachers earn twice or more of the GDP per capita.
Moreover, the average teacher salary in the United States is
significantly below that of other university graduates; in many
other countries, like Australia, France and Britain, it is above
it.
</P>
<P>
   However, the amount of time a typical middle school teacher in
the United States spends in front of a classroom per year is 964
hours, among the highest in the OECD, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report adds that Americans can not comfort themselves by
thinking that theirs is a society of social mobility and second
chances. It finds that children whose parents completed college are
more than three times as likely to become college graduates
themselves than children whose parents did not complete high
school. Moreover, the achievement gap between the children of the
well-off, well-educated and others is above the average for the 29
industrialized nations.

SURVEY FINDS ANTI-SEMITISM DECLINING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the close of the 20th century _ both the worst and
the best century, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
has observed _ Jews are both back in their historic homeland and
living basically unmolested in other countries where they freely
choose to be.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing this sentiment, the Anti-Defamation League in New
York City issued a fundamentally good-news study Monday showing how
much anti-Semitism has tumbled in this country. While synagogue
desecrations and other outrages still go on, the league reports
that fewer Americans embrace stereotypes about Jews _ such as that
they have too much power, they control Wall Street, they are more
loyal to Israel than to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 percent of the 999 adults surveyed qualified as
hard-core anti-Semites, compared with 20 percent in 1992 and 29
percent in 1964, years when similar questions were asked. (The
margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.)
The older and more poorly educated a person was, the more likely he
was to hate Jews.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 53 percent were judged to be not anti-Semitic,
compared with only 39 percent in 1992 and 31 percent in 1964. In
all three survey years, 35 percent or more landed in a ``middle
category,'' meaning they were not free of prejudice and could be
tipped the wrong way by hard times that bring out the conspiracy
theorists and scapegoat artists.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the report of interest to more than just Jews is the
direct line running between Jew-hatred and intolerance on all
levels. Far more than others, those in the ``most anti-Semitic''
category tended to consider immigrants a burden, to deem AIDS
divine retribution for sexual sinning and to want women back in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about anti-Semitism is that ``unfortunately it still
becomes the measuring rod of what is a healthy society,'' said
Abraham Foxman, the league's national director. ``It doesn't mean
that other groups aren't targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   The main cloud in an otherwise upbeat report hovered over
African-American attitudes. Blacks, too, were inclined as a group
to think better of Jews than years ago, but only somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, they were nearly four times as likely as whites _ 34
percent to 9 percent _ to fall into the ``most anti-Semitic'' camp,
a finding that Foxman called ``not only troubling, but also
painful.'' At the least, it suggests that anti-Jewish rants from
the likes of Louis Farrakhan, Leonard Jeffries Jr. and Khallid
Abdul Muhammad cannot be shrugged off as cries in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights
Coalition, said the situation may be more disturbing than the
numbers indicate. ``I myself find the level of anti-Semitism among
blacks, both at the grass roots and among the professions, to be so
pervasive as to be appalling, shocking and deafening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the
Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, cites figures from a separate
study commissioned by his group this year showing that 43 percent
of Jews and 54 percent of blacks believe that relations between the
two groups are improving. Both his report and the league's suggest
an improved climate, Schneier said, but ``theirs shows a slower
pace.''

NEW JERSEY DEALS WITH RESTLESS SPORTS FRANCHISES

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ For generations, New Jersey officials have
excelled at peddling their proximity to Manhattan, using the
promise of tax abatements, new buildings and ample parking to lure
New York businesses and sports franchises west of the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year New Jersey has bid aggressively, and
unsuccessfully, to bring the New York Stock Exchange to Jersey
City. Members of Gov. Christie Whitman's administration have
quietly tried to lure the New York Yankees to the Meadowlands
complex in East Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the consternation at the state Capitol when a group
of Newark investors set their sights this summer on a new trophy:
the Nets basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' new owners, headed by Raymond Chambers, a
philanthropist, want to move the team 14 miles south, from the
Meadowlands to Newark. They are lobbying the state to help spur
Newark's redevelopment efforts by building a downtown arena a few
blocks from the new New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' proposal is only one of many efforts by team owners
trying to obtain new, more lucrative stadium deals. A half-dozen
National Football League teams have moved into new quarters in
recent years, and last week the governor of Connecticut announced a
deal to build a $350 million stadium to lure the New England
Patriots to Hartford from Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' plan also comes at a time when the New Jersey Devils'
owner, John McMullen, is asking the state to build a hockey arena
in Hoboken, placing Mrs. Whitman in the position of scrambling to
placate existing franchises rather than wooing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact details of the plans will be determined
during months of negotiations, it seems certain that the Whitman
administration will be forced to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars to build a new stadium, new roads and rail connections or
all three. The Devils' owner says he is unhappy with the team's
present site, Continental Airlines Arena, because it isn't
accessible by train and has fewer luxury boxes than arenas housing
other National Hockey League franchises.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' new owners say they want to aid the rehabilitation of
downtown Newark and, in the words of the team president, Michael
Rowe, ``to be part of an urban community where we can make a real
difference with kids who live there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the MetroStars soccer team is contemplating leaving the
Meadowlands because its players prefer a natural grass field and
Giants Stadium is equipped with artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of the Nets' move raises troubling questions about
the future of the Meadowlands, a successful sports complex that
coaxed the Jets and Giants football teams out of New York City and
helped New Jersey land its own major league hockey, basketball and
soccer franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more fun to play offense than defense,'' said
Raymond Bateman, chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority, which operates the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the housing complaints of the Nets and the
Devils would not exist without the success of the Meadowlands.
Thirty years ago, the site was a desolate stretch of swamp; part
wetland, part garbage dump.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1970s, Gov. William Cahill saw the expanse of
vacant land, with its easy access to New York City, as a chance to
put the New Jersey into the entertainment world's big leagues, by
luring the Yankees to suburbia. When Mayor John Lindsay of New York
agreed to overhaul Yankee Stadium, the team decided to stay put. So
New Jersey officials convinced the Giants' owner, Wellington Mara,
whose team shared Yankee Stadium at the time, that he need not be a
second-class tenant, and the Meadowlands won its first franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 750-acre complex, complete with a racetrack, outdoor
stadium and indoor arena, is one of the busiest sports centers in
the nation, with revenues near $150 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But competition for sports franchises has become so fierce, and
the economics of stadium-building so convoluted, that a modern
arena doesn't necessarily placate franchise owners for long.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Arena, which opened in 1981, is mechanically sound,
has good sight lines and is considered a pleasant stadium by most
spectators. But McMullen, the Devils' owner, has complained for
years that it does not have enough luxury boxes and corporate
suites, which can generate huge profits. When the Devils made their
successful Stanley Cup run in 1995, McMullen seized the moment to
threaten a move to Tennessee, saying that the Meadowlands' luxury
box gap had made it impossible for the Devils to compete with teams
housed in newer centers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman gave McMullen $5 million a year in concessions and
persuaded him to sign a lease until the 2006-7 season. He has since
demanded that the state help pay for a new center, to be built over
an abandoned rail yard in Hoboken, a proposal many experts believe
is prohibitively expensive because it would require hundreds of
millions of dollars in road and rail improvements.
</P>
<P>
   State officials had hoped to persuade both the Devils and the
Nets to stay at the Meadowlands by upgrading the arena, and hired
an architectural firm this year to study the feasibility of
renovating or replacing Continental Arena at its current East
Rutherford site. The firm, which will release its preliminary
findings next month, is expected to recommend razing the building
and replacing it with a new 20,000-seat arena packed with luxury
boxes, restaurants, sports bars, movie theaters and a shopping
concourse, all surrounded with indoor parking ramps.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the Meadowlands proposal recommends, it cannot meet
one of the primary concerns of Chambers, the leader of the Nets'
new owners _ helping to revitalize Newark. A native of the city,
Chambers amassed a fortune orchestrating leveraged buyouts in the
early 1980s, then left the business world to devote himself to
charities aimed at rebuilding the troubled city. He has spent tens
of millions of dollars on redevelopment projects.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who owns 19 percent of the team, shuns publicity and
declined to be interviewed. But others familiar with his plans say
he envisions a new downtown arena as a cornerstone in Newark's
renaissance. State Sen. Richard J. Codey, who supports the project,
said, ``What I want to do is turn this into a public policy
issue,'' said Codey, the Senate minority leader. ``We've already
built the Meadowlands and turned that area of the state around. Why
not do the same thing for Newark?''

MUCKLER HAS HIS HEALTH AND HIS HOCKEY
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Muckler suspects that getting fired as general
manager of the Buffalo Sabres may have saved his life. This was in
1997, around the time he lost sight in his right eye during a
scouting trip to Regina, Saskatchewan. The vision returned after
about 10 seconds, so Muckler did not tell many people about the
episode. But after he lost his job, Muckler took his wife's advice
to get a routine eye test. When he told the doctor about the
temporary blindness, the doctor put his hand on a carotid artery in
Muckler's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to see a vascular surgeon,'' the doctor told Muckler.
The specialist found a 98 percent blockage in the major artery that
carries blood to the head. If untreated, the problem could have led
to a stroke. Muckler needed more than four hours of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I still had my job in Buffalo then, I probably wouldn't
have gone to the doctor,'' said Muckler, who replaced Colin
Campbell as the New York Rangers' coach last February. ``Without
that warning, I might not have been here.'' It's not that Muckler
fears death or regrets his life's journey through hockey. ``I enjoy
every day of it,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want to have it any other
way.'' Recently, he told his players: ``I believe in reincarnation.
If I come back again, I want to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 64, Muckler is the second-oldest coach in the National
Hockey League, six months younger than Detroit's Scotty Bowman, a
friend and neighbor who lives near him in Buffalo and who underwent
heart surgery last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler is tall with silver hair, a deep voice and a piercing
gaze behind thick glasses. Even his nickname, Muck, is part of the
hockey lexicon, such as ``muck for the puck'' and ``our team is
made up mostly of muckers and grinders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who are mucking through a rebuilding phase, take a
5-8-6 record into Wednesday night's game in Buffalo. Although the
record is among the worst in the NHL, Muckler seems to have the
respect and attention of his players as he tries to transform the
Rangers from the discouraged and dissolute group that missed the
Stanley Cup playoffs last season into a dedicated unit that is
hoping to qualify next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, this club has to be rebuilt,'' Muckler said.
``It's going to take time. It's going to be another challenge in my
career. I don't mind that.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly doesn't mind working them hard. Under Campbell, the
Rangers relaxed between games. Practices rarely exceeded one hour.
Veteran stars were often excused and, when they attended, sometimes
wore no helmets. The team flew home by charter after most road
games and there were many off days. Under Muckler, there are fewer
off days.
</P>
<P>
   Practices often last longer than 60 minutes and everyone
participates. After road games, he likes to keep the team out of
town overnight so the players can socialize together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coach has their own philosophy of how things are done,''
Muckler said. ``I'll be the last one to criticize anybody else for
what they've done. I just go along with what I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   The players say they have accepted his approach. Brian Leetch,
the captain and star defenseman, says Muckler repeats drills so
that players are prepared for tactical changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say, `We've got to do the drop-back breakout instead of
the wide guy,''' Leetch said. ``Instead of having to show it on the
board, it's in our heads. He loves teaching. He feels it's a
privilege to teach guys like ourselves. He also has a lot of
confidence in his own ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathieu Schneider, another veteran defenseman, says Muckler
``commands a lot of respect'' in part because he was with the
Edmonton Oilers during the Stanley Cup dynasty of the 1980's.
Muckler was listed as assistant, associate and then head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been tough on us for the first part of the year,''
Schneider said. ``At times, you get frustrated and you get upset at
him. But he commands respect. At practices, he demands perfection.
I think it is great. It rubs off and it shows in a game. If we play
hard and work hard and get some wins, it's going to make life
easier for us in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler also seems sensitive to specific personalities. Aleksei
Kovalev, who feuded with Campbell for four seasons, praises Muckler
and compares him to Mike Keenan, whose Rangers won the Stanley Cup
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells me lots of things to help me, we talk a lot, and I
appreciate it, he's a really nice coach,'' Kovalev said. Comparing
Muckler to Keenan, Kovalev said: ``They are both tough. Muck just
looks quieter. At the same time, he's a really tough coach. If he
is really mad, he can show you that he is really mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Manny Malhotra, a first-round draft choice, says Muckler has
explained his limited ice time by saying he wants to develop the
18-year-old rookie slowly and carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not one of those coaches who bark out commands at you
and make an example of you at practice,'' Malhotra said. ``He's
very good at talking to you as a person, one on one. His message
gets by a lot clearer that way. You know what he is thinking by the
tone of voice. He has that respect when he doesn't have to bark
out. You know when he is not in a great mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler started out in the 1950's in the Eastern Hockey League,
a stay-at-home defenseman in a ``Slap Shot'' circuit in which
players traveled by car, got $4 a day in meal money and earned
salaries of $100 or $150 a week. Muckler became a player-coach with
the New York Rovers on Long Island in 1959-60 and stayed with the
team, which became the Long Island Ducks. His first job with the
Rangers was in 1966-67, the last year of the old six-team N.H.L.,
when he was director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to be the coach of the New York Rangers,''
Muckler said. ``And now I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He coached the Minnesota North Stars during the 1968-69 season
and also many minor league teams before earning success first with
Edmonton and then as both coach and general manager with Buffalo.
Noting that his many roles have taken him through ``several
generations'' of athletes, he said that the high-salaried major
leaguers of the late 1990's are not much different from the poorly
paid minor leaguers he knew in his youth. Even the best ones,
Muckler said, respond to a demanding coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Muckler joined the Rangers, some wondered whether Neil
Smith, the general manager, had hired his eventual replacement.
Smith says he doesn't worry about that and praises Muckler for
``cultivating the right atmosphere'' and ``getting a work ethic in
place'' and ``creating a new attitude that was not there last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler says he works well with Smith because his own experience
in Buffalo's front office _ he lost a power struggle with Ted
Nolan, who was then the Sabres' coach _ taught him to be patient
and to understand the difficulties of player acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relate very well for the simple reason that, basically, we
think alike,'' Muckler said of his relationship with Smith. ``On
the majority of things, we agree.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith is 20 years younger than Muckler. More contemporary is
Bowman, a friend and rival. They don't socialize much during the
season, but Muckler and Bowman have been known to get together at
home in the off season. One occasion was in the summer of 1997,
right after Bowman won the first of his two championships with the
Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had parties in the backyard,'' Muckler recalled. ``Scotty
had a party in the morning and we had one in the afternoon. He had
the Stanley Cup at his party. He brought it over to our party, for
my daughter's graduation. I was very proud of the fact that I could
get a picture taken with Scotty Bowman and the Stanley Cup.
Scotty's won, what, eight? And I've been part of five. So there's
two guys standing there with the Stanley Cup who have represented
13 wins. I've got that picture up in my house. It was kind of neat,
I thought.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you think things are smoothly sailing along in the NBA
labor negotiations, along comes yet another snag.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's a proposed change in free-agent signings that
owners are insisting upon, a major change players are determined to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   The players are so set against the change that sources close to
the negotiations said a deal could have been worked out in Friday's
marathon 12-hour negotiating session between the NBA and the
National Basketball Players Association had the owners surrendered
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of preparing to play games, the two sides are preparing
for another bargaining session, tentatively set for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change is in Section 6 of the NBA's
collective-bargaining proposals, a part that deals with ``timing''
rules, or how teams approach their free-agent signings. The
proposal states that a team ``loses its Bird rights if it uses room
under the (salary) cap to sign another team's free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   This rule would force teams that sign another team's free agent
to give up the right to go over the salary cap to re-sign their own
Larry Bird exception free agents, which was the case in the past.
The Bird exception allows teams to exceed the salary cap to re-sign
their own free agents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the Rockets signed a free agent like Antonio
McDyess, they would then be prohibited from exceeding the salary
cap to re-sign Charles Barkley, Matt Maloney, Othella Harrington or
any other of their free agents who fall under their umbrella of
Bird-exception players.
</P>
<P>
   The players are staunchly opposed to such a rule and have
indicated they will not accept it under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deal-killer that has been buried in their proposal for
a long time, and they know we'd never do a deal that included it,''
said Jeffrey Kessler, the lead outside counsel for the union.
``They (the owners) said it's something they really wanted, but
it's a false issue. We'll never accept it, and we're not making any
concessions not to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ``timing rules'' change was opposed by most of the
100-plus players who took part in a union conference call Saturday.
Rather than holding formal discussions on such a rule change, many
players figured the clause would be simply deleted from future
proposals _ a concession by the owners to repay the players for
their concessions on items like a longer rookie scale, a luxury tax
to slow salary growth and a reduction in the percentage of salary
increases.
</P>
<P>
   But NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said such thinking is
misguided. ``I think it's things like that that may cause us to not
make a deal this season,'' Granik said. ``With each meeting we
have, there's some new issue that suddenly becomes the most
important thing for the players. I don't even know how to deal with
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been in our proposal from day one. We've mentioned it
many times. It hasn't been one of those where we've had a lot of
negotiations over up until Friday, but we've said many times that
it's been an important issue for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not according to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the timing-rule change) has been on their back sheet,''
said Orlando player representative Danny Schayes, who attended
Friday's negotiating session. ``Now, it's become a
`We-gotta-have-it' issue. It's a major problem.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ The headline, in huge block, wavy letters, almost
leaps off the page near the back of the 1998 Texas A&AMP;M football
media guide amid pictures of Houston's Andre Ware and Ty Detmer of
BYU.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Heisman Hex,'' it reads, appearing over a brief bit of prose
that describes how the famed Wrecking Crew has laid waste to
Heisman Trophy winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience tends to bring (a Heisman winner) down to earth
_ in a hard way,'' the story says.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M has faced five of the past 13 Heisman winners and has come
out on the winning end four times, including 3-0 in bowls.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in
Austin, they will collide with Texas tailback Ricky Williams, the
front-runner in the 1998 Heisman chase.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams this season _ Kansas State, owner of the No. 1
defense in the nation, and Oklahoma State _ have been able to put
the brakes on Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrecking Crew wants to become the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to play against Ricky Williams because everyone
recognizes him as being probably the greatest back in college
football this year,'' sophomore linebacker Roylin Bradley of La
Marque said Monday. ``I think it's going to make our defense play
better, want to shut him down, just keep him contained. I can't say
we're going to stop him. You don't stop a great running back like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams needs 63 yards to shoot past Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett
and become the NCAA's career rushing leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that it could go down in the record books that he
got it against Texas A&AMP;M,'' coach R.C. Slocum said, ``but the
reality is he didn't. He has gotten it because he's done what he's
done every week and he's done it for several years now. You don't
make those many yards against one team.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams probably is already penciled in to win on most of the
ballots that will be cast for the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   It's equally as predictable the Wrecking Crew is unlikely to
hold him to fewer than 63 yards. But poll members of the defense,
and their answer is unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Williams in check is imperative to extending A&AMP;M's
10-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, said senior All-America linebacker Dat Nguyen,
entails mixing a strong dose of eight- and nine-man fronts with
some of the blitzes that helped the defense earn its nickname in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   It's what Kansas State did Sept. 19 as Williams garnered a
season-low 43 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   And it's how Oklahoma State limited Williams to 90 yards rushing
Nov. 7 in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And a little bit of luck wouldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kansas State was in a lucky spot,'' said Nguyen, a
finalist for the Lombardi and Butkus awards. ``I think they stopped
Ricky Williams because the Longhorns had a redshirt freshman (Major
Applewhite) starting his first game at quarterback. I think he had
a lot of butterflies; he made a lot of mistakes early. That really
cost them; that really hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw an interception that went for a touchdown. I guess he
didn't get a lot of reps, as he's done now, since that was his
first start.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU kept Williams relatively quiet, though he scored on a
70-yard pass from Applewhite, who threw for a school-record 408
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma State gave him a run for the money,'' said Nguyen.
``They always play him well. But Ricky's a great back. He caught a
pass and ran 70 yards for a touchdown. They had a lot of big plays
then, too, throwing the ball. Overall, that's why they're doing so
well this year, because they rely on big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma State and K-State had some success against Ricky
because they could stack the line, since the quarterback was so
young. But now, he has been through a lot of reps. He's getting a
lot of confidence week in and week out. We just want to go out
there and give him some pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' successful run against Heisman winners began in 1986
at the Cotton Bowl. Auburn's Bo Jackson was stopped on
fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line twice in the fourth quarter
as A&AMP;M prevailed 36-16.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, again in the Cotton Bowl, the Aggies contained
Tim Brown in a 35-10 victory over Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Houston came to Kyle Field with Ware, who was setting
all kinds of NCAA records on the way to claiming the Heisman. But
the Wrecking Crew held him to his lowest production of the year in
a 17-13 A&AMP;M victory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Aggies punished Detmer, who separated both
shoulders in a 65-14 loss to A&AMP;M in the Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Only Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders (1988) has escaped the
Heisman Hex.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the target is Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky's fast,'' said Bradley. ``You don't want him to get
loose on the outside. We want to basically keep him on the inside.
If our defense is rolling to the outside, then we'll try and keep
him to the outside. If we have most of our contain on the inside,
we'll try to keep him on the inside. It's all in the basic scheme
of what (defensive coordinator Mike) Hankwitz has called.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Williams gain the 63 yards he needs?
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope not,'' said senior linebacker Warrick Holdman, the
Aggies' second-leading tackler this season. ``We're going to try
and stop him, but he's a good back. Sixty-three yards really ain't
nothing with the numbers he's put up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stop him, it'll be good. If we don't, I'll still be
happy for him because he's had a great career. If he gets it, best
of luck to him.''

   NEW YORK _ In the political scrum set off by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan when he announced earlier this month that he would not
seek re-election in 2000, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was an obvious
choice for the seat. It was once held by his father, he is one of
the most visible environmental lawyers in the state, and his last
name is Kennedy. But Kennedy, 44, said almost immediately that he
would not run because he wanted to see his five children grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Kennedy made it clear that his decision was ``for this
time around,'' pointed out that ``the governor's seat is up in four
years'' and added that ``if I wanted to run for something, there's
always something to run for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the third child and second son of Robert F. Kennedy,
said he made his decision about the Senate seat after talking to
Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate who lost in the
Democratic primary this year, and Rep. Charles Schumer, who
defeated Sen. Alfonse D'Amato on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark and Chuck said you're really talking about a
three-and-a-half-year commitment when you don't see your family,''
he said. ``Chuck said he saw his family one day a week _ Saturday _
but not Saturday night.'' (Schumer said Monday that in the last six
months of his campaign, he worked seven days a week.) Kennedy added
that the same week he talked to Schumer, ``I had a baby turn 1, and
I was left with the vision of not seeing him again until he was
4{.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, he added, urging his brother-in-law, Housing Secretary
Andrew Cuomo, to run for the Senate. (Cuomo is married to Kennedy's
sister, Kerry.) Would he ever run against him? ``That would not
happen in a billion years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that his arrest for heroin possession in 1983 and
former drug addiction was not a factor in his decision: ``It's out
there,'' he said, shrugging. ``I have a thick skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer concurred with that view Monday, although he said there
would have been negative advertising about Kennedy's past. ``But
it's so long ago, and he has been such a productive citizen, I
think it wouldn't have mattered,'' he said. ``I think the public
has a certain bottom-line wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy talked in a conference room at Pace University in White
Plains, where he is co-director of the Pace Environmental
Litigation Clinic, which prosecutes polluters. When the subject was
Kennedy's work on the 1997 watershed agreement between New York
City and upstate communities, or his beloved Hudson River (he
water-skis in its bays and watches sea horses when he scuba dives
in its creeks), he was full of enthusiasm. When the conversation
turned to his family, he jiggled his leg and withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was 14 in 1968 when his father, the former U.S. attorney
general and Democratic Presidential candidate, was assassinated in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home someone told me Daddy had been shot,'' he recounted in
``The Riverkeepers,'' a 1997 semiautobiographical book, which he
wrote with John Cronin, about their battles to clean up the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy flew with the other Kennedy children to see their dying
father in Los Angeles. ``Each of us spent time with him that night,
holding his hand, praying, saying good-bye, listening to the pumps
that kept him breathing,'' Kennedy wrote. ``In the morning, my
brother Joe came into the ward where all the children were sleeping
and told us, `He's gone.' We all cried.''
</P>
<P>
   In the succeeding years, Kennedy fought his much publicized
demons, and it was in fact community service work required after
his heroin arrest that brought him to the Hudson River Foundation
in Putnam County, where he volunteered for 800 hours. Today he is a
senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council and a chief
prosecuting attorney for the Hudson Riverkeeper, Inc., a nonprofit
group, which patrols the Hudson and brings lawsuits against
polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was an architect of the 1997 watershed deal that is
intended to protect the city's water supply _ in large part by
shielding its 19 upstate reservoirs from pollution _ but now he
says that the city's Department of Environmental Protection is not
enforcing the deal. ``There is no leadership at the agency,''
Kennedy said, adding that ``the Giuliani administration's heart is
just not in this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy lives with his second wife, Mary Richardson, and their
three young children in Bedford, N.Y., on 10 acres bordering a
30-acre lake. (He has two older children from a first marriage.) He
keeps a pair of Harris hawks _ falconry is a pastime _ and
water-skis with his children on the Hudson in the summer. Every
Memorial Day, he camps out with friends and family on a tiny Hudson
River island near Rhinebeck and remains as always a Kennedy: Two
years ago, people recall how he left the island to take his son to
the hospital for a fishing-knife cut and returned at the brink of
darkness _ on water skis. It was a grand entrance: He skied right
up the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Kennedy was asked what his father would think of how his
life has turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I feel like my father's still part of my life,'' he said
quietly. ``I feel like he's still helping me when I have trouble or
when I'm trying to make a decision. He's very much a presence in my
life.''

3-D AIDS BAND'S MIDDLE-AGED PYROTECHNICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perched on a chair at the Continental Airlines Arena in East
Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday night, a small boy in a black fright
wig and silver makeup watched the fireworks. His companion,
probably his father, excitedly snapped photographs of the four
living wonders onstage: the bassist dressed as a dragon, the singer
with the star painted over his eye, the spaceman guitarist and the
feline drummer. The boy just stood quietly, taking it all in. This
must have been his first Kiss concert, his initiation into the
fellowship of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   As the rock 'n' roll equivalent of Disney, Kiss consciously
links the genre's excesses to children's entertainment, safely
subsuming rock 'n' roll decadence into spectacle. The camaraderie
of music making turns the band into a League of Superheroes whose
unleashed primal desires render them cartoonishly powerful. They
become ``exiles from the human race,'' as Paul Stanley sang in the
title song from the new album, ``Psycho Circus'' (Mercury), which
is also the title of this tour. (The show goes to Nassau Coliseum
on Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   The bassist, Gene Simmons, means his monster persona to reflect
his enthusiastic promiscuousness, but as he flew around the arena
in a wire harness he seemed no more sexually threatening than a
plastic Godzilla. Ace Frehley's otherworldly image originally
invoked drug use, but when the computer-generated rendering of a
guitar spacecraft loomed behind him during his longest solo, this
now sober guitarist seemed more like an alien on the space opera
``Babylon Five'' than a stoned Jimi Hendrix acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley may be as vain as his preening implies, but he turned
egotism into a carnival act as he swung on a silver trapeze and
soared to a small center stage to sing ``Love Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   This tour's new trick for sensationalizing rock's
transgressiveness involves 3-D movies, which cause images to appear
to be zooming toward a viewer wearing special glasses, given out at
the door. A 3-D camera followed band members around onstage and
prefabricated videos created the effect of Simmons drooling fake
blood on fans or of the drummer, Peter Criss, poking them with his
sticks. 3-D is ideal for Kiss, since it is both technically
impressive and totally corny, evoking cheap 1950s shocker films. It
literalizes the cliche that rock 'n' roll is music that gets ``in
your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyrotechnics also made up for a lack of musical complexity.
``Any band can play a song perfectly,'' said Stanley. ``We live
dangerously!'' In fact, the contrast between elaborate theatrics
and extremely raw music is the key to Kiss' appeal. Songs like ``I
Want to Rock-and-Roll All Nite (And Party Every Day)'' are
basically punk anthems, as stripped-down and direct as anything by
the Ramones. By dressing up this simple music in glitter, Kiss
forged a link between rock's glamorous aspirations and its
democratic urges.
</P>
<P>
   This formula, temporarily abandoned when Frehley and Criss left
during the 1980s, is proving foolproof again now that rock 'n' roll
has reached its difficult middle age. As players and fans try to
figure out what made this music so strong in the first place, the
comic book epic of Kiss provides one easy answer. People sometimes
like to play at being larger than life; it frees them from the
complications of mere humanity. Kiss still takes that innocent wish
in outrageous directions.

STEINBRENNER SEEKS FREE-AGENT MONEY TO STAY AS YANKEES' BOSS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bargaining like a free-agent ballplayer after setting
a home run record, George Steinbrenner is negotiating a lucrative
contract to run the New York Yankees after he sells a majority
stake in the team to Cablevision, three of his business associates
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the proposed management contract, he would
receive at least $5 million a year and a signing bonus, one
associate said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a director with Cablevision and an executive with
the Yankee organization, both of whom spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the team would probably stay in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which would leave Steinbrenner in control of the
team and would include performance bonuses every time the Yankees
reach the playoffs and the World Series, could be worth as much as
$100 million over 10 years, said one associate of Steinbrenner, who
like the other associates spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking for Mike Piazza money,'' the associate said. He
was referring to the New York Mets outfielder who recently signed a
7-year, $91 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's contract has emerged as an important issue in the
continuing negotiations to sell more than two-thirds of the Yankees
to Cablevision, the giant media company that owns Madison Square
Garden, the Rangers and the Knicks, the business associates said.
But they expected the sale to be completed early next year and said
it could also put Steinbrenner in charge of the Knicks and the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Steinbrenner, Howard Rubenstein, said Monday
that talks with Cablevision were continuing, but he declined to
comment on the details.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision, whose 12-year, $486 million deal to broadcast
Yankee games on MSG Network expires in 2000, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring the Yankees, Charles F. Dolan, chairman of
Cablevision, would gain a virtual monopoly on sports programming in
the region and insure that a rival could not outbid him for the
cable television rights. The company would own three of the city's
most prominent teams and control the cable telecasts for seven
teams: the Yankees, Mets, Knicks, Nets, Rangers, Islanders and
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The sale may ultimately resolve the controversy, which has hung
over the city for more than a decade, over a future home for the
Yankees, . Steinbrenner has not been shy about his antipathy for
the Yankees' historic home in the Bronx, and he has suggested that
the team could move to New Jersey or to a billion-dollar stadium in
Manhattan when the team's lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2003.
The threats to leave the state may end, said a director of
Cablevision, adding that the company ``would be sensitive to what
New York wants.''
</P>
<P>
   An executive with the Yankee organization said that the team
would probably remain in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city's Economic Development Corporation agreed to
provide $3 million for a ``feasibility and design study'' for the
Yankees that would examine the possibility of renovating the
stadium in the Bronx and building a new stadium in either the Bronx
or Manhattan.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ You may have heard of John Hanhauser, Matt Carroll, John
Palusi, Tom Brzoza and George Messich.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most likely you have not, but Tony Dorsett definitely has.
</P>
<P>
   Ten, 20 years from now, the names Jay Humphrey, Ben Adams,
Russell Gaskamp, Octavious Bishop and Roger Roesler may be
unfamiliar as well.
</P>
<P>
   But as with the aforementioned offensive linemen, the running
back who broke records running behind them will surely remember who
they are.
</P>
<P>
   In the record book, Dorsett is listed alone atop the NCAA
Division I-A career rushing chart with 6,082 yards. But Hanhauser
and Co. have the satisfaction of knowing they had a lot to do with
the accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   With Ricky Williams just 63 yards from breaking Dorsett's
22-year-old mark, Texas' offensive linemen are spending a lot of
time talking about being a part of history as the Longhorns (7-3)
prepare for Friday's clash with No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M (10-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not many things that you can carry with you all your
life, and not many people have a chance to be in a moment of
greatness,'' said Adams, a senior guard. ``A moment of greatness
could be anything, but for an offensive lineman, a moment of
greatness is to maybe have a 350-yard rushing day, or pass block
for 10 seconds (without allowing a sack).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky has a chance to have a moment of greatness this week.
Twenty, 40, 60 years down the line, you can tell your kids that you
were there and you contributed to that moment of greatness. That's
what makes it so important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns have not been bashful in verbalizing their desire
to see Williams finish his career with the most yards of any
running back in the history of college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all they talk about,'' Williams said. ``I'm happy for
them that they feel like they're a part of it, too. And they really
have been more of it than I have been. I'm sure that they can be
proud of themselves for a very long time and say that they helped
me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the linemen do not want Williams to merely get the record;
they want to see him do it with room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of our main goals going into this game,'' said
Humphrey, who has started three years at tackle. ``We want to get
Ricky as many yards as we possibly can. We don't want to just break
the record; we'd like to shatter it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky would be the first one to tell you that he couldn't have
done it without us.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will call on the line to help him deliver the record
against one of the toughest run defenses in the country in the
Aggies' Wrecking Crew.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams is averaging more than 186 yards a game (1,865
yards on 317 carries), A&AMP;M gives up just 104.8 rushing yards per
game (13th in the country).
</P>
<P>
   But only once this season has Williams been held below the magic
number of 63. Kansas State's attacking defense, which leads the Big
12 Conference and is seventh in the nation against the run, limited
the senior from San Diego to 43 yards on 25 carries.
</P>
<P>
   But that was more than two months ago in just the Longhorns'
third game under first-year head coach Mack Brown and in new
offensive coordinator Greg Davis' system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot better,'' Brown said. ``We were so bad in parts of
the UCLA game and parts of Kansas State. I know they're both really
good, (but) we're a lot better. I would like for our offense to get
a chance to play K-State again.
</P>
<P>
   `` They're really good, but we've played as well offensively as
anybody in the country all year.''
</P>
<P>
   With Williams leading the nation in rushing, the Longhorns are
21st in the country in rushing offense. With Major Applewhite
setting a school freshman passing record, Texas is 19th in the
nation in passing. The team is 10th overall in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   But to the offensive line, the next 63 yards of rushing offense
with the ball in the hands of No. 34 will carry with it more
meaning than all of the 4,694 yards Texas has racked up this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fully aware of every yard,'' Brown said. ``In fact,
they're fully aware if there was a penalty and he lost some yards,
and they had the penalty. I mean they talk about it probably too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that those young guys are obsessed with
helping Ricky get that record.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will not guarantee that he will break the mark _ not
officially, anyway _ but he has come close.
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of weeks as Williams has gotten closer to the
record, the Longhorns have been flooded with questions revolving
around what is more important _ winning the game or breaking the
record.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite scenario is, what would Texas do if Williams were
three yards from setting the mark, with little time left on the
clock and the Longhorns needing a touchdown from the 10-yard line
to win?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd throw it into the end zone,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   What if in that same situation, there was a run or pass option,
and the defense was lined up to where the pass was the right call?
``I'd check off (to the pass play) in a heartbeat,'' Applewhite
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had the best answer of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to be that close if I only have 60
yards,'' he said.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ Ernie Mills, who became the Dallas Cowboys' No. 2 receiver
after being released by the Carolina Panthers, underwent surgery
Monday to repair a perforated small intestine. He will miss the
rest of the regular season but could be healed in time for the
playoffs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cowboys, 8-3 and leaders of the NFC East, have been
afflicted by injuries throughout this season, but Sunday's game
against the Seattle Seahawks was one of the costliest.
</P>
<P>
   Right guard Everett McIver, who missed seven games after surgery
on his right knee, returned Sunday and promptly tore ligaments in
his left knee. He's out for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Thus concludes a singularly miserable season for McIver, who was
slashed by teammate Michael Irvin in the training-camp caper that
became known as ``Scissorgate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with him today, and he was pretty upset,'' coach Chan
Gailey said. ``He worked hard to get back from a knee injury, and
then the other knee goes. There's no justice for that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Listed as questionable for Thursday's game against the Minnesota
Vikings are All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders (sprained big toe),
running backs Emmitt Smith (sprained right ankle) and Chris Warren
(strained groin) and offensive tackle Erik Williams (sprained left
knee).
</P>
<P>
   Although the designation ``questionable'' indicates 50-50
probability, speculation at the team's training camp at Valley
Ranch was that Sanders, Smith and Williams all will start. How long
they can stay on the field is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders did not practice Monday and was unavailable for comment,
but Jerry Jones, the team's owner/general manager, said, ``I'm sure
he thinks he's going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred Nov. 15, and Jones said, ``It's improved a
lot since then. The swelling is gone; the discoloration is gone. He
aggravated it Sunday, but it was not a setback. He didn't have
additional damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders played against Seattle with a metal reinforcement in his
left shoe. In order to minimize the chance of someone stepping on
his foot, he did not return punts.
</P>
<P>
   But he left Sunday's game in the second quarter after hurting
his foot while making a tackle. Sanders' availability is especially
critical this week, because the Vikings have the most explosive
passing game in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys beat Seattle 30-22 but have little time to heal
before facing a team that's 10-1 and has three of the game's finest
receivers: Randy Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cowboys sounded confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have three great, tall receivers and a great running back
(Robert Smith), but we're going to accept the challenge,'' safety
Darren Woodson said. ``If Deion is out there, it makes it easier,
but if not we can still win.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman said, ``We're not stepchildren trying to
prove we belong. We're accustomed to playing on Thanksgiving Day,
and we don't have to travel. That helps us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was all but shrugging off the casualties, saying, ``Every
team's got injuries. That's part of being in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has proved adept at plugging holes, beginning with Aikman
going out in the second game with a broken collarbone. Now, Aikman
is back, playing as well as ever. But maintaining a supporting cast
for him has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, 30, leads the team with four touchdown catches. Even
though Billy Davis has been starting ahead of him, Mills is second
to Irvin with 28 receptions for 479 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was hospitalized after he was upended by cornerback Fred
Thomas while catching a pass in the second quarter of Sunday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his intestines apparently was pushed into the spine,''
Jones said. ``He was in extreme pain last night. It was determined
this morning that he needed surgery. He's expected to recover in
four to five weeks. So we're hopeful he'll be back for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have some depth at wideout, with Irvin and Davis
backed by Patrick Jeffers and Jeff Ogden, who combined for six
catches for 66 yards Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries to Sanders, Warren and Kevin Mathis (broken
forearm), Ogden and Davis will return kickoffs, with Ogden and
cornerback Kevin Smith catching punts.
</P>
<P>
   Is Gailey concerned about starters Davis and Kevin Smith being
hurt on kick returns?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about that,'' he said. ``It could happen, but
you can get hurt anywhere on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are proof of that this season.

SOX' OFFER TO WILLIAMS BELIEVED TO BE FOR $80M 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox have offered free agent outfielder Bernie
Williams a long-term deal for more money and more years than they
offered Mo Vaughn, which could be the impetus for Williams to say
goodbye to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox offered Vaughn a five-year deal for $63 million,
which was rejected by their first baseman, who still has not
accepted a deal from the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday night whether the Red Sox' offer to
Williams was for six or seven years, though his agent, Scott Boras,
repeatedly has said that his client is holding out for a seven-year
offer. Boston's offer to Williams is believed to be in the
neighborhood of $80 million, a figure that could grow if a seventh
year is guaranteed in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the middle of something, I can't talk right now,''
Boras said by telephone Monday night from Atlanta, where he and
Williams met for a second day with Red Sox general manager Dan
Duquette, who was joined Monday by manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Yankees are unwilling to offer the
outfielder a seven-year contract. There is no one on their roster
signed for that duration.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, on the other hand, already have demonstrated their
willingness to reward players with seven-year deals. Last winter,
Pedro Martinez signed a six-year, $75 million deal with a club
option for a seventh year worth $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra signed a five-year,
$22.5 million deal that has two option years, both held by the
club, for at least $10.5 million in 2003 and $11.5 million in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, according to league sources, the Red Sox weighed in
with their long-term proposal for Williams, the defending American
League batting champion and Gold Glove outfielder who just turned
30 in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels remain the only team known to have made an offer to
Vaughn. Vaughn's agent, Tom Reich, was in meetings all day with
Angels GM Bill Bavasi, according to sources, and it was believed
that they were tying up the ``loose ends'' alluded to by Vaughn
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's original offer to Vaughn was for six years and $72
million, though there were indications that with performance
bonuses and incentive clauses, the deal could be worth close to $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees officials, meanwhile, held meetings in Tampa Monday with
owner George Steinbrenner to plot their course of action. One
option was eliminated Monday when free agent outfielder Brian
Jordan, who could have played center field for New York if Williams
left, signed a four-year, $50 million deal with the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also was pursued by the Baltimore Orioles, who could jump
in the Williams hunt and already have spoken with Boras. The
Orioles, who saw free agent second baseman Roberto Alomar sign with
the Indians Monday, are expected to retain free agent first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro, who had talked with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   According to one source, the Yankees made another offer Monday _
believed to be four years in the $50 million range _ to free agent
left fielder Albert Belle, who appears to be the Red Sox' fallback
option if they are unable to sign Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Another Williams suitor is Arizona, though the Diamondbacks' top
priority appears to be free agent pitcher Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox made a couple of roster moves Monday. They
outrighted catcher Mandy Romero, and released Billy Ashley, who
briefly served as DH, and righthanded pitcher Rich Garces, spelling
the end of ``El Guapo's'' time with Boston.

JORDAN CHOOSES THE BRAVES OVER THE METS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As expected, Brian Jordan wound up signing with the
Atlanta Braves, agreeing Monday to what is believed to be a
five-year, $40 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Before the former St. Louis Cardinal outfielder agreed to terms
with Atlanta _ where he has a home and where he once played
professional football _ the New York Mets also made Jordan a
five-year offer, believed to be worth about $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did so shortly after meeting with Jordan last Thursday,
and after Jordan's agent, Jim Turner, announced that his client was
looking for a five-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   By signing with the Braves, Jordan, who will be 32 in March,
also passed up the chance to go back to Baltimore, where he grew
up. The Yankees had also been viewed as a suitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling that's the way things were going,'' Mets
General Manager Steve Phillips said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One day after the Braves opened a spot in right field for Jordan
by trading Michael Tucker to Cincinnati along with pitcher Denny
Neagle for second baseman Bret Boone, General Manager John
Schuerholz said he was extremely eager to sign Jordan as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who is coming off the best season of his career, posted
career highs in batting average (.316), home runs (25) and games
played (150) and also had 91 runs batted in and 17 steals.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets increased their offer to the free-agent third baseman
Robin Ventura Monday, two days after tendering Ventura an initial
offer believed to be for four years at less than $7 million a
season. The new offer made by Phillips is believed to be for four
years at $7 million a season _ the same average amount the Mets
offered Jordan. Ventura, however, is looking for $8 million a
season _ the same amount Jordan received.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's agent, John Boggs, said Monday that he has already
received one other offer. Boston, Cleveland, Seattle, St. Louis and
San Diego appear to be the other teams interested. To justify what
he is asking for, Boggs pointed to the market _ and not just
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of third basemen, Arizona's Matt Williams will make $9
million next season. Detroit just signed Dean Palmer to a
five-year, $36 million deal. And Jose Offerman, an
infielder/outfielder, signed a four-year, $26 million contract with
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have re-signed two of their own players to huge
contracts: Mike Piazza for $91 million over the next seven years
and Al Leiter for $32 million over the next four years. Their
payroll is in excess of $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly $6 million of that figure could be erased when the
Mets trade Todd Hundley. The Mets' talks with the Dodgers and with
the Orioles apparently intensified as the Indians, who agreed to
terms with Roberto Alomar Monday, are believed to have dropped out
of the running for Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' co-owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, are
believed to have approved a $65 million budget for Phillips to work
with. And now with Jordan out of the running, Phillips must decide
whether signing Ventura or outfielder B.J. Surhoff is his biggest
priority. Both are left-handed batters who could hit behind the
right-handed-batting Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, who is believed to be seeking a guaranteed four-year
deal worth around $19.5 million, met with the Pirates in Pittsburgh
Monday. The Mets will probably not contact Surhoff's
representatives again until Tuesday. But even if they do amend
their current offer of three years with an option _ totaling $17.25
million if the option is picked up _ it is doubtful the Mets will
guarantee the fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Surhoff will re-sign with the
Orioles, if they come up with an offer comparable to that of the
Mets or the Pirates. The Orioles have lost out on Jordan and
pitcher Todd Stottlemyre. Alomar has left them, and Rafael Palmeiro
might, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles may try hard to sign Surhoff, which may mean the
Mets will be leaning toward Ventura, especially considering that
Milwaukee is believed to have shied away from accepting the
right-hander Octavio Dotel in a proposed deal for second baseman
Fernando Vina.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers would apparently like a pitcher they know is ready
for the major leagues; Dotel has yet to pitch in the majors. And so
the Mets could sign Ventura, move Edgardo Alfonzo to second and
then try to trade for a corner outfielder who could also bat
leadoff.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FOR three months now, as this surprising season has pushed steadily
upward like a fire-ant hill, he has been the poster boy for the
supposed gap between what the Cowboys are and once were.
</P>
<P>
   For two weekends now, as the current winning streak has climbed
to four in a row, he has been the man between the cross hairs as
the clock ran down, all scoped out and ready to be blasted if he
didn't come through.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Smith is still standing, and with the Thanksgiving Day
clash with the Vikings warming in the oven, he likely holds the key
to the season-long mystery of just how far Dallas can go in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago in the waning seconds in the Arizona desert, Smith
snuffed out the comeback hopes of Jake Plummer and the Cardinals
when he denied Rob Moore a chance to catch the tying touchdown pass
in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Did he commit pass interference on the play by face-guarding
Moore and never looking back for the ball? Maybe. But the referees
never threw a flag, and the Cowboys survived on a day when their
thin secondary could have come unraveled like a White House alibi.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago as the clock ticked down to the 2{-minute mark and
Warren Moon had the Seahawks driving for what could have been
another TD that could have forced overtime, Smith was there again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it wasn't a dramatic last-gasp pass into the end
zone. This time, there was no controversy over whether it should
have been a penalty. But again this time, Smith made the play by
reaching in with his right hand to swat away Moon's
fourth-and-three pass to Joey Galloway and seal another Cowboys
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't know where we'd be without him,'' said Dallas
defensive coordinator Dave Campo. ``I know he's taken a lot of
shots this season from fans and from critics. But I haven't lost
faith in Kevin's ability to play. We have needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Never have the Cowboys needed Smith more than now, with
Minnesota rookie sensation Randy Moss coming into Texas Stadium as
Deion Sanders hobbles around on a sore big toe.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders limped off the field in the second quarter against
Seattle and never returned, which has to make you wonder how ready
he can be in short week to take up his usual position on the right
corner.
</P>
<P>
   If Deion can't answer the bell or leaves early, it will again
mean Charlie Williams and maybe Kenny Wheaton see significant time
in the secondary against the Vikings' potent receiving corps of
Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of padding their record with victories over the
flotsam and jetsam that their schedule has had to offer, the
Cowboys finally get a real test. This is when we find out if that's
a real 8-3 and whether that bold talk of even securing home-field
advantage all through the playoffs is anything more than fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, this would appear to be a mismatch as lopsided as the
turkey vs. the carving knife, and yet just the fact that the
Cowboys have been able to keep things together the past two games
in Deion's absence might hold promise.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's second-half strafing gave the Deion-less secondary a
baptism of fire in what was to come, and against Seattle, Smith and
his cohorts seemed to gain confidence. They limited Moon to a
non-fatal 10-for-19 passing for 116 yards in the second half and
made the plays that were needed.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line has been asserting itself as Leon Lett
appears back to his old ways. The offense has been functioning
smoothly as Troy Aikman looks as comfortable in coach Chan Gailey's
timing-pass offense as a man in a recliner. Aikman is currently
playing at his best level in three seasons. Putting points on the
board and controlling the ball is certainly the very best defense
against Randall Cunningham's throw-it-up, quick-strike attack for
the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The glaring weakness of late has been in the area of penalties.
Dallas was flagged for an assortment of 15 on Sunday for 129 yards,
which included everything from false starts to holding to even a
call against Chris Warren for bumping into a referee on the
sidelines. It will be tough enough to beat the 10-1 Vikings without
helping them.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that better than Kevin Smith, who has played the
season with a bull's eye on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about Deion's status,'' said Campo. ``I can't
guess whether he will be able to play. But I know this about Kevin:
He'll show up.''
</P>
<P>
   As victim or victor, deciding so much about how far this season
is going.

COMMENTARY: Faith in Stocks 
 (ms) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street panicked this summer, but Main Street doubted the
sky was really going to fall. So far, at least, those who kept
their heads _ or at least their stocks _ have done better than
those who sold.
</P>
<P>
   Indexes of big American stocks, including the Dow Jones
industrials and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, set records Monday.
Smaller stocks and junk bonds are showing new life.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? Wall Street analysts list a number of causes.
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times, reassuring
investors that it was determined to avoid a recession. Corporate
takeovers are back in vogue, Brazil was bailed out, and the
election assured that President Clinton would keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Such explanations have validity, but they miss the most
important part of the story. Individual investors were never as
fearful as Wall Street that Asia's woes would affect this country's
economy. Russia's default on its debt came as a shock to
professional investors, as did the collapse of John Meriwether's
hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management. But back on Main Street,
investors generally couldn't buy hedge funds _ Long-Term Capital
required a minimum investment of $10 million _ and had not invested
in Russia either. To be sure, mutual funds that invest primarily in
American stocks suffered withdrawals of $6.6 billion in August, but
all of that money and more came back in September. The initial
public offering business is again strong, and speculation in
Internet stocks is hotter than ever.
</P>
<P>
   All this reflects the widespread belief that stocks are now, and
always will be, the best long-term investment. The spread of that
gospel has had important effects on how the stock market relates to
the economy. Back when most investors thought that stocks could
fall as well as rise, and deemed it important to try to anticipate
those moves, the stock market usually began to fall months before a
recession began. But in 1990, the plunge in prices began in the
same month as the recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is quite possible that the stock market will peak not
before, or even simultaneous with, the economy. Instead, stocks may
keep rising until evidence of a real recession is clear not just to
those who follow economic statistics but to all those people on
Main Street who have so far shown such faith in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, perhaps, we will see if the faith can endure a bear
market. Such a market is not indicated by a fall of 20 percent or
any other arbitrary amount, but by continued declines, quarter
after quarter, in stock prices. By that measure, the last bear
market ended in 1982, long before most current investors took their
first plunge into stocks.
