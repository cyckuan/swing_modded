<HEADLINE> FIBA Agrees to Free Player Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUNICH, December 2 (Xinhua) -- World basketball governing body
FIBA, which has previously restricted European club teams to two
non-European players, has agreed in principle to the free
movement of players worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement announced in Munich, Germany, on Wednesday
by FIBA, basketball players will be free to join any club team in
the world without restriction.
</P>
<P>
"What it means is a team like Real Madrid could field 10
Americans if they wanted,'' FIBA spokesman Florian Wanninger
said. "It puts us in line with the NBA, which has no limit of any
kind on foreign players."
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of FIBA's 20-member central board voted in favor of
the change, which could be in force next season. Details are
expected to be ironed out at a FIBA meeting in May in Barcelona,
Spain.
</P>
<P>
FIBA has also proposed the change to end the practice of
non-EU players seeking EU passports in order to be counted as a
national player instead of a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
The increasing practice has set off disputes between national
basketball federations.
</P>
<P>
At this year's World Championship in Athens, 2.12-meter Dragan
Tarlac, a Yugoslav with a Greek passport who plays with Greek
club Olympiakos, declined to play for Yugoslavia's national team
for fear of a legal battle.

<HEADLINE> Russia Unable to Make Lump Sum Debt Repayments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia is unable to repay all
its debts to the people at once due to the flagging consumer
market, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The state cannot pay off all its debts at one time. Such a
move will cause the collapse of the commodities system," the
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Maslyukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said "the ministries of economy and finance must decide
on the problem of mutual debts between enterprises in the coming
days."
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov called for a tax reform, noting that it is essential
for guaranteeing the interests of Russian citizens, not
corporations or oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the restoration of Russia's money
supply depended on "normalization of companies' current assets,
the arrangement of a normal investment process, and restoration of
the real estate sector."
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov stressed that the current top priority is to
normalize the investment process by imposing strict controls over
the destination of the money, which will help to restore
companies' current assets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Report Breakthrough in Transgenic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers announce
breakthrough in transgenic animal technology, said the latest
issue of Proceedings of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Work performed by former University of Wisconsin-Madison dairy
science professor Robert Bremel and his colleagues has resulted in
increasing in the efficiency of the production of transgenic
livestock.
</P>
<P>
Dairy livestock are seen as key players in the production of
genetically engineered protein drugs such as monoclonal
antibodies, hormones, vaccine proteins and enzymes. Introducing
new genes into the animal allows them to produce specific
pharmaceutical proteins in their milk, from where it can be
extracted as a drug component. Cost of producing proteins by this
route are far lower than more traditional pharmaceutical
production methods.
</P>
<P>
The new method of gene introduction developed by the
researchers inserts a gene into the unfertilized oocyte or egg,
which stably incorporates the gene into the maternal germline.
Once the egg is fertilized, all cells of the resulting embryo
carry the new gene, and the calf is born with the capability to
secrete a new protein in milk. Subsequent generations, offspring
of each founder animal, will also carry the desired gene.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the new method, the older and less efficient
production methods made transgenic livestock very costly. Cloning
and pronuclear microinjection typically lead to only 1 percent of
animals born carrying the new gene.

<HEADLINE> African Coffee Producers Urged to Raise Domestic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Secretary of State for
Coffee Gilberto Buta Lutucuta Wednesday called upon the African
coffee producing countries to act immediately to increase their
domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Luanda here, Lutucuta noted that
the supply of coffee is more than the demand in the international
market and the prices for coffee are dipping.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan coffee official pointed out that the domestic
demands in coffee producing countries are less than 10 percent of
their production.
</P>
<P>
The African coffee producing countries agreed late last month
that they should take steps immediately to raise their domestic
demands for coffee in a bid to change the unfavorable situation
on the world market, said Lutucuta.
</P>
<P>
He added that besides increasing the output of coffee, the
African producers should also improve the quality of the cocoa
beans they export.
</P>
<P>
From May to September this year, Lutucuta said, the coffee
prices had been on decrease in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, one kilogram of Robusto coffee is sold at 1.6 U.S.
Dollars while the Arabica coffee sold at 3.2 Dollars per
kilogram, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most of the cocoa bean exports have quality problems
and some even carry such viruses as trachiamicose, ochratoxine
and mofo.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state also disclosed that the output of
coffee for 1998/99 in Angola is expected to top 10,000 tons. But
he pointed out that Angola may harvest only 5,000 tons of coffee
due to domestic conflicts and the abnormal climate.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Leather Exporters Urged to Meet World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Leather and Leather
Products Technology Institute of Ethiopia is urged Wednesday to
play an important role in assisting national efforts to bolster
the supply to the world market of leather and leather products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the call was made here
by an Ethiopian leather products exporter, Teshome Kebede, in an
interview with the national news agency.
</P>
<P>
Teshome said that Ethiopia has not been able to supply the
world market with leather and leather products in the required
quality and quantity.
</P>
<P>
"Although Ethiopia is rich in skin resources," Teshome said,
"lack of modern and well-equipped pickling and tanning factories
have thwarted efforts of the nation to be a leading competitor in
the international leather market."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has the largest livestock population in Africa,
including 33 million head of cattle, 23 million sheep and 13
million goats.
</P>
<P>
The total world exports of hides and skins amounted to 4.59
billion U.S. Dollars in 1994, but Ethiopia's share remains small
at 57 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A majority of hides and skins are wasted as a result of
quality loss due to obsolete equipment and unskilled practices.
</P>
<P>
Teshome said that two types of Ethiopian skins, Bati goat skin
and Selale sheep skin, are famous for their quality in the
international market.

BONN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany and the Baltic states -
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - will sign an accord this month,
canceling the Requirement for Baltic nationals to get travel
visas, a Bonn foreign ministry spokesman said Wednesday.

<P>
Nationals from the three countries will no longer need a visa
to visit Germany from March 1, 1999 under an agreement which will

</P>
<P>
Baltic nationals will make free travel to much of Europe under
the Schengen Accord, because Germany has scrapped border controls
with nine of the European Union (EU)'s 15 member states.
</P>
<P>
The nine states, which are members of the Schengen bloc, are:
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Greece is a Schengen member, too, but border controls have not
been lifted between Greece and other Schengen states. Denmark,

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) will set
for the first time air quality limit values for benzene and carbon
monoxide gases, according to an EU-proposed directive adopted
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main goals of the directive are to protect the public from
health damage and enhance the life quality of the citizens in the
15 member states of the organization, especially in the crowded
towns and cities, said the EU commission, the executive body of EU.
</P>
<P>
The proposal set limit values for benzene at 5 micrograms per
cubic meter, which should be met on January 1, 2010, and limit
values for carbon monoxide at 10 micrograms per cubic meter, which
is to be met on January 1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these targets, the commission said, emissions of
benzene, the first carcinogen subject to an air quality limit
value, must drop by nearly 70 percent in addition to reductions
already planned. The peak level of carbon monoxide must also drop
by up to a third.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the proposal is just part of an action program
launched within the framework of its Directive on Ambient Air
Quality Assessment and Management.
</P>
<P>
Proposals for tackling other pollutants including other
carcinogens will follow, said the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> WTO to Elect Future Director-General by Mid-December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will elect their future director-general by
mid-December at the latest, said WTO sources here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They failed to meet the previous deadline by the end of
November to form a consensus on choosing one of the four
candidates: Morocco's Hassan Abuyoub, Canada's Roy MacLaren, New
Zealand's Mike Moore and Thailand's Supachai Panitchpakdi.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero of Italy has
said that he will not run for the position again when his term
expires next April.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the consultations should aim to make
it possible for WTO members to elect the new chief by consensus.
The content of the consultations was to be secret, in particular
the positions and views expressed by the representatives of the
members.
</P>
<P>
A large majority of the members hold that recourse to a vote,
whether a straw ballot or a final election vote, must be ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, two rounds of secret consultations have taken place.
The first round between late October and early November was
attended by 46 heads of delegations, representing more than 65 WTO
members. They discussed mainly the nature and modalities of the
selection process for the next director-general. But none of them
met with any of the four delegates during the first round.
</P>
<P>
At the second round on November 24-26, 70 heads of delegations,
representing 90 members, informed the meeting of their
authorities' appreciation of each one of the four candidates and
the reasons for their preferences.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a certain number of the 132 delegations
have not yet been able to inform the WTO of their authorities'
position on the four candidates.

<HEADLINE> French-British Summit to Focus on Cooperation in Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair will focus their talks on
bilateral cooperation in defense and security during their summit
to be held Thursday and Friday in Saint Malo, western France.
</P>
<P>
A French foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday that
Paris and London will start dialogue on defense cooperation and
thus contributing to building European capacities and means of
action in defense and security.
</P>
<P>
Britain changed its stand last month by agreeing to discuss
with France, Germany and some European countries the construction
of a European defense. But London insists that all military
operations by European countries should be conducted under the
auspices of the NATO.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that France wishes that European Union (EU)
assume control of political and strategical operations of a future
European defense force, including collaborations with the NATO.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany and Italy agree that the 28-member Western
European Union (WEU), which is the only European forum of defense,
should be integrated into the EU.
</P>
<P>
While agreeing to join the process of building a European
defense ``without being diverted by institutional obstacles,''
London says that the WEU should hand over its political role to
EU, and its military role to NATO.
</P>
<P>
British defense secretary George Robertson and foreign
secretary Robin Cook are meeting their French counterparts Alain
Richard and Hubert Vedrine in Paris to prepare for the summit.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to focus their talks on the future of the WEU
and increasing exchange of information between the two foreign
ministries and their missions around the world.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the British government said on Wednesday that
Britain and France will sign an agreement on cooperation in crisis
prevention operations such as that in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They will also agree to increase cooperation in Africa by
arranging joint visits by government ministers of the two
countries to African countries, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain have military cooperation agreements in
army, navy and air force and nuclear fields.

majority, a Zimbabwean minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Land Acquisition Committee Joseph Msika, who

At independence from Britain in 1980, he said, 6,000 farmers,
mainly white, owned 45 percent of the most fertile land while
communal areas with 700,000 farming households occupied less than
50 percent of the agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question from a workshop participant, Msika
ruled out taxing people to raise money for acquiring farms for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zimbabweans would not accept to be taxed to raise
money for buying the more than 1,400 farms designated for
acquisition by the government last November because the land was
forcibly taken away from them by the colonial regime.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Lands and Agriculture had prepared and served
acquisition orders for 841 farms, including those offered to the
government, in fulfillment of a legal requirement, said Msika.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Meeting to Focus on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Wednesday started its seventh
ministerial council meeting in Oslo, capital of Norway.
</P>
<P>
OSCE chief and Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek and
high-ranking officials from the 54 member nations including 40
foreign ministers are attending in the two-day meeting, which is
expected to focus on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne
Bondevik defended the OSCE, which has been criticized for being
slow in organizing the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM).
</P>
<P>
Bondevik said, "We must not forget that the KVM is by far the
biggest and most complex field operation in the OSCE's history."
</P>
<P>
Although the OSCE is playing an important role in solving the
Kosovo crisis, a final settlement can only be brought about
through international cooperation and the coordination between the
United Nations, the OSCE, NATO and the six-nation Contact Group is
of utmost importance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Geremek said the peacekeeping operations were the biggest
single challenge for the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis demonstrates that small-scale internal armed
confrontation is the most probable conflicts to affect European
security, Geremek said.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE is sending a group of 2,000 observers to monitor a
U.S-brokered truce signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
in October.
</P>
<P>
About 400 OSCE observers have so far been deployed in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, with the rest due by the end of January.

<HEADLINE> Germany Stresses Jobs During German EU Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- German government stressed
Wednesday that job creation would be the cornerstone of Germany's
1999 European Union (EU) presidency.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is more employment in Europe...," said spokesman of
the German government Uwe-Karsten Heye after a meeting of the
cabinet in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
But Heye did not give any details about what sort of new
measures EU planned to fight joblessness.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders have pledged the battle against joblessness as a top
priority at every one of their semi-annual summits since Essen in
1994.
</P>
<P>
There has been little progress and joblessness in the 15-
nation bloc remains at 10 per cent or about 18 million. Among the
11 euro-members unemployment is almost 11 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Like France, German government wants the EU to set binding job
creation targets for members.
</P>
<P>
Heye said German government's other top priority was reforming
the EU's budget, farm subsidy spending and aid policies - the
so-called Agenda 2000 package. The government hoped these reforms
could be agreed by a special EU summit in Germany next March, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer will visit all E.U. capitals
from December 13 to 18 to outline Bonn's presidency plans.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
will have talks in Bonn Friday on the upcoming December 11-12
Vienna summit which marks conclusion of Austria's E.U. presidency.
</P>
<P>
Germany will hold the rotating EU presidency from January 1 to
June 30 next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New-home Sales Continue Growth in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide new-home
sales went up a modest 0.8 percent in October for the second
consecutive month, continuing at a record-setting pace for all of
1998, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 851,000, up from a revised 844,000 the month before,
according to the department. Previously, September sales had been
reported at an 822,000 rate.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates and strong U.S. economic growth amidst the
world financial chaos are fueling the busiest year for new-home
sales since the department started tracking the data in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Sales are running 8.7 percent ahead of last year's pace, when
804,000 were sold and should easily surpass the record 819,000
sold in 1977.
</P>
<P>
October marked the 14th consecutive month of sales above an
800,000-unit rate, a record. It also marked the 22nd month in a
row that the supply of unsold homes has been less than needed to
meet demand for five months at the current sales rate, which is
also a record.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, all of October's gain came in the West, where sales
jumped 11.2 percent to a rate of 248,000. Sale declined 11 percent
in the Northeast to a rate of 65,000, 5.4 percent in the Midwest
to 157,000 and 0.3 percent to 381,000 in the South.
</P>
<P>
In September, sales fell in the West, picked up in the Midwest
and South and held steady in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home was 150,000 U.S. dollars in
October, up 6 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Angola Agrees to Extension of U.N. Observers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Angola said here Wednesday it
has agreed to further extension of the United Nations observers
mission to February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Higini Carneiro, deputy head of the government delegation in
Joint Commission for the Angolan Peace Process made the remarks
after talks with delegates of the United Nations and the observer
countries of the United States, Russia and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Carneiro pointed out that his government will stick to its
stance in regard to UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi at the U.N.
Security Council meeting in New York Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government insists that President Savimbi of the
opposite National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
has lost his status as the dialogist in the peace process and the
breakaway UNITA Renovation Commission is the sole lawful
dialogist.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government official admitted that the military
situation in this southern African country is "very tense."
Therefore, he said, the government has demanded that the U.N.
should impose more strict sanctions upon the armed UNITA,
especially in te field of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
As to the 15 U.N. military observers detained by the UNITA,
Carneiro said that his government has not got any new information
about them.
</P>
<P>
On November 11, the UNITA troops prevented the U.N. personnel
from evacuating Bailundo in central Huambo Province and Andulo in
Bie Province on the ground that they had to "repair" runways at
the airports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UNITA held them hostage as shields
against attacks from the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Ambassador to Luanda Ramalho Ortigao said that the
peace process observers are deeply worried over the incident and
will make their stance clear.
</P>
<P>
On June 30 last year, the U.N. Security Council decided to
send observers to Angola to supervise over the implementation of
the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol which ended the 19-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to extend the observers' term by
six weeks as it expired on October 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the council is holding a meeting in New York to
discuss whether to further extend the term of the observers or
not.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Bans Fishing in N. Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The government has decided to
ban fishing in northern province of Cabo Delgado, Mozambican
Health Minister Aurelio Zilhao said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said more than 100 people died after eating
polluted fish and 1,400 others got ill as recorded by the health
department since September this year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many people felt sick after eating the
fish polluted by insecticides.
</P>
<P>
According to Zilhao, the chemical analysis of the fishery
products and flour of maize and sorghum shows that the food
contained residuals of insecticides.
</P>
<P>
Besides a 45-day ban of fishing in the province, the
government also decided to "strictly control" the storage and
sale of the insecticides and to set up an inter-ministry team to
probe the incident on the spot and work out a plan to take hold
of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The government will also sensitize local population on
hygiene, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zilhao noted that what his government must do is to make sure
that no one will die any more.
</P>
<P>
Fish is the staple food for local residents and also the main
currency earner.
</P>
<P>
The health minister disclosed that the Mozambican National
Commission for Emergency is considering delivering alternative
food to the residents in the affected areas.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Hit by Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) - The economic slowdown has begun
to affect the housing market in Britain with prices falling 0.6
percent in November, according to the latest survey from the
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Nationwide Building Society earlier this week
showed the same underlying picture of a downturn in the property
market.
</P>
<P>
It is a big turnaround from October when prices grew 1.3
percent. On annual basis, November's figures show property prices
rising by 4.9 percent - a marked slowdown on the 6.7 percent
annual inflation reported in October.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax survey provides a gloomy picture of the current
state of the housing market that prices had fallen for the first
time in three years.
</P>
<P>
However, the UK's largest mortgage provider believes that the
housing market is not heading for a crash.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the bank said it was difficult to gauge too
much from just one month's figures - a clearer picture of the
housing market emerged from looking at house prices over a
three-month period.
</P>
<P>
Prices in the three months to November were 1.2 percent higher
than in the preceding three months - a similar increase to that
recorded for the three months to September and October.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "It is our view that house prices are
likely to rise less steeply in 1999 than this year, as the
expected sharp fall in economic growth is reflected in weaker
demand for housing."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief May Visit Libya Over Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is likely to visit the Libyan capital of Tripoli for
talks with the Libyan authorities on the 10-year-old Lockerbie
issue, a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, told a press
conference that "there is some possibility" for Annan to pay the
visit in order to discuss with Tripoli on the surrender of two
suspects in Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is in Tunisia Wednesday for a two-day visit, most
likely make a trip to Libya over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in contact with the authorities of Tripoli and it may
happen that I go there on a visit after visiting Tunis," Annan
told a press conference in Algiers at the end of his tour in
Algeria in a bid to break a deadlock on a U.N.-sponsored peace
process in the Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in the U.N. headquarters in New York said that Annan
would seek permission of a U.N. Security Council sanctions
committee, which envoys said would be granted immediately.
</P>
<P>
But members of the Libya sanctions committee said they had not
yet received a request through its chairman, Slovenian Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Danilo Turk. Libya has been
under a U.N. air embargo since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Libya has agreed to put the two suspects, namely Abdel Basset
Ali Mohammed al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, on trial in the
Netherlands before a Scottish court. But Tripoli has objected to
British and U.S. demands that they, if convicted, serve their
sentence in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans have been accused by the United States and
Britain of planting a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 103 which exploded
over the Scottish village of Lockerbie nearly 10 year ago, killing
270 people.

MOSCOW, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, Wednesday adopted a resolution requiring a
statement on President Boris Yeltsin's health, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed by a vote of 247 versus 33 with no
abstentions insisted that the Kremlin submit a medical report on
Yeltsin to both houses of parliament within 10 days and ordered
parliamentary committees to ask the Constitutional Court whether
the president may be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
The document was supported by the Communist faction, the
Agrarian faction, the People's Power faction and some of the
members of the Russian Regions group, while Our Home Is Russia,
Yabloko and the Liberal-Democratic Party were against.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrat Alexei Mitrofanov, who lead the Duma
Geopolitical committee, said the resolution could produce a
situation where decisions by doctors determine Russia's politics.
</P>
<P>
Boris Misnik of Yabloko said his party opposed the anti-Yeltsin
move "for pragmatic, legal and moral reasons."
</P>
<P>
Today is the eleventh day for the Russian president to have a
treatment in the Central Clinical Hospital. Yeltsin was taken to
the hospital with pneumonia on November 22, when his temperature
rose to 38.9 degrees Centigrade.

ATHENS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday accused
neighboring Turkey of interfering in its domestic affairs after
statements made by senior Turkish officials on the issue of the
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said at a press
briefing that Greece did not allow any third party to interfere in
its domestic affairs. "The governments of Greece and Cyprus are
handling the missile issue responsibly in accordance with their
own needs," he added.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its defense, Cyprus had earlier last year decided
to purchase the missiles from Russia. Currently, the two
governments of Greece and Cyprus are discussing the location of
the missile deployment with no final decision has been taken.
</P>
<P>
To avoid being dragged into hostilities with Turkey, Greece
proposes that the missiles should be installed in the southern
Greek island of Crete, but Cyprus insists that the missiles will
be deployed on the island republic as planned.
</P>

Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem opposed the idea of the
deployment of the missiles in Crete as an alternative to Cyprus,
saying in Paris recently that Crete belonged to the same
geographical region and he believed that this kind of talks was
not serious.

Reppas urged Turkey to be more like Greece with respect to its
achievements on the economic front, the operation of democratic
institutions and respect for individual rights.

<HEADLINE> Report of Congo (K) Rebels' Using Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has strongly refuted an
allegation by a member of parliament that rebels in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) use Ugandan passports in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Wednesday, Minister of Internal
Affairs Tom Butime said Ugandan passports are issued after a
rigorous vetting process to ensure that applicants are genuine
Ugandans with no criminal records.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as malicious propaganda allegations by MP Aggrey
Awori who claimed that he met DRC rebels in possession of Ugandan
passports in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Butime said Awori's allegations were purely sensational and
meant to tarnish the image of the government because he could not
give the names and passport numbers of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Citizenship matters cannot be merely judged by physical
appearance, color and language spoken, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said even if the report were true, Awori, as a

illegal possession of Ugandan passports to Interpol or relevant

Tuesday, sparking associations of Uganda's close relationship

<HEADLINE> AL Denies Support for U.S. Proposal over Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid Wednesday denied a report that the AL
supports a U.S.-proposed venue for trying two Libyans accused of
the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid, on a visit to Lebanon, told Egypt's Middle East
News Agency that he was astonished by the report, reiterating AL's
support for Libya's position on the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Arabic-language Al Hayat newspaper said on
Wednesday that the AL supports a proposal that the two Libyans be
tried in a U.S. military base in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The league sides with Libya over its demand for a guarantee
that its two citizens get a fair trial in a neutral country and
not be handed over to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have accused the two Libyans of blowing up
the Pan Am 103 flight over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, which
killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
For years, Washington and London insisted on trying them
either in the U.S. or Scotland. Fearing that the two will not get
a fair trial in either place, Libya called for a neutral venue.
</P>
<P>
A compromise has been reached in July between the two sides
that the two Libyans will be tried by Scottish judges under
Scottish law in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
But Libya, meanwhile, has demanded guarantees that the two
suspects will not be extradited to the U.S. and wants them to be
imprisoned in Libya if convicted.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Freezes $36m Loan to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has suspended the
disbursement of a 36 million U.S. Dollar loan to a water project
in Sierra Leone, a report reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The loan was approved in 1996 to help state-owned Guma Valley
Water Company expand water supply in the capital Freetown, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank official in Sierra Leone said Wednesday that it
was agreed that the Sierra Leonean government would install water
meters to ensure the loan is repaid with money generated from
water sales.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said the government has not installed
any meters, hence forcing the bank to suspend the loan until they
are installed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Seirra Lonean company officials, the bank has
only disbursed seven million dollars of the loan total so far and
that only a fifth of the project has been done.

<P>
KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has strongly refuted an
allegation by a member of parliament that rebels in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) use Ugandan passports in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Wednesday, Minister of Internal
Affairs Tom Butime said Ugandan passports are issued after a
rigorous vetting process to ensure that applicants are genuine
Ugandans with no criminal records.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as malicious propaganda allegations by MP Aggrey
Awori who claimed that he met DRC rebels in possession of Ugandan
passports in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Butime said Awori's allegations were purely sensational and
meant to tarnish the image of the government because he could not
give the names and passport numbers of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Citizenship matters cannot be merely judged by physical
appearance, color and language spoken, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said even if the report were true, Awori, as a
prominent and responsible citizen, should have reported cases of
illegal possession of Ugandan passports to Interpol or relevant
authorities for prosecution instead of making such irresponsible

KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- An east African community
organization for better management of Lake Victoria resources was
formed Wednesday in Uganda's second largest city of Jinja, 80 km
east of the capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, formed at the first meeting of the east African
non-governmental organization forum for the lake management, is
to foster proper management of the lake resources and it will
operate through the various shareholders at the community level
in the three countries, namely Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, the
Uganda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Its formation follows the deteriorating environmental
conditions of the lake basin which have led to growing concern in
the region and the international community at large.
</P>
<P>
The report said the situation in the basin affects both the
land-based and lake-based sources of livelihood, so it requires
concerted efforts from all the three governments and the
community organizations in the region.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 organizations in the region were represented at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The participants also decided to establish a task force to
deal with water hyacinth management and promote resource
utilization.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Never Allows Anyone to Dictate Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will never allow anyone
to dictate its defense policy, said Cypriot government spokesman
Christos Stylianides on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem,
the spokesman said "we do not have masters dictating to us the way
we should deal with issues concerning our defense."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Cem said that Turkey objected to a possible
deployment of the Russian S-300 missiles, which Cyprus has
ordered, on the Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "if they make such a mistake, there will be
serious repercussions."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles in a bid to boost its defense
capability.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other western countries have criticized Cyprus
for signing the deal, and Turkey has threatened to launch
pre-emptive military strikes if the missiles are deployed on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus welcomes any initiative within the framework of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mission of good offices in
Cyprus aimed at the demilitarization of the island, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Cypriot government joins in the shuttle talks
undertaken by U.N. resident representative in Cyprus Ann Hercus,
which are within this framework.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was recognized only
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal formula, but no results have been
achieved.

ALGIERS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual met here Tuesday with visiting U.N. Secretary General Kofi

The meeting was focused on the Western Sahara issue, the Middle
East problem and the reform of the United Nations Security
Council, Annan said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Algerian National Assembly speaker Bashir Bu-Mazzat also held
talks with the U.N. chief Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the West Sahara issue, Bu-Mazzat expressed the
hope that Annan's visit would help implement the U.N. resolutions
to defuse the crisis which disturbs the stability and development
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Polisario Front, which proclaimed statehood in West Sahara
after the Spanish pullout of the region in 1976, has waged a war
against Morocco over the right to vote among residents of the
state in a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian issue, he urged the U.N. to play its role
in realizing peace for the benefit of the people in the region.
</P>

Annan, who arrived in Algeria on November 29, also met with
Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf, Speaker of the National

The incident began when about 150 students from the Bir Zeit
University, north of Ramallah, were sent to the center of
Ramallah by bus to protest what they called Israeli violation of
Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Organized by various political factions, the students staged a
march seeking the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
jails, then walked to a traffic circle, north of Ramallah, and
began stoning Israeli cars.

KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has donated 32
vehicles to Uganda's Lake Victoria Environment Management Project
to facilitate its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles were handed over to Henry Kajura, the Ugandan
Minister of Water, Land and Environment, by the World Bank
Representative Randolph Harri here Wednesday, the Uganda News

</P>
<P>
The provision of vehicles, together with equipment and labs,

protection of Lake Victoria and its catchment areas in the three
east African countries-- Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.

<P>
At the handover ceremony, the bank official said the
sustainable management of the lake as an important natural
economic resource for the region was the reason behind the bank's
funding for the project.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the bank's hope that the end result of
implementing the project will be eradication of poverty in the
catchment area of the lake on which over 20 million people are
dependent for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
The minister thanked the World Bank for its start-up support
for the project and asked the project managers to make good use
of the vehicles which go to 10 components of the project.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Europe to Speed Return of Jewish Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States asked
European countries Wednesday to return to Jewish groups the
synagogues, schools, cemeteries, community centers and artifacts
that were plundered by the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"Governments improperly took this property from the rightful
owners without compensation," Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of
state, told an international conference.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference on Holocaust-era assets, Eizenstat
said, "Now it is our common responsibility to ensure that,
finally, justice is done."
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said communal property, from religious land,
buildings, artifacts and documents such as the Torah was "one of
the early targets of the Nazi regime" of wartime Germany.
</P>
<P>
Private property also was stolen, and although the conference
didn't address it, Eizenstat urged European nations to "make a
start" in settling private claims through return or restitution.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat cited obstacles across Europe, including slow-moving
governments, legal problems at the local level and the question of
making restitution to current owners.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, which ends Thursday, involves 44
countries, the Vatican and more than a dozen groups, including
those representing Jewish, art, history and insurance interests.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the U.S. State Department and the
Holocaust Museum in Washington, is aimed at setting informal
standards for returning looted art and propertys.
</P>
<P>
The Nazis looted an estimated 150,000 pieces of art from
Western Europe during the war and some 500,000 pieces from Eastern
and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Lauder, chairman of the board of the Museum of Modern
Art and an official with the World Jewish Congress, estimated
110,000 pieces of art worth 10 billion to 30 billion U.S. dollars
are still missing and said virtually every large museum,
institution and private collection contains some.
</P>
<P>
A review of 225 museum catalogs over the Summer by his group
found 1,700 looted pieces of art, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lauder called on governments and museums to return the art or
auction it to help Jewish groups and Holocaust survivors and their
families.

CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Iraq are expected to
sign next week a memorandum of understanding on bilateral
cooperation, an official of Egypt's Trade and Supply Ministry said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Egypt's

</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili will

Speaking at a three-day national workshop on poverty
eradication and environmental conservation being chaired by
President Benjamin Mkapa, Lowassa said SELF is intended to
integrate and strengthen micro-finance institutions providing
soft loans, including non governmental organizations (NGOs),
credit and savings schemes and the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Wednesday, Lowassa said SELF will
start operating in the middle of next month and provide loans to
groups, individuals, small-scale farmers and jobless youths in
towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
At present, 50 percent of Tanzanians are living on poverty
line, said Lowassa, who challenged responsible ministries, towns
and district councils to create conducive environment for private
investors to create employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said sectors like public works programs could be
implemented by employing villagers in their respective areas so
that they could expand financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Lowassa also said the Vice-President's Office has started
preparing poverty monitoring indicators which would determine the
extent of poverty in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
The move will also help the government know whether its various
poverty eradication programs have been successful or not, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lowassa told the workshop with the presence of the entire
national leadership that the government has so far dished out 300
billion Shillings (about 444 million U.S. Dollars) to various
development funds in a bid to fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, opened by founder of the nation Julius Nyerere,
is being attended by Zanzibar President Salmin Amour, Tanzanian
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma, all ministers and their deputies,
regional and district commissioners and local authorities
functionaries.
</P>
<P>
It is jointly sponsored by the government, Danish embassy,
United States Agency for International Development (USAID),
United Nations Development Program and BP (T) Limited.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Never Allows Anyone to Dictate Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will never allow anyone
to dictate its defense policy, said Cypriot government spokesman
Christos Stylianides on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem,
the spokesman said "we do not have masters dictating to us the way
we should deal with issues concerning our defense."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Cem said that Turkey objected to a possible
deployment of the Russian S-300 missiles, which Cyprus has
ordered, on the Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "if they make such a mistake, there will be
serious repercussions."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles in a bid to boost its defense
capability.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other western countries have criticized Cyprus
for signing the deal, and Turkey has threatened to launch
pre-emptive military strikes if the missiles are deployed on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus welcomes any initiative within the framework of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mission of good offices in
Cyprus aimed at the demilitarization of the island, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Cypriot government joins in the shuttle talks
undertaken by U.N. resident representative in Cyprus Ann Hercus,
which are within this framework.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was recognized only
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal formula, but no results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> UK Promises Libya Access if Lockerbie Bombers Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom promised
Wednesday that Libya could station an unrestricted consular to the
two Libyans who are suspected of being responsible for the
Lockerbie bombing, if they were jailed in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The UK government, which is seeking to persuade Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi to hand over the two suspects, made the promise
several days earlier.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman told journalists Wednesday that the
promise had been relayed through U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who is expected to visit Libya this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said London would not move on the principle that
the men had to serve their sentences in Scotland but could make
some compromise in response to Libyan questions.
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet what Gaddafi's response would be.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused by both the United States and the
UK of planting a bomb aboard a Pan American airliner on December
21, 1988. The plane exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie
and killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, London and Washington agreed that the two
could be tried in the Hague of the Netherlands, but by Scottish
judges. Libya has agreed to this plan in principle.
</P>
<P>
But Libyan leader Gaddafi said Sunday that the UK and the U.S.
were still trying to impose unacceptable conditions and were
refusing to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
The UK spokesman said that if the two were found guilty, they
must serve their sentence in Scotland, but Libya could be allowed
to keep consular officials in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
They would have special access to prison to ensure that the men
were treated properly under arrangements which could be made under
U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed an air and arms
embargo on Libya in 1992, and expanded it in 1993 to include a
freeze on some Libyan assets abroad and a ban on some oil
equipment.

<HEADLINE> Israel Threatens to Stop Troop Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Wednesday
threatened to suspend the implementation of the Wye peace accord
signed with the Palestinians in Washington in October after an
Israeli solider was attacked in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that if the
Palestinian side could not control the violence against Israelis
in the territories, the Israeli side will stop implementing the
Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
This was the strong reaction from the Israeli side towards the
incident in which an Israeli solider was attacked by Palestinian
demonstrators in Ramallah Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said there will be no further Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank until the Palestinian side meets
certain Israeli demands, including publicly announces that it
will not declare an independent Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinian university students attacked the Israeli
soldier, Assaf Miara, in Ramallah and then torched the car he was
riding on.
</P>
<P>
Captured by cameras, this incident was shown over and over
again on Israeli televisions, making some wonder whether the
Palestinian security apparatus was trying to control violence in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The incident began when about 150 students from the Bir Zeit
University, north of Ramallah, were sent to the center of
Ramallah by bus to protest what they called Israeli violation of
Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Organized by various political factions, the students staged a
march seeking the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
jails, then walked to a traffic circle, north of Ramallah, and
began stoning Israeli cars.
</P>
<P>
Miara was badly beaten by the students and hospitalized for
head injuries.

<HEADLINE> Botswanan President Denies Division Within SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President
Festus Mogae Wednesday denied that the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo was causing division within the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
But the Botswanan president admitted the trading block was
distracted from its goal of economic development.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, SADC is less focused than it normally is,
but this is a short-term phenomenon. I'm sure it will recover
its focus before long," Mogae was quoted by South African Press
Association as saying at a regional trade and investment summit
in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said there was no bitterness between SADC leaders, who
all endorsed Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola's efforts to stop the
overthrow of DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
He said the region could ill-afford the instability which
would result if the DRC government was overthrown every year.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said the Botswanan army's role in suppressing a military
coup in Lesotho was almost at an end.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to leave very soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that conflicts in some African countries should not
distract investors from taking advantage of opportunities in the
region, which as a whole remained healthy.

<HEADLINE> Human Brain Signal System Has Root in Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at New York
University have discovered that a biochemical signaling system
has its roots in the plant kingdom, where it started millions of
years ago as a lowly regulator of photosynthesis and other
botanical processes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists previously thought this biochemical signaling system
was unique to human and animal brains.
</P>
<P>
They said that this discovery suggests that many plant
compounds such as nicotine, caffeine and cocaine have a big
impact on the human brain not because they were developed by
plants as biological weapons against plant-eating animals, as
researchers had thought, but because plants need the chemicals
for their own purposes.
</P>
<P>
According to a science report by the Washington Post, the
researchers found that mustard family plants have a gene for
making glutamate receptors--molecular structures that respond to
the amino acid glutamate. The glutamate system is crucial to
brain cell communication, but this is the first evidence that
it's present in plants, where it appears to regulate
light-sensitive reactions.
</P>
<P>
They said that their research suggests that the glutamate
receptor and other similar signaling systems, which were first
described in animal brains, are actually ancestral methods of
simple cell-to-cell communication, common to plants and similar
alike.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Accused of Withholding Nazi-era Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Vatican was accused
Wednesday of refusing to fully open its World War II archives at
an international conference on Holocaust-era assets here.
</P>
<P>
Lord Janner, chairman of Britain's Holocaust Educational Trust,
said the Vatican's lack of cooperation raised fresh suspicions
about its wartime collaboration with Hitler's Nazis.
</P>
<P>
"If the Vatican has nothing to hide, they should open it
(archives) up," he told reporters, adding that he did not believe
Pope John Paul II was aware of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Janner also named 11 companies that he alleged had used slave
labor from Nazi concentration camps and said the data, based on a
new study, reflected a new focus with broad international
implications requiring compensation of survivors.
</P>
<P>
Janner said his group repeatedly asked the Vatican for
information but received no satisfactory reply.
</P>
<P>
"We need to know the truth and there is no reason why one of
the greatest moral centers in the world cannot find that truth,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
This was needed so that the truth could be a matter of
historical record, and so that -- where appropriate and possible
-- restitution could be made to the survivors, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do know that many monasteries saved many thousands of
Jewish lives. We also know that others cooperated," Janner said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the slave labor issue, Janner said, "This is a
massive new investigation with huge implications all over the
world, including the United States."
</P>
<P>
The following companies, most of them German, were among those
to have used slave labor from Nazi camps in the following
pursuits: AEG (electronics); BMW (aircraft engines); Daimler-Benz
(aircraft engines); Dresdner Bank (construction); Dynamit Nobel
(explosives); I.G. Farben (synthetic fuel); and Ford (trucks),
according to Janner.
</P>
<P>
Janner said the trust just completed a report on the issue of
Nazi slave labor which found that about a million Jews died as a
result of slave labor. There were 7.7 million non-Jewish slave
laborers under Nazi control in late 1944, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that these companies which are today run in a moral
and decent way by honorable people will wish to make appropriate
amends. There may be legal implications of a massive kind --
claims made against them -- but equally there is a huge moral
obligation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, which ends Thursday, involves 44
countries and 13 groups, including those representing Jewish, art,
history and insurance interests.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the U.S. State Department and the
Holocaust Museum in Washington, is aimed at setting informal
standards for returning looted art and property and on paying off
old insurance policies taken out by Jewish families.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation offered a set of principles to encourage
cutting red tape at all levels and to agree that both religious
and secular property should be returned so that "delay and
obfuscation" don't "simply run the clock out" on elderly Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Nazis looted an estimated 150,000 pieces of art from
Western Europe during the war and some 500,000 pieces from Eastern
and Central Europe.

<HEADLINE> Blair Arrives at Belfast to Push Forward Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair arrived in Northern Ireland Wednesday afternoon to seek a
breakthrough in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He arrived at the provincial capital Belfast amid heightened
speculation that an announcement of substantial progress was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was anxious to resolve the impasse in
Northern Ireland's politics, brought about by arguments over the
balance of new bodies established in the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
It was Tony Blair's 10th trip to the province this year and
second one in just two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Blair met the province's Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon
and will also have discussions with First Minister David Trimble
and representatives from Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
During the prime minister's questions Wednesday afternoon,
Blair came under pressure from former Northern Ireland Office
minister Michael Mates for not insisting on decommissioning as a
pre-condition to other moves.
</P>
<P>
Blair told the Commons, "I understand the concerns of people
who see those that have committed appalling murders being released
on license -- not being given an amnesty but being released on
license.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is important that we are to make sure that all the
elements of the agreement are adhered to, including
decommissioning, and that we hold to our part of the bargain."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams also hinted at the likelihood
of a breakthrough emerging from Blair's latest visit.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We welcome the fact that Tony Blair is coming. It
took the same concentrated focus in the run-up to the agreement."
</P>
<P>
"It will be progress, but progress on the terms of the unionist
go-slow policy. And I would not be surprised if there was
agreement," he added.

<HEADLINE> Judge Allows House Impeachment Investigators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. judge allowed
Wednesday the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee access
to memos on fund raising during President Bill Clinton's 1996
re-election campaign, but Democrats said the move was a sign the
panel's inquiry was out of control.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that one
Republican and one Democratic staff member could see the internal
Justice Department memos, but could not make copies or take notes
and must report the contents only to Chairman Henry Hyde and
ranking Democrat John Conyers.
</P>
<P>
The committee had sought copies of the memos, but Republicans
said the ruling was a positive move.
</P>
<P>
The memos, written by FBI Director Louis Freeh and former
campaign finance task force head Charles LaBella, include
confidential information from grand juries under Johnson's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
They have long been sought by Congress but Attorney General
Janet Reno refused to let congressional investigators see them,
even after she was cited for contempt by the Republican-controlled
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said they had received information the memos might
contain evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Clinton, and that they
were "duty-bound" to investigate. They have also subpoenaed Freeh
and LaBella to give closed-door depositions.
</P>
<P>
But House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, speaking to
reporters on Wednesday after meeting with Clinton at the White
House, said Hyde was giving in to committee conservatives and that
House leaders were not asserting leadership of the probe.
</P>
<P>
"We are in chaos in the House on impeachment," Gephardt told
reporters shortly before Johnson's ruling.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's chaos. I think no one is in charge. The present
speaker is not exerting leadership. The speaker-to-be is not
exerting leadership, and Henry Hyde seems to be giving in to some
members of the committee."
</P>
<P>
Gephardt sent outgoing Speaker Newt Gingrich and incoming
Speaker Bob Livingston a letter on Tuesday asking them to take
control of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
"So unless leadership on the part of the speaker or the
speaker-to-be comes into this issue in the next few days, I think
there's a serious possibility that this will go into next year,"
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
But Hyde said on Tuesday he was determined to stick to his
year-end deadline for concluding the probe and hoped to stay on
schedule for a committee vote next week on articles of impeachment
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But he said the schedule could be prolonged if the campaign
finance inquiries turned up new information.
</P>
<P>
The confidential memos by LaBella and Freeh unsuccessfully
advocated the appointment of an independent counsel to look into
alleged campaign finance violations during the 1996 Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Judge Johnson said in her three-page ruling that it would be
"in the public interest" to allow limited disclosure of the secret
grand jury information in the memos.

<HEADLINE> Lower Economic Growth Rates for 1998-2000 Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Wednesday
predicted that growth rates for developing nations in 1998-2000
will be the lowest since the debt crisis of the 1980s, but that
outlook is likely to improve in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In its ninth annual report on the global economy, "the Global
Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries 1998/99," the
World Bank said that developing countries would be hardest hit by
the economic and social costs of global slowdown in 1998-2000,
with their per capita growth expected to slow to 0.4 percent in
1998, compared with 3.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and 33 other developing and
transition countries, which account for 42 percent of total GDP
for the developing world, and more than a quarter of its
population, are likely to see negative per capita growth this
year. In 1997, by comparison, per capita income fell in 21
countries which accounted for 10 percent of the developing world's
GDP and 7 percent of its population. Although 1999 is likely to be
another year of slow growth in developing countries, their
situation could improve in 2000, and following years, when their
per capita growth could return to the 3.5 percent pace of recent
years (excluding transition economies).
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's new report attributed much of the slowdown in
developing countries to the unprecedented depth and severity of
the recession in the crisis countries of East Asia and its
contagion effect on the rest of the world. With output projected
to decline sharply in the region this year, and to stabilize in
1999, the report noted that the Asian crisis already ranks with
the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s in terms of its impact
on countries during its first 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Developing nations have been hurt by Japan's deepening
home-grown recession, as well as by a series of shocks related to
the Asian crisis. These include: the collapse of the Russian
ruble, falling commodity prices, a marked slowdown in world import
demand, and general risk aversion in financial markets. Besides,
El Nino-related phenomena also brought both severe flooding and
drought to many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America,
devastating crops, water supplies and rural infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Worldwidely, output growth is expected to be cut nearly half,
from 3.2 percent in 1997 to 1.8 percent in 1998, and to revive
only modestly to 1.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Joseph E. Stiglitz, the World Bank senior vice
president and chief economist, said, "While 1998 and 1999 will be
very difficult years for developing countries, in the longer term
(2001-2007), growth in developing countries could still reach the
record setting rates that we saw in 1991-1997. But this will only
happen if policies to prevent a deeper global slump are
implemented quickly and developing countries strengthen their
financial sectors."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Premier-Designate Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's veteran politician
Salim Hoss was designated Wednesday by the newly-elected
President Emile Lahoud as the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, who turns 69 on December 20, is known for his background
in economics and his three terms as prime minister during the
country's 1975-1990 civil war, in contrast to outgoing premier
Rafik Hariri's reputation as the successful contractor of the
reconstruction era.
</P>
<P>
Hoss presided over three cabinets. He also served as education
and labor minister from 1985 to 1987 and has sat in parliament
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Much of Hoss's appeal derives from his reputation as an
honest lawmaker, and he enjoys support from professionals and
intellectuals around the country, while his criticism of
Hariri's social and economic policies has been characterized as
"constructive."
</P>
<P>
His experience outside politics has been split evenly between
academics and finance. He served as a member of the World Bank's
consultative board for the Middle East and North Africa between
1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Before the civil war, Hoss was a financial expert with the
Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development and presided over the
Banking Control Commission at Lebanon's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, he was a consultant for the Arab Monetary
Fund in the United Arab Emirates, as well as chairman of
the board of the Arab and International Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1929, Hoss is the youngest of five children of a lower
middle class Sunni family from Beirut. His father, a pharmacist,
died when he was young.
</P>
<P>
Despite financial strains, he studied business at the
prestigious American University of Beirut, where he later
taught for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
His 10 books include a two-volume autobiography and several
works on business administration and economics.
</P>
<P>
Hoss has one daughter, Wadad, by his late wife Leila
Pharaon, who died in 1990.

down as national chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Grossman told President Bill Clinton Wednesday that he was
leaving for personal and family reasons, said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
"The president and the first lady accept those reasons and
applaud Mr. Grossman for the fine work he did in helping Democrats
around the country in this season where we defied all historical
trends as far as how parties in the White House do in midterm
elections," Lockhart said. "The president and first lady believe
Mr. Grossman is in large part responsible for that incredible
effort."
</P>
<P>
Roy Romer, retiring governor of Colorado, will stay on as
general chairman of the party, and a successor to Grossman will be
named later.

Grossman is a Newton, Massacusetts, businessman who runs his
family's multimillion-dollar Massachusetts Envelope Co.

WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Wednesday met over
Pakistan's nuclear policies and to review a plan for returning
some of 658 million U.S. dollars owed to Pakistan for F-16 fighter
jets it never received.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to reporters before the talks, Clinton praised
Sharif for resuming direct talks with India on the Kashmir
conflict and said he would consider playing a mediating role if
both nations asked him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters he planned to brief Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif on U.S. efforts to compensate Islamabad for
the money it paid for 28 F-16s which it never received because of
U.S. sanctions imposed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The two also focused on the tit-for-tat nuclear tests India and
Pakistan conducted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"All of you know of my concern to do everything we can to end
the nuclear competition in South Asia, which I believe is a threat
to Pakistan and India and to the stability of the world," Clinton
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that he is hoping to visit the two
countries next year.
</P>
<P>
Just on the eve of Sharif's visit, Clinton Tuesday temporarily
waived certain economic sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan
after the nuclear tests in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China's largest Internet-based
news service signed an agreement today with a major
telecommunications company for long-term cooperation in
Internet-related services.
</P>
<P>
The pact between China Internet Information Center (CIIC),
under the State Council Information Office, and GTE Corp. of the
United States is the first China has entered into for Internet
development services.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will allow CIIC to more easily provide
information about China to Web users in North America and
Europe using GTE's network," said Bruce Linton, vice-president of
sales and marketing for GTE Internetworking Services.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2 million visitors to the CIIC website, which started
operation on Jan. 1, 1997, one-quarter are Internet users in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this is an important step toward the opening of
China's Web content service.
</P>
<P>
But this agreement is not such big news in the country's
Internet service sector, as a number of agreements and contracts
between China's Internet service providers and foreign firms have
already attracted the spotlight in the Internet community.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo recently concluded its agreement with Infoshare
Technology Co., Ltd. affiliated with China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Infoshare will help market Yahoo's
services in China, and the latter will promote Chinese businesses
and help them with online advertising.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo expects to open its Beijing office next year.
</P>
<P>
There is ample reason for the world's major networking and
Internet service companies to be optimistic about the China market.
</P>
<P>
The latest information shows that Internet users nationwide has
now reached 1.2 million, and is doubling every year.

<P>
Early this year, a delegation of top executives from major
U.S. Internet service providers visited China; and U.S. president
Bill Clinton made a trip to the Internet Cafe in Shanghai during
his state visit to China this past summer.
</P>
<P>
Now, hundreds of China's Internet service firms are seeking
cooperation from foreign counterparts for an injection of
technologies and a wider variety of information.
</P>
<P>
The country's most profitable Web content provider, China.com
Corp., has become the exclusive agent for America Online, and has
a firm cooperative relationship with 24/7 Media of the U.S. The
Chinese corporation is working with Netscape right now to produce
a Chinese website.
</P>
<P>
The impact of all this transmission of Internet information
is obviously felt by Chinese. Currently, there are hundreds of
thousands of Yahoo users in China, and more and more Chinese
business people are approaching Yahoo to discuss the possibility
of online advertising.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government limits the involvement of overseas
investment in electronic publications, and stipulates by
regulation that the Chinese side in a joint venture must be the
majority shareholder. And overseas investment is not allowed to
enter the mass media.
</P>
<P>
Like everywhere else in the world, industry analysts say,
government policies and regulations cannot keep up with China's
Internet market expansion, despite a few regulations related to
Internet operations and security which have come into effect.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Develop Multi- and Bilateral Business Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China will develop multi- and
bilateral commercial ties as it strives to create a sound economic
environment for reforms, opening-up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, Chinese minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), made this remark in a speech to Chinese
economic and commercial counsellors working in more than 150
countries, who were attending a conference today on foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Shi said he hopes Chinese commercial officials abroad will
continue to promote multi- and bilateral commercial ties, enhance
research, and offer valuable information and suggestions for the
development of economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
In spite of potentially difficult prospects next year, China
will work hard to expand trade volume and maintain a high level of
overseas capital use, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater efforts to promote the negotiation
process on China's entry into the World Trade Organization next
year.
</P>
<P>
China will also take an active part in APEC and the
Asia-Europe Meeting to propel free trade and investment among APEC
members and increase economic and technological cooperation among
the Asia-Pacific region and Asia and Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
China's trade volume totaled 259.1 billion U.S. dollars in the
first ten months this year, up 0.4 percent over the same period of
1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 16,000 new foreign-funded enterprises have been
approved this year, involving contract capital of 35.9 billion
dollars, according to Shi.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that many surrounding countries suffer
from serious economic depression, devalued currencies, and
declining trade volume, but China has scored its achievements
without devaluing its yuan, and this describes a sharp contrast.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns U.S. Military Presence in East Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) denounced the permanent presence of the
U.S. military in East Asia on Thursday and called it a flagrant
display of its ambition to seek hegemony in the region.
</P>
<P>
In commenting on a U.S. government report published on November
23 on stationing 100,000 troops in East Asia, a spokesman for
DPRK's Foreign Ministry said the DPRK would answer any aggression
or infringement upon its sovereignty and security with "resolve
and merciless" self-defensive measures.
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops stationed in East Asia are capable of attacking not
only the DPRK, but many other countries lie easily within its
attacking sphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
This means that a U.S. military presence in this region has
become a "hotbed" for a new round of confrontations and
conflicts. The DPRK can not but suspect U.S. sincerity in its
talks with the DPRK, said the spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Argentine President
Carlos Menem and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi met on
Thursday to discuss bilateral ties and global issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
In the one-hour meeting, Obuchi said Argentine-Japanese
relations have been strengthened through exchanges at various
levels.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation will greatly contribute to the peace and
prosperity in Japan, Latin America, and the international
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between the two countries has
increased in recent years to about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, but
Argentina now has an annual trade deficit with Japan of 500 million
dollars, said Menem.
</P>
<P>
Menem said he expected to promote exports of beef and grain to
Japan in an effort to narrow the deficit.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reaffirmed their cooperation in nuclear
nonproliferation issues.
</P>
<P>
Menem reiterated Argentina's stand against nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan in May.
</P>
<P>
Menem arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for a four-day official
visit. He will return home on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Dons Face FA Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England have demanded an urgent explanation from Wimbledon after
an apparent admission by manager Joe Kinnear that Dons players
had broken strict rules on betting.
</P>
<P>
Players at the club could face misconduct charges, fines and
even suspensions if there is any truth in Kinnear's comments
following his side's Worthington Cup quarter-final victory
against Chelsea on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Kinnear, said: "We were 66-1 (to win the cup) a
t the start of the season and I think a few of the lads had a few
quid on."
</P>
<P>
Kinnear is known for making flippant comments from time to
time and may argue he is unaware of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
But if it is found that any Dons players did put money on the c
lub to win the competition, it would be in clear contravention of
the tightened regulations on betting in the game drawn up by the
FA last year.
</P>
<P>
The regulations followed a report by Sir John Smith in the
wake of the collapse of the match-fixing case in which Bruce
Grobbelaar, John Fashanu and Hans Segers were all cleared, which
declared that no betting of any kind would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
An FA spokesman said: "We are writing to Wimbledon for a full
explanation.
</P>
<P>
"The rules state that it shall be deemed to be misconduct to
bet on any football match, other than those registered for the
football pools."
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon could technically be kicked out of the competition
if they are found to have broken FA rules, but it is far more
likely that any guilty players would be fined or even suspended.
</P>
<P>
Following Sir John's report, the FA issued a blanket ban on
all types of betting by players, managers and directors - even if
it was on their own team winning.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan said here Thursday that he would visit Libya on
Saturday to discuss the Lockerbie issue with Libyan government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Wednesday on a two-day visit during his
tour of the Arab Moghreb states, said he would meet Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi to discuss ways of settling the Lockerbie
issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed arms and travel embargo on
Libya since 1992 for its refusal to hand over two Libyans
suspected of blowing up an American airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in 1988, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council passed a resolution in August calling for
lifting the sanction once Libya agrees to transfer the two
suspects to the Netherlands for trial under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya demanded that, if found guilty, the two Libyans serve
their time in Dutch prisons whereas the United States and Britain
insist they must serve the sentence in British prisons.

<HEADLINE> Romania Readjusts 1998 State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
Wednesday announced this year's second cut in budget expenditures
in an effort to keep its deficit within limits.
</P>
<P>
By whittling spending down about 26 million U.S. dollars, the
government hopes it can help to contain the deficit within 3.6
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Analysts here count the sluggish privatization process of state
enterprises as the main reason for the budget cut, saying it bit
into expected government revenues.
</P>
<P>
In making re-adjustments, spendings in some budget sections
were cut sharply, while some other sections received supplementary
budgets. However, the overall budget expenditure were reduced.
</P>
<P>
A cut of 530 million dollars was expected in the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Health and the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of
Interior Affairs, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of
Industry and Trade enjoyed a supplementary budget. The Ministry of
National Defense received 233 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Daniel Daianu said the budget cut would not
affect the routine operation of related ministries, adding the cut
was mainly done in investment capital which hasn't been used.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government previously announced a 10 percent
budget cut three months ago.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Joins Energy Charter Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia became the 51st
member state of the Energy Charter Conference after it signed the
Energy Charter Treaty on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia is the second Asian country after Japan to have
acceded to this inter-governmental organization dealing with
energy issues. Both Asian countries still need to ratify the
accession to the treaty that entered into force in April this year.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Charter Treaty provides market-oriented rules for
all economic activities in the energy sector and covers all energy
forms such as oil, gas, electricity, nuclear and renewable
energies.
</P>
<P>
It aims at protecting investment in the energy sector,
facilitating the transit of energy and energy products, settling
disputes, promoting cooperation and supporting structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Most of the member states of the conference are from Europe due
to the fact that the conference developed from the European Energy
Charter which was a declaration by 53 countries.
</P>
<P>
Signatories were later extended to other areas of the world to
include Australia, Japan and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Henning Christophersen, the newly elected chairman of the
conference, said on Thursday that there was a prospect to include
China into the multinational organization as well by first
offering it an observer status.
</P>
<P>
Christophersen said the next task of the conference would move
from ratification to implementation of the treaty by emphasizing
the treaty's purpose to all signatories as an energy development
tool.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Street Democracy in Guangzhou (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lai Chaohui, president of today's forum, said that many people
were scared to speak a word when the forum was first open in
1992. Most of them just watched and waited, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But gradually they became brave. Sometimes, some people
don't even want to pass the loudspeaker on to someone else," Lai
said.
</P>
<P>
However, there is occasional trouble. Lai recalled that at one
forum on reconstructing the old city district a man shifted the
topic to his family quarrels.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most dramatical changes is the behavior of the
officials attending the forum," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, when officials heard sharp criticism,
the muscles on their faces twisted, Lai said. Now, they listen with
honest expressions, and sometimes even make timely decisions
on sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
Some government departments even apply to take part in the
discussions, and officials believe they might even hear some good
suggestions from the public, according to Lai.
</P>
<P>
"The street discussion is a new form of democracy in China,"
said sociologist Qiu Haixiong. "It will help improve public
supervision of the government, and increase the transparency of
government work."
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe that the forum signals
something. Guangzhou, along with other cities in China's most
economically prosperous province of Guangdong, are usually seen as
testing grounds for China's reforms.
</P>
<P>
The forum has also attracted officials from dozens of
inland provinces observing the event.
</P>
<P>
Today's discussion ended at 10:30 in the morning. But the
officials were still surrounded by many people.
</P>
<P>
The whole story of this discussion forum will be presented on
the Guangzhou TV Station.
</P>
<P>
The city has decided that the forum will be held regularly
beginning next year.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Today's topic was "should the
hospital help a brave person if he or she is wounded in a fight
against hooligans, but has no money".
</P>
<P>
The question sparked controversial answers among hundreds of
citizens and officials at a square in downtown Guangzhou, capital
of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"To give medical treatment to such sort person is our
responsibility," firmly replied one doctor.
</P>
<P>
"But why not first listen to what our official says?" someone
else suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Aha, from my point of view, hospitals have their
difficulties," said an official with the City Health Bureau. "It
is hard to tell a good man from a person fond of street
fighting. There isn't any law for us to follow in this respect."
</P>
<P>
......
</P>
<P>
The "Yangcheng Forum" is how the people describe this street
discussion, the only forum open to everybody who wants to say
something in public.
</P>
<P>
Since it was inaugurated six years ago, the forum has become a
special channel for Guangzhou citizens to air their views on state
affairs and local issues, and comment on the behavior of officials.
</P>
<P>
The topics are usually decided by the City People's Congress
and the Guangzhou TV Station, the sponsors of the forum, and
municipal officials are required to be on the spot so the
citizens can talk with them face to face.
</P>
<P>
"The forum provides us with an opportunity to discuss pressing
issues as equals with high ranking government officials," said
Tang Guifang, a 55-year-old woman who had made the first speech at
today's forum.
</P>
<P>
She added that in ancient times Chinese citizens had to
prostrate themselves when attempting to talk to imperial
officials.
</P>
<P>
As an enthusiastic participant, the woman has taken part in
discussions on many topics including city environment, food and
health and housing problems.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, problems discussed at the forum are subsequently
solved. What is more important is that I feel I am the master of
the city when taking part in the discussion," said Tang.

</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Tung Chee Hwa officiated at the conferment ceremony of honorary
doctorates to Zhou and three other outstanding persons here

to the advancement of science and technology in China, said the
University.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Zhou said: "Whether for a long-term
purposes or just to enhance the current international
competitiveness of Chinese industries, plans have to be made to
develop science, technology, education, and various industries
propelled by scientific and technological advancement, including
the service industries. This is a step forward which both the

<HEADLINE>   WTO Calls For Collective Action Against Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) has urged all countries, even if they are not WTO members,
to take a collective responsibility to deal with the financial and
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"This crisis calls for a sense of collective responsibility, as
urgently as at any other time in the post-war period," said the
WTO in its 1998 annual report published here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has suggested that three matters should be addressed
from the perspective of the global trading system.
</P>
<P>
It requires a clear and continuing commitment by governments to
the multilateral trading system and a firm resolve to resist
protectionism. A fresh impetus toward trade liberalization would
contribute to the resolution of the crisis and would send a
positive signal to the markets, the WTO said.
</P>
<P>
It also requires renewed efforts to bring the countries which
are outside the system, including China and Russia, into the
WTO. It would help complete the global economic architecture for
which the need has been so strongly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
The WTO said in the past that governments have sometimes
responded to recession and rising unemployment by implementing
policies that restrict imports of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
"History tells us that this has been a major mistake," it
pointed out: "The growing economic crisis of the late 1920s became
a full-blown recession when governments closed their borders to
trade, making the pain more severe and the recovery slower."
</P>
<P>
Today, the WTO went on, with national economies ever more
connected, and with 25 percent of global output now being
exported, a resort to protectionism would be more costly still.
</P>
<P>
"Resisting protectionism is vital, but it is not enough," the
WTO said. "Pressing on with trade liberalization is essential to
restoring health to the world economy."
</P>
<P>
"Global trade in goods and services is the circulatory system
of the world economy," it stressed. "If this system fails, the
patient will not improve, no matter which macroeconomic medicine
is prescribed."
</P>
<P>
The continued dynamism of the trading system is a necessary
precondition for economic recovery in Asia and for buttressing the
economies of Russia, Latin America and other parts of the world,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO also pointed out that admitting new members to the
organization would enhance its ability to provide a stable
foundation for the global trading system, particularly during
times of economic stress.
</P>
<P>
"The current crisis makes no distinction between WTO members
and others, and we can't afford to maintain a situation where
millions of people and their governments are outside the benefits
and responsibilities of the trading system," the WTO stated.

<HEADLINE> Millwall Rapped over City Crowd Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Millwall have escaped
punishment from the Football Association over the pitch invasions
that marred their match with Manchester City earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
The Second Division club were found guilty of failing to
control spectators and were warned about their future conduct.
</P>
<P>
Coins were thrown on the pitch and City players claimed they
had been spat at and threatened during the crowd trouble in the
match at the New Den on September 29.
</P>
<P>
After a six-hour hearing an FA crowd control commission said
it was impressed by the south London side's determination to
prevent any further problems.
</P>
<P>
But the commission said the FA would continue to monitor the
situation closely with the club.
</P>
<P>
Police Superintendent Trevor Brydges told the commission the
game had to be held after four separate pitch invasions and
police had to stop fans reaching players and officials.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the trouble had been blamed on hooligans from
other London clubs attending the fixture.
</P>
<P>
Supt Brydges added new measures had been brought in at
Millwall to combat football violence.
</P>
<P>
Match referee Matt Messias also gave evidence on the clashes
during a volatile second half of the league match, which ended
1-1.
</P>
<P>
The trouble was sparked after City scored a late equaliser -
but a bad tempered game also featured a mass brawl between the
two teams, which was sparked when City's Tony Vaughan and
Millwall's Paul Shaw were sent off.
</P>
<P>
Six other players were booked and a furious City manager Joe
Royle said at the time: "The home fans were refereeing at
times."

<HEADLINE> Kidd to Take up Reigns at Blackburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Brian Kidd, right-hand man to
the English Premier League club Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson, looks set to take up the reigns at Blackburn Rovers,
admitting Thursday he is keen to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
After seven years at Old Trafford, Kidd is expected to sign
for Rovers this week and held discussions over the Ewood Park
vacancy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
United's chief executive Martin Edwards said Kidd is now
likely to leave the club but claimed his departure would be a big
blow.
</P>
<P>
"He wants to progress his career and he wants to have the
chance of being a number one," Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
"He wants that opportunity to speak to them and so reluctantly
we have agreed to that.
</P>
<P>
"We have accepted the fact that he may want to leave and
Blackburn have been very good.
</P>
<P>
"They have been on to us and they have done it the right way,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Only last week Edwards claimed the only way Kidd would leave
United would be "over my dead body", but his attempts to hold on
to him look set to fail.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson had been keen to hang onto his loyal lieutenant, and
had earlier said: "We do not want to lose Brian. He is very
important to United.
</P>
<P>
"We have built up an excellent staff and Brian has been a key
part."
</P>
<P>
United initially rejected Rovers' approach for Kidd, who has
been Ferguson's right-hand man for almost eight years.
</P>
<P>
Kidd has long been tipped, along with Middlesbrough boss Bryan
Robson, as a possible successor to Ferguson when the United
manager decides to retire.

<P>
ZHAQU(TIBET), December 3 (Xinhua) -- The expedition to the
Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, the world's longest, deepest and
perhaps most dangerous gorge on the Yarlung Zangbo River in
Tibet, ended today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time anyone successfully traveled through
the gorge on foot. The expedition was completed in 42 days.
</P>
<P>
The 496-kilometer-long canyon has an average depth of 5,000
meters, and is a challenge to any adventurer. Several Chinese and
foreign teams had attempted to go through it in the past, but they
all failed, and in some cases, team members lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
The team that just successfully completed its trek through the
canyon consisted of Chinese scientists, news reporters and athletes,
and faced many hazards along the way, according to sources.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Palestinians Must Live up to Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here Thursday Israel will implement the
Wye peace accord only after the Palestinians fulfil their
commitments.
</P>
<P>
''Otherwise, there will be no peace process, " Netanyahu said
to reporters after his meeting with U.S. Secretary of Health Donna
Shalala.
</P>
<P>
He strongly criticized a violent attack against the Israelis
Wednesday in Ramalah, adding such violence was organized by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The TV crews were there (in Ramallah) Wednesday not by chance
and everything was well organized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two Israelis were attacked and beaten by demonstrating
Palestinian students in the Ramallah incident.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the Israeli government set three
conditions for the Palestinians to fulfil, or it will halt
further Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The conditions include the PNA acceptance of continued
imprisonment of Palestinian prisoners with blood on hands, ,
renouncement of its intention to unilaterally declare a
Palestinian state and halt to incitment activities.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said Wednesday night that Israel has no right to raise
more demands in implementing the Wye peace accords and such
demands violated the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that it is not
appropriate to add new demands and the Wye peace accord must be
implemented as signed.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Clinton is to visit Gaza, but the
Israeli side has asked the President not to land his special plane
at the Arafat International Airport, requesting him to take a
helicopter to reach Gaza.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross will return to the Middle East
soon to help implement the Wye peace accord signed in Washington
in October.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Foreign Firms' Choice for Regional Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has increasingly
become the choice for foreign firms to set up their regional
establishments including headquarters and procurement centers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 42 operational headquarters and 22 international
procurement centers for regional establishments in Malaysia have
so far been approved, Malaysian International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has also approved 802 representative
offices, of which 178 between 1997 and November 1998, and 427
regional offices for foreign companies, of which 46 during the
same period, she said at a function in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, with its cost competitiveness, good infrastructure
and support facilities, can serve the regional market efficiently
and competitively, she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's program for such companies,
international procurement centers are allowed to maintain
expatriate staff and foreign currency accounts and they can also
bring in raw materials and finished products without having to pay
duties to tax-free industrial zones and licensed manufacturing
warehouses for re-packaging, cargo consolidation and integration
before final distribution.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said operational headquarters are levied a 10-percent
concessionary tax on income arising from qualifying services
rendered to companies outside Malaysia and from interest and
royalties.
</P>
<P>
She said that in addition to maintaining expatriate staff and
foreign currency accounts, these operational headquarters can
borrow up to 10 million ringgit (about 2.631 million U.S. dollars)
from domestic sources without requiring approval from Bank Negara
(State Bank) Malaysia and obtain credit facilities in foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
They are also allowed to invest in foreign securities and lend
to related companies outside Malaysia, she added.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The euro will be introduced
early next month and China is actively making preparation for both
trade and banking in the new currency.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the euro will provide both opportunities
and challenges for China which expects to gain more ground in
trade talks due to European Union's (EU) earnestness for providing
support. China will also be able to raise additional low cost
funds by issuing Eurobonds on a unified capital market and will
quite likely attract increased European investments due to the
elimination of risk involved in the volatile exchange rate,
according to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
However, introduction of the euro will also present new
challenges in terms of adjusting the structure of foreign exchange
reserves and foreign debt, as well as expanding trade with the EU
and competing with new financial services related to the currency.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to expand bilateral trade with the EU and
the nation's foreign trade companies are currently training to
ease adjustments to the new currency, according to officials from
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Chinese banks are also expected to revise expansion strategies
in Europe and will shift their focus to Frankfurt rather than
London. They will also open more branches in European nations
outside the domain of the euro and will compete for related
services.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Bank of China has restructured its foreign
business operations and is fully prepared to offer new services
beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts expect that the euro may be weak at the initial
stage but will become strong in the long-term. They suggest that
China may hold at least a portion of long-term debt in the euro
and use various financial instruments to minimize the devaluation
risks for short-term debts in the currency.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Cut Market Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will cut market
interest rates in a bid to help its economy out of slump, said the
Bank of Korea Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will also expand the supply of cash reserves
and the issuance of bank notes and payment reserves to gradually
lower market interest rates, said Kwon Jung-hyun, spokesman for
the bank.
</P>
<P>
The central bank supplied reserve money totaling 19.8 trillion
won (15.8 billion U.S. dollars) last month.
</P>
<P>
The declining pace of the nation's production and domestic
demand has slowed down and the credit crunch eased as a result of
the steady down-sliding market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall South Korean economy still shows no sign
of recovery.
</P>
<P>
That is why the bank intends to make a stronger push to lower
call rates through "open market operations," a mechanism to
control liquidity by purchasing or selling state and public bonds,
while making an effort to stabilize the foreign exchange market,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The bank's efforts to pull down market interest rates,
including call rates, are designed to help domestic enterprises
reduce their heavy financial burdens and further stabilize the
exchange rate of the South Korean won against the U.S. dollar,
said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Meets Fugitive Ex Zimbabwean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Fugitive former
Zimbabwean president Canaan Banana met South African President
Nelson Mandela in Pretoria Wednesday to advise him that he is in
the country, a spokesman for Mandela said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place at Banana's request, South African
Press Association (SAPA) quoted Tony Trew as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean police had a warrant for Banana's arrest after he
skipped the country shortly before his conviction on 11 counts of
sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting took place with the knowledge of the
Zimbabwean government, said Trew.
</P>
<P>
Banana did not apply for asylum and did not intend to stay in
South Africa for long, he said. The spokesman could not supply
further details on what transpired at the meeting or on Banana's
current whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Banana is said to have a son working in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week in Harare, a senior Zimbabwean official who
did not want to be named, said that Zimbabwean police and
Interpol had been informed of Banana's presence in South Africa.
Efforts were being made to return him to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted Zimbabwean police chief Augustine Chihuri as
saying Wednesday that South African police were helping to hunt
down Banana.
</P>
<P>
Banana is believed to have crossed into South Africa from
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Banana, 62, was head of state from Zimbabwe's independence in
1980 to 1987.

stability in Asia ever since the financial crisis started in the
region in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the World Bank Global
Economic Prospects of 1998/99, which was released Thursday in
Washington, Dipak Dasgupta, lead author of the report, said that
China has pursued policies that have helped maintain stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The growth of China's economy may be slowed down due to various
factors including the serious flood in the country this year and
the slow-down of its domestic consumption growth.
</P>
<P>
However, China can still achieve more than a 7-percent growth
this year and it will remain about that level in 1999, Dasgupta
said. So China is one of the largest countries in the region which
is enjoying a very strong growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the conference held Thursday afternoon at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Hong Kong, Dasgupta said that China's
growth obviously has a major influence over Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been forced to defend itself during the crisis
but it is also a source of great stability in this region, he
added.

<HEADLINE> German Economy Up 2.8 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy showed robust
growth in the third quarter, rising by 2.8 percent on an annual
basis and up 0.9 percent over the second quarter, the German
Federal Statistics Office announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The office's report also said the gain in eastern Germany was
1.7 percent lower than that of western Germany's 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the gain to strong private consumption
and domestic demand, while noting that exports, the traditional
pillar of the German economy, have played a relatively weaker role.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption rose by 2.2 percent in the third quarter,
faster than the average rise in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the third quarter went up by 3.1 percent on an
annual basis, a slowdown from the eight percent rise in the first
half of 1998. Meanwhile imports were up by 3.5 percent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Further significant figures in the report concerned
employment. The number of jobholders in western Germany shot up by
90,000 or 0.3 percent and those in eastern German were up by
26,000 or 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate still remains high at an average 10.7
percent for the quarter, but slightly below the 11.3 percent in
the spring.

Malaysia received in June the 300 million U.S. dollars applied
in May to overcome the economic downturn for providing micro

he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank would need more time to process the loan
applications submitted in June and July this year as the loans
involved various ministries, sectors and projects.

He said the loans sought this year were mostly for the
construction of low-cost houses, the agricultural sector,
infrastructures, land transport, education and the economic
sector.

gather facts and made assessments before making recommendations to
its board of directors.

<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the People's Consultative Assembly/House of Representatives
(MPR/DPR) have agreed to hold the general election on June 7,
1999, House Speaker Harmoko said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Referring to the people's aspiration, the general election --
as part of the reform agenda on political affairs -- is scheduled
to be held on June 7 next year, while the first phase of the
general session of the MPR will be held on August 29," Harmoko
told reporters after a meeting with the President B.J. Habibie at
the legislative assembly building.
</P>
<P>
The election was previously set in May 1999 and the MPR's
general assembly in December in the same year.
</P>
<P>
"The holding of the general session of the MPR in 1999
constitutes an effort to form a new government based on the
results of the general election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the general election and the MPR's general session,
Harmoko also explained the DPR's commitment to following up the
implementation of the MPR decrees adopted during the body's
special session last month.
</P>
<P>
The president, according to Harmoko, is committed to
implementing the MPR Decree which includes a probe into the
alleged hidden wealth of former president Soeharto.

He said the legislative body will take proactive steps to
follow up these MPR decrees with laws, either in the economic,
political or legal fields.

JOHANNESBURG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Trott Moloto was named
coach of South Africa's national soccer team, Bafana Bafana, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moloto has been caretaker coach of the national side after the
end of this year's World Cup when former coach Frenchman Philippe
Troussier's contract expired.
</P>
<P>
Moloto would hold the reins until the end of the African
Nations Cup in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
His immediate task will be to name an 18-member squad on
Monday to face Egypt in the Nelson Mandela Inauguration Challenge
Cup on December 16 in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
His appointment came after South African Football
Association's failure to find a foreign coach for Bafana.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Carlos Parreira last week refused to take the job on
the ground that a four-year contract is too long for him, who
wished to stay with his family.
</P>
<P>
Moloto had been Troussier's assistant at the World Cup and
guided Bafana in their African Nations Cup qualifier against
Angola in October.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Closely Watches U.S.-India Nuclear Talks: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has delinked its
position on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) from India
but it is closely following the Indian negotiations with the
United States on the issue, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Siddique Kanju said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Following the tests (by Pakistan), we do not consider it
necessary to link our position on the CTBT with India,
nevertheless, we are closely following the Indian negotiations
with the United States on this issue," he said while addressing
the International Conference on Peace and Security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is ready to adhere to the CTBT provided the
atmosphere of coercion and pressure is removed.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan remains committed not to exporting sensitive
technology to a third country or entity," he said. "This is a
responsible policy adopted for over two decades. We are ready to
further tighten our controls where necessary."
</P>
<P>
Kanju said Pakistan has agreed to the commencement of
negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament regarding the
conclusion of a Fissile Material Cut off Treaty (FMCT).
</P>
<P>
He said that the nuclearization of South Asia cannot be
reversed. "Nuclear deterrence is now fundamental to Pakistan's
security."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with wide conventional disparity, he said, Pakistan's
reliance on a nuclear deterrence is imperative.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, there is an urgent need for both
Pakistan and India to promote understanding and stability in order
to avoid nuclear arms race and conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan had already acted with restraint, declared a
unilateral moratorium on testing and offered India a regional test
ban treaty."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's dialogue with the United States, he said, on nuclear
and security issues and with India on peace and security is
governed by "both our fundamental security considerations and our
sensitivity to international non-proliferation concerns."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, has pursued the goal of nuclear non-
proliferation as it has realized that a nuclear race in South Asia
will have far-reaching consequences.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Tycoons Asked to Donate Personal Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The bosses of South Korean
family-owned conglomerates, or chaebols, will be asked to donate
their personal wealth to help reduce the debts of their business
groups, said a top presidential advisor on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top five chaebols -- Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo, LG
and SK -- will sign an agreement with their creditor banks before
December 15 to specify ways of reducing their debts, said Kang
Bong-kyun, the top presidential advisor on economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
In their debt reduction plans, the chaebol bosses must make
clear how much of their personal wealth, including real estate,
stocks and cash, will be used and how much foreign capital they
will attract, said Kang.
</P>
<P>
Kang also said the South Korean government has been monitoring
whether the chaebols bosses have been abiding by their earlier
commitments to put their personal wealth back into their business
empires.
</P>
<P>
Under the commitment of "self-rescue efforts," creditor banks
will convert part of their debts into equity while the
conglomerates must shut down their unprofitable subsidiaries and
sell off real estate and stocks to improve the financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Unless the chaebols comply with the debt reduction plans they
sign with their creditor banks, they will be denied access to
bank credit, Kang said.
</P>
<P>
The top five chaebols are now burdened with debts of totaling
160 trillion won (130 billion U.S dollars). The ratio of debt to
equity ranges from 370-570 percent, much higher than the 85-150
percent recorded by their counterparts in Japan and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The five had previously promised to attract foreign capital of
29 billion U.S. dollars, of which only 16 percent has actually
flowed in.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions China will
try to take their third straight Asiad gold medal in softball.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which won the Asian Games softball gold medal
at 1990 and 1994, will face a tough challenge from their Japanese
opponents.
</P>
<P>
At least 5 players of the Chinese team took part in the Atlanta
Olympics Games in which China finished runners-up. Some of them
retired from the national team after that but returned for the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"Though pyhsically I am not as good as at the Olympic Games,
but I think my experiences could still benefit the team," said
pitcher Wang Lihong.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Asian Games softball tournament will have 7 teams
and Japan are the only one which can pose serious threat to the
Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yaming, head coach of the Chinese team, said:"We have a
very tough opponent--Japan, we feel the pressure but we are
confident of retaining the title."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team lost twice to Japan at the world championships
earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Top Sprinter Jayasinghe to Run in Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- World women's 200 meters silver
medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka will come for the
Asian Games on Saturday and run in four events, a top official of
the Sri Lankan delegation said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Maiya Gunasekera, Chef de Mission of the Sri Lankan delegation,
said the continent's most controversial track star Jayasinghe has
not been affected by the doping scandal and is in a superb form.
</P>
<P>
"She has been totally cleared of the doping offence," said
Gunasekera, who headed the country's delegation to arrive at the
Bangkok international airport this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"She is in a good form and is ready to run. I believe she will
win all the gold medals from the four events," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Jayasinghe will arrive here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"She is a strong-willed person," Gunasekera said. "The doping
case failed to cast a shadow over her, and she has been training
very hard."
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, 23, won the 200 meters silver medal at the World
Championships in Athens in 1997 with a time of 22.39, posing the
main hurdle in the Asian Games against China's sprint star Li
Xuemei, who holds women's 100 and 200 meters Asian records.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan was first temporarily suspended from
participating in all international events after she failed a
random drug test conducted by the world's track and field
governing body IAAF in April.
</P>
<P>
She was then cleared of the charges in August by the Asian
Athletics Association after a three-member committee appointed to
study the issue ruled not guilty for her.
</P>
<P>
But IAAF announced last month that her doping case did not end
and will be submitted to the arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Jayasinghe is eventually allowed to run in the Asian Games
pending the ruling from the arbitration panel.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Trade Surplus Down to 28 billion Dollars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade surplus is
expected to fall to 28 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 from an
estimated 40 billion this year due to a rise of imports, the Korea
International Trade Association said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the 1999 trade outlook, the association said
increased export of electronics products and automobiles will
depend on demand from developing countries and could be offset by
a slowdown of the U.S. economy, pushing up export volume by a mere
0.4 percent to 133 billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
The heavy-industry export is expected to rise 2.4 percent while
light-industry one will drop 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, import is due to jump 13.5 percent to 105 billion
dollars, reflecting a reduction in inventories.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of another foreign currency crisis is low
because of current-account surplus and steady inflow of foreign
investment capital, said the association.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean won is expected to make a stable
movement at the level 1.300 against the U.S. dollar, added the
association.

<HEADLINE> WTO Predicts Lower Global Trade Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of world
merchandise exports for 1998 is expected to be between four and
five percent, less than half of that in 1997, said the World Trade
Organization (WTO) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The sharper than projected deceleration of global output and
trade in 1998 is largely attributable to the underestimation of
the recession in Japan and the deeper and more widespread
repercussions of the financial crisis in East Asian countries,"
said the WTO in its 1998 annual report.
</P>
<P>
The East Asian financial crisis which began in the latter half
of 1997, and the severity of the down turn in the Japanese economy
in 1998, together with slower growth in the United Kingdom and
Latin America led to reduced global economic activity.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the downward tendency was somewhat
mitigated by increased momentum in continental West Europe.
</P>
<P>
The slump in Asia's growth contributed significantly to
depressed commodity markets, with oil prices and non-fuel
commodity prices falling by about 30 percent and 15 percent
respectively on an annual average basis.
</P>
<P>
"This year will be the third in a row with a decrease in the
dollar prices of internationally traded goods," said the
report. "Average prices for total merchandise exports are falling
back to the level of 1991, the lowest in the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
Expectations regarding global trade growth in 1999 have been
lowered in recent months, said the WTO. Most forecasters regard a
moderate acceleration in volume growth compared to 1998 as the
most likely scenario.
</P>
<P>
In value terms, the WTO predicted that the recovery should be
more pronounced as price declines for primary commodities are
partly reversed and the dollar is not expected to strengthen.
</P>
<P>
"The actual outcome will depend in large measure on
developments in international capital markets, the rate of
recovery in Asia and in particular Japan, and the sustainability
of growth momentum in Western Europe and North America," it said.

<HEADLINE> New Scheme Offers More loans to HK Home Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mortgage
Corporation (HKMC) announced here Thursday that it is expected to
launch a new guarantee scheme at Spring next year to enable local
home buyers to obtain a mortgage up to 85 percent of the value of
the property.
</P>
<P>
Peter Pang, chief executive officer of the HKMC, announced
Thursday that the Board of Directors of the HKMC has given its
approval in principle for the corporation to partner with mortgage
insurers to launch a mortgage guarantee scheme which will enable
home buyers to secure mortgage loans up to 85 percent
loan-to-valuation (LTV) ratio.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed scheme, the HKMC will provide a guarantee at
a fee to the lending bank (which has to be an approved seller of
the HKMC) for an amount up to 15 percent of the value of the
property to enable the bank to extend the mortgage loan up to 85
percent of LTV ratio from the existing 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The HKMC will fully hedge the exposure of the guarantee by
taking out an insurance of equal amount with a mortgage insurer,
Pang said.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and chairman of the HKMC, described
this scheme as a win-win solution for all parties -- home buyers,
banks, HKMC and the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement will also help improve the liquidity in the
property market, particularly in respect of secondary property
transactions, Tsang said. The HKMC is a wholly-owned corporation
of the HKSAR government through the exchange fund.
</P>
<P>
"With the approval of the board, we will conduct detailed
negotiations with the mortgage insurers on the terms of the
back-to-back mortgage insurance and seek formal authorization as
an authorized insurer under the Insurance Companies Ordinance,"
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes well, the product is expected to be launched
in the first quarter of 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dominic Wong, secretary for housing of the SAR, welcomed the
HKMC announcement, saying that the proposed arrangement for using
mortgage insurance to enable banks to lend beyond the 70 percent
mortgage ceiling without increasing additional risk will have
positive impact on the property market.

<P>
BNAGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Some four hundred sports
officials and athletes of the Chinense Asiad delegation arrived
here Thursday afternoon for the 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The Asian sports giant, which collected 137 gold medals four
years ago at Hiroshima, sent the sports delegation in two
chartered plane from Guangzhou and Beijing respectively, with 207
in the first and 193 in the second.
</P>
<P>
"Ninty percent of the Chinese delegation has been in Bangkok,"
Li Furong, deputy Chef de Mission of the Chinese delegation, said
upon his arrival at the Bangkok international airport.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation for the 13th Asian Games consists of 822
athletes and officials. They will take part in 32 out of 36
events at the games.
</P>
<P>
Among the 400 athletes who arrived here on Thursday are teams
of diving, swimming, basketball, judo, volleyball, canoeing,
rowing, fencing, shooting and weightlifting, which are believed to
contribute most of China's gold medals in the Games.
</P>
<P>
The all-conquoring table tennis as well as badminton teams will
get here later.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Weimin, Chef de Mission of the Chinese delegation, said he
was confident that Chinese athletes would take lion's share of
gold medals at the games.
</P>
<P>
"I think China can win over 100 gold medals," said Yuan Weimin.
"But I'm not sure whether we can win more or less than the 137 we
got at the Hiroshima Games."
</P>
<P>
Yuan said China aims higher than just winning gold medals:"I
cannot say it is good or bad to win more than 137 gold medals. We
hope that through the Asian Games, we can find some young talents
with potential to win honor at the 2000 Olympic Games and other
world competitions."
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that main part of the Chinese delegation was formed
by young athletes since a lot of veterans have retired after the
Chinese Eighth National Games last year.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the veteran athletes can put on world-class performance
instead of just winning gold medals," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan also said that the performance of Chinese athletes at the
Asian Games was closely related to China's bid for the 2008
Olympic Games, though gold medals was just one side of their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot only depend on the gold medals and results of the
athletes to bid for the Olympics," he said. "But the reason we
submitted our bid right before the Asian Games was to say we are
contributing greatly for the Olympic movement."

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices took a hit on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday after a limp rebound Wednesday.
</P>

and banks leading the fall.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover increased to 228.54 million units valued at

<HEADLINE> Philippine Pros Set Eyes on Asiad Hoop Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- As Asia's 13th quadrennial
sporting gala is two days away, the men's basketball competition
will unveil the mask of an all-pro Philippine Centennial team,
which aims to end the country's hoop gold drought since 1974.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines reapt four consecutive gold medals in the first
Asian games from 1951 to 1962 and regained the title in the 1974
Tehran Games.
</P>
<P>
But the basketball crazy islanders have never repeated the
glory since launching their professional league PBA in 1975 when
the country was then represented by amateurs in international
meets.
</P>
<P>
The best result the Filipinos have attained was a silver medal
at the Beijing Games by a hastily-shuffled PBA All-Star team in
1990.
</P>
<P>
After a hiatus of eight years, the Philippines vows to fight to
win the gold in the Bangkok Games by fielding in their best pro
cagers in the Centennial team as the country celebrated its 100th
anniversary of freedom from Spanish domination in June.
</P>
<P>
The mission would be dire tough for the Filipinos as they know
clearly that three-time defending champion China and the
newly-crowned Asian championship winner South Korea were on their
ways to the top of the podium.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Filipinos are not to surrender without fight but to
whet their weapons for tough battles from both China and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Centennial team, led by Manila-based American
coach Tim Cone, went to the United States for a 22-day tour
against the collegiate teams one month before the Bangkok Games.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines' biggest problems will definitely come from
China and South Korea," admitted Cone before leaving for the US
trip. "We've got to overachieve to beat China."
</P>
<P>
"Aside from China and South Korea, the Philippines is also
closely watching teams from Japan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgystan," said
Cone.
</P>
<P>
The basketball competition will start from December 8 through
19 with more than 16 teams competing in the last Asian Games of
the century.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Discovers Debt Buy-back Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
investigating a 2.5 billion-Dollar debt buy-back fraud involving
two former ministers and a member of the family of late Head of
State General Sani Abacha, media reports here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Press Secretary to the Head of State, Malam Mohammed
Haruna, disclosed in Nigerian capital Abuja Wednesday that the
three people involved had already made statements to the police.
</P>
<P>
He said that the money was the debt owed by the Nigerian
government to a Russian company handling the Ajaokuta Steel
Company in the country.
</P>
<P>
Haruna noted that some ministers and a member of the Abacha
family had an interest in the debt.
</P>
<P>
They went abroad and registered a company which had reached an
agreement with the Russian company to buy back the 2.5
billion-Dollar debt for 500 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
They paid the Russian company off with the 500 million Dollars
and shared two billion Dollars which is the difference between
what Nigeria owed and what they paid, said Haruna, adding that
that is what is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that an additional 130 million Naira (about
1.5 million Dollars) had been identified under the votes of the
former National Security Adviser Alhaji Ismaila Gwarzo.
</P>
<P>
The money is part of the 64 billion Naira (about 744 million
Dollars) earlier recovered from the family of the late General
Abacha, he added.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have reached advanced stage and the money will
soon be recovered, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Airways to Open Flight to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An aviation official has
confirmed that the Nigeria Airways would commence its scheduled
flight operations to Johannesburg next week, The Post Express
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Jani Ibrahim, Chief Executive of Nigeria Airways
Limited, was quoted as saying that arrangements had reached
advanced stage to ensure smooth operations on the virgin route.
</P>
<P>
All flights to South Africa will be routed through Nnamdi
Zikiwe International Airport in capital Abuja instead of the
Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, services on the route will be conducted in a
leased DC-10 aircraft, probably from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement issued in Lagos by the South African
Airways said that direct flights between South Africa and Nigeria
would start on December 3 using a Boeing 767 airplane.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no bilateral air service agreement between
the two countries, a memorandum of understanding signed by them
allows for two flights on every Monday and Thursday by the South
African Airways.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources here believe that with direct links between
Lagos and Johannesburg, commercial activities and cultural
interactions will receive a boost and cement the existing cordial
relationship between the two giant African nations.
</P>
<P>
There have been several efforts to open direct air link
between Nigeria and South Africa since the dismantling of
apartheid in the gold-rich country.
</P>
<P>
Political problems and other issues have prevented the
much-expected direct flights from taking off.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two African countries worsened and
reached its lowest ebb during the regime of the late General Sani
Abacha who, in spite of overtures from President Nelson Mandela,
went on to kill Ken Saro-Wiwa, an acclaimed environmentalist, and
his eight Ogoni kinsmen in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes One U.S. Cent Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shed
more than one U.S. cent Thursday as it succumbed to pressure from
poor commodities prices and overseas fall-out from Wednesday's
Reserve Bank of Australia rate cut.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed Thursday at 62.60 U.S. cents from 63.68
U.S. cents previously, after spending the day between 62.38 and
63.02 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
A major factor in the performance was falling commodity prices,
with the Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB) down by 0.84 at
195.99.
</P>
<P>
The CRB is an index of 21 U.S. futures markets and although it
is not weighted to Australia's exports, traders follow it as an
indicator for the commodity price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement by the Reserve Bank of Australia to
reduce the cash rate to 4.75 percent from 5.00 percent also saw
market participants sell.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates Thursday, the Australian dollar was buying
74.75 Japanese yen from 77.53 yen Wednesday and 1.0453 German
marks from 1.0714 marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Thursday inspected the ruins of a Manila orphanage and
ordered an investigation into the cause of the blaze that killed
24 children and three nannies.
</P>
<P>
Estrada expressed deep regret over the tragedy while inspecting
the ruins of the 85-year-old house settlement in Paco, Manila.
</P>
<P>
After asking about the circumstances leading to the fire, the
president invited officials running the orphanage to meet him in
the presidential palace at the soonest.
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said that 24 kids and three nannies were killed
in the fire, and eight children are still missing and feared dead.
</P>
<P>
They said that faulty wire might have caused the fire, which
started at 02:09 Thursday (18:09 GMT Wednesday) and was placed
under control after more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers, volunteer groups and terrified parents are
still searching for the missing people from the debris of the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
The settlement house was occupied by at least 70 people,
including abandoned children, babies left by their working parents
on a day care basis and volunteers who take care of the kids,
firemen said.
</P>
<P>
The survivors were brought to the nearby parish church in Plaza
Dilao.
</P>
<P>
The corpses were transferred to a funeral home.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said that Estrada is
eyeing a partnership between the government and the private sector
in rebuilding the orphanage.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese marksmen are
aiming at winning 13 medals, or as many as that at the last
edition back home, during the 13th Asian Games to open here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The squad, spearheaded by three-time Games champion Ryohei
Koba, is targetting to repeat their feat of three golds, five
silvers and five bronzes in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Other medal hopes are men's rifle expert Naoki Kurita, men's
air rifle standing 60 shots competitor Masaru Yanagida and women's
air pistol shooter Yoko Inada.
</P>
<P>
Yoko Minamoto also attracts attention by coming back as a
mother after two years of absence.
</P>
<P>
Minamoto, gold medalist at the 11th Asian Games in 1990, is
expected to pose threat to the Chinese women in air rifle three
position event.
</P>
<P>
With powerhouse China sending its star-studded line-up here, it
is unlikely that Japan will fare better here than in Hiroshima
four years ago but the country still hopes to finish at least
third after South Korea.

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The disappearance of a lake has
been the subject of wide-ranging conjecture in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to today's edition of

</P>
<P>
The dry rectangular lake bed located near the village of
Lianjing in Jingxi County covers 20 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the water level dropped by 20
centimeters per day beginning on October 15, with all water
disappearing over the following eight days.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers noted that the lake thrived for over a hundred
years, with the surface area consistently remaining above 13 ha
even during severe droughts.
</P>
<P>
The actual cause is under investigation. However, the article
points out the lake formed as a result of local karst features
which created subsidence.

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys Rapid Scientific, Technological Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The past two decades have
witnessed a rapid development in China's modern science and
technology, according to Lu Yongxiang, president of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Scientific reform has been accelerated since the Third Plenum
of the 11th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee in
1978, said Lu. He made the remarks at a recent symposium on the
plenum which introduced the reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the CAS has followed the guidelines outlined at the
plenum and has taken the lead by sending students and researchers
abroad to study and initiating scientific cooperation with the
United States, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
CAS also established China's first "open laboratories" and a
special fund for natural science studies.
</P>
<P>
"The measures have provided valuable experience for
establishing a new innovation system and exploring ways to reform
the science and technology system," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
CAS plans to build itself into a center for knowledge and
innovation by the year 2010, with related efforts focusing on
strategic scientific projects and advanced international
scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
Twelve related CAS pilot projects are progressing smoothly
now.

<HEADLINE> Cutting China's Longest Railway Tunnel (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A driver presses buttons in the cab, breathing air that is
pumped in by a ventilator. The hard rock is being cut to pieces
and carted out of the tunnel on narrow tracks and water used in
the cutting runs into a water-treatment pool before it is released
into the valley.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jun, senior engineer on the project, told reporters that
work on the Qinling Range tunnel started at the end of last year
and more than 6,000 meters have been covered.
</P>
<P>
The Qinling Range in the middle of China, where the tunnel is
being bored, has a 2,800 meter main peak. It forms a demarcation
line between northern and southern climates and a watershed
between the Yangtze and Yellow rivers.
</P>
<P>
Li Henian, chief engineer of the Xi'an-Ankang project, says
that several generations of Chinese have long dreamed of a tunnel
through Qinling Range, but because of the length, complex
geological structure, and possible disasters, a number of railways
had to be built around it.
</P>
<P>
So, to realize this dream and improve rail transport in
southwestern and midwestern China, the Chinese government decided
to put more than 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) into a
railway going directly goes through the middle of Qinling
Range. The Qinling tunnel alone will cost over 2 billion yuan (240
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It took engineers some eight years before they hit on the
present plan, which allows the tunnel to pass through five big
faults in the shortest way, Li said.

<P>
The tunnel will have two basically parallel single-track
tunnels, 30 m apart, and the total length of the two is just over
18 km.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the tunnel, China spent a great deal
on the most sophisticated excavating equipment, including two TBMs
from Germany's Wirth, which cost 750 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for China to use TBMs. Liu Jun says that
Chinese quickly caught on to the technology.
</P>
<P>
Li Henian says that a 9,500 m-long single-end ventilation was a
major accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an-Ankang Railway runs from the Longhai railway
(Lanzhou-Lianyungang) in the north to the Xiangfan-Chongqing rail
line and Baoji-Chengdu rail route in the south. It is one of the
leading construction project in China's development program for
1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
When completed in 2000, it will form another north-south trunk
railway line, and the railway trip from Xi'an, the capital of
Shaanxi province, to Ankang in southern Shaanxi will be shortened
from 18 hours to about three hours.

<HEADLINE> Increased Consumption to Promote Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists contend that
the nation can achieve economic prosperity by promoting further
development of the domestic market in answer to the turbulent
international economy.
</P>
<P>
Increasing domestic investments and consumption are playing an
increasingly important role in maintaining stable economic
development as a result of declining growth rates for both exports
and foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaochao, deputy director of the State Statistics Bureau's
Intergrated Statistics Department, said China has reaped positive
results in efforts to invest more in fixed assets and ignite
market demand. He noted that China's economic situation
undoubtedly improve in line with related efforts.
</P>
<P>
Li admitted that Chinese enterprises and members of the general
public thus far refrained from active investments and consumption,
and noted that the government is adopting additional measures to
boost consumption.
</P>
<P>
Noted Economist Hu Angang pointed to the macro level and noted
that China is a developing country which must strengthen
development of its railway, highway, higher education and medical
care sectors.
</P>
<P>
China's accelerated urbanization, environmental protection and
ecological projects offer vast opportunities for investors, said
Hu, adding that the nation has exhibited less restraint and
greater generosity in terms of overall economic policies.
</P>
<P>
"Shortages of construction capital are longer the main obstacle
hindering economic development," according to Hu. He also noted
that the Chinese economy will be further fueled up by breaking
monopolies and encourage the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Many difficulties remain in spite the fanfare surrounding
increasing domestic demand, according to observers..
</P>
<P>
China's ongoing reform of the housing and medical care sectors
reform have led to a retrenchment in spending, and massive
layoffs have sharpened the general public's awareness of possibly
financial instability and in turn sparked increased savings.
</P>
<P>
Increased market competition has forced many companies to adopt
a strategy of less spending for product upgrades and increased
investments in other areas.
</P>
<P>
However, a broad domestic market is in place and China can
expect greater market development of the domestic which will
continue to grow the economy.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Detains Human Rights Group Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court has ordered the
detention of Secretary General of the Egyptian Organization for
Human Rights (EOHR) Hafez Abu Saada for receiving foreign funds
with the intention of damaging national interests.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Thursday that Egypt's
Higher State Security Court issued the order Wednesday after
questioning him over a 25,000-U.S.-dollar check offered to the
group by the British embassy in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Under the order, Abu Saada will be held in custody for 15 days
as part of the investigation, a judicial official said.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of accepting foreign funds without official
approval in advance and spreading allegations that have
jeopardized the national interests, the official said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the EOHR secretary general was jailed
since its founding in 1985. Abu Saada would face seven to 15 years
of hard labor if convicted, according to judicial sources.
</P>
<P>
The private Al Usbou weekly has reported that EOHR received the
check offered by the British Parliament's Human Rights Committee
via the British embassy after it released a statement alleging
police brutality against Copts in southern Egypt. The weekly
denounced the organization of committing treason.
</P>
<P>
Al Usbou Editor-in Chief Mustafa Bakri has also displayed a
copy of the check and another EOHR statement on the incident in
Suhag Governorate's Kosheh village, where 70 percent of its 35,000
residents are Christian Copts.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette reported on November 1 that EOHR had
issued a statement that more than 1,000 Copts were rounded up by
the security forces who were investigating the killing of two
Copts.
</P>
<P>
Based on the allegations, Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper
said: "Egyptian Christians have been subjected to horrific
crucification rituals, raped and tortured by the security forces
during a crackdown on the ancient Coptic community."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament, social groups and celebrities have
denounced the story of the British newspaper as a fabrication
aimed at defaming Egypt where Muslims and Christians have been
co-existing in peace for more than 14 centuries.

<HEADLINE> Severino: Hanoi Summit to Push for Early Recovery of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) Rodolfo Severino
Jr. has said that the Sixth ASEAN Summit scheduled in Hanoi,
Vietnam, will come up with concrete measures to push for the early
recovery of ASEAN economies.
</P>
<P>
Severino made the statement Wednesday at the Conference on the
Economic Prospects and the Environment in Asia held in Kuala
Lumpur, a media release issued here Thursday by the ASEAN
Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN leaders, Severino said, will issue a mandate for a
more rapid integration of markets in goods and services and
liberalization of trade and investment regimes to further improve
the business climate of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN leaders are expected to take strong steps to
hasten the ASEAN Free Trade Area establishment and to draw
investments into ASEAN. An agreement on facilitating goods in
transit is expected to be signed, he said, adding that these and
other economic measures to be undertaken in the next three to six
years will be on the agenda of the summit to ensure ASEAN's
competitiveness in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general said the Hanoi Summit to be held on
December 15-16 promises to be productive "Summit of Concrete
Measures".
</P>
<P>
He also said ASEAN leaders will be meeting with those of China,
Japan and South Korea. "The meetings with all three Northeast
Asian leaders and with each of them in turn will be of great
importance to the future of our region."
</P>
<P>
"China is a rising force in the regional and the global
economy; Japan is the world's second economic power, Asia's
leading economy and ASEAN's leading economic partner; South Korea
is a victim of the crisis, and is cooperating with ASEAN in
dealing with it", he explained.
</P>
<P>
Severino said there is now a growing confidence in ASEAN among
multinationals and investors and cited the following three
conditions:
</P>
<P>
The first, he said, is that the factors that made three decades
of rapid growth possible remain in place in ASEAN. These are
healthy budgets, high savings rates, natural resources, relatively
good infrastructure, and an educated, skilled, motivated and
mobile labor force.
</P>
<P>
The second is that ASEAN members are dealing forcefully with
the ravages of the crisis, each in its own way -- "a clean-up of
the banking and financial system, capital infusion, expansionary
measures, belt-tightening. Some are doing it in partnership with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), others on their own.
</P>
<P>
These efforts are starting to show results, he said, adding
that "currencies are being stabilized, inflation is coming under
control, and interest rates are going down." There are guarded
forecasts of the beginning of a recovery sometime next year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The third, he said, is that the international community seems
to be finally getting itself together in grappling with what has
become a global problem.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for business people who are alert to
opportunities to take a close look at ASEAN," Severino said.
"ASEAN's market of 500 million people is integrating and further
opening up to trade and investment. The economic reforms now
taking place will make ASEAN a better place in which to do
business."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Instructs Attorney General to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to take
active and effective actions in fighting corruption, collusion and
nepotism and to take legal measures against former president
Soeharto soon.
</P>
<P>
"The Attorney General should soon take legal measures against
Soeharto for alleged practices of corruption, collusion and
nepotism, based on the presumption of innocence and respect for
human rights," State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung said
Thursday after accompanying the head of state at a consultative
meeting with legislators.
</P>
<P>
He said the complete instruction is stipulated in Presidential
Instruction No. 30/1998 on the eradication of corruption,
collusion and nepotism in an effort to accelerate the
implementation of national development.
</P>
<P>
The instruction implements People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
Decree No. 11/MPR/1998 which was passed by a special MPR session
on November 13, he added.
</P>
<P>
Article 4 of the MPR decree states that efforts to eradicate
corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately
upon any state officials, former state officials, their families
and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung noted that Habibie has long given the instruction to
the Attorney General during cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
Early investigations, he said, show that Soeharto led seven
foundations with total assets of 4.1 trillion rupiah (585 million
U.S. dollars) and has 23 billion rupiah (3.28 million U.S.
dollars) deposited in 72 banks -- 57 private banks, 7 state banks
and 8 foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
"With Presidential Instruction No. 30/1998, the Attorney
General would be more active in conducting the investigation of
Soeharto," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Muladi said the government has
decided to use government bodies, such as the Attorney General's
Office, in efforts to combat corrupt, collusive and nepotistic
practices and investigate Soeharto's alleged hidden wealth.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the government said it will form an
independent commission that would investigate Soeharto's personal
fortune.
</P>
<P>
The idea has drawn pros and cons from the people, Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
However, if it is necessary, the government will set up an
independent commission, he said, adding that a decree on this has
been drafted and commission members are being chosen.
</P>
<P>
"The decree is already with President Habibie but he has not
yet signed it," Muladi added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Students and citizens in the country have held various
demonstrations, urging the government to bring Soeharto to court
on charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Real GDP Drops by 0.7 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product
(GDP) in the third quarter of this year shrank by a preliminary
0.7 percent from the previous quarter in real terms, or an
annualized decline of 2.6 percent, the Economic Planning Agency
(EPA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The contraction marks the fourth consecutive quarterly fall. It
is the first time that Japan's GDP has declined for four straight
quarters since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption, which accounts for some 60 percent of the
GDP aggregate, fell by 0.3 percent, and corporate capital spending,
another engine for growth, declined by 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Housing investment fell by 6.2 percent, while public investment
increased by 3.6 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
EPA Director General Taichi Sakaiya told a press conference it
may be difficult for Japan to attain the government-set economic
forecast of 1.8 percent contraction for fiscal 1998 ending next
March 31.
</P>
<P>
GDP measures the value of goods and services produced within a
nation. Real GDP figures are adjusted for inflation and seasonal
variations.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Franco-British summit to be held in Saint Malo, western
France, on Thursday and Friday is expected to focus on the recent
decision by London to join the process of building a European
defense. Although considering it as a "test balloon" of Britain,
France is taking it seriously.
</P>
<P>
-- With a fully emotional speech in which she recalled the
assassination of her grand-parents by the Nazis, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright opened the Washington conference on
the Jewish objects of art and other properties robbed by the
Nazis during World War II. The World Jewish Congress has
threatened France with an economic boycott if France does not
settle account of some 2,058 objects of art without owners which
are now kept in French museums.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The 21st French-British summit to be held Thursday and
Friday in Saint Malo will be focused on the issue of European
defense and is expected to see debate over whether the Western
European Union should be integrated into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has agreed that the EU should
be competent in defense but said it should avoid doing a "double
job" with NATO. France hopes that Britain, France, and Germany can
have a common stand on European defense at the NATO summit in
Washington next Spring.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan failed to
unlock the impasse over the holding of a self-determination
referendum in West Sahara during his visit to northern Africa early
this week. The two conflicting sides of West Sahara -- Polisario
liberation front and Morocco -- are disputing over the right to vote

refusal to purchase another Australian-built frigate, warning the
country risked losing its relevance to the region.
</P>
<P>
But visiting New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said
Thursday his country had swapped the frigate for a squadron of
fighter planes after getting a good deal from the United States.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand decided earlier this week not to purchase a third
ANZAC frigate for just under 300 million U.S. dollars, but instead
to spend the money on improving its army, and purchasing 28 F-16
fighter jets offered by the United States at a bargain basement
price.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia was disappointed at New Zealand's
decision to only buy two ANZAC frigates and added that it was
important the country didn't retreat from the region.
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we want to see is a New Zealand that just walks
away from its own region," Downer was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We would have liked to see them go down the path of choosing
the third ship, the third ANZAC frigate, and we will just continue
to put that case to them," he said.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon, who met Downer in Canberra Thursday, said he
understood Australia's disappointment but his government could not
afford both the frigate and the fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we were offered a deal on fighter aircraft that my
colleague the defense minister said could not have been bettered
by Santa Claus," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia had also offered New Zealand a generous
deal on the third frigate, but McKinnon said the United States'
offer was extraordinary and could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the 28 jets will cost New Zealand around
360 million U.S. dollars over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The jets were ordered by Pakistan, but canceled by the U.S.
government.

</P>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- From the heat of Malaysia to
the snows of Russia and the maple trees of Japan, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin was busy in November during a two-week visit
to the three nations, an indication of China's interest in
solidifying its good-neighborly ties for the next century.
</P>
<P>
The visit resulted in an APEC declaration in Kuala Lumpur,
Sino-Russian "no-tie" talks in Moscow, and a Sino-Japanese joint
declaration in Tokyo, as well as a Sino-ROK joint statement in
Beijing, making this good-neighborly diplomacy a cornerstone of
the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
With a series of high-level visits with Russia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Pakistan, and Viet Nam, and the Sixth APEC
Informal Leadership Meeting, China has had substantial success in
solving problems left over from the past, dealing with border
issues, and promoting bilateral and regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In Jiang's Russia trip, a declaration on the border issue was
signed, with eastern and western sections of the border accurately
marked for the first time to guarantee the Sino-Russian strategic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
During the Japan visit, the two sides issued a joint
declaration to build a friendly and cooperative partnership
devoted to peace and development.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Dae-jung's mid-November China trip resulted in a
framework and an orientation for a cooperative partnership for the
next century.
</P>
<P>
In October, Viet Nam's Prime Minister Phan Van Khai reaffirmed
in Beijing to strengthen trade cooperation with China, and to sign
the land border treaty before the year 2000 and to finish the
demarcation of the Beibu Gulf by then.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Develop Small Offshore Oil Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Two offshore oilfields in the
western part of China's Bohai Sea started production today,
signaling completion of the first-phase project for a joint
development program of small to medium-sized oilfields in the area.
</P>
<P>
Lin Shaodong, president of the China's Offshore Oil Bohai Corp
(COOBC), said the first phase project included the development of two
offshore oilfields and an onshore oil and gas processing terminal.
</P>
<P>
The Qikou 18-1 and Qikou 17-1 oilfields are respectively 46 and
58 km from Tanggu Port in Tianjin, a major industrial city in
north China. The oilfields will provide the city with a daily gas
supply of 300,000 cu.m. and an annual oil supply of 500,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Sea has abundant oil and gas reserves, including a
large group of small and medium-sized oil and gas structures,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that joint development of related oil fields
represents an important step for increasing the country's offshore
oil production.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the joint development of small and medium-sized
oilfields in the giant Bohai Oilfield will raise its annual oil
production to over 10 million tons by the year 2004.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo on Yen's Appreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled across the
board in Tokyo on Thursday due mainly to the yen's rise against
the U.S. dollar and the overnight fall on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 289.54 points, or 1.93
percent, from Wednesday's close to finish at 14,697.08.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 18.26 points or 1.59 percent to
1,128.89.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section slowed slightly to about 315
million shares, down from Wednesday's 324.10 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba Corp was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The fall does not indicate investors sold shares aggressively, but
their buying interest has declined, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Investors are concerned that the dollar's fall may bring about a
further decline in stock prices on Wall Street, he added.
</P>
<P>
Exporter shares fell as the dollar slipped below 120 yen, because a
stronger yen tends to weaken Japanese exporters' competitive edge
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers overwhelmed
gainers 1,034 to 153, with 117 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Gin People: (Guangxi Ethnic Group Series) (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The household contract responsibility system was the main part
of China's rural reforms when the people's communes were
abolished. But, the rural reforms were several years late in
coming to the three peninsulas because of the war with Viet
Nam in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the hard-working Gin used the opportunity and
used the marine resources to make more money.
</P>
<P>
The Gin's ancestors migrated from Viet Nam to the peninsulas in
the 15th century. In 1990, when border trade between China and
Viet Nam resumed, the Gin on the three peninsulas became some of
its biggest beneficiaries. With no language barrier, they do a
brisk border trade with the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
Gin people sell China-made light industrial and daily
necessities to Vietnamese businessmen from whom they purchase
marine products, timber and discarded metallic commodities. Last
year, the volume of border trade between them exceeded 100 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The government has spent 120 million yuan on 4 highways and 3
harbors since 1994, and thanks to these efforts, transportation
has improved a great deal and business is much easier, Su says.
</P>
<P>
There is 9-year compulsory education on the three
peninsulas. Before the 1980s, few Gin students made it to
university. But now members of the Gin ethnic group pass college
entrance exams or even go abroad for advanced studies.
</P>
<P>
Television sets and telephones are now found in almost all Gin
households, a quarter of which have motorcycles or
automobiles. There is one mobile phone for every five households.
</P>
<P>
"These days are the best of my life," says 81-year-old Liu
Richeng from Wutou, "children now use more money to buy snacks
than what I used to spend on meals."
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, there have been no criminal acts or
instances of public disorder among the Gin, says one local
official.

<HEADLINE> Cheung Tze-keung Trial Is Proper: Law Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Prof. Chen Guangzhong, of
Southwest China University of Political Science and Law in
Chongqing and deputy head of the China Law Society, says that the
mainland has jurisdiction over the Hong Kong resident Cheung
Tze-keung and that his trial is in complete accord with the law.
</P>
<P>
Cheung Tze-keung and his 36-member gang are accused of dealing
in explosives, smuggling arms and ammunition, kidnapping people,
and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou reached a verdict
in the trial of first instance on November 12 and the Higher
People's Court of Guangdong Province will announce the final
verdict, because some of the defendants have appealed.
</P>
<P>
Chen says that the case involves people from Hong Kong and the
mainland. The explosives and arms and ammunition charges are for
crimes committed on the mainland. The kidnapping and robberies
were committed in Hong Kong, but were plotted and prepared on the
mainland, Chen explains.
</P>
<P>
He points out that, according to Clause 1, Article 6, of
China's Criminal Law, the Criminal Law applies to all crimes
committed in the People's Republic of China's territory, except
stipulated otherwise by laws.
</P>
<P>
The people's court in the place where a crime is committed has
jurisdiction over the case, according to Article 24 of the
Criminal Procedure Law, he says, therefore mainland courts have
jurisdiction over the case of Cheung Tze-keung.
</P>
<P>
Mainland justices respect the independent judiciary of Hong
Kong, he said, and the courts of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region have jurisdiction over any crimes committed
by Hong Kong residents in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Thai Officials Call for More Stress on Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai government officials have
called for special emphasis on trade liberalization to strengthen
the country's economy and protect export.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi Wednesday said
that promoting liberalization is a goal that could not be achieved
without the support of overseas capital, more sophisticated
technology and wider access to markets.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to increase trade and investment through liberalization
are aimed at protecting Thai exports from barriers and not
intended to damage local companies, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign support will help create more jobs with higher pay for
locals, expand foreign markets for Thai products and above all,
underline the country's economic stability in the long term," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to amend 11 contentious bills to
ensure that they support an economic recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade liberalization is seen as important by countries
worldwide. "Among ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
members of the World Trade Organization, Thailand has the most
restrictions on trade. If the government is too late to adjust
itself, the barriers will become obstacles to future trade and
slow the recovery," Supachai noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is working hard to restore the economy
and reduce reliance on foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Plaipol Khoomsap, an academic at Thammasat University, said the
parliament should pass bills ensuring the government guarantee
that foreign capital would not take opportunities away from Thai
investors.
</P>
<P>
The government should also ensure that foreign investors do not
repatriate all their profits and, instead, they expand their
production in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Above all, after the implementation of liberalization, foreign
countries which have trade with Thailand must lift all their
restrictions on Thai exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Surakiat Sathirathai, a former finance minister, said the
government prefers to liberalize enterprises or businesses so that
the public would benefit. Businesses in which locals are not ready
to compete with foreigners should be under Thai control.
</P>
<P>
The government should also promise that legislation would not
be amended under foreign pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Foreign Business Bill, in particular, has lots of defects
and loopholes. Its penalty chapter is quite light and gives too
much authority to commerce ministry officials," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lake Malawi's Fish Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The fish population in Lake
Malawi is under threat because of uncontrolled and inappropriate
fishing practices.
</P>
<P>
Malawian Environment and Fisheries Minister, Frank Mkandawire,
said Wednesday in Lilongwe that fish availability in the lake,
one of the world's largest fresh-water bodies, had declined.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted Thursday by The Post, a Zambian
independent newspaper, as saying the fish population had fallen
from about 15 kilograms per capita in 1970 to seven kilograms per
capita this year.
</P>
<P>
And some species had declined sharply from 6,000 tons in 1987
to 500 tons in 1996, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The situation was due mainly to increasing numbers of
fishermen who used inappropriate fishing gear, and environmental
problems such as drought, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian government, said Mkandawire, had put in place a
number of measures to prevent the situation from getting out of
control.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would encourage community-based fisheries
management schemes, apart from banning certain fishing gear, and
designating some times of the year as off-season for fishermen.
</P>
<P>
He added that some catchment areas of major rivers, which are
polluted, would be rehabilitated to act as breeding grounds for
fish, which would in turn migrate into the lake.
</P>
<P>
Lake Malawi with an area of 22,490 square kilometers is the
country's chief tourist attraction and home to more than 500
species of fish.

<HEADLINE> Recovery of Chemical Fertilizer Industry Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical fertilizer
industry recorded losses of 1.15 billion yuan (138.6 million US
dollars) during the January-September period due in part to
widespread heavy summer flooding, according to today's Market
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Some 57.1 percent of the nation's fertilizer companies operated
in the red during the period because of low demand and high import
volume, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The reliance on imports in recent years has resulted for the
structural imbalance in fertilizer production. For example, the
nation produces ample nitrogenous fertilizers, but falls far short
in the production of phosphate and potash products.
</P>
<P>
Experts underlined that China should impose stringent controls
on the domestic fertilizer industry to prevent unapproved
companies from flooding the market with cheap inferior products.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they have called on the government departments to
ensure supplies of raw materials and waive taxes in order to
promote the recovery of the industry, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt Anew In East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua)-- Clashes between Palestinians
and Israeli police erupted again on Thursday morning in East
Jerusalem after a Palestinian man was stabbed to death by an
Israel Jew in the previous day.
</P>
<P>
No casualties or injuries were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Local Palestinian residents in the city, still angry about the
death of the young man, threw stones and rocks at Israeli police
near a post office on Salah Eddin Street of the Old City and
Israeli police tried to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local Palestinian residents in the city closed their
shops and halted all business Thursday to show their indignation
over the incident.
</P>
<P>
The 41-year old Usamah Mousa Al-Natsheh, father of six, was
stabbed to death early Wednesday by an Israeli Jew in the Old City
of Jerusalem. The police said the attacker wanted to cause
political problem in the city.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli police during
Natsheh's funeral Wednesday. Police responded by firing tear gas
and rubber-coated bullets. Several people were injured in the
clash. Angry Palestinians also set a vehicle on fire and
torched several other cars.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert strongly condemned the attack, saying such killings
can not be tolerated no matter the victim was a Jew or a
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
Israel strengthened its security measures in East Jerusalem
following the implementation of the Wye peace accord signed in
October in Washington. However, incidents such as bombings and
killings have been occurring frequently in the city.

<P>
KAMPALA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Rebel leaders in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) flew to Uganda Wednesday to
discuss the peace deal reached at the Franco-African summit in
Paris over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Rebel military leader Jean-Pierre Ondekane took off from the
eastern city of Kisangani Wednesday afternoon for two-day talks
with President Yoweri Museveni, the Monitor paper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua in
a telephone interview Thursday morning that she does not know the
meeting because the president is now touring the up-country and
will not return to Kampala until the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma refused to
make any comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Reuter's report as saying that the rebels'
political leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba denied any big change
despite the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The fighting continued and the rebels would stand firm despite
mounting pressure from the offensive by the allied forces, Wamba
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused of backing the rebels who rose up to
out DRC President Laurent Kabila on August 2 while Kampala has
brushed aside the charge as baseless.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire reached in the Paris summit brings a new ray of
hope for the war-torn country. However, observers noted that it
may not be as binding to the rebels as expected because rebels
were not represented at the summit.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Nuclear Race Increases Tension in S. Asia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan in May this year have not only worsened the already
soured relations of the two neighboring countries, but also made
the situation in the South Asian region more tense.
</P>
<P>
India conducted five successive underground nuclear tests on
May 11 and 13, and Pakistan, in a tit-for-tat revenge, carried out
six nuclear tests on May 28 and 30. These tests have pushed the
two hostile countries as well as the whole region into a nuclear
armed race.
</P>
<P>
Indian Home Minister L. K. Advani said on May 18 that
"Islamabad should realize the change in the geo-strategic
situation in the region" following India's nuclear tests. Indian
Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Tourism M. l. Khurana
said on May 21 that "India is ready to fight a fourth war with
Pakistan in case Pakistan wishes it so."
</P>
<P>
"If Pakistan wants to fight another war with us, they should
tell us the place and time, as we are ready for that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his first press
conference on May 23 after India's nuclear tests that "India has
resorted to nuclear blackmail to impose a military solution in
Kashmir... but any misadventure will be met with a resolute
response."
</P>
<P>
Following India's threat, Pakistan has put its army on maximum
alert along its border since May 20 and round-the-clock monitoring
systems have also been activated in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pakistan urged the world community to "take a
serious note of the irresponsible Indian threats."
</P>
<P>
Under their new threat perception and to face new challenges,
both India and Pakistan have quickened their efforts to develop
and manufacture more sophisticated weapons including nuclear
weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
Indian Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat said on November 30 that India's
naval version of the formidable missile Prithvi would be deployed
on-board certain surface ships by January 26 next year and its
newer submarines would be upgraded to have missile-launching
capability.
</P>
<P>
India has already begun manufacturing the 150-kilometer range
Prithvi missile for the Army and is in the process of developing
the 250-kilometer range version of the missile for the Air Force
for which test flights have already started. The sophisticated Sea
Harrier jump jets would undergo a "mid-life upgradation" within a
time frame and be fitted with "top-of-the-line avionics and
radar", he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Minister Geroge Fernandes said Wednesday that
the government has already approved the development of the longer
range (about 2,500 kilometers) missile Agni using state-of-the-art
technology.
</P>
<P>
Samar Mubarakmand, head of a Pakistan missile project, said
Wednesday that Pakistani scientists have built the most modern
surface-to-surface missile in the South Asian region and were
awaiting a government signal to launch it. The 759-kilometer range
new missile Shaheen is three times more powerful than India's
Prithvi missile.
</P>
<P>
Public opinions in the two countries hold that both India and
Pakistan have engaged themselves in an unnecessary war of nerves
which will hamper the social, cultural and economic ties between
them. They are of the view that the nuclear tests by the two
countries would lead to an arms race and proliferation of nuclear
weapons in the region, worsening the relations of the two
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Nuclear Race Increases Tension in S. Asia (2) ...two neighbors. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since May, armed clashes between India and Pakistan along the
Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir area have increased. In
their exchanges of fire, both sides used heavy weapons inflicting
heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif said in an interview with the India Today magazine
on June 6, "Kashmir is a flashpoint. It is the core issue. Only a
solution to that can lead to permanent peace in South Asia."
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and two of
them were due to the Kashmir dispute. India claims that Kashmir is
a part of its territory while Pakistan maintains that it is a
disputed area. They have talked over the issue on many occasions,
but without any result.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the world community, India and Pakistan
resumed their talks stalled after September last year in October
this year, and have since then held several rounds of talks at
various levels on issues including peace and security, Jammu and
Kashmir, trade and economy, but little has been achieved due to
deep mistrust between them.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Command and Staff College in Quetta on November
19, Sharif said that the recent bilateral talks between Pakistan
and India proved that "the Indians are not ready for meaningful
dialogue... Their primary objective is to deflect international
pressure and prevent the involvement of third parties in the
process."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has also described as complete failure the
Indo-Pakistan dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said, "Our region will continue to be plagued with
tension, so long as the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir remains
unresolved." The world was shaken out of its indifference to the
cause of tension in South Asia, as the United Nations Security
Council and its five permanent members as well as the G-8 (Group
of Eight) have acknowledged that the unresolved Kashmir dispute is
the root cause of tension in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed on November 18
accused India of having expansionist designs in the region and
called for U.S. intervention. Speaking to a group of American
editors in Islamabad, he said that New Delhi had neither shown any
indication for settling the Kashmir dispute nor had accepted
Islamabad's proposal for nuclear restraint and stabilization.
</P>
<P>
Any further nuclear testing or more unsettling deployment by
either side will only heighten tensions in a region dangerously
close to open hostility. South Asia cannot afford a costly arms
race, the result of which can be only further impoverishment of
the people, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
Prices have gone up sharply with the smoke of nuclear tests in
India and Pakistan and the fiscal deficits of the two countries
are expected to increase by a big margin. In the wake of the
devaluation of their currencies, inflation rates have soared. The
big hike of price of daily necessities in India in recent months
have drawn severe criticism and resentment among people, who voted
out the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party' state governments in the
just-concluded assembly elections in Delhi and Rajasthan.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An Australian government's
proposal would make Sydney Olympics organizing committee (SOCOG)
save 123 million U.S. dollars, Australia Olympics Minister
Michael Knight said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan to minimize the effect of a goods-and-services tax on
the Sydney Olympics was put forward by Prime Minister John Howard
in a letter to New South Wales state Premier Bob Carr.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed legislation, most of SOCOG's contracts
involving ticket sales, sponsorships and television rights would
be free from the tax as exports.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would also apply to the Sydney Paralympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Knight welcomed the plan although he said SOCOG would have
preferred a total exemption from the tax.
</P>
<P>
The ticket sales would reach a games record 372 million U.S.
dollars, according to SOCOG's budget.
</P>
<P>
The deal would depend on a Memorandum of Understanding between
the government and SOCOG being settled soon, Howard said.

BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A leading Japanese sports
official rebuffed Bangkok organizers' claim that the 13th Asian
Games here would be the greatest ever, a Thai newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The 12th Asian Games in Hiroshima (in Japan) were better
organized than the 13th Bangkok Asian Games," Japanese delegation
head Karugi Kogake was quoted as saying by the English-language
newspaper The Nation.
</P>
<P>
Kogake said he had found that Thailand's preparations could not
compare with the Hiroshima edition in terms of competition
organizing, the welcome and the condition of the residential
accommodation.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made three days before the opening of the
Asian Games, from which the Saudi Arabia controversially withdrew
recently.
</P>
<P>
The number of the competing countries and regions were reduced
to 41 after the Saudi Arabian withdrawal, making the Hiroshima
edition still the most widely competed in history at 42.
</P>
<P>
Kogake was confident that his country would take the second
place behind China in the overall medals standings here despite
the South Koreans made the same claim.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that our team are potentially stronger than
the South Koreans, especially in the men's swimming and both the
men's and women's marathons," Kogake was qutoed as saying.
</P>

In the last Asian Games, China snatched 133 golds, followed by

The Bangkok-based The Nation newspaper said on Thursday clay

<P>
But Panomporn was worried the lack of competition experiences
may offset the team's progress.

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance industry has
experienced rapid development over the past 20 years and a
complete insurance system has basically been established since
establishment of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC)
in November.
</P>
<P>
This year's insurance premiums are expected to grow
significantly over last year's level in spite of a lower economic
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, decided to
reinstate the domestic insurance sector in 1980 following a
suspension of some 20 years. with premiums for the first year
amounting to less than 300,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the sector has since risen at an annual average rate
of over 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics through the end of 1997 show that domestic
insurance premiums have exceeded 100 billion yuan, including
property premiums of some 48 billion yuan and life premiums
totalling 60 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The number of domestic insurance companies has jumped from one
in 1978 to the current 13 with total assets worth over
164.6 billion yuan and over 140,000 employees. Four insurance
companies are currently engaged in fierce market competition in
the nation's medium-sized and large cities.

attend the 13th Asian Games to be held in Bangkok of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chinese athletes will make efforts to get good results in both
sports and ethical progress, said Yuan Weimin, the head of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of that Thailand, the host of the

China's insurance sector has also accelerated efforts to open
wider to the outside world. American International Assurance
Co. Ltd. and Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. emerged as
the first foreign insurance companies to establish operations in
China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Eleven foreign insurance companies have since been granted
approval to do business in China and some 189 foreign companies
have opened representative offices.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 Foreign insurance companies recorded total premiums of
639 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The advanced management concepts and expertise foreign
insurance companies have introduced to China have helped to
develop and improve the nation's insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
For example, individual marketing means for life insurance
introduced from American International Assurance Company sparked
the rapid market development over a few years.
</P>
<P>
China's 1997 life insurance premiums hit 60 billion yuan, up a
dramatic 85 percent on the previous year. The volume showed that
for the first time in history life insurance premium exceeded
the volume for property insurance.
</P>
<P>
China has also developed its insurance business abroad over the
past few years with the establishment of companies such as the
China Reinsurance Company, People's Insurance Company of China
(H.K) and the European-China Insurance Holding Company. Related
companies currently have annual insurance premiums of several
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Insurance experts point to various problems and hidden risks in
China's rapidly developing insurance industry. The founding of the
CIRC is expected to help develop and improve China's insurance
market, unify supervisory activities and establish a supervision
system suited to the development of the socialist market economy
in order to ensure the sustained and sound development of the
nation's insurance industry.

<HEADLINE> Grain Marketing Reform Yields Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved initial
results in reducing government losses for grain purchases by
launching nationwide reform of the grain marketing system.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics released by the China Agricultural
Development Bank (CADB) show no losses for purchases by state
grain companies since.
</P>
<P>
CABD loans for purchases of grain and edible oil have increased
on a monthly basis since June this year, according to an article
in today's "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
In terms of the summer harvest, the CADB has provided
sufficient loans for grain and rapeseed purchases in line with the
principle of "granting loans according to the volume of grain
purchased and collecting principal and interest in line with
market sales."
</P>
<P>
Government loans granted for purchases of grain and edible oil
over the past six months have equalled the purchasing value of the
two products.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring the grain distribution system represents a major
aspect of the central government's reform agenda for this year,
and is a main task for national economic development. Premier Zhu
Rongji has repeatedly stressed the importance and urgency for
reform of the grain marketing system.
</P>
<P>
The main problems with the nation's grain marketing system
center on the fact that state grain companies play a dual role
involving both storage and marketing, with the failure of
managements mechanisms to operate in line with the laws governing
market operations resulting in heavy financial losses.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that state grain companies have lost
more than 100 billion yuan over the past seven years due to poor
performance and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The central government has responded by adopting a series of
measures to reverse the trend. For example, state grain companies
with sole rights to purchase grain directly from farmers are now
required to purchase surplus grain at protected prices.
</P>
<P>
The CADB has also granted loans totalling 2.3 billion yuan
during the first 10 months of this year for constructing temporary
granaries.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Cotton Colorant Not Acceptable in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Export Board of Zambia
(EBZ) has cautioned local exporters against exporting azo dye, a
cotton colorant, to Europe because the product is no longer
acceptable on that market, The Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
EBZ public relations officer, Leonard Simwanda, said in Lusaka
Wednesday that the European Union (EU) was becoming increasingly
conscious of the repercussions culminating from the importation
of products that were environmentally hazardous.
</P>
<P>
Simwanda explained that azo dye had been discovered to be a
health hazard to both producers and consumers in the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said although there was a wide market, the dye had been
found to be "highly" infectious and this had prompted the EU to
ban any imports of the dye into its market.
</P>
<P>
It is suspected that the dye is linked to the manifestation of
bladder cancer among workers exposed to the colorant, according
to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Still Trying to Push for PAL-Cathay Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Thursday seemed determined to get Hong Kong-based Cathay
Pacific Airways to buy into Philippine Airline (PAL) despite the
breakdown of talks between the two airlines.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada told a press conference here that he remains
optimistic that the negotiations between the two airlines can
still be reopened when PAL chairman Lucio Tan returns from a trip
to Guam.
</P>
<P>
Cathay regional manager Peter Foster announced Wednesday the
pull-out of his company from six weeks of negotiations with PAL,
saying: "Certain issues could not be resolved." But he refused to
elaborate on these issues.
</P>
<P>
"The Cathay management wrote me a letter that they are still
available for another negotiations. So let us not lose hope," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said when Tan returns to the country, "maybe
there is still a chance for them (PAL and Cathay) to come to an
agreement."
</P>
<P>
"When we asked them (Cathay) for help during the (PAL) strike,
I asked for help from Cathay and they responded and helped solve
many problems of the business," he said.
</P>
<P>
PAL was temporarily closed in September, following the labor
union's refusal to accept an agreement offered by the management,
calling for a suspension on collective bargaining agreement for 10
years, in exchange for shares in the national flag carrier. The
airline resumed operation in early October.

<HEADLINE> Gates Donates 100 Million Dollars to Immunize Poor Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft founder Bill
Gates said Wednesday that he will donate 100 million U.S. dollars
to help vaccinate children in developing countries, according to
reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
"New life-saving vaccines quickly become available to children
in the developed world, but recent history shows us that children
in the developing world have to wait up to 15 years for the same
vaccine," Gates said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed,"We have a social imperative to work together
to address this basic inequality."
</P>
<P>
This is the second donation in a week that Gates and his wife
Melinda made. On November 25, they donated 20 million dollars to
the Seattle Public Library.
</P>
<P>
Bill Gates, who holds a 22 percent stake in the
65-billion-dollar Microsoft, is considered the richest man in
America and possibly the world.
</P>
<P>
Gates was once criticized for his lack of charity. But in
recent years, he has begun to make his mark as a philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, he established a two-billion-dollar William
H. Gates Foundation, which focuses on world health, population and
educational issues.
</P>
<P>
The Gates also established a 250-million-dollar Gates Library
Foundation to help libraries in poor communities gain access to
computer equipment and the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Opening Invigorating China: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
national newspaper, frontpaged an article hailing the
nation's opening policy as a highly successful approach to
invigorating the nation.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that China must make full use of
international and domestic markets and resources to supplement and
join the mainstream of the international economy.
</P>
<P>
The depth and breadth of the ongoing Asian financial crisis has
far exceeded people's predictions. The crisis has affected
China to some extent.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that China should persist in opening up
while continuing to strengthen the nation's ability to ward off
and prevent risks.
</P>
<P>
New problems and contradictions that have cropped up over the
past 20 years failed to restrict the further growth of China's
opening effort. The shift from a planned to a market economy, and
the shift in enterprise operational mechanism have not only
lagged behind demands for the opening drive, but have also
increased costs for opening.
</P>
<P>
A complete framework for micromanagement policies has not as
yet been formed, and direct administrative interference continues
to be so widespread as to reduce the effectiveness for resource
distribution.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the advantage of low cost labor in coastal areas
continues to weaken; an extensive foreign trade growth mode
cannot continue; and the structure of foreign-financed industries
is not rational.
</P>
<P>
The article noted: "The solutions to these problems lie in our
efforts to open wider to the outside world and to improve our
efficiency in opening up."
</P>
<P>
It called for a correct understanding of the relationship
between reform and opening, with the latter representing a
driving force behind the form. On the other hand, reform is the
precondition for opening.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Dominant Taliban Fail to Bring Peace to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the international arena, the Pashtoon-dominated Taliban are
faced with even greater challenges.
</P>
<P>
The growing hostility between Iran and the Taliban was further
heightened in August, after nine Iranian diplomats and a
journalist were killed by the Taliban during their capture of the
key northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the pro-Iran
northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of accusations fueled the tension between the two
sides and raised the likelihood of war. In a show of strength,
Iran amassed approximately 200,000 soldiers along the border with
an implied threat to avenge the killing of its diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Central Asian states and Russia have also made a high-profile
reaction to the Taliban's continuing onslaught against the
opposition forces in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in October
signed another security pact providing for coordinated efforts to
halt the spread of "aggressive extremism." The three countries,
along with Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, already have
Taliban-inspired treaties of mutual defense.
</P>
<P>
Even the Taliban's few foreign friends appear to be abandoning
the pariah regime. Saudi Arabia, one of the only three countries
(the other two being Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates) that
recognized the Taliban, essentially broke diplomatic ties with the
Taliban by recalling its envoy in Kabul and expelling the
militia's representative in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, considered to be the Taliban's closest friend
despite the government's repeated denial, there are consistent
strong voices urging the government to review its pro-Taliban
Afghan policy in order to straighten out its ties with other
regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, the friendly relations between Pakistan and Iran
were strained over the Taliban's killing of Iranian diplomats.
Tehran, openly holding both Pakistan and the Taliban responsible
for the killing of Iranians, has already reduced its diplomatic
presence in Pakistan due to "security problems."
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, in doldrums are the international peace
efforts in Afghanistan spearheaded by the United Nations. On one
hand, the Afghan warring factions have apparently abandoned the
idea of peaceful negotiations and this leaves little room of
maneuver for the outside brokers.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the already fragile mutual trust between
Pakistan and Iran, which, among all external players, are
universally recognized as the two countries who can exert the
greatest influence on Afghanistan, was seriously undermined by the
recent developments in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. and the international community as a whole have not
given up on Afghanistan," said James Ngobi, acting head of the
U.N. Special Mission on Afghanistan, in a speech here at the
Institute of Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
"We in the U.N. have observed that peace will not come to
Afghanistan through conquest by military force," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban could be persuaded, if they hold onto their
conquests, to institute programs under which they would establish
a genuine multi-ethnic and representative system of administration
under the revered Afghan traditional Shuras (consultation group)
at all levels, Ngobi said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important therefore that Iran and Pakistan should resume
their bilateral discussions on the Afghan crisis. In particular,
they should revive their joint peace initiative, which was
instituted following the breakdown of the Ulema (Islamic scholars)
Commission process (in May)."
</P>
<P>
As for the so-called six-plus-two group of countries
(Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus Russia and the United
States), he said, "the present geo-military stature in Afghanistan
should impel them closer towards common ground, rather than
diverge them on the basis of individually conceived interests."
</P>
<P>
"Unless the above-mentioned proposals are seriously considered
and given a fair chance as basic minima, I believe that not only
will prospects for a peaceful settlement recede, but progress on
other attendant issues will also be slowed down," the U.N.
official concluded.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Dominant Taliban Fail to Bring Peace to Afghanistan (1)  By Yang Shilong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- With fighting, blood, death,
exodus, frustration and destruction, the year of 1998, just like
the past 20 years, meant anything but peace for tens of millions
of war-weary Afghans.
</P>
<P>
With the freezing winter approaching, fighting has escalated
over the recent weeks in northern Afghanistan between the dominant
Islamic Taliban and the opposition forces loyal to former Afghan
military chief Ahmad Masood as both sides attempted to secure
supply routes around the Hindu Kush mountain range.
</P>
<P>
Masood's spokesman Monday claimed that they have extended a
push across the far north after a popular revolt involving more
than 1,000 locals in Jouzjan province left 40 Taliban dead and
another 200 imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
The claim, if confirmed, would be the latest blow to the
Taliban, who now control more than 90 percent of Afghanistan
including the capital of Kabul following their sweeping victories
in the past few months in the north.
</P>
<P>
The hard-line militia have recently just admitted that Masood
had made extensive gains in the far northern Kunduz province
bordering Tajikistan. Both Kunduz and Jouzjan, which borders
neighboring Uzbekistan, encompass intricate supply routes linking
the north with Masood's stronghold in the Panjsher Valley.
</P>
<P>
The recent military advance by the Masood forces in northern
Afghanistan "is not only because of Masood's military acumen, but
is due to the Taliban's failure to introduce a political system
providing more space to the locals for accommodation," said
Zarghoon Shah Shinwari, an Afghan intellectual and journalist
working at a Pakistan-based Afghan research organization, in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
"With their rigid policies the Taliban are not in a position to
bring real peace to Afghanistan and successfully rule the
country," Shinwari said.
</P>
<P>
Shinwari is not alone in describing a less rosy future for the
formidable Taliban who suddenly rose to the Afghan political scene
in 1994 and vowed to impose their self-styled strict Islamic rule
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Most observers here held that the Taliban militia might be able
to bring the remaining areas under their control. Yet given their
limited vision and experience of domestic governance and foreign
relations maneuvers, the Taliban's difficulties would increase,
not to say that the military balance in Afghanistan could be
changed any time as in the past.
</P>
<P>
One cannot deny that the puritanical Taliban did a good job in
improving law and order in areas under their writ but the present
situation has brought new demands to the forefront. Most Afghans
are least interested in the military conquests highly projected by
Taliban-controlled Radio Sharia. Instead, they want food for their
empty stomach, education for their children, rehabilitation of
their country, health and welfare facilities, and jobs and
business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban administration, seemingly more interested
in the strict implementation of the Islamic punishment, has not so
far presented any practical and feasible program to restore the
economy riddled by sky-rocketing prices of essential items, the
structureless banking system and the almost worthless Afghan
currency.

KATHMANDU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Nepal by
air reached 360,875 in the first 11 months of this year, up 11.8
percent over the same period of last year, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
During this period, tourist arrivals from other countries
excluding India grew by 12.6 percent to 231,236 while those from
neighboring India were 129,639, up 10.3 percent, according to
figures provided Thursday by the Department of Tourism.

Tourist arrivals in Nepal stood at 28,883, 33,145, 53,314 and

<HEADLINE> F16s Lease to Cost New Zealand 424M U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The 28 F16 fighter bombers
the New Zealand government plans to lease from the United States
for 10 years with an option to buy will cost 800 million NZ
dollars (424 million U.S. dollars) by the year 2011, according to
the Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper Thursday quoted a spokesman for
New Zealand Defense Minister Max Bradford as saying the F16
fighter bombers, which will be acquired to replace the NZ Air
Force's 19 aging Skyhawk aircraft, were built for the Pakistan Air
Force but never delivered.
</P>
<P>
He told the Post the figure of 800 million NZ dollars
comprises:
</P>
<P>
-- A 10-year lease at 12.5 million NZ dollars a year, totaling
125 million NZ dollars;
</P>
<P>
-- Up to 204 million NZ dollars getting the planes operational,
which includes overhauling the engines, acquiring spares, support
and training of pilots and ground crew;
</P>
<P>
-- An option to buy at the end of 10 years at about 140 million
 U.S. dollars (264 million NZ dollars at the current exchange
rate); and
</P>
<P>
--About 200 million NZ dollars in operating costs.
</P>
<P>
The Post said the New Zealand Air Force intends to operate only
 22 of the aircraft. The other six will be kept as "attrition
aircraft" or broken down for spares.
</P>

The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Thursday that
the F16 fighters New Zealand will lease "are ready to fly without
 modifications".
</P>
<P>
They were built in two lots, in 1989 and 1992. Though they were
early models, they incorporated all the modifications and
upgrades included since the first F16s were built in 1974, the
NZPA said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand will take delivery of the fighters in 2001 if the
deal is done, it added.

<HEADLINE> Workload Bigger Worry Than Money: New Zealand Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Workloads, stress and lack
of time for research are of even more concern to university
academic staff than salaries in New Zealand, the Dominion reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper said that a survey conducted by
the New Zealand Council for Educational Research, finds that
academic staff work an average of 53 hours a week and expect this
to continue, to the detriment of research.
</P>
<P>
It also finds that the main concern of academics about salaries
is that they are no longer competitive with international
universities, or the private sector and professions.
</P>
<P>
The survey says 40 percent of university academic staff suffer
frequent job stress, with work-related illness or injury up from
30 percent in a 1994 survey to 40 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of academic staff take work home and about a
third of general staff, who average 40 hours, work unpaid
overtime. More than half of academic and support staff such as
technicians think they are underpaid.
</P>
<P>
President-elect Jane Kelsey of the New Zealand Association of
University Staff was quoted as saying that the ability of New
Zealand universities to recruit overseas will be severely limited
if workloads and stress continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
Massive workloads are endangering staff health and
universities' future viability, she said.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered a random sample of 30 percent of academics
and technicians and half of support staff in all seven
universities. The response rate was 55 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Coal Sales Plunging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's total coal
sales in the third quarter this year were down 21 percent on the
same quarter last year, according to Statistics New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
In a media release issued Thursday, deputy government
statistician Ian Ewing said the latest energy statistics showed
sales of sub-bituminous coal were down 27.5 percent because of a
fall in the amount of thermal electricity generated, and sales of
bituminous coal were 21.3 less because of a decline in exports.
</P>
<P>
Electricity generation in the third quarter was 4.2 percent
lower than the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
"The flat state of the New Zealand economy may have contributed
to this lower demand for electricity," Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
Hydro generation in New Zealand rose 9.8 percent with high
South Island lake levels compared with 1997 levels. However, this
was more than offset by thermal generation, 27.6 less.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of refined petrol produced during the third
quarter was down 5.3 percent compared with the corresponding
period of last year. Regular petrol refining (91 octane) was 8.4
percent lower, while premium petrol (94 octane) refining was five
percent higher.

YANGON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar athletes will take part
in the 13th Asian Games scheduled to be held from December 6 to
20 in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50 Myanmar athletes will compete in only five
categories which are rowing, sepak takraw, women's weightlifting,
women's taekwondo and women's archery.
</P>
<P>
When meeting here Wednesday with members of the Myanmar sports
contingent taking part in the games, Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, stressed that the aim of sending them to the games is to
win medals rather than gaining experiences merely as in the past.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of the Myanmar National
Olympic Council, admitted that camp training was given only to
athletes of 10 categories though Myanmar can take part in 27
sports categories of the 36 to be competed in the games, taking
into consideration of the prospects to win medals.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 categories, only 50 athletes of five categories, who
have high hopes to win medals, were selected to take part in the
games, he said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar athletes won a total of 190 medals during the last two
years after the Ministry of Sports was established in December
1996 and 63 sports contigents sent abroad for contests since
then.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Outlines Agenda for Next APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley has outlined the agenda for the APEC Leaders'
Informal Meeting to be held in New Zealand next September.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a businessmen's gathering in Christchurch, the
biggest city in New Zealand's South Island, Shipley said Thursday
that as APEC Chair in 1999, New Zealand "can shape the APEC agenda
to restore confidence in our region".
</P>
<P>
In her speech, which was released here by the Prime Minister's
Office, Shipley said the agenda New Zealand has set covers four
important areas. In 1999 New Zealand wants to see:
</P>
<P>
-- further substantive progress towards reducing the barriers
to and costs of trade and investment;
</P>
<P>
-- a credible APEC response to the economic crisis;
</P>
<P>
-- strengthening of the institutions and human resources in
this region to deal with the economic challenges APEC members all
face; and
</P>
<P>
-- The building of broader support for APEC among the wider
communities.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined and confident that we should undertake our
chairing responsibilities with a sense of flair as well as
professionalism. As host economy in 1999 we will chair all of the
Ministerial meetings and the Leaders' summit," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility to carry forward the existing work of
the group and the outcomes from Kuala Lumpur provide a platform
for doing this," Shipley added.
</P>
<P>
Realistically, the New Zealand prime minister added, "we can
not expect APEC to make a great leap forward each year.
Incremental progress, while not as exciting or headline grabbing,
may prove more significant and sustainable in the long run."

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Supports EU Initiative to Try Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said on Wednesday that he backed the European Union (EU)
initiative to try Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan before an
international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Opening a Lower House debate over the Ocalan case, D'Alema said
the EU initiative would contribute to a peaceful solution to the
dispute with Turkey which wants him extradited on terrorism
charges.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema, who discussed the initiative with other EU nations,
said the proposal would be "of great value" because the crisis was
not related to Italy or Turkey alone, but to all European nations.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Prime Minister told deputies that Italy was ready
to support the Kurdish people, but "this does not mean to support
of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained in Rome on November 12 under international
arrest warrants issued by Germany and Turkey, but Germany later
said it would not seek Ocalan's extradition.
</P>
<P>
Italian law forbids extradition to a country that practices
the death penalty, which is in force in Turkey.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Provide Loan for Bangladesh Mangrove Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has approved a 37 million U.S. dollar loan for a project of the
Bangladesh's Sundarbans Reserve Forest, part of the world's
largest remaining mangrove area, an ADB official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With this loan, Bangladesh will develop a sustainable
management and biodiversity conservation system of the Sundarbans,
situated in the southwestern part of the country, the ADB official
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladesh will use the loan to introduce modern
management systems involving all stakeholders in 17 sub-districts
around the forest.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is also providing a technical assistance grant of
570,000 dollars to determine a future option for the Sundarbans'
development.
</P>
<P>
The participatory systems will conserve and manage the forest
and its biodiversity as a multi-dimensional resource.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000 square kilometer mangrove area provides a subsistence
living for 3.5 million people, offers protection from cyclones in
Southwest Bangladesh and is rich in biodiversity and natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
As a globally significant ecosystem, the Sundarbans Reserve
Forest contains habitats for fish, shrimps, birds and other
wildlife, including the largest remaining population of the highly
endangered Bengal tiger.
</P>
<P>
The resources of the forest are being depleted through
increasing use by commercial wood processors, rural communities
bordering the forest and subsistence fisher-folk from the Bay of
Bengal.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Contribute to IMF Rescue Plan for Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia is to lend up to
half a billion Australian dollars (300 million U.S. dollars) to an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue package for Brazil,
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the loan is an interim measure under the IMF New
Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), which he chairs, and the funds
should be repaid early in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"They are being provided at an above-market interest rate,"
Costello said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The NAB came into effect just two weeks ago following
ratification by the United States and Germany, bringing together
25 developed nations into a more streamlined operation for
assisting with IMF financial rescue packages.
</P>
<P>
The Brazil package is the first time the NAB had been
activated, as members have agreed to provide up to 19.9 billion
Australian dollars (12 billion U.S. dollars), the treasurer said
in a separate statement.
</P>
<P>
"The total funding being provided by the IMF to Brazil in
support of its reform program is 17.89 billion U.S. dollars. The
World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and a group of
bilateral supporters will also provide assistance to Brazil in
conjunction with the IMF, " the treasurer said.
</P>
<P>
"The total support from all official sources is around 41.6
billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
The treasurer defended Australia's assistance for a country far
removed from its local region. "Our membership of the NAB
represents a global obligation and the Brazilian program is
crucial for efforts to control the current international financial
crisis, which began in Asia but has since spread more widely."
</P>
<P>
"Stability in Brazil is important for stability elsewhere in
Latin America and for stability in the international financial
system," he added.
</P>
<P>
Although Australia has contributed billions of dollars to IMF
rescue packages for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea during the
past year, this is the first time it is to lend money to help a
country outside Asia.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Rescue Package for Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) decided Wednesday to help revive Brazil's economy with
a fresh cash injection of 18.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An IMF statement said the credit line is part of a 41.5 billion
dollars international rescue package agreed upon on November 13 by
officials of the IMF and the largest Latin American economy.
</P>
<P>
Of the newly earmarked money, 5.3 billion dollars would be
available immediately and an additional 4.5 billion dollars at the
end of February, after government reform programs are reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Additional payments by the IMF are scheduled later in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, however, can have access to the second installment
before February if the government decides it cannot wait for the
funds and receives the IMF governing board's approval.
</P>
<P>
The three-year IMF rescue package committed Brazil to avert a
devaluation of its currency by reducing its 65 million dollars
budget deficit through spending cuts, tax hikes and other measures.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
would contribute 4.5 billion dollars each to the package, with a
further 14.5 billion dollars to come from other donor nations.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest contributor among these
countries with a commitment of five billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Encourages Counter-Trade Deals With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government encourages
state firms to pursue counter-trade deals with the European Union
for Thai agricultural products that will face higher tariffs
staring from January 1, 1999, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Counter-trade would also help state enterprises save money, The
Bangkok Post Thursday quoted Apinant Pavanarit, director-general
of the European Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, meanwhile, is looking for new markets in Eastern
Europe and Latin America for Thai agricultural products to offset
possible declines in the EU once tariffs increase, Apinant said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is removing three major Thai export sectors -- fishery
products, fresh fruit and vegetables, and cut flowers -- from its
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Under the GSP designed to
help the beneficiaries build markets abroad, developing countries
can export certain products to the EU at lower tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Apinant met on Wednesday with representatives of 14 state
enterprises to promote the counter-trade idea. The 14 enterprises
include the Communications Authority of Thailand, Thai Airways
International, Metropolitan Rapid Transit Authority, Electricity
Generating Authority, State Railway of Thailand and the Port
Authority of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Apinant reaffirmed that the ministry would continue to lobby
the EU to postpone the GSP removal until 2001. But Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said last week that the effort
would be futile.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the government should concentrate instead on
lobbying the EU to make comprehensive changes in its tariff
structure. He argued that EU tariffs on many imported goods are
much higher than in markets such as North America and Australia.

Meanwhile, other officials noted that Latin America had not
been affected by an arms race after the United States lifted the
ban on weapons sales to the region.
</P>

In July last year, U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted a 20-year
ban on sales of advanced weapons in the wake of Latin America's
shift from military dictatorships to elected civilian governments.

On his part, Chilean Defense Minister Jose Florencio Guzman

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Petar Djokic, president of the
Bosnian Serb parliament, on Wednesday condemned NATO's
Stabilization Force (SFOR) for arresting the Republika Srpska's
most senior military figure.
</P>
<P>
General Radislav Krstic, commander of the 5th Corps of the
Bosnian Serb Army, was arrested on his way to a general staff
meeting near Bijeljina, in the north of the Bosnian Serb republic
controlled by U.S. troops serving in SFOR, around midday Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal for
genocide, complicity to commit genocide, extermination, murder,
and persecution for his alleged personal involvement in atrocities
and his command of troops carrying out massacres.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjug news agency, Djokic said, "General Radislav
Krstic's name was never placed on any list of war criminals by the
international criminal tribunal in The Hague."
</P>
<P>
He noted that this behavior of international forces "brings
uncertainty to people, a feeling that every citizen of the
(Bosnian) Serb republic can be regarded as a potential war
criminal in the eyes of the tribunal, and that SFOR is authorized
to arrest anybody, anytime, anywhere."

Tanjug reported that Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY),
verified Wednesday in The Hague that Krstic was arrested on a
secret indictment issued by her on October 30 and confirmed by a
judge three days later. But the document was kept sealed until
Wednesday in order to facilitate his arrest, she revealed.
</P>
<P>
"Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice", NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Wednesday after the arrest,
adding that Krstic would be sent to The Hague tribunal for trial.
</P>
<P>
Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by peace-keeping forces. He was named head of
the Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.

<HEADLINE> Bolivians Celebrate UNESCO's Naming of World Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAMAIPATA, Bolivia, December 2 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 people
gathered here on Wednesday for a party after the United Nations
Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO) declared an
ancient fort in Bolivia a world heritage site.
</P>
<P>
The Samaipata fort, 120 kilometers southeast of the city of
Santa Cruz, was built under several pre-Incan cultures although
the Incas lived on the site when the Spanish first landed in
America in 1542.
</P>
<P>
The fort was built on a militarily strategic site, based on a
hill 1,900 meters above sea level overlooking all routes leading
from the valleys to the tropical jungle.
</P>
<P>
A 200-meter long and 90-meter wide building inside the fort is
adorned with zoomorphic figures representing felines and snakes.
</P>
<P>
Samaipata received its new status at the 22nd UNESCO meeting
held on Wednesday in the Japanese city of Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
The fort is made up of two sites, the hill which with its
ancient engravings could have been a ceremonial site of the
ancient city in the 14th and 15th centuries, and a zone south of
the hill which was possibly its administrative and residential
district.
</P>
<P>
Samaipata mayor Alfonso Banegas said the fort was used as a
ceremonial site by various cultures for moon and water worship.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Port No Longer Suffering From Traffic Jams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- One of the greatest changes at
the port of Shanghai in the past two decades, according to Wan
Jiazhong, a ship captain for COSCO Shanghai, is the lack of
traffic jams on the sea lanes.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wan explains, in the past they often had to wait
offshore for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
From the late '70s to the early '80s, Shanghai had some of the
worst traffic jams in its harbor with the rapidly-growing number
of vessels coming in owing to the boom in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 vessels could be often seen moored offshore in
the Yangtze River mouth, recalls Li Jisan, and this did not help
the port's name and caused considerable losses.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the bottle-neck problem, the government spent 8.46
billion yuan (1.02 billion US dollars) expanding the port's docks
and berths, which can now handle 930,000 tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the port has handled more than 100 million tons of
goods annually and has become the world's 11th largest container
port. It is expected to handle 3 million TEUs this year.
</P>
<P>
It has forged business ties with more than 400 ports and 600
shipping companies in over 160 foreign countries and regions and
with the new information network, the amount of time required to
handle vessels has been cut drastically.
</P>
<P>
Vessels had to stay in the port an average of 9.5 days, some 20
years ago, but that time has now been shortened to 1.9 days.
</P>
<P>
Captain Wan Jiazhong says that his container ship normally
stays in the port about 12 hours, and sometimes, needs only 5 or 6
hours.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Report Accuses Tamil Rebels of Intransigence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) Wednesday accused the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) of delaying a solution to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka
by constantly refusing to negotiate a political solution.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the LTTE remains implacable in its refusal to
accept any political solution short of a separate state and
engages in armed violence to support its position, it is difficult
to end the conflict situation," the UNDP said in the National
Human Development Report on Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The 88-page report, compiled by a group of independent experts,
said the LTTE deliberately attacked institutions in areas outside
the northern and eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 15-year war for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The report urged expatriate Tamils, foreign governments and
diplomatic circles to exert pressure on the LTTE to cease
violence, tolerate democratic Tamil political parties and
negotiate a political settlement rather than insist on a separate
state.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the need for a broad consensus on a political
solution to the conflict among the people including the government
and other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's relatively high level of social development was
praised by the report.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP said the contents of the report remain the
responsibility of the independent analysts who compiled it after
extensive investigations and research.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia's new government
Wednesday approved NATO's request to deploy in Macedonia rapid
reation troops for possible intervention in Kosovo, according to
news reports from the Macedonian capital of Skopje.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big decision made by the new government at the very
beginning of its mandate but it will contribute to Macedonia's
speedier integration with NATO," said Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski, when announcing the decision following a cabinet
discussion on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new government was formed after a recent election and won a
confidence vote in parliament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As called for by a NATO decision on November 13, a 1,700-
member rapid reaction force will be deployed in Macedonia, which
neighbors Kosovo, to protect the 2,000 monitors of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
assigned to the Yugoslav province in case they are at risk there.
</P>
<P>
After NATO Secretary-general Javier Solana struck a deal with
Macedonia President Kiro Gligorov and Prime Minister Georgievski,
a 30-member advance team arrived in Skopje on November 28 to
prepare for the arrival of the rapid reaction troops.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Help Finance Second Bridge Over Danube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is prepared to help pay
for a second bridge crossing over the Danube linking up with
Romania, Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Evgenii Bakurdjiev said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-day conference with Romanian and Greek
ministers charged with environment and communications, Bakurdjiev
said the construction could be completed within three years and
the cost was estimated at 120 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said 60 million dollars would come from the European
Investment Bank, another 30 million dollars from European Union
bodies, and the rest, accounting for no more than 30 million
dollars, would be committed by Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and Romania, sharing 400 kilometers of the Danube as
their border, had proposed to jointly build a second bridge to
ease the burden on the old bridge, but the proposal was deadlocked
over disagreement on the choice of bridge site.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Minister of Water, Forests and Environment Romulus
Tomescu, who attended the three-nation meeting, has expressed his
discontent with the site Bulgaria selected, hoping that the two
nations could continue to work out a better choice.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the trilateral meeting also adopted a joint
declaration to establish three working groups made up of
Bulgarian, Romanian and Greek experts to speed up implementation
of joint infrastructure, transport and environmental projects.

OTTAWA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- FIFA has approved Winnipeg's
plans for next July's Pan American Games soccer matches in
Winnipeg, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Organizers got FIFA's approval after they promised to improve
their soccer facilities.
</P>
<P>
In earlier this Autumn, FIFA representative Hugo Salceda and
sports delegates from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay inspected two
stadiums for the Game's soccer match and pointed out that the
sites were lack of permanent seats.
</P>
<P>
Organizers argued that adding permanent seats would severely
damage the playing field but finally they agreed to install
between 2,500 and over 3,000 permanent seats at the Waverley
soccer complex.
</P>
<P>
They also promised to improve an indoor warm-up facility, add
more on-field media positions and enhance lighting for television.
</P>
<P>
The two playing fields were for men's and women's soccer
matches respectively. Initially, organizers only provided one
field for both.
</P>
<P>
5,000 athletes from 42 countries will compete in 41 events in
the XIII Pan American Games from next July 23 to August 8 in

<HEADLINE> Tourists to Indonesia Down 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign tourists
coming to Indonesia slumped by about 19 percent to 2.91 million
during the first 10 months of this year, from 3.56 million during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Ministry of Art and Culture on
Wednesday, the lowest level of tourist arrivals was recorded in
May when massive unrest hit Jakarta and forced the resignation of
former Indonesia President Soeharto. Only 226,700 foreign tourists
visited the country during the month.
</P>
<P>
The peak level was recorded in August when tourist arrivals
reached 352,500, national newspapers Thursday quoted the
ministry's report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange receipts from tourism in the January to
October period were estimated at 2.94 billion U.S. dollars, 19.5
percent less than the 3.65 billion dollars recorded in the same
period last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The unfavorable political situation in the country has posed a
serious obstacle to tourism development and promotion. This has
prompted the Art and Culture Ministry to take precautionary
measures including the setting up of a crisis center and promotion
through Let's Go Indonesia and Indonesia Spectacular in
association with the national tourism industry, including the
Hotels and Restaurants Association and the Association of
Indonesian Tour and Travel Agencies.

<HEADLINE> Senior Democrat Says Memos Not Relevant to Clinton Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The ranking Democrat on the
U.S. House Judiciary Committee said on Wednesday that a review of
secret campaign finance memos had found they were not "in any way
relevant" to the inquiry into President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Conyers said the review by Democratic
counsel Kevin Simpson had not found anything in the documents to
merit consideration by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that this closes a short and unproductive chapter in
the history of this very strange proceeding," Conyers said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Simpson and Republican chief investigative
counsel David Schippers read the memos on potential White House
fund-raising irregularities during Clinton's 1996 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Republican committee members had no immediate reaction
Wednesday after Schippers viewed the memos.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled earlier
Wednesday that one Republican and one Democratic staff member
could see the memos, but could not make copies or take notes and
had to report the contents only to Chairman Henry Hyde and ranking
Democrat John Conyers.
</P>
<P>
The memos, written by FBI Director Louis Freeh and former
campaign finance task force head Charles LaBella, recommended the
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the White
House fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
Republicans subpoenaed the documents after receiving a tip that
the memos, which include confidential information from grand
juries under Johnson's jurisdiction, might contain evidence of
criminal wrongdoing by Clinton. They have also subpoenaed Freeh
and LaBella to give closed-door depositions.
</P>
<P>
"The majority's sudden lurch into the subject of campaign
finance is ill-advised and simply a last-ditch attempt to
resuscitate a dying investigation," Conyers said.

<HEADLINE> More Accurate Predictions Help Keep Earthquake Casualties Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMIN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Timely pre-warning of recent
earthquakes in Yunnan Province in southwest China has helped keep
the number of casualties down, a senior seismologist said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He Xihu, vice-director of the Yunnan Seismology Bureau, said
that seismologists in the predicted that earthquakes measuring 5.9
would hit Ninglang County before November 20 and warned local
people.
</P>
<P>
On November 19, two tremors measuring 5.0 and 6.2 hit 13
townships in the area, killing three and injuring 1,381. This was
the smallest number of deaths for all earthquakes of the same
magnitude that have hit the province, He said.
</P>
<P>
The local government got the warning a week ahead of time and
was able to act to get people out of old houses and a
round-the-clock watch was started. The two earthquakes damaged
17,500 houses, 395 school buildings, some water conservation
projects, bridges, and highways, causing economic losses of 590
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The low mortality rate can also be attributed to the time, he
said. The first quake hit at 19:31 on November 19, and many people
ran out to open fields before the second, stronger quake hit seven
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Quick rescue work also helped. In less than five hours, rescue
workers got to the scene and rushed people with serious injuries
to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan lies in an earthquake belt, along with Gansu, Shaanxi
and Sichuan provinces, and this is an active period for
earthquakes.

SANTIAGO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Building up of inventories
worldwide has downed copper prices to the 11-year low of average
69.4 cents a pound, the Chilean Copper Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As accumulated inventories of copper in New York and London had
reached over 150,000 metric tons this year, the commission said,
prices were hovering around 70 cents per pound in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Although far below the expected price of 92 cents a pound, the
recent dip was within expectations, it said. The average so far
this year is 75.66 cents, within the predicted 75-80 cents range.
</P>
<P>
Chile, a leading copper producer in the world, receives 40
percent of the government revenues from copper.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Copper Commission said it expects copper prices to
go up in December and to average over 75 cents per pound for the
year, and further up to 70-75 cents next year and through year
2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan has urged Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
members to be ready to make political and economic changes, The
Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN "has to be ready to make adjustments" or it risks being
compelled to do so by force beyond its control, Surin was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot sit still and take comfort behind the status quo or
continue to do business as usual. We all must be prepared to
adjust ourselves and accommodate the pressures and demands of the
changing times," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Being willing to adjust yourself is better than being dictated
to adjust," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members, he said, must be prepared to heed calls "for
reform, for greater democracy and for wider participation of our
peoples in the political and economic processes."
</P>
<P>
Surin was speaking at a two-day conference of Asian
intellectuals convened to discuss the Asian economic crisis by the
Japan Center for International Exchange and the Singapore-based
Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.
</P>
<P>
Delving into the history of ASEAN, Surin said, "in the
beginning, 30 or 31 years ago, diversity of ASEAN was our strength
-- the fact that we were different. Lately, particularly,
political diversity has become our problem."
</P>
<P>
But he said adapting and adjusting to globalization does not
mean that traditions and values that reflect the best of ASEAN
societies need no longer be protected and conserved.

<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Wednesday that it has decided to seek financial penalties
against Luxembourg for violating the European Union's social law.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive body, said Luxembourg has
failed to comply with a previous European Court judgement
concerning Luxembourg nationality requirement for the access to
employment in certain parts of the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposed that the European Court fix a fine of
14,000 European currency units (equivalent to about 16,380
U.S. dollars) for each day of non-compliance with the second
judgement of the court under an EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg was judged by the court in 1996 as violating Article
48 of the treaty for reserving jobs in certain parts of the public
sector for its own nationals.
</P>
<P>
However, although almost two years have passed, the EU said,
Luxembourg has not adopted necessary measures to comply with the
judgement and allow European citizens access to the public service.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the commission has sought the European
Court's imposition of a daily fine on a member state in the social
area.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors in U.S. Real Estate More Cautious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners planning
investment in U.S. real estate in 1999 are somewhat more cautious
than they were last year, according to a survey released Wednesday
by the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate (AFIRE).
</P>
<P>
This is against the background of a new wave of opportunities
for foreign investors in U.S. real estate created by their
domestic turmoil in both real estate investment trusts (REITs) and
real estate capital markets.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the optimism of foreign investors
has been tempered by continuing concerns about a global
recession," said AFIRE.
</P>
<P>
Of the 145 AFIRE members representing 17 countries, only 42
percent of respondents to the survey said they would increase
their investment in 1999, as compared with 67 percent in 1997 who
said they would increase their investment in the forthcoming year.
</P>
<P>
With over 22 billion U.S. dollars invested in the country's
real estate, AFIRER's member investments represent nearly two
thirds of all direct foreign investment in U.S. real estate.
</P>
<P>
Last year at this time, AFIRE said, foreign investors faced
fewer opportunities due to very strong competition from REITs that
reduced inventory and sent prices sky-rocketing. But this year,
the product is more accessible.
</P>
<P>
Office buildings were ranked as the number one investment
opportunity in the U.S. today, and 37 percent of respondents said
they would add office buildings to their portfolio in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But their interest in industrial and hotel properties is
declining, with only 3 percent have hotels on their list.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, survey respondents picked multi-family properties as
the second most attractive real estate product in the U.S. today.
Since 1995, it has been in the third, fourth or fifth position.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Host Regional Telecom Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Telecommunications Commission (CITEL) will meet here on December
7-11 to chart the growth of the sector in South and North America.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's National Telecommunications Council President Daniel
Rodriguez said on Wednesday that the meeting is expected to boost
the growth of communications in the region and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador,
the United States, Grenada, Honduras, Mexico and Paraguay are
expected to join the regional event, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will enable the Ecuadoran authorities to learn from
experiences of other Latin American countries in privatizing and
modernizing the telecommunications sector, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador is restructuring and updating its telecom network. But
the government's efforts to sell the state-run telecom operation
or part of its shares failed months ago.
</P>
<P>
The government is now planning to revise the existing laws to
facilitate a privatization program in the first quarter of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Kidd Gets Permission to Talk with Blackburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Manchester United have relented in the battle to hang on to
manager Alex Ferguson's assistant Brian Kidd.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn was given permission Wednesday to discuss the Ewood
Park managerial vacancy with Kidd, linked with the Rovers post
after the sacking of former chief Roy Hodgson.
</P>
<P>
The news was released following Blackburn's 1-0 defeat in the
Worthington Cup semi-final at Leicester on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Rovers club chairman Robert Coar said: "We have received
permission tonight from Manchester United to speak to Brian Kidd.
</P>
<P>
"During the next 24 hours, we will be meeting Brian Kidd. That
is all the club are saying on this matter at this time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United have been reluctant to part with Kidd, with
approaches having been made by Everton last summer and Manchester
City.
</P>
<P>
Kidd spent Wednesday night alongside Alex Ferguson, possibly
for the last time, as United also went out of the Worthington Cup
at Spurs.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson had been keen to hang onto his loyal lieutenant, and
had earlier said: "We do not want to lose Brian. He is very
important to United.
</P>
<P>
"We have built up an excellent staff and Brian has been a key
part, " he said.
</P>
<P>
United initially rejected Rovers' approach for Kidd, who has
been Ferguson's right-hand man for almost eight years.
</P>
<P>
Kidd has long been tipped, along with Middlesbrough boss Bryan
Robson, as a possible successor to Ferguson when the United
manager decides to retire.

<P>
COLOMBO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) Wednesday issued a Sri Lankan Human Development Report
prepared by a group of independent experts, the official Daily
News said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The group includes a six-member national team, an international
consultant from the U.N. Children's Fund, India and a special
consultative committee headed by former UNDP Resident
Representative Arve Ofstad.
</P>
<P>
Head of the six-member national team Harsha Aturupane said the
88-page report is an analysis of human development in terms of
achievements, poverty levels and gender empowerment, categorized
by regional, district and provincial dimensions.
</P>
<P>
UNDP Resident Representative Peter Witham in his comments on
the report observed that dimensions may have been omitted in this
maiden summary and are expected to be incorporated in its future
analytical reports.
</P>
<P>
Witham pointed out that the main aim of the report is to
basically depict the current social and economic situation of the
country and to stimulate strategies for development activities
based on the country's identified strengths and weakness.

<HEADLINE> China Displaying Its Best Tomb Frescoes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China will put its most treasured
ancient frescoes on display in Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi History Museum is planning on turning an
underground hall into a 3,000-square meter exhibition center for
the original frescoes from tombs of the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The 540 frescoes have been kept in a museum storehouse that
only a few scholars and distinguished overseas guests could see.
</P>
<P>
It has some of the most precious frescoes in the world,
according to Feng Gengwu, the deputy curator of the museum, which
has 18 state treasures among them and 82 that are designated as
class-one cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have found beautiful frescoes inside tombs,
especially from the Tang, one of China's most prosperous
periods. In Shaanxi they have excavated 66 Tang tombs that have
frescoes, which provide a panorama of people's lives in the Tang
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
One purpose of the exhibition is to put the frescoes in a
better place because the storehouse is not ideal for preservation
or display, Feng explains.

<P>
After the frescoes were moved from the plastered wall it was
difficult to preserve them, so museum authorities built the
1,500-sq.m. storehouse in 1992. Even moving the giant cabinets
that original held the frescoes can do some damage, Feng says.
</P>
<P>
Protecting frescoes is now a business with world-class
difficulties, according to Shen Qinyan, director of the museum's
fresco research center, and they are focusing on problems like
fading colors and a peeling coat.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese cultural relics research institute has cooperated
with the museum in finding ways of protecting them and has
provided equipment to analyze the colors, and some progress has
been made.
</P>
<P>
But, researchers still want visitors to be able to see the
treasures as a whole, so Shen says, they will recreate tomb
passages in the proposed exhibition hall and put the frescoes on
the wall.
</P>
<P>
The museum estimates the total cost at 25 million yuan (3
million U.S. dollars). Cultural organizations from Italy and
France have also shown an interest in the endeavor.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Party Hopes to Win 1999 General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's United Development
Party (PPP) wound up its fourth congress Wednesday night with a
strong commitment to bring the party toward a better future and
win next year's general election.
</P>
<P>
"We have two political agenda items to safeguard," said the
Muslim-backed party's newly-elected General Chairman Hamzah Haz at
the closing ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
He said the agenda items are the June 1999 general election and
the presidential and vice presidential nominations in the general
assembly of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) by the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah, now the state minister of investment, defeated his main
rival, Food and Horticulture Minister Ahmad Muflih Saefuddin, by a
majority of votes at Wednesday's election.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah expressed optimism that the party could increase the
votes in the upcoming polls if all members of the newly-formed PPP
Executive Board along with its loyal cadres and followers work
hard.
</P>
<P>
"We have the responsibility to enable this party to gain more
votes than it had achieved in the 1997 elections in which it
managed only to secure 22.5 percent," he was quoted by Antara News
Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
One of the only three political parties allowed under former
President Soeharto's rule, PPP always ranked second to the ruling
Golkar (Functional Group) in general elections. The party got 89
seats in the 500-member House of Representatives in last year's
election.
</P>
<P>
PPP was formed from the fusion of four Islamic political
parties and organizations in 1973. They were Nahdlatul Ulama (NU),
Muslimin Indonesia (MI), Perti and Syarikat Islam.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah's victory marked the first time that a member of the NU
camp assumes the party's top post since the party's birth. In the
past, the party was never chaired by NU cadres despite the fact
the NU became the main source of PPP votes in every general
election and Hamzah supporters warned the congress if Hamzah was
not elected, there would be a significant decline in the PPP vote.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hamzah's victory, a political analyst from the
Indonesian Institute of Science Indria Samego said any NU cadre
could have won the PPP chairmanship at every congress if there had
been no interference from the government.
</P>
<P>
Under former President Soeharto, no politician was able to lead
the party if the government did not like him, Samego was quoted by
the Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah's election raised hopes that he would draw NU members
back to PPP, the Jakarta Post said, adding that NU members'
political affiliations have become increasingly scattered, with
some joining the ruling Golkar, others signing up with the new
crop of parties and some keeping neutral.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility that PPP would be allied with such Islamic
political parties as the NU-backed National Awakening Party and
the National Mandate Party led by Amien Rais, Hamzah said PPP
welcomed cooperation with any party.
</P>
<P>
"We are open for whoever. The most important thing is that we
must have good access to the elections. If we only get five or 10
percent of the votes, it would be meaningless because nobody would
then respect us," he added.

RIO DE JANEIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will
provide Brazil with 165 million U.S. dollars in loan to help the
country fight against AIDS, the Jornal do Brasil daily reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Health Minister Jose Serra will sign the loan
agreement next week in Washington.
</P>

The loan will be used to fund the 1999-2002 AIDS program phase
II, which will focus on preventing contagion among people living
in extreme poverty, who make up most of the AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
A total of 300 million dollars is needed for the program. The
Brazilian government will bear the rest of the fund.
</P>
<P>
With the program, health authorities will be able to increase
threefold the number of cities receiving medicine, condoms and
other devices.
</P>
<P>
Some 400,000 people have been registered as HIV-positive in
Brazil, of whom 135,000 have developed full-blown AIDS, the news

<HEADLINE> U.S. Real Estate Markets to Remain Strong in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The real estate market in
the United States is expected to remain strong in 1999 because the
underlying fundamentals of property performance this year have
remained solid even in the face of sagging financial markets, a
leading real estate investment banking firm said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Examining trends that are expected to affect the sectors of
office, lodging and retail in 1999, Sonnenblick-Goldman Company
said in a report that the markets have learned from past mistakes
and are in a better position to manage the downside, while taking
advantage of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
While 1999 may not be a boom year, real estate, equity and debt
will remain solid investments, the company said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the markets are becoming increasingly global as
corporations have broken their national borders and have been
doing business worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Traditional lenders, including insurers, banks and pension
funds, will become bigger players in real estate as the more
aggressive investment banks, which have dominated the more highly
leveraged deals, seek to redeploy their capital.
</P>
<P>
Overbuilding in the country's cities was less of an issue than
it had been in the past, because stricter controls were helping to
manage the growth, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Most office markets around the country should remain strong in
1999, although slower projected economic growth will ease pressure
on already low vacancy rates, resulting in slower rental growth
and reduced demand for new construction.
</P>
<P>
The lodging industry is expected to again generate record
profits in 1998 with another strong year expected in 1999, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted that institutional investors, including
pensions funds, would step up direct investments in shopping
centers during the coming year. But malls must constantly change
to continue attracting shoppers, as consumers nowadays have more
stores to choose from and Internet shopping will provide direct
competition to malls.

BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has built
more residential housing than it needs and 88.5 percent of its
vacant buildings are residential housing, China Business News
reports, based on a recent study of 96 real estate development
companies by the Beijing Municipal Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The 96 companies account for 17 percent of Beijing's real

by the end of August, which is 36.9 percent of the city's total
area in unsold commercial space.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the companies had 5,518 apartments that
had remained unoccupied for at least a year and 2,644 apartments
that were still unsold after more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The state sector has the highest rate of unsold housing, with
72 percent of the housing of state-owned real estate companies
still waiting for buyers.

<HEADLINE> Iranian World Cup Star to Join Chinese Champions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Mehdi Mahdavikia, who
scored the winning goal in his country's world cup group
encounter against the United States in June, will be joining
Chinese first division champions Dalian Wanda, the club sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
Wanda has been chasing the 21-year-old striker since the
beginning of the year and had reached a basic transfer agreement
with his Iranian club Pirouzi later. But the deal fell through
after Mahdavikia became a major target of some European big names
reportedly such as German's Dortmund and English premier league
side Tottenham Hotspur since his world cup success.
</P>
<P>
But a car accident in August turned his European dreams sour
and the Asia's Young Player of the Year once lost his first line
spot in the national squad because of wounds.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese champions, though, kept faith in the
hugely-talented player and their one-year-long bid seemed to have
finally succeeded in the ongoing Asian Games soccer tournament
where Mahadavikia played for his country with some reviving
performances in Iran's opening 2-0 defeat of Kazakhstan.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zhongshan Memorial Hall
in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong Province, has
reopened to the public after completion of major renovations.
</P>
<P>
The hall, built in 1931 with donations from Guangzhou residents
and overseas Chinese in memory of the great forerunner of the
Chinese revolution, Sun Yat-sen, is renowned for its artistic
architectural design, and has been the venue for many important
meetings and performance.
</P>
<P>
With a government investment of over 40 million yuan (about
five million U.S. dollars), the renovations have equipped the hall
with state-of-the-art light and sound systems.
</P>
<P>
The hall managers said they expect to stage a series of
concerts and operas, including the classic "Turandot."
</P>
<P>
The city has established a special art fund so that the hall's
presentations can be made financially accessible to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
The first performance will be a New Year's concert by the Hong
Kong Chinese Orchestra as a salute to those Hong Kong and Macao
compatriots who donated to the building of the memorial hall,
sources said.

<HEADLINE> South-South Countries Urged to Cooperate With G7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The South-South countries need
to cooperate with the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized countries
to boost the development of their economic and banking sectors, an
ESCAP official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Group of 77's high-level conference on regional
and sub-regional cooperation under the South-South framework in
Nusa Dua, Bali Province, on Wednesday, Executive Secretary
Adrianus Mooy of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) said the cooperation is imperative to global
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Thus, there would be economic cooperation oriented to the
development of balanced and competitive global economies and the
socioeconomic disparities between the developed countries of the
North and the developing nations of the South could be reduced, he
was quoted by Antara News Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation is also an effective means of encouraging and
developing the economic and banking sectors in each of the
South-South countries, Mooy, former governor of Bank Indonesia,
said.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the monetary crisis still affecting some Asian
countries including Indonesia, he underscored the need for these
countries to intensify the control of the banking sector and adopt
transparent banking rules.
</P>
<P>
To that end, he said, there must be good working mechanism
between the North and South at regional, sub-regional and national
levels.
</P>
<P>
The four-day high-level conference was opened on Wednesday by
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, aiming to draw up a
recommendation for the South-South summit to be held in Havana in
2000.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being attended by ministers and ranking
officials from 132 countries, representatives of international
organizations and observers from Canada, Japan and South Korea. A
delegation from China is also attending the meeting at the
invitation of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 was founded on June 15, 1964, after 77
countries signed a joint declaration in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, US to Renegotiate Immigration Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuban and U.S. officials will
hold a new round of talks on Friday to monitor compliance with
immigration agreements between the two countries, the Cuban
Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and the United States signed their first immigration pact
in 1984, but the accords were soon suspended by Havana due to the
start of broadcasts from the anti-Castro Radio Marti, funded by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Relations returned to some degree of normalcy in May 1995 after
the signing of an agreement under which the U.S. pledged to grant
a minimum 20,000 visas to Cuban immigrants and to return illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has so far reportedly complied with its pledge,
granting 66,000 visas to Cuba and returning 1,373 illegal migrants.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said the
Cuban delegation to Friday's talks will be headed by parliament
leader Ricardo Alarcon while the U.S. delegation will be led by
Under-Secretary for Latin American affairs John Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and the U.S. do not have diplomatic ties.

<HEADLINE> New Rules on Moving in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Money is the main thing being
used to compensate Beijing's urban residents who have to move
because their houses are being demolished, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
This is stipulated in the Chinese capital's Managerial Measures
on the Removing of Urban Housing and the moving of Involved
Residents, which was officially adopted on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Beijing officially abolished its Detailed
Rules for the Implementation of Managerial Regulations on the
Removing of Urban Housing and the Moving of Urban Housing and the
moving of Involved Residents established by the State Council in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will be the only basis for the Beijing
municipal government's work on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Besides money, Beijingers can also seek housing as
compensation. The new regulations' 27th item states that
residents can choose money or housing as compensation for their
demolished residences after discussions with parties responsible
for the removing and moving project.
</P>
<P>
A local housing official said that the measures do not limit
compensation to money because the city wants to ensure freedom of
choice.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, some residents can not find suitable hosing
immediately," he said. "We cannot leave them on the streets."

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Faces Fine for Employment Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Wednesday that it has decided to seek financial penalties
against Luxembourg for violating the European Union's social law.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive body, said Luxembourg has
failed to comply with a previous European Court judgement
concerning Luxembourg nationality requirement for the access to
employment in certain parts of the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposed that the European Court fix a fine of
14,000 European currency units (equivalent to about 11,966
U.S. dollars) for each day of non-compliance with the second
judgement of the court under an EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg was judged by the court in 1996 as violating Article
48 of the treaty for reserving jobs in certain parts of the public
sector for its own nationals.
</P>
<P>
However, although almost two years have passed, the EU said,
Luxembourg has not adopted necessary measures to comply with the
judgement and allow European citizens access to the public service.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the commission has sought the European
Court's imposition of a daily fine on a member state in the social
area.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China has become the third
country in the world to produce recombinant human insulin.
</P>
<P>
The product was developed by Dr. Gan Zhongru using new
bio-engineering technology, which is different from that used by
the U.S. Eli Lilly and Denmark's Novo Nordisk.
</P>
<P>
The product meets or even exceeds standards of similar imported
products in purity and ability to reduce blood sugar, according to
Beijing Union Medical College Hospital and three other hospitals
which used it to treat 100 diabetes patients from October 1997 to
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
China applied for an international patent for the product in
March and began to produce it in November.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gan's partner, China Tonghua Dongbao Pharmaceutical
Co. Ltd. has spent 100 million yuan (about 12.5 million
U.S. dollars) on advanced production and testing facilities from
the U.S., Germany, Britain, and France.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 30 million diabetes sufferers, several
million of whom need insulin on a regular basis. In the past few
years, most of these people have depended on bovine insulin and
imported human insulin.

HEFEI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, a major grain
producer at the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, plans to
introduce more investment from Taiwan Province to accelerate local
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
These funds will mainly be directed to hi-tech industries,
along with other major enterprises, in line with the province's
long-term development plan, according to acting governor Wang
Taihua, who said that large projects are especially encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Wang told Xinhua recently that his province is blessed with
rich mineral, water and agricultural resources, a cheap labor
force and sound infrastructure. The province greatly impressed a
group of 60 leading Taiwanese businessmen who visited there last
month, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are over 700 Taiwanese-funded projects in this
eastern province, with total capital of 880 million
U.S. dollars. Most of these firms were set up in the last six
years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that an increasing number of Taiwan
industrial giants have settled in Anhui, raising the average
investment for each Taiwanese-funded project from 730,000
U.S. dollars at the beginning of the 1990s to 4.3 million
U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> 3,000-Year-Old Carriages Found in Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered two large chariot pits in Shandong province, east
China, with two beautifully decorated imperial carriages, and
nearly 1,000 pieces of bronzeware, bone, and jade.
</P>
<P>
The two pits are located in the village of Qianzhangda in the
southern part of the province. The archeologists discovered them
during other excavation work. They say that the two carriages are
at least 3,000 years old and are still intact. They are 3.2 meters
long and 3.1 meters wide and have a painted awning decorated in
gold leaf.
</P>
<P>
In front of the carriages they found the remains of
horses. Archeologists said the horses were powerful and were
beautifully decorated before being buried as funerary objects.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe that decorated carriages indicate
imperial family members or members of the nobility.

<P>
The doctor says that because of science and technology few
villagers still believe that shamans can cure diseases. In the
past, when a doctor wanted to give people inoculations, no one
would allow it even if it was free. But now, villagers will stand
in a long queue early in the morning when they see a notice to get
shots.
</P>
<P>
Tang Renzhong, an agronomist in the village of Xingbing,
Rongshui County, says that villagers used to burn incense and ask
shamans to chant incantations to drive away evil spirits that
could destroy crops, but they still lived in poverty.
</P>
<P>
But, hybrid rice is popular here now. In 1995, this poor county
became self-sufficient in grain for the first time. Rice output
doubled with the use of hybrid rice, Tang explains.
</P>
<P>
He says that villagers have had good harvests for several years
running, because of the use of the rice seeds, and chemical
fertilizers and pesticides. Per capita annual income in the
village was 1,000 yuan last year, and villagers no longer worry
about where their food and clothing are coming from.
</P>
<P>
With these changes, shamans have found it hard to find
successors. Jia Anhe says that his father, a former shaman,
stopped when his relatives died of illness even after shamans
prayed for them, and that his father told him not to live this way.
</P>
<P>
Jia, who is now the deputy director of the Agriculture Bureau
of Rongshui County, is busy every day promoting the use of hybrid
rice and agronomy in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Jia's daughter is a primary school pupil. Jia says that he
hopes his daughter will become the first university student of his
family of shamans.

The following is the third of a series of articles on the
fast-changing life and culture of the Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Shui, and
7 other ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in
southern China. They are being prepared by Xinhua reporters to
mark the 40th anniversary of Guangxi on December 11.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi Ethnic Group Series:
</P>
<P>
Shamans: Living History in Miao Ethnic Group (1)
</P>
<P>
NANNING, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Miao is one of the largest
ethnic groups in China, with more than 7 million people. They have
a tradition of worshiping gods and spirits, and in the past, a
professional or semi-professional shaman could be found in almost
every village.
</P>
<P>
The people believed that shamans were a link between the common
folk and the gods, between the present world and the next, and
they were asked to help people by praying for fortune and for
agricultural blessings and for good health.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, Jia Weifu in Yubu village, Rongshui Miao
Autonomous county, was the most celebrated person in the
village. As a shaman, he treated sick people with straw ash and a
mysterious dance that was used for good harvests. These, together
with his incantations, meant that he could communicate with gods
and the spirit world.
</P>
<P>
Jia now raises cattle and pigs and crops. Tang Shaohui, the
village doctor, says, "I used to go to Jia for treatment when I
was ill, but now he comes to me when he's sick."
</P>
<P>
The more modern China became, the more shamans disappeared,
especially in developed cities and suburbs. Today they can only be
found in some remote villages. With the gradual decrease in the
number of shamans, came an increase in the number of doctors,
teachers and agronomists, even in the most remote villages.
</P>
<P>
The Miao in Guangxi live in compact communities. Jia lives in
the Damiao mountains. Jia's wife says that it's been a long time
since he was asked to chant incantations to drive away evil
spirits and treat people's illnesses. The family is also no longer
living in poverty and makes a better living by farming and selling
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
There's a motorcycle parked in front of Jia's wooden house, and
in the sun-lit lounge there's a television. On the wall, a
horizontal plaque says: Achieve Prosperity through Hard
Work. There are few reminders of the spirit world.

<P>
LHASA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tibet -- the formerly information
inaccessible Roof of the World -- has witnessed a 20-fold increase
in the number of telephone subscribers over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Tibet Post and Telecommunications Bureau
show that in the regional capital of Lhasa 32 people out of every
100 are now telephone subscribers, and that nearly three people
out of 100 are telephone subscribers on average throughout the
region.

Today, all seven cities and prefectures in the region have
mobile phone telecommunications networks, and Lhasa has a digital
program controlled mobile phone network.
</P>

The bureau said that all of the region's 73 counties have
ground communications satellite stations and program-controlled
telecommunications offices, and local residents are able to make
either domestic long distance calls or international long distance
calls.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Achieve Good Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tibet, the Roof of the World, is
expected to have a grain harvest this year of an estimated
850,000 tons, 7.3 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the autonomous region's agricultural and
animal husbandry bureau said the per capita net income of farmers
and herdsmen is expected to reach 1,150 yuan (about 130
U.S. dollars) this year, six percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the recent good harvests to increased
investment in agriculture by the central and local governments,
the spread of technology, and the adoption of special local
policies such as exemption from agricultural tax.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have offered 220 million yuan
(26 million dollars) since 1996 to disseminate science and
technology for crop growing, build irrigation networks, and
invigorate low-yield farmland.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 1,300 irrigation canals and 5,290 reservoirs of
various sizes have been built in the region.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that about 200,000 Tibetan farmers and
herdsmen receive technical training each year.

JINAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
which has led the country in port and highway construction, plans
to spend some six billion yuan to build three local railways over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Provincial government sources said this project will further
improve Shandong's communications network system and alleviate the
pressure on local cargo transportation, adding that the funds will
be raised through various channels at home and abroad.

The new railways are designed to link a number of major cities
in Shandong, including Dezhou, Yantai and Yanzhou, to some
national railway trunks, such as the Beijing-Kowloon line and
the Beijing-Shanghai line.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
which produces one-tenth of the country's grain, plans to import
advanced water-saving irrigation equipment from abroad for
use on some one-million hectares of farmland over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
These imports will include advanced spraying, seeping and
dripping technology, according to an official at the Provincial
Water Conservation Department.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, the provincial government will
subsidize 50 million yuan (six million US dollars) in this program
annually, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's per-capita water resource stands at only 357 cubic
meters, 20 cubic meters fewer than that of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Around 1.8 million of the 4.67 million hectares of farmland in
Shandong have been hit with droughts to one degree or another for
the past 48 years, resulting in annual losses of 1.5 billion
kilograms of grain.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1970s, Shandong province has imported
water-saving irrigation technology from the United States,
France, Italy, Israel and Austria. So far, this advanced equipment
has been used over 2.1 million hectares of local farmland, the
most widespread use of such technology in the country.

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Some people in China's
Zhejiang Province are improving their living conditions by
gradually moving towards an urban lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
The fast development of the industrial and service sectors
brought annual incomes of most farmers in Zhejiang to 3,684 yuan
(444 U.S. dollars)last year, and they are estimated to be nearly
4,000 yuan this year. Most rural people do not have to worry about
how to make ends meet any longer and pay more attention to how to
make their lives more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
People now eat more fish and meat instead of just vegetables
and have an average of 75 grams of protein in their daily diets.
</P>
<P>
They also dressed more or less the same as urbanites,
especially farmers in the more developed cities of Hangzhou,
Wenzhou and Ningbo, and per capita floor space is 37.3 square
meters now, twice the amount of 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Interior decoration has become fashionable in rural areas, with
spending on it up 28.4 percent, and the quality of materials is
improving to include granite, ceramic tiles, carpets, and
wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
Household electrical appliances are no longer a rarity in rural
areas, and air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, video players, and
cameras are increasingly seen to be needs, alongside washing
machines and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Rural people are also spending more on telecommunications and
transport, on motorcycles, automobiles, mobile phones and
pagers. Average expenditure on these items is 88.75 yuan per
capita, 52.4 percent up more than for last year.
</P>
<P>
More attention is being paid to health as well, and people have
given up the old idea that illnesses can cure themselves. Average
spending on physical examinations and medical treatment per capita
for the first half of this year was 71.79 yuan, 17.8 percent more
than for the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Oil markets on Wednesday warmed
to a sharp drawdown in U.S. oil inventories, as the benchmark
Brent traded last at $10.38 a barrel, up 16 cents.
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday reported a 5.7
million barrel draw in U.S. crude stocks last week, against market
expectations for a build-up in stocks.
</P>
<P>
"The draw is encouraging, but distillate stocks are still very
high," Mehdi Varzi, director of oil and gas research at Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson in London, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
Distillate stocks grew last week by 1.5 million barrels as the
key market for heating oil in the northeast U.S. basked in
unseasonably warm temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market in the long term would pay little
attention to the API report as disappointment with last week's
OPEC's meeting in Vienna would linger.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said oil prices in the single digits were not
unforseeable.

<P>
BUCHAREST, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Permanent Council of the
French-speaking world Wednesday opened its 31st Session in
Bucharest under the leadership of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary
General of the international organization.
</P>
<P>
The session preceded the 12th Ministerial Conference that will
take place in Bucharest on December 4 and 5, with the
participation of the personal representatives of heads of state or
government in the member states of the French-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
It is the first opportunity for Romania to host such a
gathering since it received full membership of the Movement in
Mauritius in 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to Boutros-Boutros Ghali, the two sessions will
debate "the main economic and technical policies" of this
international organization. He also said the gatherings would
"prepare" the conference of the economic and finance ministers due
to take place in Monaco, in April 14-15, 1999, and the 8th Summit
of the French-speaking world, due to be held in Moncton, Canada,
in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the French-speaking world Agency will be approved
in order to make the international organization "become more
pragmatic, more flexible and more effective in the way it
operates", said Andrei Magheru, executive secretary of the
National Advisory Council for the French-speaking world at the
Ministerial Conference in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
There were many specific issues that would be discussed, issues
of the academic cooperation in the field of media, the cultural,
economic cooperation, the issue of "information highways the
French-speaking world is concerned with, meaning that the Internet
should deliver information not only in English but also in
French", Andrei Magheru added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will attend next week the foreign ministerial
meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) charting
the alliance's future course.
</P>
<P>
Albright would attend the regular NATO foreign ministers
meeting in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday that will prepare for a
NATO summit in Washington next April, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
One issue under discussion as part of the broad review is a
proposal by Germany for NATO to declare it will not be the first
to use nuclear weapons in a conflict.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. strongly rejected that idea during a visit to
Washington by German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping last week,
but Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Tuesday again stressed it was
Germany's right to raise it as a topic.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to spend Wednesday and Thursday in Paris

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday proposed a new monitoring function in the
U.N. Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA).
</P>
<P>
In his annual report on Afghanistan to the General Assembly and
the Security Council, Annan said reports of mass killings and
other forms of gross violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law in the country have become a major source of
concern to the international community at large and to the United
Nations in particular.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the primary objective of promoting respect for
minimum humanitarian standards and deterring massive and
systematic violations of human rights in the future, Annan
proposed to establish a separate civil affair unit in the UNSMA,
initially composed of 12 monitors who, security conditions
premitting, would be deployed in major centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Annan said their exact location, mandate and functioning would
be determined following the return of an assessment team, which he
intended to dispatch to the country at an early date, with the
agreement of the Afghan authorities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Israel's Conditions for Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States dismissed
Wednesday Israel's conditions for a withdrawal from the West Bank
and demanded that the Wye accord with the Palestinians "should be
implemented as signed."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
withdrawal is an obligation. "We do not think it is appropriate to
add new conditions."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also condemned an attack on an Israeli soldier in
Ramallah, an Arab town on the West Bank, which he said "is clearly
the kind of violence that has no place in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
office said Wednesday that troop pullbacks would be delayed unless
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat stopped saying he would establish
a Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
Israel also insists that incitement of rioters be halted and
that Israel alone decide which Palestinian prisoners to free under
October's Wye accord signed in rural Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rejection of the Israeli conditions puts the
administration on a collision course with Israel little more than
a week before a scheduled trip there by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position was that neither side should say things that
appear provocative or are designed to prejudge the outcome of
negotiations still to be held.
</P>
<P>
American mediator Dennis Ross and his deputy, Aaron Miller,
will go to the region in a few days to try and ease the conflict
in advance of Clinton's trip, a senior U.S. official said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. General Assembly Calls for Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly on Wednesday adopted six resolutions on the question of
Palestine and two on the situation of Middle East, calling for
self-determination for the Palestinian people and demanding the
Israeli withdrawal from the Golden Heights captured from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions on the two issues, debated separately every
year by the General Assembly, were again endorsed by overwhelming
majority this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States jointed Israel by casting the only negative
votes against five of the resolutions, while abstaining on the one
about Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A resolution on the peaceful settlement of the question of
Palestine was adopted by a vote of 154 to two, with three
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stressed "the realization of the rights of the
Palestinian people, primarily the right to self-determination," and
"the withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territory occupied
since 1967."
</P>
<P>
The resolution also "stresses the necessity for commitment to
the principle of land for peace and the implementation of Security
Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which form the
basis of the Middle East peace process, and the need for the
immediate and scrupulous implementation of the agreements reached
between parties."
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged U.N. members to expedite economic and
technical assistance to the Palestinian people and emphasised the
importance for the United Nations to play a more active and
expanded role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 149 to one with seven abstentions, the General
Assembly said in a resolution that a 1948 decision by Israel to
impose its laws and jurisdiction on all parts of Jerusalem,
including the eastern part captured in 1967, was illegal, null
and void. Israel voted against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution deplored the transfer by some countries of
their diplomatic missions to Jerusalem, which Israel regards as
its undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
Another resolution, adopted by 97 votes to two with 58
abstentions, called upon Israel to resume peace talks on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks and to respect undertakings reached in
previous rounds.

<HEADLINE> Former Agriculture Secretary Acquitted by Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. jury on Wednesday
acquitted former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy of 30 corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
The verdict ended an investigation by independent counsel
Donald Smaltz, who spent nearly 20 million dollar and four years
investigating allegations Espy accepted free sports tickets,
travel and other favors from companies he regulated.
</P>
<P>
Espy, a former Democratic member of Congress from Mississippi,
and the nation's first African-American agriculture secretary,
resigned from the Clinton cabinet in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The verdict from the predominantly black jury came after a
lengthy probe by one of the first independent counsels named to
investigate members of the Clinton administration. Other
high-ranking Clinton aides -- including current and former cabinet
members Alexis Herman, Bruce Babbitt, Henry Cisneros, and Ron
Brown -- were also targets of separate probes.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the prosecution called 70 witnesses while the
defense did not present any testimony. The jury rejected the
prosecution's case, ruling that Espy was guilty of nothing more
than accepting gifts and social courtesies from friends, and did
not alter Agriculture Department policy because of the favors.

<HEADLINE> Smoking More Dangerous for Women, UK Study Reveals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Smoking is more likely to kill
women than men, according to the largest ever British study of
lung cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
The study, presented at the British Thoracic Society Winter
Meeting in London on Wednesday, revealed that women are more
vulnerable to the most fatal type of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
The research, carried out by the Royal College of Physicians
Research Unit, involved 1,600 cancer patients in 46 hospitals in
the UK.
</P>
<P>
It showed that women who smoke are twice as likely as men to
develop small cell lung cancer, an insidious form of the disease
which spreads more rapidly than other forms. Seven out of 10 of
these cases could not be helped by surgery.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that changing patterns of smoking
behavior, as many British women took up the habit a decade after
men who smoked heavily during the Second World War, may be one of
the reasons that women have less resistance to small cell lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Women may also smoke in a different way to men, researchers
explained, like taking shorter, sharper inhalations, which could
have an effect on the kind and severity of cancer that they
develop.
</P>
<P>
Researchers hope the findings will give more impetus to drives
to cut the increasing number of teenage girls in the UK taking up
smoking, which accounts for a huge percentage of lung cancer
cases.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, only one in five 15-year old girls in Britain
smoked. Now the number has climbed to one in three.

Council to approve an investigation of the U.S. bombing on a

</P>
<P>
The Arab Group sent a revised draft resolution to the President
of the Security Council, requesting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan dispatch a mission to verify all facts concerning the
Al-Shifa factory, including its production and ownership.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution also asked Annan to submit a report on
the mission's findings within one month of the reslution's adoption.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and the Arab Group requested a U.N. investigation
immediately after the attack and demanded compensation from the
United States for the cost of the plant.

NEW YORK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks fell Wednesday on
discouraging news from two blue-chip index components about their
business performance.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, covering the trend of 30 big
companies, closed 69 points lower at 9,064.54 and broader market
indicators fell modestly, based on preliminary data.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft maker Boeing, a Dow component, announced that it will
cut 20,000 jobs over the next two years due to lower demand from
Asia where the financial crisis originated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, retailer Sears, another Dow member, said that its
sales retreated last month and its earnings for the year would
only rise marginally despite a shopping season is ahead.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed the market decline to continuing
profit taking following weeks of gains in major indexes but others
said it may reflect investors' uncertainty about U.S. and world
economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
The market followed Tuesday's pattern of low opening with the
Dow down 178 points at one point Wednesday.

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Profit warnings and poor start

The UK's FTSE 100 index closed 30.3 points or 0.6 percent lower

"We're going down with the U.S. market as our market lacks
impulse," one trader in Frankfurt said.
</P>
<P>
The slump on Wall Street dragged down by Boeing Co's gloomy
financial forecast also weighed on French investors.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index closed down 38.43 points at 3,649.91. "We're
following New York, which is very weak because of the bad news
from Boeing," said one Paris dealer.
</P>
<P>
Swiss shares closed some 0.5 percent lower after initial gains
were erased by a crumbling dollar and the weaker start on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
Dutch shares closed just over 2 percent down despite a higher
start, with only a few buyers around in morning trade and
sentiment soon turned bearish when investors started to sell large
amounts of shares.

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition
Conservative Party leader William Hague sacked his leader in the
House of Lords Wednesday, plunging the Tory party into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Conservative peers were in open revolt after Lord Cranborne was
booted out by Hague for agreeing to a government plan to save
seats for almost 100 hereditary Lords. Lord Strathclyde was later
appointed as his replacement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was part of a compromise to win an easy passage
in the upper House for the government's plans for constitutional
reform, including the abolition of voting rights for all
hereditaries.
</P>
<P>
It had been kept secret and was only revealed by Hague during a
dramatic Question Time clash Wednesday. He insisted his party had
rejected the deal and accused the government of a "huge climbdown"
which showed that the prime minister had no principles on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Tony Blair hit back, claiming the deal had
been done with Lord Cranborne, proving Hague was not in control of
his own party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly afterwards, Lord Cranborne admitted he had
"behaved quite outrageously."
</P>
<P>
He said he had "exceeded his authority and gone behind his
leader's back."
</P>
<P>
But he added, "In any conflict between loyalty to the party and
loyalty to this House, my judgement must be about what I think is
best for the future of this House."
</P>
<P>
Hague, in a letter to the sacked peer, declared, "As you know,
at our meeting this afternoon I explained that following the
events today I had no option but to require you to step down from
your position as leader of the Conservative Party in the House of
Lords.
</P>
<P>
"It can never be acceptable for a member of the front bench to
seek to bring about a change in the policy of the party without
the knowledge or agreement of the party leader or the shadow
cabinet."
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to abolishing the rights of all 750
hereditary peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been opposed by the Tories and the government
fears they could use their inbuilt majority in the upper House to
block the proposal and throw its parliamentary program into
disarray with guerrilla warfare over the issue.

<HEADLINE> Arab Group Asks UN to Investigate U.S. Bombing in Sudan </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The 22 Arab states at
the United Nations on Wednesday once again asked the U.N. Security
Council to approve an investigation of the U.S. bombing on a
factory in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Group sent a revised draft resolution to the President
of the Security Council, requesting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan dispatch a mission to verify all facts concerning the
Al-Shifa factory, including its production and ownership.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution also asked Annan to submit a report on
the mission's findings within one month of the reslution's adoption.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and the Arab Group requested a U.N. investigation
immediately after the attack and demanded compensation from the
United States for the cost of the plant.
</P>
<P>
The United States considers Sudan a sponsor of terrorism. It
bombed the Khartoum factory and a site in Afghanistan after its
embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were attacked on August 7.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stocks Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks fell Wednesday on
discouraging news from two blue-chip index components about their
business performance.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, covering the trend of 30 big
companies, closed 69 points lower at 9,064.54 and broader market
indicators fell modestly, based on preliminary data.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft maker Boeing, a Dow component, announced that it will
cut 20,000 jobs over the next two years due to lower demand from
Asia where the financial crisis originated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, retailer Sears, another Dow member, said that its
sales retreated last month and its earnings for the year would
only rise marginally despite a shopping season is ahead.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed the market decline to continuing
profit taking following weeks of gains in major indexes but others
said it may reflect investors' uncertainty about U.S. and world
economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
The market followed Tuesday's pattern of low opening with the
Dow down 178 points at one point Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 8.55 to 1,995.20 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 4.03 to 1,171.25.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners led advancers 9-7
with trading volume down to 724 million shares from 781 million
previously.

<HEADLINE> European Shares End Down for 3rd Session in Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Profit warnings and poor start
on Wall Street dragged European shares down Wednesday for the
third session in a row.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 index closed 30.3 points or 0.6 percent lower
at 5,507.2.
</P>
<P>
While the decline was poor, investors were glad to see the
market hold up slightly against the drag of a 100-plus fall on the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.
</P>
<P>
Germany's benchmark Xetra Dax index fell deeper into negative
territory. By 1530 GMT it was down 1.8 percent at 4,690.62 points
as profit-taking continued.
</P>
<P>
"We're going down with the U.S. market as our market lacks
impulse," one trader in Frankfurt said.
</P>
<P>
The slump on Wall Street dragged down by Boeing Co's gloomy
financial forecast also weighed on French investors.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index closed down 38.43 points at 3,649.91. "We're
following New York, which is very weak because of the bad news
from Boeing," said one Paris dealer.
</P>
<P>
Swiss shares closed some 0.5 percent lower after initial gains
were erased by a crumbling dollar and the weaker start on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
Dutch shares closed just over 2 percent down despite a higher
start, with only a few buyers around in morning trade and
sentiment soon turned bearish when investors started to sell large
amounts of shares.
