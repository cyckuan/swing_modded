<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate ratified
Tuesday a bicameral conference committee report extending the life
span of the 50-year-old Home Insurance and Guaranty Corporation (
HIGC) to another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Voting 16-3, the senators adopted Senate Bill 1568,
consolidation with House Bill 7848, which prolongs the existence
of the state-owned insurance firm to year 2050 and increases its
capital to 50 billion pesos (1.25 billion U.S. dollars) from the
present 2.5 billion pesos (62.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The administration-backed measure would now be sent to
Philippine President Joseph Estrada for his immediate signature
into law.
</P>
<P>
Under the final and consolidated report, the HIGC was
subsequently renamed as the Home Guaranty Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Of the 50-billion-peso authorized capital stock, 40 percent
shall be used exclusively for socialized housing, 30 percent for
low-cost housing, 20 percent for medium cost housing, and the
remaining 10 percent, for open housing.
</P>
<P>
HIGC, created in 1950 and given a corporate life of 50 years
until the year 2000, provides guarantees and credit insurance for
the government's housing programs.
</P>
<P>
It serves as the link between the government and the private
sector in financing affordable dwelling and taking out mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Extends Amnesty For Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to grant another one-week amnesty for army deserters,
official television reported Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,289 military personnel who had deserted
surrendered in response to the one-week amnesty from February 21
to 27 declared by the Sri Lankan government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The new one-week amnesty from February 28 to March 5 was a
response to appeals made to the army commander by many deserters'
parents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has conducted amnesties on many
occasions since 1995. Many deserters have returned to the army.
However, there are still thousands of army deserters who have
failed to respond to the amnesties.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that all deserters would return to the
army during the new amnesty period. Deserters who return to the
army will receive no punishment, sources here said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao SAR Govt Strives to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- "Macao Welcomes You!" This is a
new slogan put forward by the Tourist Office of China's Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government in an effort to
attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
Posters of the slogan can be seen at Macao's airport, ferry
terminals, streets, buildings, bus stops and tourist sites. In
addition to the slogan, in fact, the Tourist Office is carrying
out a series of measures to boost tourism, a pillar economic
sector in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The slogan was made public earlier this month and is the theme
of tourism this year," officials with the Tourist Office said at a
press conference here Tuesday afternoon. "We aim to establish a
brand-new image for Macao, so that tourists can enjoy their stay
here."
</P>
<P>
Tourism plays a key role in the local economy. Statistics show
that in 1999 the revenue from tourism accounted for 38 percent of
the local GDP, and about 30 percent of the labor force are
involved in tourism.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Macao received more than 7.4 million tourists, and
the number is about 17 times that of the local population.
Officials with the Tourist Office said the target for this year is
set at eight million.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that tourists from China's Hong Kong SAR,
the inland areas and Taiwan account for more than 90 percent of
the total, the Tourism Office puts special emphasis on tourism
promotion in these areas this year.
</P>
<P>
In particular, those from Hong Kong take up over a half. The
office will enhance publicity in Hong Kong and in the meantime
offer more colorful tourist activities at home so that tourists
will have fresh feelings each time they come to Macao.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, large-scale activities such as art festivals,
motor Grand Prix, international musical festivals and golf
tournaments have attracted the attention of more people outside
Macao. On the basis of this, the Tourist Office will continue to
hold promotion activities in Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
Along with economic booming in China's inland areas, tourism
has become a part of life for many. Up to now, seven airline
companies operate 172 flights each week between Macao and 13
cities in the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Tourist Office also revealed their plan to
have better cooperation with travel agencies and news
organizations in the inland areas to raise people's understanding
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
As to people from Taiwan, Macao has been a major stop for them
to head for other places since the Macao International Airport was
put into operation at the end of 1995. The Tourist Office is
consulting with some airline companies and people in the tourism
sector in Taiwan so that Taiwan passengers can stay longer in
Macao for sightseeing instead of merely taking Macao as a transit
place.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Tourist Office will exert great efforts to
explore tourism markets of Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore,
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, as
well as European and American markets.
</P>
<P>
Government officials also noted that Macao boasts unique
tourist attractions which blend Eastern and Western cultures. Such
an advantage can be better used.

<HEADLINE> Mayon's Latest Eruption Biggest Since 1993 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) Tuesday afternoon recorded
the biggest eruption of Mayon Volcano since 1993.
</P>
<P>
At about 2:00 p.m., the National Power Corporation had to shut
down electricity, after mud-rains and ashes grounded power cables
and insulators. This put the provinces of Albay and Sorsogon into
a total blackout.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs observer said the series of blasts in the afternoon
were the strongest of the volcano's recent explosions, adding that
they were stronger than Mayon's 1968, 1984 and 1993 blasts.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Disaster Management Office in Legazpi city said
some evacuees, especially children and elder people, have been
rushed to the hospital due to asthmatic fits.
</P>
<P>
Evacuees who have flocked to the evacuation centers now
numbered over 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs Director Raymundo Punongbayan said the successive
blasts could continue into the night and the following days.
</P>
<P>
The Philvolcs maintains Alert Level 5 of the country's most
active volcano "since there is still high potential for
occurrences of pyroclastic flows."
</P>
<P>
The institute said strict compliance of the 6-kilometer radius
permanent danger zone and the extension to 8-kilometer in the
southeast sector should be observed.
</P>
<P>
Mayon Volcano erupted last Thursday, sending lava fountains and
huge columns of smoke to the sky as thousands of local residents
fled their homes to evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
Located about 300 kilometers southeast of Manila, the 2,462-
meter Mayon Volcano has erupted at least 40 times since 1616 and
its last major eruption was in 1993, which killed at least 77
people.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Refutes "Hearsay-based" U.S. Report on  Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Ministry
Tuesday said the U.S. State Department's Country Report on Human
Rights Situation in Pakistan does not represent the facts and is
based on hearsay.
</P>
<P>
"The report misrepresents the facts and demonstrates a lack of
understanding of the situation in Pakistan," the Foreign Ministry
said in a statement. "It is a compilation of unfounded reports
mostly collected from unreliable sources based on hearsay and so-
called off the record conversations."
</P>
<P>
The statement questioned the objectivity of the report and said
it was "concerned over the tendency of some countries to sit in
judgment over others, ignoring their own serious human rights
situation, including racial and economic discrimination."
</P>
<P>
It said the authors of the report also need to address the
unjust global economic system and financial monopolies which
aggravate poverty in the developing countries and even provide
incentives for corruption leading to massive transfers of assets
to benefit the already rich societies.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan remains open to constructive criticism. But, it would
resolutely defend itself against allegations which are
unsubstantiated and aimed at wrongfully maligning the country," it
added.

<HEADLINE> Knowledge-based Economy Provides Opportunities for People: HK Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
will lead to usher in the knowledge-based economy supported by
innovation and technology and will give everyone in the society a
hand to sign on, said Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gala dinner after receiving the 1999 Leader of
the Year Award, Tung said Hong Kong was quite well prepared for a
knowledge-based economy and Hong Kong had open and highly
efficient markets and its IT infrastructure was already among the
best.
</P>
<P>
The government will, in particular, play its part by creating
the best environment to support innovation and technology;
revamping the school systems and multiplying the educational
opportunities for everyone; and further opening up our markets to
the benign forces of competition, the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
In the race into the knowledge-based economy, Tung expected
that the middle class would benefit most relative to the rest as
knowledge, brain power, or innovative human capital, were worth
more than physical or financial capital in a knowledge-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the knowledge-based economy would be a
challenge for people without adequate education or whose skills
were outdated, Tung promised that no one who was willing to work
hard to move up would be denied a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
The government would play its part to help by providing ample
opportunities for those who were determined to improve themselves
through learning, training and re-training. The "lifelong learning
" concept espoused by the Education Commission would be a most
important step.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the business sector, Tung noted that there might be
some froth in high-tech stocks everywhere, and perhaps in Hong
Kong too, and he reminded investors to be prudent and invest
within their means.
</P>
<P>
Referring to those companies that had not integrated IT fully
into their management practices or had not even begun to embark on
the road to the knowledge economy, Tung urged them to come out
from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
"We will become truly and totally successful as a community if
all our businesses, big or small, embrace the information
technology as the way forward. Only then will our competitiveness
be second to none in Asia," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Holds Talks With Jordanian PM on Bilateral, Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
held talks with visiting Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh
here on Wednesday on boosting bilateral ties and Arab solidarity
and pushing forward the sluggish Middle East Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rawabdeh conveyed to Saleh a written message
from Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein on the bilateral brotherly
ties and the means to further enhance co-operation in all fields,
the Yemeni News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The message also referred to the latest Arab-related
developments
on the regional and international arena, the report added.
</P>
<P>
They also touched on the ongoing sessions of the joint Yemeni-
Jordanian Higher Committee in Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
On whether there would be an Arab summit in the near future and
the possible Yemeni-Jordanian co-ordination in this issue, Saleh
said,"We still raise the call for such summit to bridge the rift
and restore Arab solidarity and reinforce the Arab support for the
Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian peace negotiators."
</P>
<P>
"This support can be only gained from a single Arab stand", he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the Jordanian stand regarding the calls for an Arab summit,
Rawabdeh said,"In our bilateral Arab meetings, we try to remove any

differences so as to formulate a single Arab stand that can
surmount the current situation for better prospects."
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh and his party arrived in Sanaa Wednesday afternoon
to attend the meetings of the joint higher committee currently held
in this capital city.

<HEADLINE> Germany, EU Officially Nominate Koch-Weser for IMF Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The German government and the
European Union (EU) Wednesday officially nominated German Finance
State Minister Caio Koch-Weser as the European candidate for the
IMF chief, a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, or the International Monetary Funds, is expected to
hold an initial vote Thursday as a test between Koch-Weser and
other two candidates, acting IMF chief Stanly Fischer and Japanese
Deputy Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibara.
</P>
<P>
Koch-Weser, 55 and born in Brasilia, had served 25 years at
the World Bank before he returned to the German cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He is the only European candidate for the IMF post and will
get the "full support" of Germany and the EU, said Bela Anda,
deputy government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear for us that Koch-Weser is the candidate of
the European Union," Anda told a routine government press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We will go for the probe vote with full confidence," he said,
adding that the EU had officially informed the IMF executive board
on Koch-Weser's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. said Koch-Weser was not qualified to lead the top
global financial institution even with the support of the EU.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Finance Secretary Lawrence Summers said Tuesday that the
U.S. backed a leader of the IMF with "requisite stature, requisite
expertise, and requisite ability to command global consensus and
respect and the commitment to doing what needs to be done at the
IMF."
</P>
<P>
This comment has caused wrangling between the U.S. and Berlin,
which criticized Washington's reaction as "unfair."
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Hans Eicher said Tuesday that his
deputy was "a very good candidate" and warned the U.S. against
this "unfairness."
</P>
<P>
The lobbying efforts have gone to the highest level, Eicher
said, adding that German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was pressing
U.S. President Bill Clinton even harder to back Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many telephone conversations in this regard,"
Eicher told the Saarbruecker Zeitung newspaper Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Zambia President Calls for Gender Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
 Wednesday urged the country to eliminate all practices
discriminating against women to pave way for gender equality and
development.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government considered the elimination of
violence as a priority area because women's positive contribution
to economic development largely depended on their rights and
freedom.
</P>
<P>
Women will continue to lag behind in developmental matters as
long as violence is not eliminated at home and in communities and
work places, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed concern over increasing incidence of
widow harassing, wife battering and the general violence against
women in the country and called on all law-abiding citizens to be
alert and fight the scourge.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiluba, this year's theme of the International
Women's Day, "Women 2000 Gender Equality Development, Peace and
Solidarity for the 21st Century", would not have come at a more
appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the important role women can play in
development, reiterating the government's commitment to creating
an enabling environment in which both men and women can contribute
to national development.
</P>
<P>
Women in Zambia should challenge themselves and aspire for
political and institutional offices, he said, encouraging them to
lead a decent, careful life and teach their children the values of
decency.
</P>
<P>
"You are our mothers, you make the core of the family and what
you teach us to do in our early lives means so much in the rest of
our lives," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister
Luiz Lampreia arrived in Cape Town, South Africa on Wednesday for
a three-day visit, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with his South
African counterpart Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Lampreia said
developing countries such as Brazil and South Africa have great
expectations about getting more access to developed markets.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest round of World Trade Organization
negotiation in Seattle, the United States, Lampreia noted that
developing countries have not been sufficiently organized among
themselves to defend their interests and serve as a pressure group
in multilateral trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The more we talk to each other, the more coordinated we are to
push through our joint cause, the better for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia will meet South African Trade and Industry Minister
Alec Erwin on Thursday to discuss strategies on restarting the

JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
given an emergency aid worth one million euro (about one million
U.S. dollars) for flood victims in Botswana and Mozambique, South
African Press Association reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission's funding to Botswana is to cover the
supply of materials for temporary shelter, basic health care and
some preventive measures to curb the epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The primary beneficiaries will be people affected by floods in
the northern and northeastern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German government announced in Berlin that it
has released 1.5 million U.S. dollars for Mozambique and will send
25 helicopters and several small planes to the flood-stricken
regions to help rescue victims.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South African Air Force personnel
and aircraft involved in rescue operations for the victims of
floods in southern and central Mozambique are to stay in the
country for at least another week, South African Defence Minister
Mosioua Lekota said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Mozambique News Agency as saying that he was
acting on recommendations made by the South Africa Air Force
(SAAF) staff in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The current South African team would remain in Mozambique until
"at least Saturday or Sunday", he said, adding that the South
African government would then take a definitive decision on the
next steps to be taken.
</P>
<P>
"But I can assure you that South Africa is ready to continue
support, even if the situation worsens," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, not only the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries, but also the rest of the
international community, should give support to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The minister was in Mozambique to see for himself the dramatic
situation in the river valleys affected by last week's
catastrophic flooding.
</P>
<P>
On board an SAAF helicopter and accompanied by his Mozambican
counterpart Tobias Dai, he overflew the flood-stricken districts
of Chokwe and Chibuto in the southern province of Gaza, and the
Gaza capital Xai-Xai.
</P>
<P>
Currently, South Africa has 82 men and 12 aircraft involved in
the rescue operations in Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Says Baghdad Visit "Fruitful" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish State Minister Edip Safter
Gaydali said here Wednesday that his visit to Iraq was "fruitful
and very positive," the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before departure, Gaydali voiced Ankara's willingness
to expand the spheres of cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit, Gaydali held talks with Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan and the ministers of finance, trade,
oil and industry, on ways of strengthening and developing bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, Gaydali signed a joint minutes of the
meetings with Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid. The minutes
covered fields of bilateral cooperation in trade, agriculture,
transport and transactions, including the possibility of extending
gas pipelines to Turkey, INA said.
</P>
<P>
Gaydali arrived in Baghdad Saturday to attend the 12th session
of the Iraqi-Turkish Joint Committee for Trade, Economic and
Technological Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival, Gaydali claimed that due to the trade embargo
imposed on Iraq since 1990, Turkey has lost 30 billion U.S. dollars
in trade transactions with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq and Turkey have not been able to implement a deal
signed in 1997, under which a 1,100-kilometer-long pipeline worth 2
billion dollars should be laid to supply 10 billion cubic meters of
Iraqi gas for Turkey annually.
</P>
<P>
During the previous six phases of oil-for-food program, which is
now in its seventh phase, Turkish secured 477 million dollars worth
of contracts to provide Iraq with detergents, medical appliances,
equipment and various spare parts, ranking the ninth largest
exporter to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, political relations have remained cool between the two
countries. Iraq has long criticized Turkey for allowing the U.S.
and British war planes to take off from its bases to patrol the
northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The restricted zone, along with a similar one in the south, was
set up by the allied forces following the 1991 Gulf War, with the
claimed aim of preventing Iraqi government troops from attacking
the Kurds and Shiite Muslims. Iraq has never recognized the no-fly
zones for their lack of U.N. authorization.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Wishes Parliamentary Elections Benefit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey wishes the recently-held
parliamentary elections in Iran will benefit "the friendly Iranian
nation," said a Foreign Ministry spokesman on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The elections, held on February 18, reflected the Iranian
people's will to improve democracy in the country, said deputy
spokesman Sermet Atacanli at a weekly press conference.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the elections will also pave the way
for improving Turkish-Iranian relations under a detente policy
initiated by moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami since he
took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkey, two Muslim-populated neighbors, maintain
lukewarm relations, reportedly because of Ankara's growing military
cooperation with the Jewish state of Israel, which Tehran considers
as its arch enemy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused Iran of sheltering the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party, a charge Iran vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a Muslim but constitutionally secular nation, keeps
distance from Iran for fear that fundamentalism which had prevailed
in Iran would affect its own people.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry's carefully-worded statement came
ironically in contrast with Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's earlier
comment, which touched off a diplomatic protest from Iran last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian revolution collapsed in 22 years, but Ataturk's
revolution has been continuing for the past 77 years," said Ecevit
last Wednesday, referring to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of
the Republic of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh summoned
Turkey's ambassador to Tehran Turan Morali to lodge the protest.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh said that Ecevit's remarks were a "clear example of
interference in Iran's domestic affairs and an insult to the
Iranian nation and system."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said in a conciliatory tone that President
Suleyman Demirel, Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem all sent
congratulatory messages to their Iranian counterparts on the
occasion of the elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince, Prime Minister
and Chief of the National Guard, Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz arrived
here from Cairo leading a high-level official delegation for a two-
day visit.
</P>
<P>
He was welcomed at Damascus International Airport by Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes within the efforts to unify an Arab stand
towards peace in the region and coordinate Syrian-Arab attitudes on
all Arab issues particularly the peace process on the Syrian,
Lebanese and Palestinian tracks.
</P>
<P>
Syria's leading official daily Chishreen welcomed Abdullah's
ongoing Arab tour, saying it showed Arab solidarity with Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
With this visit, the campaign of Arab support for Syria and
Lebanon reached its peak, the daily claimed, adding that Israeli
leaders should heed this strong message and drop their hostile
plans, and commit themselves to a just peace which essentially
means a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and
South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The wave of Arab support for Syria and Lebanon put Israeli
leaders in a mess, the paper said. The firm Arab solidarity has
pressured Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to confess the promise
of pulling out from the Golan to the June 4, 1967, lines made by
late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is to visit Beirut, Lebanon to continue his ongoing
three-leg Arab tour.

<HEADLINE> EU Works for Mideast Peace Talks Resumption: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the U.S.
were making concerted efforts to help resume the peace talks on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks with Israel, said visiting EU Mideast
envoy Miguel Moratinos on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied an immediate return to the negotiation table
by the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos told reporters after meeting with Lebanese Prime
Minister Salim Hoss that they discussed the latest developments in
the region especially those related to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
More efforts should be made to kickstart the stalled peace talks
to reach a negotiated settlement among all parties, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The envoy of the 15-nation bloc said that the EU was intensively
working to solve the issue of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon
through political and diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 Palestinian refugees have been taking shelter in
12 refugee camps across Lebanon for decades now.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said he is to leave for Washington and then return to
Syria as part of the EU efforts to seek a political solution to the
issues in the region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the EU upholds Lebanon's right to exercise full
sovereignty over all its territories and the EU is concerned about
the current situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy refused to comment on recent remarks made by French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in Jerusalem which branded the
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas as "terrorists".
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived in Beirut on Wednesday afternoon as part of a
regional tour for pushing the sluggish peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israeli-Lebanese and the Israeli-Syrian peace tracks
have sunk into a stalemate because of the escalation of the tit-
for-tat clashes between the Israeli occupation troops in south
Lebanon and the Hezbollah guerrillas, and the differences over the
Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights Israel seized
in the 1967 Middle East war from Syria.

<HEADLINE> Election Watchdog Orders Votes Recount in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A top elections watchdog in Iran on
Wednesday confirmed certain riggings in vote-counting in Tehran
constituency and ordered to recount at least one third of the
ballot boxes to assure accuracy of the parliamentary polls result.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Guardians Council said in a statement that it
has received many complaints from Tehran and other provinces about
possible riggings or mistakes in counting votes in some boxes.
</P>
<P>
Reformists, mainly supporters of the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, won a landslide victory in the 6th Majlis (parliament)
polls held on February 18, dealing a severe blow to the
conservatives, who dominate most of the sensitive state organs of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Latest polling results showed that 225 of a total of 290 seats
in the expanded new Majlis have been confirmed, with reformists
pocketing 170, the conservatives 45 and independents 10.
</P>
<P>
There were serious riggings in certain constituency and most of
the complaints came from Tehran constituency, said the Guardians
Council, which groups six Islamic jurisprudents and six civilian
law experts.
</P>
<P>
Some votes were not counted, it said, and the final result of
the elections would be announced soon after the ballots recount.
</P>
<P>
As complaints by some candidates pouring in, the moderate
Interior Ministry on Tuesday also announced to recount votes from
500 of the total 3,111 boxes in Tehran constituency.
</P>
<P>
Seyed-Javad Qadimi Zaker, director general of national polling
at the ministry, said that the recount started on Tuesday night in
the presence of observers from the Guardians Council and the
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The election result of Tehran constituency was announced last
Saturday after a two-day delay, during which votes from 105 boxes
were recounted by related bodies to "remove all doubts."
</P>
<P>
According to the results, reformists won 29 of the 30 seats for
the city while former President Hashemi Rafsanjani narrowly got a
seat in the Majlis by ranking the 30th in the list.
</P>
<P>
However, Ali Akbar Rahmani, who ranked the 31st in the Tehran
constituency, doubted the accuracy of the vote counting and claimed
that his seat might have been unjustly taken by Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently heading the powerful State Expediency
Council, posed as a centrist in the elections, but he is widely
believed to be close to the conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Defends Arrest of Students Who Stoned French PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian West Bank Security Chief
Gabriel Al-Ragoub on Wednesday defended the arrest of Birzeit
University students who hurled stones on visiting French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ragoub said in press statement here that the security system,
based on video and photograph records, issued arrest warrants
against students who stoned the French prime minister at the campus
in west Bank. He assured that innocent students have not been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Saturday morning when Jospin and his
entourage were to leave the campus after giving a lecture to the
university teachers and students. Over 1,000 Palestinian students ,
angered by Jospin's remarks against the Lebanese Hezbollah,
confronted with the delegation.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Jerusalem on
Thursday, told reporters that he condemned Hezbollah's attacks on
Israeli troops occupying south Lebanon as "terrorism".
</P>
<P>
Al-Ragoub blamed those students for harming the Palestinian-
French ties and turning a friendly foreign country into an
opponent, and called for democratic expression of opinion.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat condemned the stone
attack against Jospin and apologized to the guest.
</P>
<P>
Gaza Security Chief Mohammed Dahlan said Arafat ordered a three-
day closure of Birzeit campus for a comprehensive investigation and
asked the police to present a fact-finding report in 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
However, the protests against Jospin's remarks are still raging
in West bank now as the closure of Birzeit campus entered the
fourth day, said reports available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of students sat in at the campus in protest against
their classmates' detention. About 120 students from various
political trends have been arrested in connection with the stoning
incident, according to one of the students.
</P>
<P>
Some palestinian human rights and law organizations called on
the Palestinian Legislative Council to step in to release the
arrested students.

<HEADLINE> Leap Year Bug Bites Montreal's Tax Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The dreaded leap year bug finally
surfaced in Montreal Tuesday, forcing the city to shut down its
taxation computer system, the Gazette newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A flawed computer program incorrectly interpreted the date of
February 29 as March 1, 1900, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to calculate interest rates on overdue
tax bills.
</P>
<P>
In order to fix the problem, city computer experts had to shut
down the entire taxation system.
</P>
<P>
Residents were still able to pay their taxes, but anyone
looking for information about his tax bill or property evaluation
was turned away from Access Montreal offices across the city, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"We are sorry, but we have a bug and our taxation system is not
working," says a notice posted in front of the Access Montreal at
the city hall.
</P>
<P>
The system was running by late afternoon, after computer
technicians reprogrammed it to accept the current date.
</P>
<P>
Montreal spent almost 12 million Canadian dollars (about 8.3
million U.S. dollars) last year to make its computers Y2K ready.
Tuesday's incident is the only recorded problem, said the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Surges in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Spending on construction
projects around the country increased by 2.7 percent in January,
the biggest increase in nearly two years, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total spending surged to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
751.8 billion U.S. dollars, an all-time-high monthly level. The 2.
7 percent advance marked the strongest pace since a 3.7 percent
rise in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
In December, construction spending rose by 2.1 percent,
slightly more than the government estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Robust construction and housing activity helped fuel the
economy's strong growth last year and Wednesday's report suggested
building activity opened the new year on solid footing.
</P>
<P>
The construction report showed that spending on all government
projects rose 4.15 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
182.8 billion dollars in January. That increase reflected a huge
11.5 percent jump in spending on highways and a 6.25 percent rise
in spending on schools.
</P>
<P>
Spending on all private construction projects, meanwhile, rose
by 2.3 percent in January to an annual rate of 569 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For private projects, nonresidential activity led the way with
a 3.15 percent increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
189.5 billion dollars. That reflected in part higher spending on
office buildings, which rose by 4 percent and increased spending
on hotels and motels, which grew by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
For all residential projects, spending rose by 2.5 percent to
an annual rate of 338.2 billion dollars. Spending on new single-
family homes grew by 2.1 percent, despite rising mortgage rates.
And, spending on apartments went up by 4.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Boy Uses Stolen Gun to Kill His Classmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the six-year-old boy brought the stolen
handgun to Buell Elementary School in Mount Morris Township of
Michigan State in the United States and shot a six-year-old girl.
She died a half hour later.
</P>
<P>
"It would appear he got the weapon from his home," Arthur Busch,
prosecutor of Genesee County of Michigan State, said on The Early
Show on CBS television. "Police discovered stolen weapons and some
contraband (at the boy's home)."
</P>
<P>
"This boy comes from a very troubled home," Busch said, adding
that he is really a victim of a drug culture and a house that's
really chaos.
</P>
<P>
Busch said there may have been "some sort of scuffle or quarrel
on the playground" between the two a day earlier in which one
child slapped the other.
</P>
<P>
The boy pulled the .32-caliber handgun from his pants, aimed it
at another classmate and then turned it on the little girl, Kayla
Rolland, Busch said.
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name was not released, was questioned and
released. He was staying with a relative and police said he would
be put in state custody.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's killing was the latest in a series of shootings to
hit American schools.
</P>
<P>
In April of last year at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colorado State, two high school children killed 12 other students
and a teacher before committing suicide in the worst school
shooting in the U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
One month after that, a student opened fire at Heritage High
School near Conyers, Georgia State, injuring six schoolmates
before being taken into custody.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Make Pinochet Decision Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to decide Thursday
whether former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet is free to return
home or should be extradited on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to make a decision in the case of Senator Pinochet at
8 a.m. tomorrow," Home Secretary Jack Straw said Wednesday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"I will give full reasons for my decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, was arrested in a London hospital in October 1998,
at the request of Spain, which wanted to try him on torture
charges dating from part of his 1973-1990 rule in Chile, during
which thousands of people allegedly died or disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, France and Switzerland have also asked for his
extradition.
</P>
<P>
On January 11, Straw said he was "minded" to send Pinochet home
after a team of British doctors said in a document that he was too
ill to face trials.
</P>
<P>
But all the four countries requesting his extradition have
disagreed with this assessment.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Approves Reform Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission approved
Wednesday an ambitious plan to modernize its financial management
and control, its strategic planning and its personnel policy.
</P>
<P>
The plan, hailed by the commission as the most far-reaching in
its 40-year history, won approval from all the 20 members of the
commission, the executive body of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the objective of the reform plan is to
equip the commission with the capability to fulfill its role with
maximum effectiveness in meeting the challenges facing the 15-
nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Romano Prodi, the commission president, said, "The objective of
reform is to provide the commission with an administration which
is a model of excellence, an administration which is also
exemplary in its use of information technology, working toward a
paperless commission."
</P>
<P>
The reform plan was adopted after long consultations with the
commission staff of more than 16,000 via trade unions, the
European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The commission also planned to cultivate a commission culture
based on service through the establishment of ethical standards
and code of good administrative behavior.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's commission took over last September after the previous
commission stepped down ensuing a scandal of misuse of public
funds.
</P>
<P>
The new commission promised to reform and the reform plan was
the result of this undertaking. Prodi said that the commission is
still to perform the reform and the results of reform will be
there after some time for all to see.
</P>
<P>
Neil Kinnock, commission vice-president in charge of
administrative reform, told the press after answering questions at
the European Parliament that with the adoption of the reform plan,
the commission had reached the end of a process of reflection,
preparation and consultation.
</P>
<P>
"Now we (the commission) are at the beginning of the demanding
period of implementation as we further develop the reform and put
it into practice," he added.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission chief
Wednesday presented an award to the winner of a designing contest
for a concert hall in the war-torn Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Romano Prodi presented the award to a group named "B Flat" that
consists of architects from Sweden, Slovenia, Italy, India and
Britain who were joined by their peers from more than 40 countries
in the design contest.
</P>
<P>
The European community initiated the concept of contest to
select a design for the new concert hall to be built in Sarajevo
where the old concert hall was shelled and burnt down during the
civil war that raged the region between 1992 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was promoted and financed by the Italian city of
Rome and therefore Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli was also present
at the award presentation together with Mustafa Mujezinovic, the
governor of the canton of Sarajevo.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Foreign Minister to Visit Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Austria's new Foreign Minister
Benita Ferrero-Waldner will make her first visit to Switzerland
next week, announced the Swiss Foreign Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner, a member of the mainstream conservative
Austrian People's Party, is scheduled to visit the Swiss capital
of Berne on March 8 when she will hold talks with her Swiss
counterpart, Joseph Deiss.
</P>
<P>
News of Ferrero-Waldner's planned visit came just hours after
Switzerland gave its first reaction to the resignation of Joerg
Haider Monday as leader of Austria's far right Freedom Party.
Deiss welcomed his resignation as a positive gesture towards
Austria's European partners.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 fellow European Union members have frozen
bilateral ties with Vienna over the inclusion of Haider's party in
the government. But Switzerland has steered clear of such moves,
preferring to judge the new government on its actions.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Swiss government spokesman confirmed that Austrian
chancellor Wolfgang Schussel wanted to pay an official visit to
Switzerland and would be made welcome. The spokesman said no date
had been set for the visit but that it was hoped it would take
place soon.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Urges World to Do More for Victims of Africa Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Carol Bellamy has called on the
international community to step up emergency relief for flood-
ravaged African countries.
</P>
<P>
"If the governments of the world are going to help, the time is
now, not tomorrow or the next day," said Bellamy in a press
statement here Wednesday. "The people of southern Africa are in
desperate straits and cannot hang on much longer."
</P>
<P>
She said that thousands of people were still literally hanging
on to treetops, rooftops, and bushy outcroppings as flood waters
swirled around them.
</P>
<P>
There has been a notable shortage of helicopters to carry out
rescue and delivery operations in isolated areas although
additional machinery has been arriving in recent days, according
to the UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
"The people and governments in this flood-affected region are
doing their utmost to survive and prevail, but they need our help,
" Bellamy added. "Rescuing the distressed, reaching out to the
displaced, giving hope to the despondent are all within our power.
It is our moral obligation."
</P>
<P>
Of the flood-ravaged countries of Mozambique, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Madagascar, the UNICEF chief toured
Mozambique and personally witnessed the devastation wrought by the
region's worst flooding in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF estimated that 800,000 to 1 million people had lost
their homes throughout the region and are now in need of urgent
humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations flash appeal is seeking approximately 14
million U.S. dollars for Mozambique alone. Appeals for the other
countries are being finalized pending ongoing assessment missions.

region's worst flooding in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible then," she said, "and circumstances since
have steadily worsened. The international community must recognize
that these floods have doubled or tripled in magnitude, and that
far more people are at risk now than when this first began."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy was in Mozambique on February 17-20 and toured flood-
affected areas by helicopter and on foot. Throughout the region,
it is estimated that 800,000 to 1 million people have lost their
homes and are now in need of urgent humanitarian relief.

<HEADLINE> UK Banks Agree To Cash Machines Surcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Cash machine users in Britain face
charges of at least 1 pound to withdraw their money as banks and
building societies have recently reached an agreement on new
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the members of Link, the national ATM (
automatic teller machine) network, could see customers charged up
to 2.5 pounds a time to withdraw cash from 1 January 2001.
</P>
<P>
The move appeared to set them on a collision course with the
competition authorities and a clear snub to Don Cruickshand, the
head of the government's review into the banking sector, who
insists charges should be limited to 30p.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Association attacked the Link move as an attempt
by the big high street banks to drive out smaller, more efficient
rivals.
</P>
<P>
Neil Walking, a researcher for the association, said, "As well
as giving them the chance to make more profit from charges, this
allows them to prevent rival banks offering free access to their
cash machines by setting charges well above the true cost of
providing the service."

<HEADLINE> EU, Turkey Meet on Accession Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and Turkey
have met here to discuss the latter's prospect of accession to the
15-nation western bloc, the European Commission said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral meeting, held Tuesday between EU Economy and
Finance Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira and Turkish Economy
Minister Recep Onal, reviewed the fact that Turkey had initiated
an economic stability program in order to decrease inflation and
increase economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Both Solbes and Onal expressed their willingness to initiate a
dialogue in the economic and monetary fields between the European
Union and Turkey that was included in the accession list only last
December.
</P>
<P>
The European Union spoke highly of Turkey's accession-oriented
achievements and the emphasis of the meeting was put on the
importance of the assistance the EU nations would give Turkey
during the pre-accession period.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had been asking for three decades to join the European
Union but its demand was turned away by the European Union in
December 1997 that led to a deterioration of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the European Union decided
last December in Helsinki to include Turkey in its list of
accession that already includes Poland, the Czech Republic ,
Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Bulgaria and Malta.
</P>
<P>
The EU has started official accession negotiations with the 12
countries but did not do the same with Turkey. Some EU member
states have been criticizing the human rights record of the
country that strides over two continents. Turkey is a member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Home Networking Market to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Enormous interest in home
connectivity from nearly every industry will cause the worldwide
home networking equipment and residential gateway market to grow
rapidly in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. market
research firm Cahners In-Stat Group, the worldwide market is
expected to grow from some 600 million U.S. dollars in 2000 to
over 5.7 billion dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
"From a market that a couple of years ago was seen as only a
small niche to be served by networking equipment companies, today
we see every company in the consumer electronics and PC industries,
as well as service provider space, developing products and
strategies for the connected home," the report said. "All aspects
of this connected home -- communications, entertainment and home
systems management -- will be interconnected in the future using
networking and Internet technology."
</P>
<P>
But the research firm said that the market will take time to
develop. The networked home will move from today's first
generation products, such as basic PC adapter cards and simple
gateways, to a future where connectivity technology is embedded in
recognizable devices that nontechnical users are familiar and
comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
New connectivity-based services, enabled through home
networking technology, will help drive growth in this market,
Cahners found. Additional voice lines, home management and
monitoring, as well as new value-added entertainment services will
create a connectivity services market worth 3 billion dollars by
2004.

Agency, was appointed to the post in late January and took up his
duties Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Blix said he would have 45 days to pick
up personnel for the UNMOVIC and draft a working plan, subject to
the approval of the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Blix said he will finish these before April 15 as requested by
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The chief U.N. arms inspector said the U.N. resolution adopted
last December and other U.N. resolutions on Iraq would be the "
road map" for him to do the work..
</P>
<P>
He said he was taking a technical job from the United Nations
Security Council and his job was to conduct arms inspection in
Iraq in accordance with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Blix said the UNMOVIC should have unconditional access to the
sites it wants to inspect, which was set by relevant U.N.
resolutions and it was indispensable.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was not a country under occupation, and it was under the
control of the Iraqi government, and the U.N. arms inspectors were
not an army and not commander troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1284 last
December which created the UNMOVIC to replace the United Nations
Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. U.N. arms inspection in Iraq has been suspended since
the U.S.-led military strikes against the country in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has so far refused to accept Resolution 1284 and
reiterated that lifting sanctions is the precondition for the U.N.
arms inspectors to return to the country.
</P>
<P>
Blix was confident that Iraq would accept the resolution and
cooperate with the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Stress Strategic Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting President Vladimir
Putin and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan Wednesday pledged
to strengthen the strategic partnership of cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the current international situation, the strengthened
cooperation between China and Russia not only conforms to the
fundamental interests of the two nations, it is also of great
significance to the progress of a multi-polar world and the
establishment of a just and reasonable new world order, said
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a personal message, which Tang
delivered to Putin at a meeting with him in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Putin, for his part, said that Russia attaches great importance
to the Russia-China strategic partnership of cooperation, which is
very useful for accelerating the two people's interests and
strengthening world and regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
As the two states have broad common interests, he said,
developing bilateral strategic cooperation is the two peoples'
common desire as well as a most significant factor of global
security.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived here Monday for a three-day official visit,
fully agreed with Putin's viewpoints, stressing that maintaining
good neighborly relationship and expanding reciprocal cooperation
between the two states coincide with their fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
As permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
China and Russia take upon themselves special responsibilities for
preserving world peace and stability, said the Chinese minister.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to work together to promote bilateral
cooperation in various fields to a new high, and to make full
preparation for the fifth regular meeting of the premiers,
scheduled for this year in Beijing, in order to achieve more
practical results in future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tang believed that the strategic partnership between China and
Russia also helps boost the progress of a multi-polar world as
well as the establishment of a just and reasonable new world order.
</P>
<P>
The sides shared the opinion that any attempt or practice to
destroy the territorial integrity of a sovereign state is
unacceptable and the argument about alleged "humanitarian
intervention" is very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Putin reiterated Russia's "One-China" policy and its persistent
stance on the Taiwan issue, which is expounded in all previously
reached bilateral documents. He reaffirmed support for China's
efforts in peaceful national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tang expressed support for Russia's anti-terrorist
operations in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's invitation for
Putin to visit China this year.
</P>
<P>
Thanking the Chinese president and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
for their warmest regards that Tang had carried to him, Putin
asked the minister to convey his warmest regards to Jiang and Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Tang ended his first official visit to Russia late Wednesday,
during which he met Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican PM Warns of Secondary Effects of Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi told parliament Wednesday that more than one million
people could be expected to suffer the secondary effects of the
worst flooding in the country in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Assembly of the Republic on the floods, Mocumbi
said there is a strong possibility that river valleys in the
center and north of the country could be affected.
</P>
<P>
Should there be further flooding in these areas, the number of
people in need of relief could rise to over a million and a half,
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government has to rethink its entire economic
and social plan for the year 2000, in order to include "the need
for urgent rehabilitation of damaged infrastructures, and to
restore a normal life to those affected."
</P>
<P>
Due to the destructive flooding, Mozambicans are facing
increased vulnerability to disease and shortages of consumer
goods.
</P>
<P>
People, particularly those in rural areas, may become
vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity since their already
precarious ability to support themselves has been reduced still
further, Mocumbi said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the rainy season continues for at least another month,
we'll have to respect the prognosis of the scientists and prepare
ourselves for difficult conditions in the Zambezi and Licungo
basins, and perhaps others", he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 150 people have died in the flooding in central and
southern Mozambique, and dozens of others are missing, the prime
minister told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that the number of people directly affected by the
floods has risen to 900,000, of whom over 300,000 have been made
homeless.
</P>
<P>
The economic losses are enormous, Mocumbi said, adding that
over 100,000 hectares of crops have been washed away, and over
40,000 head of cattle been drowned.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo-Zimbabwe railway is severely damaged, as are many
roads, electricity transmission lines, and water supply and
sanitation systems.
</P>
<P>
The Pungue river in Sofala Province is currently rising. A
large flood on the Pungue could cut the road between Beira and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, water from Malawi is pouring down the Shire river
into the Zambezi, which could threaten to flood on the lower
Zambezi.

<HEADLINE> NGOs Forced to Withdraw From Areas Controlled by Sudanese Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Seven international humanitarian
agencies have completed the forced withdrawal of their staff in
accordance with the instructions of the Sudan Relief and
Rehabilitation Association, the humanitarian arm of the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Movement.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement issued here Wednesday by these
non- governmental organizations, they were unable to sign the
draft of a memorandum of understanding Tuesday as required by the
Sudanese association.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese association announced on January 12 that there
could be no further discussion of the text of the memorandum and
imposed a March 1 deadline for NGOs to sign the document or leave
the area of southern Sudan under the control of the Sudan People's
Liberation Movement.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs including Oxfam, World Vision International and Carter
Center, said in the joint statement that it has been impossible to
reach an agreement before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
According to the current draft of memorandum, the NGOs are
required to work in accordance with the objectives of the Sudanese
association rather than based solely on humanitarian principles
and clauses, which could reduce individual NGO's ability to
guarantee the safety of their staff.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs appealed to the Sudanese association to reopen
negotiations on the memorandum, saying that they are committed to
the people of Sudan and tot he provision of humanitarian
assistance of the highest quality.
</P>
<P>
The interruption of the negotiation process and the subsequent
departure of a number of NGOs leaves a significant gap in the
provision of humanitarian service in southern Sudan, the NGOs
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the desire to restart discussion with the
association, the statement said, the NGOs who have been forced to
leave the control areas by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement
are continuing to work in other parts of southern Sudan.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government has
rescheduled Zambia's debt of 35 million U.S. dollars and 23
billion Italian Lira (about 1.5 million dollars) to be repaid in
33 years under an agreement signed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The debt Zambia owed to Italy was supposed to be paid between
March of 1999 and March of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Zambian Finance Minister
Katele Kalumba said the debt reschedule would go a long way in
promoting the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government is currently working on modalities to
reduce or completely write off the country's debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister hailed the combined efforts by the Italian
government and the Episcopal Conference Initiative on debt relief
for Zambia and reiterated the Zambian government's commitment to
poverty reduction and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, Italian Ambassador to Zambia
Umberto Plaja said his country is committed to cancelling Zambia's
debt and would soon pass a law to ensure that the debt is reduced
or cancelled.
</P>
<P>
Plaja also said that a team of Italian experts will come to
Zambia soon to study the investment potential of the southern
African country.

<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Centre for
Research in Agro-forestry (Icraf) will build a regional office in
Zimbabwe to coordinate its projects in Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirayi Kangai
signed the agreement with Icraf Director General Pedro Sanchez on
Wednesday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said the establishment of the regional office will help
agricultural research, development and implementation of
technologies to alleviate poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said many countries in the Southern African region were
experiencing population growths exceeding three percent annually
and this was forcing small-holder farmers to settle on fragile
resource areas with limited capacity.
</P>
<P>
 He urged Icraf to incorporate technology dissemination
components in their research programs to maximize the adoption of
results by farmers.

<HEADLINE> Murder Cases Decrease in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Incidents of murder and
attempted murder per 100,000 people decreased from 69.5 to 55.3
and 70.7 to 66.7 respectively over the past five years, a senior
South African police officer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 12 other serious crimes, including rape, had stabilized
from June 1999 until the end of January 2000, said Johan Burger,
assistant commissioner of the South African Police Service, said
in Midrand, near Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The figures are based on a study by the Information Analysis
Center of the South African Police Service.
</P>
<P>
Burger attributed the crime decreases directly to "Operation
Monozite", which started last June.
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of the operation, police have reportedly
arrested more than 15,000 people for offenses such as hijacking,
bank robberies and the possession of unlicensed firearms.
</P>
<P>
Burger said a new development in the police service, the
National Crime Combating Forum, will further contribute in the
fight against crime. Government departments such as Justice,
Correctional Services and Welfare, will be involved in the
strategy.
</P>
<P>
Overall crime levels decreased by 4.7 percent in the Western
Cape Province and by three percent in KwaZulu-Natal Province, from
June 1999 until the end of January this year.
</P>
<P>
The crime levels in Gauteng Province appeared to have
stabilized over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The figures for other provinces would be released at a later
stage.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Adopt New Anti-Crime Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South African police have
adopted new anti-crime strategies which will result in an
"immense dent" in criminal activity in the next three years,
National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told the National Assembly's safety and security committee
that officers in the South african Police Service (SAPS) were
absolutely committed to the fight against crimes.
</P>
<P>
The SAPS had identified those of the 1,136 police stations
which shouldered the biggest burden in dealing wiith crime, and
extra resources would be channeled there.
</P>
<P>
Personnel would be moved, within reason, to the areas where
they were most needed, while training would also focus on needs,
such as anti-crime intelligence gathering, Selebi said.
</P>
<P>
One of the SAPS' greatest weaknesses was in intelligence
gathering, which was hampering effective crime prevention, Selebi
said.
</P>
<P>
Another priority in the immediate future was the recruitment
and training of detectives, according to Selebi.
</P>
<P>
He said focus would be on investigating crime syndicates as a
whole, and not individual crimes.
</P>
<P>
In the past, SAPS had dealt with organized crime in a
disjointed way, with separate investigators concentrating on
offences relating to drugs, hijackings and firearms.
</P>
<P>
No more than about 100 of the organized crime syndicates in
operation had an immediate impact on the economy, and these would
be targeted.
</P>
<P>
Such syndicates were involved in, among other areas, the theft
of medical supplies and medicines from the state, and reselling
them, according to South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the lack of discipline in the police, Selebi said
there would be no compromise and the matter would be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The problem had arisen due to the "de-militarization" of SAPS.
</P>
<P>
SAPS had to return to basics regarding discipline and a deputy
national commissioner was being appointed to take charge of this.
</P>
<P>
The problem of corruption within the police, involving a small
group, was also receiving urgent attention, Selebi said.

<HEADLINE> Floods Cause Drop of Zimbabwe's Food Crops: Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyclone Eline floods have caused a
15 to 20 percent reduction in forecast yields of food crops,
Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirayi Kangai said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The strong winds and heavy incessant rains that fell in
Manicaland, Masvingo and Matabeleland South provinces last week
resulted in floods that wiped out 20 to 25 percent of crop cover
in the three provinces, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said preliminary assessments had shown that of the 1.6
million tons of the staple maize grain yield expected for this
season, only between 80 and 85 percent would now be realized.
</P>
<P>
This would further deplete food supplies in the southern
African country whose maize demands are 1.9 million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said the situation could deteriorate further if the
floods recurred as feared by weather experts.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 750,000 people are expected to need prolonged food
relief as their only hope for self sustenance could come in the
next farming season.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice-President Joseph
Msika said Wednesday that his government is working on new
macro-economic fundamentals that would promote the growth of the
informal sector.
</P>
<P>
There is need for the southern African country to move away
from the donor dependency syndrome through developing its informal
sector, the vice- president told a national women and youth
workshop on entrepreneurial development held in Bulawayo, the
second largest city of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The government will soon come up with initiatives aimed at
strengthening the business sector in the wake of the negative
impact of globalization and trade liberalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraging a multi-stakeholder approach that will
endeavor to give small and middle enterprises access to
micro-finance, enterprise development assistance and alternative
fair trade schemes," Msika said.
</P>
<P>
He said the informal sector has not been given the attention
and assistance it deserves despite its importance to the growth of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are now advocating for a new economic order that is
conscious of the need to alleviate poverty among the majority of
our marginalized people, most of whom are in the informal sector,"
the vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Minister of State Sithembiso Nyoni said
there is need for cooperation between the government, private
sector and the community in the informal sector.

western Cyangugu Prefecture Tuesday passed judgement for 40
suspects all accused of genocide and other crimes against humanity
in 1994, Rwanda News Agency reported on Wednesday.

KUWAIT CITY, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Wednesday reaffirmed
its support for efforts aimed to ensure stability on the world oil
market, while its oil experts called for an extension of the

</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Deifallah Sharar said after
Kuwaiti cabinet's weekly meeting that the cabinet has asserted its
abidance by the decisions of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
It also voiced keenness on backing any efforts designed to

</P>
<P>
But the official refused to tell if the oil-rich Gulf emirate

prices on the global market.
</P>
<P>
A number of Kuwaiti oil experts on Wednesday strongly

OPEC members and some producers out of the cartel.
</P>

The OPEC quotas agreement, under which member states began to
reduce their production by 1.7 million barrels per day on April
1999, will expire by the end of this month.

The OPEC policy at first succeeded in lifting oil prices from
below 10 U.S. dollars per barrel at the start of last year, and
then sending the prices to its nine-year high recently.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti experts said, however, OPEC members and other oil
producer should extend oil production cuts beyond March, as
increasing output will cause the prices to fall again.
</P>
<P>
Although oil prices surged to nearly 30 dollars per barrel in
mid-February, some OPEC members are still fearing a relaxing of the
present output squeeze will undermine their efforts to maintain a
balanced international market.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Relief still a Major Goal of ADB: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development
Bank (ADB) still views poverty reduction as its most important job
to do at the moment after most countries in the region recovered
from the worst financial crisis in decades, a senior official of
the bank told reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After many Asian countries have recovered from the crisis, the
ADB will continue to provide policy advices for the governments to
mobilize the resources, to ensure most of the bank's fund programs
work in the right direction and to work in a way that overall
quality of life of the people will improve, said Bindu Lohani,
secretary of the bank.
</P>
<P>
He cited the following as three pillars in poverty reduction --
to achieve growth so that it will help the poor, to target the
poor so that they can be direct beneficiaries of the growth and to
improve governance.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank has pledged that 40 percent of its investment
each year, which amounts to five billion U.S. dollars, will be in
poverty reduction related projects.
</P>
<P>
Lohani is here attending a pre-seminar of the 33rd annual
meeting of the Board of Governors of the ADB, which is scheduled
for May 6-8.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that the Chiang Mai meeting will send an optimistic
message to the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
The ADB was established in 1966 as a multilateral financial
institution aiming to promote the economic and social development
of the members.
</P>
<P>
The principal objectives of the ADB are to promote development
among its members in terms of economic growth, poverty reduction,
development of human resources, improvement of the status of women
and the conservation of the environment, with poverty reduction as
its major goal.
</P>
<P>
To date, the ADB has extended loans to its members amounting to
82 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Minister Tries to Appease Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Amidst mixed reactions to the
general budget for the coming financial year tabled before the
Indian parliament Tuesday, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
Wednesday tried to appease industries, promising that the on-going
reform process would not stop.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar organized by the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) here, Sinha said the
reform process would move more strongly once the various budgetary
measures he announced in the budget were absorbed in the system.
</P>
<P>
The budget invited mixed reactions with industries and
exporters severely criticizing the government for harsh tax
proposals and the opposition parties sharply attacking the budget
as a lackluster exercise. The military, however, welcomed the
remarkable increase in the defense spending.
</P>
<P>
Apex chambers hit at the government for continuing the
surcharge on corporate tax and phased withdrawal of concessions to
export income without taking effective measures to check the
fiscal deficit and non-plan expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"I know I am criticized for keeping the fiscal deficit target
at 5.1 percent," Sinha told the industrial leaders, adding: "When
I had to increase the plan allocation by an additional 360 billion
rupees (8.37 billion U.S. dollars) the fiscal deficit had to be
kept above five percent."
</P>
<P>
He told the seminar that the government had deliberately kept
the disinvestment target at a modest 100 billion rupees (2.32
billion dollars), adding that this was done to keep the
credibility of the figures. He hoped the target would be exceeded
during 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
The government had to look into the background of certain
events including higher allocation to defense and development
schemes before preparing the budget for 2000-01 which begins on
April 1, Sinha explained.
</P>
<P>
The budget put defense expenditure at 585.87 billion rupees (13.
62 billion U.S. dollars), a record increase of 28.2 percent over
the financial year 1999-2000 ending March 31.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hike in defense expenditure, Sinha said, the
central government had to make additional devolution totaling 110
billion rupees (2.55 billion dollars) to the states.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed 20 percent dividend tax on companies, increased
surcharge and unchecked fiscal deficit, FICCI said they were the
negative aspects of the otherwise modern budget aimed at
catalyzing the economy into a higher growth orbit.
</P>
<P>
In his budget, Sinha set India's economic growth rate at 7-8
percent for the next financial year with an aim to put the country
on a "sustained, equitable and job creating" basis and to
eradicate poverty within a decade.
</P>
<P>
However, Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry President
Shekhar Bajaj said the budget was not positive for the industry
and corporates as the financial minister did not "bite the bullet"
to check the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee hailed the
budget as "responsible, reform-oriented and forward-looking" and
said the burden on the common people would "not be heavy." But the
opposition parties said the budget "failed to address the problems
of unemployment, poverty and infrastructure."

<HEADLINE> Chief U.N. Arms Inspector Takes Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Executive Chairman of
the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission (UNMOVIC) for Iraq Hans Blix took office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hans Blix, former Swedish head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), was appointed to the post in late January.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Resolution 1284 adopted last December requested Blix to
pick up the personnel for the UNMOVIC and draw a working plan,
subject to the approval of the U.N. Security Council, within 45
days of his appointment.
</P>
<P>
The resolution created the UNMOVIC to replace the now defunct
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM has been barred by Iraq from returning to the
country to resume arms inspection. It withdrew from Iraq days
before the U.S.-led military strikes against the country in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hans Blix served as director-general of the IAEA from 1981
to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hans Blix was born in 1928 in Uppsala, Sweden. He studied
at the University of Uppsala, at Columbia University, where he was
also a research graduate and at Cambridge, where he received his
Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
In 1959 he became doctor of laws at Stockholm University and in
1960 was appointed associate professor in international law.
</P>
<P>
He has an honorary doctorate from Moscow State University (1987)
and is a recipient of the Henry de Wolf Smyth Award (Washington, D.
C. 1988).
</P>
<P>
From 1963 to 1976, Dr. Blix was head of department at the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs and served as legal adviser on
international law.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, he became undersecretary of state at the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs in charge of international development cooperation.
He was appointed minister for foreign affairs in October 1978.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Montreal's 80-Year-Old Former Hockey Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A violent fire has destroyed one of
the earliest homes of the Montreal Canadiens, an 80-year-old
former hockey arena, the Montreal-based Gazette newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire reduced to little more than rubble late Tuesday a 60,
000-square-foot commercial building that was once the Mount Royal
Arena.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 firefighters were involved in battling the blaze
for eight hours, only to lose the two-story brick building on
Mount Royal Ave to out-of-control flames.
</P>
<P>
"This is an old-style building, the wood is really dry. It
spread so rapidly, partly because of the material that the stores
had inside," the Montreal Fire Department was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Commercial losses were estimated at more than 2 million
Canadian dollars (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars), but it was the
value of hockey history that was mostly cherished for the building.
</P>
<P>
It was originally built in 1911 with a capacity of 3,000 seats.
In 1919, the capacity was expanded to 0,000 seats before the re-
built arena was officially inaugurated in January 1920 to hockey
mad Canadians.

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Primaries in Virginia, North Dakota, Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
defeated his rival John McCain in the presidential primaries in
Virginia, North Dakota and Washington Tuesday, recapturing the
lead in the struggle for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
In Virginia, Bush beat McCain 53-44 percent. Bush had 350,185
votes and McCain had 290,779 votes. Another contender Alan Keyes
had 20,294 votes, or 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the primary, McCain was punished by religious conservatives
for harshly attacking two prominent leaders of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
Virginia's was an open-to-all primary, but Republicans cast two-
thirds of the vote and rallied overwhelmingly to Bush.
</P>
<P>
In North Dakota, Bush had 6,865 votes, or 76 percent, and
McCain had 1,717 votes, or 19 percent. Keyes had 481 votes, or 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
In Washington state, with 98 percent of precincts reporting,
Bush had 214,611 votes, or 58 percent, and McCain had 141,151
votes, or 38 percent. Keyes had 8,955 votes, or 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he's "not going to rest" yet as the two rivals are
focusing their attention on Super Tuesday on March 7, when over a
dozen states will hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore rebuffed Bill Bradley's last-
chance bid for headway in his faltering challenge before
Democratic contests in 15 states next Tuesday that could decide
who wins that nomination.
</P>
<P>
Gore won overwhelmingly in Washington state's primary. With 98
percent of precincts reporting, Gore won 68 percent to Bradley's
31 percent, or 148,335 votes to 68,550.
</P>
<P>
"This is really a sweet, sweet victory," Gore said. "We climbed
another mountain."
</P>
<P>
The presidential candidates of the Republican and Democratic
parties will be decided at their national conventions in the
coming summer. A candidate needs 1,034 delegate votes to win the
Republican nomination. Bush, with his victories in the three
states Tuesday, now has 170 delegates, McCain 105, and Keyes 5.
The Democratic candidate needs 2,170. Gore has 42 to Bradley's 27.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Ireland Set New N.Irish Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish governments
on Wednesday sketched out a new timetable for Northern Ireland's
deadlocked peace process, said Prime Minister Tony Blair's
official spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Blair talked to his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern by telephone
to agree to a framework for the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson and Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen will hold talks
with the province's political parties in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The focus will then switch to New York for its famous March 17
St. Patrick's Day celebrations, with U.S. President Bill Clinton
weighing in, before Blair and Ahern take stock on March 20 and
again a few days later when they attend the European Union summit
in Lisbon, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's peace process plunged into crisis earlier
last month when Mandelson suspended the province's home-rule
government on the grounds that the Irish Republican Army had not
taken steps to disarm.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted government sources as saying that they
expected representatives of most of the key Northern Ireland
parties to be in the United States for St. Patrick's Day.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Average Gas Price Hits New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada's average gasoline price hit
a new high of 70 cents (about 0.48 U.S. dollars) a liter Tuesday,
a week after a previous record of 69.7 cents was reported.
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight week in which self-service price for
regular unleaded gas set a record, according to Calgary-based
consultants MJ Ervin &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
In Toronto, many stations charged 71.9 cents (about 0.50
dollars) for regular unleaded, while truck stops near the city
asked 69.9 cents for diesel oil.
</P>
<P>
In St. John's, Newfoundland, unleaded gas fetched 79.9 cents (
about 0.55 dollars) while diesel oil reached 82.9 cents (about 0.
57 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The big four oil companies, Petro-Canada, Imperial, Sunoco and
Shell, all reported running out of gasoline at some stations in
southern Ontario.
</P>
<P>
A Petro-Canada official, Donna Hildebrant, attributed the high
crude oil price to cutbacks by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a return to profitable levels, given the price of
crude oil on the world market," she said.
</P>
<P>
The country saw a peak of 67.1 cents (about 0.46 dollars) a
liter for its average gasoline price in 1990, when war loomed in
the Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Opposition Bill Darkens Fate of Possible Syrian-Israeli Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A bill raised by Israeli
opposition Likud Party that is meant to make the future peace deal
with Syria more difficult to get approval in Israel passed its
preliminary reading Wednesday in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The bill that requires an absolute majority in ratifying the
handover of the occupied Golan Heights to Syria in a referendum
received greenlight in its first reading by a vote of 60 to 53,
with one absention. Two more readings are needed before the bill
becomes law.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, submitted by Likud lawmaker Silvan Shalom, 61 "
yes" votes in the 120-member Knesset (parliament) and 50 percent
plus one of all eligible voters in a national referendum are needed
to endorse a possible peace treaty with Syria. All the votes of the
voters who fail to cast their ballots are interpreted as "no."
</P>
<P>
The Likud bill will without doubt make the handover of Golan
more difficult to get approval in Israel in comparison with a
government referendum bill that requires a simple majority of votes
cast.
</P>
<P>
In Israel where the turnout has never exceeded 80 percent of the
registered voters traditionally, it will mean that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak must garner at least 63 percent of the cast
votes to win referendum, which is called by some "mission
impossible." In January 1999, the Knesset passed the Golan
Heights Bill, which stipulated that any decision to remove "Israeli
law, jurisdiction and administration" from the Heights would
require the approval of at least 61 Knesset members and then the
ratification of a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
The strategic plateau in southwestern Syria was seized by Israel
in the 1967 Middle East War and formally annexed in 1981, a
decision that is never recognized by Syria and the international
communities.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks resumed last December after a 45-
month break, but they hit impasse again only after two round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's admission recently of his predecessors' promise to hand
in full back of the Golan to Syria has brought a thread of hope for
resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the bill has undoubtedly dealt a blow to Barak's
government and increased uncertainties on the fate of Syrian-
Israeli peace process that is plaguing by mounting tensions in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Terming Likud's bill as racism, Barak's government accused the
rightist party of attempting to neutralize the vote of nearly 1
million Israeli Arab citizens, who are supposed to endorse any
peace deal with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Making the situation even worse, three partners in Barak's
ruling coalition voted for the Likud bill that sounds alarm of a
possible coalition crisis ahead.
</P>
<P>
During a caucus held on Monday night, Yitzhak Levy, leader of
the National Religious Party, and Natan Sharansky, leader of
Yisrael Ba'aliya, announced that their lawmakers will vote for the
Likud's bill.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of the
orthodox religious Shas party, decided that all its 17 lawmakers
will give greenlight for the Likud's bill.
</P>
<P>
The instructions of Yosef, usually a dovish figure supporting
the peace process but hardening his stand on the Golan Heights
withdrawal in the past few months, was a really dangerous signal to
Barak that his coalition is facing the breakup.
</P>
<P>
Official in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon had warned that
no coalition faction would have freedom of choice in this vote and
a violation of coalition discipline would mean a sudden coalition
crisis. But his warnings is to no avail.
</P>
<P>
To mobilize support for the government, Barak's office called
Shimon Peres and Shlomo Ben-Ami, the two ministers who were
visiting abroad to return home immediately to take part in the
voting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh also cut short his
visit to the United States to fly back to Israel. However, these
efforts were also proved no use.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts pointed out that the government stopped dealing
with the referendum bill and rested easy because of the suspension
of the Israeli-Syrian negotiations, which enabled the Likud to take
occasion to push through its bill.
</P>
<P>
The analysts also warned that though the bill needs two more
readings to get final approval, the passage in the first reading
has sent a dangerous message to Syria and the international
community that Israel had no serious intention of peace.
</P>
<P>
Syria which is hesitant about going back to the negotiating
table will worry that a deal sealed with Israel is meaningless
because it will most likely be killed in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
It would also tie Barak's hands under the negotiating table,
since now he has to ensure his efforts to make a peace deal with
Syria will not be rejected by the Knesset and easily defeated in a
national referendum, which will definitely announce a humiliated
end of his political life.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Bill Passes Preliminary Reading in Israeli Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua)-- A bill submitted by the Israeli
opposition on referendum over a future peace deal with Syria passed
the preliminary reading in the Israeli Knesset (parliament) on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 120-member Knesset approved the bill, which was sponsored by
opposition Likud's legislator Silvan Shalom, with a vote of 60-53
with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
Knesset members from Shas, the National Religious Party and
Ysrael Ba'aliya, which are part of the coalition headed by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, joined the opposition in the voting.
</P>
<P>
After the voting, Barak said that although he does not take the
voting lightly, the importance of the preliminary voting should not
be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Haim Ramon, the minister in the Prime Minister's office,
criticized the three parties of the coalition for their voting with
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"The victory for the opposition today in the Knesset, backed by
the coalition factions, will force One Israel bloc to reconsider
its future course," Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
The bill, on procedure for a national referendum Barak has
pledged to hold on a future peace pact with Syria, will need two
further readings to become a law, but its passing in the
preliminary reading is a sharp blow to the government and possibly
its stability.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates a referendum on any peace deal involving
ceding the Golan Heights to Syria must be passed by more than 50
percent of all eligible voters on official rolls, rather than a
simple majority as demanded by the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the peace deal with Syria will also require the
support of at least 61 members of the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the bill is intended to prevent the Israeli
Arab vote from deciding on the future of the Golan Heights and the
territories. It also will make it more difficult for Barak to make
a peace deal, since Barak has to ensure what he presents to the
Knesset and in a referendum will win public support.
</P>
<P>
After the preliminary reading, the bill will be sent to the
Knesset Law Committee for discussion before the second and the
third readings in the Knesset.

He said it was impossible for the PNA to stand still without
taking a crucial and decisive move over this issue which is of
great importance to Jerusalem and the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "We asked all authorized Palestinian
ambassadors all over the world to convey to the governments of the
concerned countries our clear message that any official who is
subject to the Israeli pressures and refuses to visit East
Jerusalem will not be received elsewhere by Palestinian officials."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians would not bow to the Israeli pressures and
blackmailing which are a clear-cut violation to Palestinian rights
in Jerusalem during this crucial period of the final status
negotiations, Sha'ath stressed.
</P>
<P>
On February 22, European Parliament President Nicole Fontaine,
who was on a visit in the region, rejected to meet with Faisal
Husseini, Palestinian National Authority's minister for Jerusalem
affairs, at the Orient House, the unofficial headquarters of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab eastern part of Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East war. It insists that Jerusalem is its eternal and
indivisible capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as
the capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The final status of the Holy City, widely acknowledged as one of
the thorniest issues in the entire peace process, is to be decided
in permanent status talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians see the visits to East Jerusalem made by
foreign officials as a significant symbol and a sign of support to
the Palestinian sovereignty over the city, while Israel regards
such visits as an intervention in the negotiations between the two
sides.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Bill on Syria Passes First Reading in Israeli Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A bill raised by Israeli
opposition Likud party, that will make a future deal with Syria
more difficult to be approved, Wednesday passed its first reading
in the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The bill that requires an absolute majority in endorsing a
possible deal with Syria in a referendum was approved in its first
reading by a vote of 60 to 53, with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
Although the bill needs two more readings before becoming law,
Wednesday's voting is a sharp blow to the government and possibly
its stability.
</P>
<P>
Knesset members from Shas, the National Religious Party and
Ysrael Ba'aliya, which are part of the ruling coalition headed by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, joined the opposition in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The bill requires that a referendum on any peace deal involving
ceding the Golan Heights to Syria must be passed by more than 50
percent of all eligible voters on official rolls, rather than a
simple majority as demanded by the government.
</P>
<P>
Under this bill, the peace deal with Syria will also require the
support of at least 61 members of the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Many believe the bill is intended to prevent the Arab Israelis'
vote from deciding on the future of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
After the preliminary reading, the bill will be sent to the
Knesset Law Committee for discussion before the second and the
third readings in the Knesset.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that it has received 1 Million U.S. dollars from the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for the comprehensive
legal protection of Filipino children.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, Vice-President Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo, also the social welfare secretary, said the
government has entered a program with UNICEF for the development
of a child-friendly investigation process.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo noted that with the program it will provide support for
the legal protection of the child abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
"This initiative aims to strengthen legal protection and make
reforms in the administration of the juvenile justice system for
the Filipino children," she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, she added, it also aims to train judges,
prosecutors, penologists, police, social workers and other members
of the five pillars of justice involved in child abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
"This effort will provide welfare support, recovery and
reintegration services for children-victims as they go through the
various stages in the juvenile justice system," Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
According to Arroyo, the amount of 1 million dollars fund is
applicable for over a period of three years from 2000 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
Among the 2.8 million working children nationwide, over 220,000
are street children, 60,000 are sexually exploited and thousands
of other children are in need of special protection.

<HEADLINE> India Accuses Pakistan of Repeated Violations of LoC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- India on Wednesday rejected
Pakistan's allegation that New Delhi was escalating tension along
the Line of Control (LoC) and accused Islamabad of repeated
violations of the LoC to invite international attention.
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to generate tension on the LoC," an Indian
foreign office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
India's objective has always been to have a regime of peace and
tranquillity on the LoC, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
India on Tuesday lodged a strong protest over the alleged
violation of the LoC by Pakistani troops last Sunday in Jammu and
Kashmir, in which 7 Indian soldiers were reportedly killed and one
still missing.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, however, made a sharp reaction to the Indian protest,
saying India had sent additional forces along the LoC with the
intention to escalate tension.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indian army claimed on Wednesday that since the
end of the Kargil conflict between India and Pakistan last year,
some 1,650 to 1,950 "terrorists" had crossed the LoC and sneaked
into Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The army foiled 79 infiltration attempts along the LoC during
1999, killing 124 "terrorists" and apprehending 36 others, Indian
Defense Minister George Fernandes said in a written reply to
parliament on Wednesday.

SINGAPORE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed lower on the

<HEADLINE> Zambia Raises Over $100M From Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has raised
more than 100 million U.S. dollars from the privatization of 240
state-owned companies, Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister
William Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said this at the first economic conference of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) which ended
in Cairo, Egypt Tuesday, the Zambia News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A further 300 million dollars of investment have been committed
to Zambia's economy by the new investors, Harrington was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
''The program (privatization) has been tremendously successful
and this is due to unwavering commitment of government and rare
political consultative,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization process in Zambia has attracted an
influx of major international investors from across the world.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government would like to see investment coming from
Egypt and is already encouraged by the interest shown by Egyptian
investors in the Nitrogen Chemical of Zambia scheduled for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Harrington said investors from Egypt and other textile
manufacturing countries are invited to come and explore available
investment opportunities in Zambia's textile industry.
</P>
<P>
He is hopeful that Egyptian and other African investors would
participate in the forthcoming privatization transaction in the
telecommunication, energy and backing sectors in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government and the private sector have already
shown serious commitment to invest in Zambia's textile and
fertilizer industries.
</P>
<P>
However, Harrington noted that of over 1,000 companies listed
on the Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges, only two have shown
interest to participate in Zambia's privatization program.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Tourism Recovering: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry of Uganda has
been recovering in the past year, Ugandan Minister of Tourism,
Trade and Industry Moses Ali said.
</P>
<P>
One year has passed since March 1, 1999 when eight foreign
tourists were killed by terrorists in the Bwindi National Park in
western Uganda, Radio Uganda said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a message marking the first anniversary of the massacre, the
minister said that the number of the tourists visiting the
national park have been increasing by over 200 each month.
</P>
<P>
He thanked all those who contributed to this rapid recovery and
said that the government would ensure the safety of all foreign
tourists to the east African country. Now all national parks in
Uganda are guarded by government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Bwindi incident plunged Uganda's tourism industry to an
all-time low and many foreign tourists cancelled their trips to
the country, for fear that their safety could not be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The Bwindi National Park is reportedly contributing some 70
percent of the country's tourism revenue. More than 300 mountain
gorillas, half of the world's total, are living in the park.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Fitch IBCA, the international
rating agency (FI), Monday affirmed its long-term and short-term
foreign currency ratings of China at "A-" and "F1" respectively.
</P>
<P>
These ratings apply to all senior, unsecured sovereign debt
issues and set a ceiling for Fitch IBCA rated entities in China,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA comments that China's sovereign rating encompasses
an extraordinary mixture of external strengths and domestic
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
The former have enabled China to surmount the Asian financial
crisis with comparatively little collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
However, the regional crisis has also alerted China to the
dangers that lie ahead if it does not address the structural
weaknesses inherent in the country's state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
and banks.
</P>
<P>
The agency believes that hard-fought negotiations to join the
WTO indicate that China recognizes the dangers and is preparing to
tackle them sooner or later.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Stress Global Stability, Regional Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia vowed to make
joint efforts to strengthen global strategic stability and
regional security in a joint communique released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In the current situation, maintaining global strategic
stability is of special significance to keeping world peace," said
the communique, published after a meeting between acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) treaty reached in
1972 as the basis of strategic stability, the two countries highly
valued their joint efforts at the United Nations and other
international organizations to achieve comprehensive and strict
implementation of the convention.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed that the two nations share common viewpoints on
guaranteeing security and stability in their peripheral regions,
such as Asia-Pacific, Central Asia and South Asia, expressing
common desire to accelerate the cooperation by all means in the
framework of the "Shanghai Five."
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia support the active efforts by Asia-
Pacific international organizations and some Asian countries to
preserve regional security and create non-nuclear weapon zones,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It said the two countries will make full preparation for the
next regular meeting of the premiers in order to achieve more
practical results as both agreed that high-level exchanges have an
irreplaceable role in pushing forward bilateral strategic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
The strategic partnership between China and Russia, not
directed against any third country, conforms to the fundamental
interests of the two countries and also helps boost the progress
of a multi-polar world as well as the establishment of a just and
reasonable new world order, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that any attempt or practice to destroy the
territorial integrity of a sovereign state is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Praising China for its resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hongkong and Macao, Russia reiterated its stance
on Taiwan issue, which is expounded in all previously reached
bilateral documents. It said Russia supported China's efforts in
peaceful national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China expressed support for Russia's anti-terrorist
operations in Chechnya, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Tang ended his first official visit to Russia on Wednesday,
during which he met Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day trip, Tang also signed an agreement with
the Russian side on the exchange of visits by the two countries'
citizens and an accord on the exemption of visas for tourists from
both countries.

WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Texas Gov. George W. Bush decisively defeated Arizona Sen.
John McCain on Tuesday in Virginia's Republican presidential
primary with the strong support of women and a unified Christian
right, as well as a two million dollar electoral organization that
energized his conservative voter base across the state.
</P>
<P>
-- A German prosecutor announced Tuesday that he is seeking
murder charges against three teenagers after they reportedly
confessed to hurling large rocks from a highway overpass in a
dangerous game that killed two drivers and injured five passengers.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A six-year-old boy pulled a 0.32-caliber gun from his pants
and killed a six-year-old girl in front of their first grade
teacher and classmates in a school near Flint, Michigan, the
authorities said. The boy pointed the gun at one pupil before
turning and firing the only bullet, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will put in place on Wednesday one of the Muslim
world's most far-reaching overhauls of family law, enabling a
woman to divorce her husband, with or without his assent.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- SBC and BellSouth are in talks to merge their U.S. cellphone
properties in a bid to create a near-national wireless provider,
say people familiar with the discussions. A deal would position
the companies to compete with AT&AMP;T, Sprint and a Bell Atlantic-
Vodafone joint venture.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's military says it captured the Argun gorge south of
Grozny, last stronghold of Chechen rebel resistance, and can now
begin to withdraw most of its army from the shattered republic. If
true, the news virtually ensures Putin's election as president on
March 26.

<HEADLINE> Pantani Withdraws from Tour of Murcia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Tour de France champion
Marco Pantani has pulled out the Tour of Murcia because he is
suffering from lumbago, according to his team Mercatone Uno said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian rider, who won the 1998 Tour de France, pulled out
of last week's Tour of Valencia before the start of the third
stage on Thursday. The five-day Tour of Murcia started on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pantani had intended using the early season races in Spain to
get into shape for the big Tours later in the year, having had his
season curtailed last year.
</P>
<P>
He failed a blood test and was thrown out of the 1999 Giro d'
Italia while leading and was then involved in a car crash in
September.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of Pantani, the biggest name at the start of the
200-km first stage was Germany's Jan Ullrich, winner of the 1997
Tour de France and 1999 Tour of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Ullrich, notorious for his weight gains during the winter off-
season, said on Tuesday he was five kilograms over his desired
weight.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Cracks Down on Gambling at Video-Game Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing authorities today
destroyed 489 video game players and 521 integrated circuits which
were used for gambling, according to a local police official.
</P>
<P>
This action is part of a campaign to clean up local electronic
game centers, which began last October, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has now 761 electronic game centers. However, some of
these centers have used video games for gambling rather than only
for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
"This has caused a bad influence on youngsters, especially
primary and middle school students," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, local public security and cultural
bureaus jointly carried out a series of overhaul and crackdown
activities to ameliorate this situation.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city destroyed over 1,000 gambling-involved
games and integrated circuits, shut down 45 illegal game centers,

<HEADLINE> State Council Upgrades Eco-Tech Zones in Central, Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua)-- The State Council, the country's
highest governing body, has recently approved the upgrading of
seven economic and technological development zones in the central
and western areas of China to state-level ones, according to the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The seven development zones are located in the cities of Hefei,
Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Kunming, Changsha and Guiyang.
</P>
<P>
"The seven development zones have long been devoted to
attracting overseas capital, producing exports, and developing
industrial projects and high and new technologies, and have played
significant roles in leading and promoting regional economic
growth," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to elevate the seven development zones to state-
level is done with the view of helping improve the investment
environment of central and western China, accelerating the
development of cities in these regions, and readjusting the local
industrial structures.
</P>
<P>
This move will also prompt the economic growth of the entire
region, as well as help narrow the regional development gaps
within the country.

<P>
-- The Chinese government and people are ready to work
alongside the people in other Asia-Pacific countries and in the
rest of the world to promote the human rights cause as well as
peace and development in the Asia-Pacific and the world at large,
said Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen today at the opening session
of the Eighth Workshop on Regional Cooperation for the Promotion
and Protection of Human Rights in the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
As China is a developing country with a population of nearly 1.
3 billion, to realize the people's right to subsistence and
development represents a fervent desire of the Chinese people and
an objective of the Chinese government, Qian said.
</P>
<P>

and the legal system. "our goal is to run the country according to
law and turn China into a socialist country under the rule of law,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that countries have different national conditions,
therefore it is only natural that they have differences in their
approach to the promotion and protection of human rights. "These
differences should be handled properly through dialogue and
exchanges on the basis of equality."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Asia-Pacific countries should strengthen
common action to realize the economic, social and cultural rights
and the right to development.
</P>

on the occasion that the forum plays a significant role in
strengthening cooperation on human rights issue among the Asia-

<HEADLINE> China to Achieve Sustainable Development in 50 Years: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China has published today "The
Report on China's Strategy for Sustainable Development" which
predicts that the country can achieve its target of sustainable
development by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
The report is the brainchild of a group of scholars from the
China Academy of Sciences (CAS), headed by Niu Wenyuan, a
researcher with a CAS institute studying State policies on the
development of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to see zero population growth, a leveling of
the consumption of resources and energy, and the end to bio-
environmental degeneration by the years 2030, 2040, and 2050,
respectively, which are the strategic goals for the country's
sustainable development, according to the CAS report.
</P>
<P>
Having achieved both a low birth rate and low infant mortality,
China is entering into a stage of population control at a level
similar to developed nations, which is preparing the country for
zero population growth, the report says.
</P>
<P>
It predicts that China will achieve zero population growth by
2030, when the country's population is at 1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the United Nations, by 2050, China's
population is expected to decline to 1.517 billion, at which time
India will replace China as the most populous country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Only when the pressure of population is relaxed can a country
also achieve zero growth in its consumption of resources and
energy and, consequently, relieve the threat of a degenerating bio-
environment and head toward sustainable economic and social
development, said Niu, the group leader who attended today's
gathering at which the report was released.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, zero population growth is likely to
contribute 1.2 to 1.5 percentage points to GNP growth, and 6.6 to
7.0 points in the growth of employment, while decreasing the
consumption of resources and energy.
</P>
<P>
A zero growth in population could also accelerate the extension
of life expectancy, the report says, noting that by 2050, the
average Chinese will have 12 years of education.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that by 2040, China will achieve zero
growth in the consumption of resources and energy, namely a
balance between development and land utilization, a balance
between exploiting and fostering forestry resources, and a long-
term balance in the consumption of energy and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Any country that plans to achieve sustainable development will
have to go through these three stages, the reports.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 65 percent of the developed nations have reached the
goal of zero population growth, and the United States, Japan,
Australia, and several European nations are making efforts to
achieve zero growth in the consumption of materials and energy,
the report concludes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Delhi's Budget, A "Mixed Bag" By Xiong Changyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- India's first budget in the new
millennium presented Tuesday by Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
before the Parliament has proved to be a "mixed bag."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee described the new budget as
"responsible, reform-oriented and forward-looking leading to
enhanced economic stability."
</P>
<P>
He also announced the intent of his government to downsize its
bureaucratic apparatus to ensure reductions in the fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition parties across the board slammed the budget
as "anti-poor, anti-farmer and disastrous." Some of them charged
that it spelt "insolvency" and a "sell-out" of the country's
interest to multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Spearheading the scathing attack on the government, the
Congress said that the budget failed to meet the demands of even
the first generation of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Madharvrao Scindia, the Congress' deputy leader in the Lok
Sabha (lower house of parliament), said: "It is a doomsday kind of
the budget that takes ten steps backward."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, corporate and industrial leaders said the budget has
encouraged the agricultural sector and addressed some problems of
the social sector, but it has failed to enthuse corporates and the
capital market.
</P>
<P>
"It is a non-exciting but a growth-oriented budget," said Dr.
Kirit S. Parikh, director and vice-chancellor of Indira Gandhi
Institute of Development Research.
</P>
<P>
"Reduction of fiscal deficit to 5.1 percent of gross domestic
product is achievable in the next financial year compared to 5.6
percent in the current financial year by downsizing the government
expenditure and continuing the disinvestment process announced by
the Finance Minister," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the information technology (IT) industry, the budget
appears to be a "friendly" one. Gopal Srinnivasan, corporate
managing director of TVS Electronics Ltd, said that for the
overall IT industry, there are several positive moves that should
help increase and maintain the stock price as well as encourage
further investments in new IT firms.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he indicated that the erection of a single point
approval for venture capital funds, a clear rate of 20 percent tax
on venture capital fund payout, as well as increasing the ceiling
for foreign institutional investments in a company from 30 percent
to 40 percent, will bring in fresh investments from both home and
overseas for the IT industry.
</P>
<P>
Even the country's stock markets have received "carrot and
stick" from the budget. The stock markets across the country
reacted sharply to the budget proposals to double dividend tax
from 10 percent to 20 percent and to remove tax exemptions
available to exports earnings.
</P>
<P>
The market nose-dived Tuesday with the Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensex down 293.71 points or 5.10 percent from its previous close
of 5,740.69.
</P>
<P>
However, the benchmark 30-share Sensex on the Bombay Stock
Exchange Wednesday rose sharply by 195.14 points or 3.58 percent
following a sharp rally led by IT and bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the rally in IT scrips was enlivened by the
statement made Wednesday by Finance Minister Sinha that the tax
concessions currently enjoyed by Export Processing Zones and
technology parks would continue.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector was expected to benefit from the proposed
abolition of two percent interest tax as it will result in
reducing the burden on borrowers and help the industry improve the
credit offtake, they added.

<HEADLINE> 3 Filipinos Hurt in Philippine-U.S. War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Three Filipinos were injured in a
freak accident at the conclusion of the month-long Philippines-U.S.
war games in the northern Philippines, Foreign Affair Secretary
Domingo Siazon confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, also chairman of the Presidential Commission on the
Visiting Forces Agreement, said in a press statement that three
civilians were hurt in the incident involving a carabao the troops
used Tuesday to carry their equipment and supplies.
</P>
<P>
The incident came one day after a Philippine marine was killed
when he was run over by an armored assault vehicle used during
amphibious landing exercises at a beach at the Marine Base Ternate
in Cavite.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the marine soldier died on the spot when
he was run over by the V300 amphibious armored vehicle Monday at
the height of a landing exercise.
</P>
<P>
According to Siazon, Tuesday's incident took place when the
carabao pulling a cartload of equipment and supplies used in the
exercises suddenly went amuck.
</P>
<P>
"From all indications, it was an accident," Siazon said, adding
that the U.S. embassy has been informed about it.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 50 elderly women reportedly trooped to the U.S.
embassy here to protest the ongoing Philippine-U.S. joint military
exercises, which are scheduled to end this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Indian Exports Record Negative Growth in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- India's exports in January were
valued at 2.78 billion U.S. dollars, chalking up a negative growth
of 2.45 percent compared with the same period of last year, an
official release said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In January of 1999, the value of Indian exports was 2.85
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the official release said, due to the fine performance
of the export sector in earlier months, India's overall exports
for the first 10 months of the current financial year beginning
April, 1999, reached 30.22 billion U.S. dollars, up by 11.32
percent over the same period of the 1998-99 financial year.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, India's trade deficit for the first
10 months of the 1999-2000 financial year was marginally higher by
1.15 percent at 7.92 billion U.S. dollars compared to 7.83 billion
U.S. dollars during the corresponding period of the previous
financial year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in trade imbalance has mainly been caused by the sharp
increase in petroleum products prices in the international market,
said the release.
</P>
<P>
India's imports in January was estimated at 3.67 billion U.S.
dollars, up by 9.55 percent compared with 3.35 billion U.S.
dollars in the same period of last year, the release said.

bank stocks.

<HEADLINE> Manila Pursuing Talks with U.S. on Toxic Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
pursuing "high-level" talks with the United States for possible
cooperation in the cleanup of toxic wastes in former American
military bases in the country, the Presidential Palace said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon has discussed the matter with U.S. Assistant
Defense Secretary Franlin Kramer during a meeting in Manila last
month.
</P>
<P>
Barican's statement came in the wake of reports that toxic
waste contamination in two former U.S.-run military bases in Clark
Air Base in Pampanga and in Subic Naval Base in Zambales, has
resulted in children residing in nearby areas getting sick of
leukemia and ultimately dying of it.
</P>
<P>
The most recent victim, reports said, was a 6-year-old girl who
lived in a resettlement site in Mabalacat, Pampanga.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Barican said, Siazon also sent a letter
to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to follow up the
Philippines' appeal for U.S. government action on the toxic waste
issue.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these high-level contacts, Barican said, a
Philippine task force was established in January to address
hazardous wastes in former U.S. military installations.
</P>
<P>
The task force has also drawn up plans of action to ensure an
effective cleanup of the bases and address the immediate
environmental and health concerns in Subic and Clark, Barican
added.

<HEADLINE> Over One Fifth Married Women are Widows in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- More than one fifth of married
women in Sri Lanka are widows, a government minister said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Women's Affairs Hema Ratnayake told parliament that
the percentage of widows has risen to 23 percent in Sri Lanka,
mainly due to the ongoing civil war.
</P>
<P>
"The women in 18,000 families in the northeast and another 11,
000 in the armed forces have become widows as a result of the war,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year-old war between
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels who demand a separate
Tamil homeland in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Political assassinations and riots have also left behind many
widows in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
Minister Ratnayake said women have contributed greatly to
improving the productivity in the garment and plantation sectors
in addition to earning foreign exchanges through foreign
employment.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, women constitute more than 60
percent of the workforce in the garment and plantation sectors as
well as in foreign employment.
</P>
<P>
The government was implementing programs for the betterment of
the women population, Ratnayake added.

<HEADLINE> China Avoids the Leap Year Bugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully passed the
final echo of the Y2K problem -- the leap year transition --
without any major problems, according to the Y2K emergency office
here today.
</P>
<P>
"The smooth transition indicates that we have passed the final
barrier. Now, we can say we have defeated the Y2K bug," said Zhang
Qi, director in charge of Y2K at the Ministry of Information
Industry.
</P>
<P>
To insure a smooth transition, people at the emergency office
were on around-the-clock monitoring duty at their headquarters
beginning February 28, and the monitoring will continue through
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Years divisible by four are leap years, but this can confuse
computers which may read February 29 as March 1, or may not
transit correctly from February 29 to March 1.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous
regions, and most central government departments, have reported to
the emergency office that they have experienced a smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's financial center, departments of power and
water supply, telecommunications and civil aviation have
reportedly avoided the problem. Its Y2K emergency office will
gradually shift the focus on the prevention of computer virus.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributes this success to the joint efforts of the
central government and the various departments.
</P>
<P>
She noted that during the country's first test for a Y2K glitch,
computers in many sectors, including the banking system, began to
display some problems. "These problems would still be there if we
paid no attention to addressing them, but we invested our time and
money in it, and so we won," said Zhang.

<HEADLINE> China's Crop Area to Reach 156 Million Ha This Year: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's crop area is expected to
reach 156 million ha, 400,000 ha more than that in 1999, according
to the latest survey conducted by the National Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The area sown to grain, cotton, and sugar crops is being
reduced this year, while that under oil crops, hemp and jute,
tobacco plants, and vegetables will increase, according to the
survey which covered over 70,000 rural families in more than 9,000
villages.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the area under grain crops will be 112
million ha, down 1.2 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that China's grain structure will improve
since the country is ending price protection for spring wheat in
the northeastern region and inferior rice in the south.
</P>
<P>
According to predictions based on the survey, the area sown to
cotton and sugar crops will stand at 3.4 million ha and 1.28 ha,
respectively, down 10 percent and 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year, the area under oil crops will reach 14.9 million ha,
up 6.8 percent, those under peanut and rape are expect to increase
by 7 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively, and those under
sunflower and sesame will grow by 6.1 percent and 7.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Stresses Protection of Land Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to adhere to a
strictest land use law in the world and protect and rationally
develop the natural resources, said Chinese Vice-Premier Wen
Jiabao here today.
</P>
<P>
China will try to keep coordinated development between social
economy, natural resources and environment, Wen said during a
meeting with personages of non-Communist parties and those without
party affiliations who were invited by the Ministry of Land
Resources to investigate land use situation in Shandong and Hebei
provinces in north and east China last year.
</P>
<P>
The investigators offered their advices on the implementation
of laws on land use and mineral resources. They also suggested to
increase the utilization rate of resources through scientific and
technological development.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that many problems in land resources utilization and
protection should not be overlooked. The activities of illegal use
of arable land still exist in some areas.
</P>
<P>
China will strengthen implementation of laws and regulations,
and those violating land use plans will be punished according to
law, Wen emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The revised Land Use Law, considered as the strictest in the
world, went into effect in 1999. The law requires that all
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities must see to it
that the amount of arable land under their jurisdiction will not
decrease while land quality is improved.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Calls for Proper Study of Marxism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Hu Jintao said here
today that the country's leading officials should further carry
forward the good Marxist study style of combining theory with
practice.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the
remark while attending the opening ceremony of a new semester of
the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, of which he is also
the president.
</P>
<P>
Hu also noted that leading officials should enhance their
studies of Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
"At present, it is particularly important to combine the study
of Marxist theory with Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech on
the 'Three Emphases,'" Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The "Three Emphases" refers to strengthening theoretical study,
political awareness, and good conduct.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's speech is of great importance as a guide to building
the Party and realizing the country's cross-century development
goals, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader asked the Party School students to put more
emphasis on this speech, grasp its essence, and gain a correct
understanding of the law and features of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Hu also expressed the hope that the students will study the new
situation and new tasks facing the country, and enhance their
theoretical knowledge in order to do a better job for the country'
s reform, development, and stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi plane carrying 114
pilgrims left here on Wednesday morning for Mecca, Saudi Arabia to
perform Muslim's annual rituals of haj, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims were headed by Iraq's Minister of Religious
Endowment and Religious Affairs Abdel Mouna'm Ahmed Saleh, with
members of the Higher Pilgrimage Mission also on board, INA said.
</P>
<P>
The flight is aimed at meeting the humanitarian needs of the old
Iraqi pilgrims who can not travel by land, as there are no U.N.
Security Council resolutions preventing such a trip, said Iraq's
Minister of Transport and Communications Ahmad Murtadha Ahmad, who
saw the plane off.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that another two batches of pilgrims will fly to
Saudi Arabia on Thursday and Friday, bringing the total number of
pilgrims by air for this year to 428.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in a row since 1997 that Iraq flew
pilgrims to Saudi Arabia in violation of the air ban imposed on
Iraq by the U.N. Security Council since its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant United Nations resolutions, flights to or
from Iraq must get prior permission from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Talks With Syria to Resume by April: Israeli Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Syria have cleared the
obstacles blocking a resumption of peace talks and likely will
return to the negotiating table within a month, Jerusalem Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh as saying
Tuesday in Washington that it is his "gut feeling" that the
Israeli-Syrian negotiations will be resumed in one month.
</P>
<P>
Sneh added that there is a clear Israeli readiness for a "
significant withdrawal" from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East War
and returning the Heights to Syria is the central key issue for the
two sides to settle in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been stalled since January
after the two sides held two rounds of talks in the United States.
Syria blamed Israel for refusing to give a written pledge of
Israel's withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 line.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Avraham Shohat also said the renewal
of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks is imminent.
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me if I believe the talks will resume soon, I would
say that in my opinion, and this is my own assessment, there is
sufficient basis for the resumption of talks," Shohat told the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that a flurry of diplomatic activity and efforts
made by leaders of some other countries seemed to point to an end
to the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Both Jordan's King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who of late had been making negative remarks about the
impasse, Tuesday sent out messages of hope for rapid progress.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in Amman with Israeli Communication Minister
Binyamin Ben Eliezer, Abdullah said he expects to see progress
soon, adding that Prime Minister Ehud Barak's clarifications have
paved the way back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday cabinet meeting, Barak said that former prime
ministers, including Yitzhak Rabin, had promised to the United
States that Israel would withdraw from the entire Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's political advisor Osama El Baz came to Israel Tuesday
and met with Barak and a number of Israeli officials. "This visit
is part of the ongoing efforts on Egypt's part to try to give the
peace process a push forward," Baz said.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 1 (Xinhua) - New Zealand Prime Minister Helen
Clark arrived in Sydney Wednesday night, starting her first visit
to Australia as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Clark said she was here to talk to Australian Prime Minister
John Howard about relations between the two countries, Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Clark would have tough talks with Howard Thursday on military
and social security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Australia is structuring its defense force and likely to spend
more on its armed forces. Meanwhile, it is keen that New Zealand,
its traditional ally, would maintain present military spending
levels.
</P>
<P>
Clark said recently: "I am of the view myself that the security
of both of us is utterly dependent on the economic prosperity of
Southeast Asia. In the end, our security is not guaranteed by our
weapons."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the New Zealand prime minister is said to be
reluctant to bow to Australian demands to lift its share of the
welfare bill paid to the 400,000 New Zealanders living in
Australia. She reportedly said before her current visit that the
400,000 New Zealanders in Australia "are the highest-earning group
in Australia, even exceeding the incomes of those who are
Australian-born, and they also have the lowest level of
unemployment."
</P>
<P>
"So there is a net benefit to Australia," she added.

NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- India's Tourism Ministry will
adopt a series of new measures, including linking all tourism
sites via the Internet and setting up a National Tourism
Development Fund, to achieve a target of attracting 5 million
foreign tourists to India each year, Tourism Minister Ananth Kumar
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We would be approaching Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
tomorrow with a proposal to set up National Tourism Development
Fund (NTDF) for approval," said Kumar at an interactive session
with members of the Indian Association of Tour Operators.
</P>
<P>
The proposed NTDF would be donor-specific and have an upper
corpus limit of 450 million rupees (10.47 million U.S. dollars),
said Kumar, adding that the Indian central government would
contribute 50 million rupees (1.16 million U.S. dollars) to the
fund.
</P>
<P>
He said the money would mainly be used to fund various tourism
promotion projects across the country and that corporate donations
to the fund would be exempt from income tax.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Ministry also has an ambitious plan to set up "
electronic kiosks" at all tourist sites and destinations and link
them with e-mail and e-commerce for the convenience of foreign and
domestic tourists, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also proposed to set up a Teerth Sthal Vikas
Board, or Pilgrim Sites Development Board, to promote the
development of tourism in pilgrim spots across the country, he
said.

LAGOS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's southeastern State of Imo
imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on Tuesday following the bloody
reprisal attacks on Hausa communities in some of its cities.
</P>
<P>
At the Hausa quarters in Owerri and Aba cities, hundreds of
people had been reportedly killed and millions of naira (100 naira
= one U.S. dollar) worth of property destroyed, This Day newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The riots came after last week's religious clash over the
proposed implementation of the Islamic law Sharia in northern
State of Kaduna, which had left more than 300 people dead,
including Igbos from the southeastern state.
</P>
<P>
In a radio broadcast, Deputy Governor of Imo State Ebere Udeagu

the north began on Monday, charred bodies could still be seen on
all major streets, though normal life had generally returned to
the city on Tuesday.

Puna said that Malaquias was one of the most excellent rebel
military leaders that were able to do miracles at difficult times.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that General Malaquias, ex-chief of the
operation division of the Headquarters of the General Staff of the
Savimbi's troops, gave up himself to the Angolan Armed Forces
(FAA) a month ago and now he is integrated into the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Malaquias told the press Tuesday that the Savimbist troops have
suffered heavy casualties in the central highlands offensive
launched by the government troops last September, losing 80
percent of their conventional effectives.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, the civil conflicts are still rampant in
Angola's eastern and northern areas although the government troops
have gained advantages in most battle fields and pushed the
battle-front toward the areas formerly under the control of the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to the repentant general, most of the rebel soldiers
still loyal to Savimbi are guerrillas, who have been launching
road ambushes, guerrilla warfares and other destructive actions
against the government's targets.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated last year by the Angolan government that
Savimbi had some 60,000 effectives, including 40,000-strong
conventional troops and 20, 000 guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Rule On Afghan Hijack Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
is set to announce on Wednesday whether passengers from the
hijacked Afghan jet which landed at a London airport last month
will be given asylum in the United kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He will give his decision on the majority of the 79
applications for asylum in a written answer to a question in the
House of Commons, expected to be given at about 1530 GMT.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, shortly after the passengers asked for
asylum after being released from the hijacked plane, Straw, who
has taken personal charge of the cases, had expressed a wish to
see the passengers from the jet leave Britain "as soon as possible.
"
</P>
<P>
However, he is legally obliged to consider each case
individually, and lawyers for the asylum seekers are expected to
appeal against any deportation.
</P>
<P>
Straw can grant the asylum seekers full refugee status, give
them exceptional leave to remain or reject their applications
outright and order them out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The applicants are likely to argue that they face imprisonment,
or even death, if they are forced to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 1996, no
Afghan asylum seekers in Britain have been deported back.
</P>
<P>
Most applicants in that time have been given exceptional leave
to remain in Britain, a record which is likely to be used by
lawyers for the former passengers to argue to let them stay.
</P>
<P>
The 79 asylum seekers, including several families, were among
the hostages who landed at Stansted airport, north London, after
the Ariana Boeing 727 jet was diverted from an internal flight in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The other 73 passengers have returned to Afghanistan, while
fourteen people have been charged with hijacking the plane.

<HEADLINE> Japan Donates Over 50,000 Dollars to Tibetan Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will donate
more than 50,000 U.S. dollars to rebuild a clinic in Dengqen
County in the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony for this aid project was held Tuesday in
Lhasa, the regional capital, with two diplomats from the Japanese
embassy in China and Dengqen County officials participating.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, this project is one of some 300
Japanese aid programs in China, which are mainly for the support
of education and medical care in rural and impoverished areas of
the country. To date, Japan has donated a total of 7.83 million U.
S. dollars for the 300 programs.
</P>
<P>
The clinic in Tibet is Japan's third aid project there, the
officials added.
</P>
<P>
Located at a high altitude in northwestern Tibet, Dengqen
County has a harsh climate and poor medical facilities, and the
people there have a high rate of endemic and epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
The rebuilding of the Dengqen clinic is expected to improve
local health and medical conditions, the officials noted.

<HEADLINE> Vice Minister Says New Treasury Bonds Lucrative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Vice Minister of Finance Jin Liqun
said today that buying the government's new treasury bonds is a
good investment.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates for the new bonds have risen from last year,
and are about seven percent higher than those of bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
A favorable policy has also made returns from the bonds exempt
from interest duty, which makes it even more profitable, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
China will sell 50 billion yuan in treasury bonds beginning
today and ending on April 20 at major banks and postal savings
offices nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Of the 50 billion yuan in bonds, ten billion mature in two
years at an annual interest rate of 2.55 percent, 35 billion
mature in three years at an interest rate of 2.89 percent, and the
other five billion yuan mature in five years at an interest rate
of 3.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
These T-bonds are certificate bonds which can be used as
collateral for bank loans, thus increasing the liquidity of the
funds and helping promote consumer credit, according to Jin.

<HEADLINE> Film Star Arnold Schwarzenegger to Visit China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Renowned action movie star Arnold
Schwarzenegger will visit China this May, but not for the purpose
of film promotion.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a delegation from Special Olympics International
(SOI), the film icon will take part in a series of fund-raising
activities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to benefit millions
of mentally handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
"These people need to have an opportunity to participate in
social life through sports training and competitions, and the
Special Olympics movement provides that opportunity," Yan Mingfu,
chairman of Special Olympics China, told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger, as the SOI's goodwill ambassador, will
participate in activities including the Great Wall Torch Run, a
fund-raising dinner, a national body-building contest, and a film
festival featuring his box-office blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
Chinese audiences know him as the movie hero of "Terminator"
and "True Lies" much more than as an advocate of the Special
Olympics movement.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he is the son-in-law of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the
younger sister of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and her
husband Sargent Shriver, who initiated the Special Olympics in
1968.
</P>
<P>
With the aim of improving the cognitive abilities of persons
with mental handicaps, the SOI is the only organization authorized
by the International Olympics Committee to use the word "Olympics.
"
</P>
<P>
China has 11.82 million people with mental handicaps, or about
one-tenth of the world's total, and the country has participated
in four world summer games, and held the first Asia and Pacific
Special Olympics Games and two national games since joining the
SOI in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to increase the number of Special Olympics athletes
from 50,000 to half million in the next five years, while
establishing six to eight national and 30 provincial training
centers, as well as 5,000 community activity centers," Yan Mingfu
said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Wheeler, vice president of SOI external affairs,
described China as "fertile soil" on which to grow the movement in
this century.
</P>
<P>
"It is here that we find the largest number of athletes waiting
to discover our movement, and here that we have encountered the
strongest and most enthusiastic support of our goals and dreams,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The SOI now has 160 member countries and regions, and has
sponsored ten world summer games and five winter games.

Experts from the CAS suggested that the development of all
kinds of education in northwest China should be speeded up and the
reform in scientific and technological system be promoted. The
local governments should also improve the electronic and tele-
communication systems, and the public health service.
</P>
<P>
They said that people from ethnic minority groups should also
be encouraged to follow family planning policy, and more job
opportunities should be provided to lower the underemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
The northwest areas should take special attention to the
environment protection, and make readjustment to balance the use
of natural resources and the development of industry.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) held its 13th lecture on
legal systems today here in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
The lecture, which was delivered by Prof. Wang Huiyan of Jilin
University, mainly focused on the state power theory of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Li Peng of the NPC Standing Committee, who presided
over the lecture, noted that it was imperative for the country's
leading officials to study economics, law, history, and Marxist
politics in particular.
</P>
<P>
The state power theory forms an important part of Marxist
politics, and the people's congress system is the result of
combining the theory with the practices of China's revolution, Li
noted.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the country's deepening reforms and ongoing
modernization drive calls for the further improvement of the
people's congress system, which has to be guided by the Marxist
theory.
</P>
<P>
It has been a rule for the past two years that the NPC Standing
Committee holds a legal system lecture every two months.
</P>
<P>
Previous lectures touched upon the Marxist state power theory,
social security system, finance, international laws and
conventions as well as the legal issues involving China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army to Start Preparation for Withdrawal From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Defense Ministry
might start to issue tenders within a week for moving military and
civilian positions and building new ones in preparations for a
troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, a local daily said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tenders will be issued to dismantle most of the military
outposts built in the so-called security zone Israel carved out in
1985 in southern Lebanon with a self-claimed aim of protecting its
northern areas, The Jerusalem Post quoted defense sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Some of the outposts straddling the international border will be
moved and new ones will be built within Israeli land according to a
redeployment plan dubbed New Horizon, which Israeli Chief of Staff
Shaul Mofaz is studying and is expected to approve in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
A new electronic border fence is also supposed to be erected
along the international line.
</P>
<P>
Tenders will also be issued to build security infrastructure for
Israel's border settlements in the region as well as fences, guard
posts and new bypass roads.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has promised to pull Israeli
troops out of south Lebanon by July this year, with or without a
peace agreement with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Senior military officials estimate the total cost of the

Traders Association (TGJTA), told Xinhua that TGJTA has set an
export growth target of 10 percent for this year.

</P>
<P>
Sunee said that Bangkok is already among the top six gems and
jewelry centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held after the opening ceremony, Pichait
Palanugool, vice president of TGJTA, said that the association is
promoting electronic commerce by establishing two websites.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Tumbles Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar tumbled to
below 61 U.S. cents for the first time in 14 months Wednesday,
driven down by a surprisingly weak result for January retail trade.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was trading at 60.55 U.S. cents, from 61.
35 at the close of trade Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said the figures of retail trade pointed to
an increasing unlikelihood of any near-term rate hike. It will
mean that there would be a widening of the short-term (Australia-U.
S.) interest rate differential against the Australian dollar.
</P>

The Australian dollar closed at 0.6296 euro from 0.6338 at the

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Thailand Up 10.5 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourist arrivals in
Thailand during 1999 jumped to 8.58 million, an increase of 10.5
percent over a year earlier and well above the targeted 8.3
million, said a press release by the Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) available here Wednesday.

Meanwhile, travelers from the Americas, Europe, Middle East and
South Asia all increased by 5.39 percent, 14.6 percent, 6.07
percent and 8.35 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 8.58 million foreign tourists brought Thailand an estimated
310 billion baht (8.2 billion U.S. dollars) worth of foreign
exchange earning, which played a major role in helping the country
boost its hard currency reserves and return to economic growth,
according to TAT Governor Pradech Phayakvichien.
</P>
<P>
Pradech attributed the success of the tourism industry to
Thailand's economic and political stability, the good value for
money factor, good airline connections, relaxed visa policies,
surplus availability of hotel rooms and the "Amazing Thailand"
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by the success of the campaign, TAT has decided to
maintain the Amazing Thailand campaign in 2000, but with a new
slogan of "Enchantment for the Next Thousand Years."
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that the overall share of East Asian market
climbed back to normal level of 60 percent of the total tourist
arrivals in Thailand. Asia's growth was led by countries such as
Indonesia, China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"Asia-Pacific economies remain on the path to economic recovery,
we can look forward to repeating the performance this year and in
the future," Pradech said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Punish Businessmen Aiding UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
will soon announce an initiative to identify and prosecute South
Africans who are aiding Angola's rebel movement, the Business Day
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The matter that some South Africans were doing business with
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in
defiance of the United Nations sanctions is "putting our country
in a very difficult situation", Deputy Defence Minister Nozizwe
Madlala-Routledge told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
She said the inter-ministerial committee on security was close
to finalize the details of punishment for those who still keep
business links with UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The latest development comes in the wake of a request to South
Africa last month from Britain's Foreign Minister for Africa Peter
Hain to act against South Africans aiding UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Hain has identified eight South Africans who were involved in
the illegal business of diamonds with UNITA.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. figures, UNITA has earned an estimated
three to four billion U.S. dollars from exporting diamonds since
1992.
</P>
<P>
However, De Beers, the biggest diamonds manufacturer in the
world, said all its raw diamonds are to carry a guarantee
demonstrating that they are not so-called "blood diamonds" used to
fund rebels fighting in Africa.

<HEADLINE> China Urges International Cooperation on Human Rights Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and people
are ready to work alongside the people in other Asia-Pacific
countries and in the rest of the world to promote the human rights
cause as well as peace and development in the Asia-Pacific and the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen made the remarks here today at
the opening session of the Eighth Workshop on Regional Cooperation
for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in the Asia-
Pacific Region, which runs through Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the Chinese nation has always held man's dignity
and value in respect and the immense energy China today radiates
is a vivid reflection of the broad scope in which the Chinese
people give free and democratic play to their creativity.
</P>
<P>
As China is a developing country with a population of nearly 1.
3 billion, to realize the people's right to subsistence and
development represents a fervent desire of the Chinese people and
an objective of the Chinese government, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has been working hard to build up democracy
and the legal system. "our goal is to run the country according to
law and build China into a socialist country under the rule of law,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted the fact that the Asia-Pacific countries boast a
time-honored history and cultural traditions that have many
positive elements on respect for human rights, and that although
the positions and views of these countries on the question of
human rights are not exactly the same, what they share obviously
outweigh their differences.
</P>
<P>
"As close neighbors, we know better than others the history and
cultural traditions of the people and the realities of the
countries in the region," he said, adding that the Asia-Pacific
countries have every reason to step up their cooperation on human
rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
Given the fact that in the 20th century, economic crises have
occurred in other regions and that the causes for the financial
crisis are extremely complex, it is obviously unfair to lay the
blame on cultures or values alone for the crisis, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"As the Asian economy is now already on the way to recovery, we
are convinced that the people in Asia, with their pioneering
spirit, will be able to overcome many difficulties lying ahead and
march forward courageously," he said, adding that they have every
reason to keep up their fine cultures and values and promote the
all-round development of human rights while attaining economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that countries have different national conditions,
therefore it is only natural that they have differences in their
approach to the promotion and protection of human rights. "These
differences should be handled properly through dialogue and
exchanges on the basis of equality."
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the Asia-Pacific countries had in modern
times the agonizing experience of being bullied by imperialist
powers and hence cherish all the more their sovereignty and
national dignity, the Chinese vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Asia-Pacific countries have recently stood out as
a major international advocate for dialogue and exchanges, and the
workshop is a concrete demonstration of such a spirit of
cooperation based on equality.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Asia-Pacific countries should strengthen
common action to realize the economic, social and cultural rights
and the right to development.
</P>
<P>
He said that democracy and the rule of law are no country's
monopoly and they do not come under a unified model in the world.
To learn from other countries' experience is not to copy it
mechanically, and only when appropriate measures suited to the
local conditions are adopted in light of a country's specific
characteristics and the needs of the people, can democracy be
effectively broadened and improved and the rule of law be promoted
and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"Universality does not mean blind identity. Every measure that
serves to promote and protect human rights effectively and every
institution or plan that proves to be truly operative should be
encouraged and endorsed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson said
on the occasion that the forum plays a significant role in
strengthening cooperation on human rights issue among the Asia-
Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 40 countries attended the forum.

<HEADLINE> Macao Newspaper Retorts U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese newspaper Macao Daily
News carried an editorial on Wednesday to lash out at the U.S.
State Department human rights report of the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Once again, the human rights report unveiled the real features
of hegemonism, power politics of the United States and its
intervention with the internal affairs of others, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
The part of the report concerning China entirely confused right
and wrong by means of vilification and falsification, the
editorial said. Those who respect facts should acknowledge that
the year 1999 witnessed more economic, scientific and cultural
achievements in China and the living standard of the Chinese
people has improved to a great extent, it said.
</P>
<P>
While ignoring the facts of China's achievements in human
rights, the U.S. report indulged in talking about Falun Gong, the
article said. It is well-known that Falun Gong was not religious
but was an evil organization which severely harmed the interests
of the masses.
</P>
<P>
Democracy is the outcome of human civilization and shows itself
in different modes in different countries, the editorial said.
Democracy and freedom must not go against the rule of law and
disdain the authority of laws, it said.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the United States wants other countries to
implement the U.S.-style political system, but on the other hand,
it asks that other countries tolerate the illegal activities which
are intolerable in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The editorial noted that there remain many human rights
problems in the United States. The so-called guardians of human
rights in the United States should first deal with their own
problems rather that blaming others.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Internet company tom.com closed

78 HK dollars, at its debut on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM),
Hong Kong's equivalent of U.S. NASDAQ market, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The shares, with a subscription rate of 669, opened the trading

<P>
The initial public offering (IPO) of tom.com, a company
controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's firms, fanned Hong
Kong investors' enthusiasm to high-tech-related stocks but the
chaos in the course of issuing triggered criticism against the
sponsors and worries that Hong Kong's reputation as an
international financial center might be hurt.
</P>
<P>
K. S. Lo, chairman of the GEM Listing Committee said Wednesday
that the overwhelming response of Hong Kong people to the IPO of
tom.com reflected that Hong Kong market is an active and vibrant
market despite some negative influence.
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized that investors must sign a risk
knowledge document before buying into any stocks listed at the GEM,
a buyers-beware market for informed investors.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Changes May Cause Public Unease: Yilmaz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A ruling coalition partner leader
has warned unease among the public over a constitutional change
that will allow longer presidential terms, salary rise of lawmakers
and more difficult closure of political parties.
</P>
<P>
Mesut Yilmaz, chairman of the Motherland Party, has said that
his party would endorse the bill, but warned that to include the
three drafts in one bill, the public would think a bargaining was
going on, local press reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has proposed a
constitutional amendment to cut the presidential term in office
from the current seven years to five years, but allow presidents a
second term.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional amendment requires at least 367 votes in
Turkey's 550-seat parliament. Two appendant provisions to raise
deputies' salary and ease control over political parties are also
include in the constitutional change in an apparent attempt to
secure enough votes in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said the Motherland Party would give priority to
stability when they decide on the re-election of presidents.
</P>
<P>
"The most important issue is the protection of stability. It is
politicians' responsibility not to let the election of the
president destabilize the country. What is important is the harmony
within the coalition and the continuation of the political
stability of the country," said Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz reiterated his worries that the public would misinterpret
the handling of three drafts in one bill, underlining that the only
thing that leaders could do was to convince or advice the deputies
to approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
Deputy chairman of the main opposition True Path Party, Ufuk
Soylemez, said his party did not think to include the three drafts
in one package appropriate, terming the move not to be "smart
acts."
</P>
<P>
The parliament will convene to debate the bill this week.

<HEADLINE> Iran Successfully Test-fires Improved Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian armed forces on
Wednesday successfully test-fired an improved "Standard" missile,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The surface-to-air missile, developed partly by Iranian Navy's
experts, was test-fired during the ongoing "Vahdat (Unity) 78"
military exercises, spokesman of the exercises Abdollah Manavi
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not disclose the range of the missile and what
countries cooperated with Iran in building the missile.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the improvement of the missile took
nearly four years and some parts of the missile were built by
Iranian experts, saving millions of U.S. dollars for the country.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day military exercises were kicked off on Thursday
jointly by the Iranian Army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvres aim to examine application of modern weapons and
equipments in the Navy's hardware, including air-to-surface
missiles, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 vessels, 120 gunboats, 30 choppers, 15 warplanes and
four brigades of naval troops are taking part in the games in an
area of 64,000 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Flies Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday started to fly
Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the annual haj to the holy city
of Mecca, in defiance of a Western allies-imposed no-fly zone in
its south.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, an Iraqi Airways plane took off from a
military air base near the capital of Baghdad with over 110 elderly
pilgrims on board as well as Iraq's Minister of Religious
Endowments and Religious Affairs, Abdel Mouna'm Ahmed Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Airways officials said a further three or four aircraft
will take more Iraqis to Mecca in the next few days for the haj,
which begins on March 14.
</P>
<P>
The United States-led Western allies imposed two no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf war claimedly to
protect the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's persecution. No Iraqi planes, whether military or
civilian, are allowed to fly in the two zones.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Iraq sent three planeloads of pilgrims to Mecca for
haj in defiance of the southern no-fly zone, which covers about one
third of the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has exempted air travel to
Islam's most sacred sites in Mecca from the sweeping sanctions
imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, most Iraqis, reeling under sanctions, cannot afford the
flight to Mecca due to stringent Security Council restrictions on
how Iraq is allowed to use the money it gets from selling oil under
a U.N. humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council members disclosed on Tuesday that they are
close to agreeing on a plan to get funds to enable 22,000 Iraqis to
make the pilgrimage to Mecca. However, the plan has yet to win the
approval of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal, Iraqi pilgrims will each be given 250 U.
S. dollars in cash and 1,750 dollars in travellers cheques by the
U.N. from Baghdad's oil revenue account without being transferred
through Iraq's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell
limited amount of oil in every six months to buy, under Security
Council supervision, humanitarian goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. receives the oil revenues from the program and uses
them to pay for the Iraqi purchases, with Baghdad getting no cash
directly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a first batch of 1,000 pilgrims have left for Saudi
Arabia by road. Reports from Riyadh said 240 of them have already
arrived in Saudi Arabia late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq plans to send a total of 7,000 pilgrims to Mecca this year,
3,000 more than last year but far fewer than the 22,000 quotas it
is allowed by the Organization of Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Geological Conditions Vital to Post-Quake Reconstruction: Turkish President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said geological conditions must be taken into consideration when
rebuilding quake-stricken regions and the height of multi-storey
buildings in quake-prone areas will be restricted.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks during a meeting with a Turkish
association in charge of reconstruction of quake-hit regions, the
Anatolia News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Demirel pointed out, however, the most important issue is to
choose right places to construct new buildings to replace the
damaged ones.
</P>
<P>
Turkey suffered two devastating earthquakes in its northwestern
provinces in August and November, which claimed nearly 20,000 lives
and left hundreds of thousands homeless.
</P>

The association members complained about the delay in the
demolishing of damaged buildings, adding they plan to keep in the
reconstruction the old texture of the cities destroyed in the two
massive earthquakes last year.

Chimutengwende made the appeal on Tuesday after a report said that
the former freedom fighters had invaded at least 12 white owned
farms throughout the country since last week.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government plans to get a total of five million
hectares of land to resettle about 150,000 black families in the
next five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only solution is to transfer some of the land from the
white commercial farmers to the landless black majority," he told
the newspaper in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It must be borne in mind that the black people of
this country waged a liberation war principally for a right to
productive land forcibly seized from their forefathers."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the War Veterans' Association Chenjerai Hunzvi said
Tuesday that the war veterans would continue with the "orderly
invasion" of white- owned commercial farms until land is in the
hands of the majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Commercial Farmers' Union David Hasluck said:
"The situation is extremely difficult to contain. We are waiting
for the government to restore order, otherwise there will be chaos
and anarchy."
</P>
<P>
He said the invasions were hindering farming operations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We have, however, advised the farmers to remain calm and not
to confront the war veterans," he added.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Launches New Longer-Range 777s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 29 (Xinhua)-- Boeing Co. Tuesday
announced the launch of new longer-range versions of its popular
777 wide-body jet, saying they will be the world's longest-range
commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in a joint news conference by Boeing
Chairman and CEO Phil Condit, and General Electric Chairman and
CEO Jack Welch. Boeing board of directors Monday authorized full
production of the newest members of the 777 airplane family.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a news release from the world's largest aircraft
maker said the new 777 planes will use larger wings with more fuel
capacity and an additional fuel tank to extend the range an
additional 192 to 241 kilometers over existing models of the plane,
without any significant reduction in passenger capacity.
</P>
<P>
The new versions of the 777-200 and 777-300 announced Tuesday
will have a range of 16250.9 kilometers, enough to fly nonstop
from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia to New York, according to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has been facing tough competition for new orders from
Airbus company, the European consortium that has offered
comparable long-range aircraft, the A340, A500 and A600.
</P>
<P>
The first A340, A500 and A600 are due to be delivered in 2002,
while the new longer-range 777s are due for delivery in September
2003.
</P>
<P>
The new 777s will address much of the market demand for
airlines to offer more point-to-point services, opening up new
routes, Boeing said, adding this phenomenon, called fragmentation,
is increasing rapidly, especially over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokeswoman Barbara Murphy said prices for the new
jetliners haven't been established but would be more than the
current 777 models. The 777-200 is priced at 150 million U.S.
dollars to 170.5 million dollars and the 777-300 is 157.5 million
dollars to 192.5 million dollars.

Tuesday as Bank of England monetary policy committee members
suggested interest rates might be left unchanged in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Unemployed people are to be offered the use of free mobile

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy on Cyprus Starts "Familiarization" Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's Special
Adviser on Cyprus Alvaro de Soto Wednesday said that at present the
U.N. does not intend to change the current format of the proximity
talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian diplomat arrived in Cyprus early Wednesday morning
for a one-week "familiarization" visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on arrival at Larnaca airport, southern Cyprus, De Soto
said he was here to get a "general overview" of the situation on
the ground and not to continue in any way the U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
De Soto said "the purpose of my trip here is primarily and
essentially to familiarize myself with the island."
</P>
<P>
He said he would however touch upon some of the substance of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-sponsored proximity talks took place in New York on
December 3-14 last year and in Geneva from January 31 to February
8, in an effort to promote progress towards direct talks aimed at a
solution of the Cyprus issue. They are due to resume in New York on
May 23.
</P>
<P>
De Soto attended the previous two proximity talks with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second round of talks, De Soto said the two
sides outlined in detail their respective positions on the four
core issues under discussion. They are territory, constitution,
distribution of power and refugees.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Cyprus, de Soto will travel on to Ankara and
Athens for talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and Greek
Foreign Minister George Papandreou.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and Syria apparently have cleared a major obstacle
(concerning full Israeli withdrawal from Syria) blocking a
resumption of peace talks and likely will return to the table
within a month, Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said
in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But he backed away from a hint made by Prime Minister Ehud Barak
this week that Israel will be willing to withdraw to the June 4,
1967 line in accordance with the Syrian demand, saying Israel has
made no such promise and will not do so in writing.
</P>
<P>
He maintained Israel Defense Force will pull out of southern
Lebanon by July as promised, with or without an agreement, saying
this decision was reached by the majority of ministers, even though
there was no formal vote in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A senior figure in Barak's One Israel coalition said Tuesday
night that if the bill sponsored by the opposition Likud faction on
the Syrian referendum passes its preliminary reading Wednesday in
the Knesset (Parliament), it will effectively mark the end of the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the coalition, eight months after its
establishment, is strikingly similar to the state of the coalition
headed by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the eve of
that government's fall.
</P>
<P>
Three ruling coalition partners, Shas, the National Religious
Party and Yisrael Ba'aliya, have threatened to vote for Likud's
bill, which has been perceived as an effort to neutralize the
Israeli Arabs' vote.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy responded on Tuesday to
Joerg Haider's resignation as head of Austria's extreme right-wing
Freedom Party by saying he does not intend to order the return of
Israel's ambassador to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Haider remains the moving force of a party that
conveys his extremist spirit and messages. He believes Haider's
resignation on Monday might very well have been an expedient
tactical move only.
</P>
<P>
Israel recalled its ambassador from Vienna when Haider's Freedom
Party joined Austria's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly 39 years after it was written, the 1,200-page
manuscript of memoirs and notes penned by Adolf Eichmann while in
prison was released to the public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eichmann, who was responsible for the deportation of the Jews
from Germany and Austria and later put in charge of the Final
Solution, was kidnapped from Argentina and put on trial for war
crimes in Israel. He was found guilty and executed in May 1962.
During his trial, Eichmann received permission to write his
memoirs.
</P>
<P>
While historians previously, and again Tuesday, dismissed the
memoir as little more than a self-serving document, it might
perhaps serve a purpose this week as evidence in a libel trial
taking place in London.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Invites Thai Muslims to Attend Hajj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Don Pramudwinai was quoted as saying
on Wednesday that the 250 Thai Muslims would be guests of the
Saudi Arabian government, which had also offered to be responsible
for all expenses concerning the sacred activity for the Thais.
</P>
<P>
"The move represents an unprecedented good will and friendly
gesture of the Saudi Arabian royal family towards Thai Muslims
after Thai-Saudi relations have been stalled over the past 20
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan would lead the group of
Thai Muslims for the Hajj in Mecca between March 15 and 19, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Minister was also invited to be a speaker of
a forum, entitled " Ties and Cooperation Between Thailand and
Saudi Arabia," to be held in Mecca on March 11, said Don.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 Thai Muslims are expected to fly to Mecca to
attend the Hajj this year, as the Ministry of Public Health will
send a 15-member medical team to take care of them.

HANOI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation(
PetroVietnam) pumped 2.7 million tons of crude oil in the first
two months of this year, a year-on-year increase of 200,000 tons,

damage of an oil station in early February.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Attracts Record Investment in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's foreign direct
investment(FDI) has increased for the fourth year and reached its
highest ever level on record in 1999, Board of Investment (BOI)
Chairman Thilan Wijesinghe said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Launching the BOI's annual report titled "Performance Review -
1999 and Future Plans," Wijesinghe said that the inflow rose to
231 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 54 percent over the
preceding year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka attracted 150 million dollars of FDI in 1998, a 16
percent rise over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wijesinghe attributed the record investment inflow to several
large-scale projects which commenced operations in 1999 and some
projects which were in operation before 1999 but infused
additional foreign capital last year.
</P>
<P>
He said the top 10 projects have brought in more than 70
percent of the total investment. These projects include South Asia
Gateway Terminal, Lanka Bell, Sell Terminal Lanka, Colombo Power
and Lanka Cellular Services.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, there were 149 new foreign-owned industrial ventures,
joint ventures and local enterprises commencing construction or in
the implementation process in the country.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises, with total anticipated investment of 53.97
billion rupees (740 million dollars), are expected to generate
employment for more than 41,000 persons.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi has lashed out at the U.S.
annual human rights report, describing it as very ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Monitor daily, the minister said that
the human rights report which ranked Uganda among the top six
African countries where human rights were abused in 1999 was
unfair to Uganda, the newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not think that human rights were so grossly
abused in Uganda as the annual report claimed, adding that the
government would study the report and make appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
The report, released on February 25, claimed that human rights
abuse was widely found among Uganda's security agencies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. human rights report covers most countries and has
sparked criticism around the world.

<P>
XINING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Salar ethnic group in northwest
China's Qinghai Province have expressed confidence in shaking off
poverty with the launching of the central government's strategy to
accelerating economic development in western China.
</P>
<P>
The strategy offers an unprecedented historical opportunity for
underdeveloped ethnic people inhabited areas in western China,
said Han Shangwen, head of Salar Autonomous County of Xunhua in
Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
"We should grasp the opportunity and see where we lag behind",
said Han before leaving for Beijing to attend the Third Plenary
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress, which is
scheduled to open on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Han's county has turned into an animal husbandry product
processing center, and nearly 60 percent of the county's revenue
came from 1,200 self-employed or private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The most important task is to improve ecological environment in
the region, develop tourist resources, readjust agricultural
structure and increase farmers' income, Han said.

<P>
JINAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Environment-protection department in
east China's Shandong Province recently issued a regulation on the
protection of local wetland which covers 16,000 sq km in total.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, the province will give priority
to regular survey and inspection of the wetland, along with the
introduction of a series of administrative measures and laws.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's wetland is a pleasant habitat for four species of
beasts, 153 varieties of birds, eight species of amphibious
animals, and 19 types of reptiles, and 340 kinds of fish,
including some endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that the rich wetland resources is of vital
importance to the sustained economic development of the province
because it will help storing floodwater, fighting drought,
controlling soil erosion, keeping biological varieties, and
developing tourism.
</P>
<P>
However, the province's wetland is now facing serious threat
resulting from insufficient water resources, water pollution, and
excessive animal hunting and tree felling.

been back on their job following Turkish Interior Ministry restored
them to their positions on Tuesday.
</P>

and make efforts to solve Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Armenia
and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq and Syria have decided to resume their diplomatic ties,

<HEADLINE> Overseas Filipinos Encouraged to Visit Homeland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Tourism Secretary Gemma
Cruz-Araneta launched Wednesday the Balikbayani program to
encourage Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) to help promote the
country's tourism in various overseas tourist markets.
</P>
<P>
The term balikbayani was coined from the original name of
balikbayan and bayani which means hero.
</P>
<P>
The OFWs have been dubbed as the country's unsung heroes
because their dollar remittances have substantially improved the
Philippine international dollar reserves.
</P>
<P>
Araneta said the 6.97 million Filipinos residing abroad
represent a formidable marketing network capable of generating
incremental visitor traffic to the country.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, statistics based on the arrival and
departure cards show that only 200,000 Philippine passport-holders
living abroad visited their homeland last year.
</P>
<P>
Araneta noted that the Balikbayani program revolves around the
concept of motivating Filipinos abroad to promote tourism to the
Philippines among co-workers, friends ad relatives and at the same
time earn big-ticket prizes.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Filipinos or those of Filipino lineage, at
least 16 years of age residing or working abroad are eligible to
join or enroll in the Balikbayani program.
</P>
<P>
Every tourist that a Balikbayani helps bring to the Philippine
earns a corresponding number of points which will entitle the
Balikbayani to big prizes like free international and domestic
round-trip plane tickets.
</P>
<P>
Under the program's community enhancement component, the
Balikbayani's town that garners the biggest number of Balikbayanis
can win up to 500,000 pesos (12,500 U.S. dollars) worth of
community enhancement projects.

<HEADLINE> First Shopping Festival Opens in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The first Zanzibar Shopping
Festival begins on Wednesday in a bid to boost sales turnover of
local businesses and promote its transit trade with neighboring
countries, the Guardian newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The 13-day event will attract shoppers and business communities
from both Zanzibar, Tanzanian Mainland, and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the festival is to promote registered traders and
encourage the establishment of more consumer-related businesses in
Tanzania, Chairman of the organizing committee Josepha Meza was
quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal is to attract more shopping visitors to
Zanzibar, thus promoting its reputation both as a shopping
paradise and an ideal tourist destination, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the festival will be conducive to
increasing the sales turnover of the local business community and
subsequently helping the government raise its income through
duties.
</P>
<P>
Among the lucrative incentives offered to participants are that
no business license is required and no local government taxes need
to be paid.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, comprising the twin islands of Unguja and Pemba off
the eastern coast of the Tanzanian mainland, as well as a number
of smaller islands, is famous for its pristine beaches, historic
sites and cloves.
</P>
<P>
The government of Zanzibar has been trying hard to promote the
development of international trade with the isles' ideal position
so as to break away from economic backwardness and eject poverty.

<HEADLINE> Botswana, Zambia Agree To Supply Fuel To Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Botswana and Zambia have agreed to
supply bulk fuel to Zimbabwe on a temporary basis to help
alleviate its current shortage, The Herald reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe Christian
Katsande Tuesday told the newspaper: "The two countries have
agreed to help Zimbabwe meet part of its fuel requirements while
current problems with the bulk shipment of products are being
resolved."
</P>
<P>
He said a block train with fuel from Zambia is already in the
country while another from Botswana is expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
"Each time our neighbors experience problems with the supply of
fuel products, they contact us, and it is in the same spirit they
are assisting us now," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This arrangement has been cleared at the highest levels
through the foreign affairs ministries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said more block trains are being dispatched from South
Africa each day to bring fuel to the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Serious shortages of petrol, diesel and paraffin reached a
climax last week, causing the reappearance of queues at the petrol
stations across the country.

<HEADLINE> Less Children Born to Kenyan Women Last Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The average number of children
born to each Kenyan woman declined from seven in 1989 to about
five in 1999, provisional results of the 1999 census show.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Wednesday quoted Minister
for Planning Gideon Ndambuki as saying that the population did not
grow as fast as initially predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan population stood at 28.679 million compared to the
projected figure of 30 million, Ndambuki said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ndambuki attributed the result to a rising child mortality rate
and family planning methods.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said that the HIV/AIDS claimed one million
lives in the east African country in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the 1999 census will be ready by July
2000. Kenya is one of the few sub-Saharan countries which conduct
a census every 10 years.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Shows 800 Million Dollars Monthly Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea posted a trade surplus
of 800 million U.S. dollars last month, said the South Korean
Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports soared 37.3 percent year-on-year to 12.82
billion dollars and imports surged 57.5 percent to 12.02 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, which originally forecast a trade deficit for
February, said exports surged during the last five days of the
month, turning around the trade balance.
</P>
<P>
Particularly on Tuesday, exports reached 1.37 billion dollars
while imports totaled 460 million dollars. The 900 million dollar
surplus on the final day of February helped to turn around the
trade balance for the entire month.
</P>
<P>
Last month's export value was the largest-ever figure for
February, with outbound shipment of mainstay exporting items such
as computers, semiconductor, automobiles, steel and petrochemical
surging by more than 50 percent over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The country registered a trade surplus of 410 million dollars
for the first two months of this year, despite a deficit of 390
million dollars in January, with exports amounting to 25.01
billion dollars and imports to 24.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month's imports were also the largest for February,
averaging 543.9 million dollars a day, up 41.1 percent from 385.6
million dollars in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, which attributed the increase in imports to sharp
rise in oil prices, predicted a further rise in trade surplus next
month due to brisk exports.

attacks on an ongoing basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian newspaper, Australian Special
Forces troops have been trained to counter possible terrorist
threats including chemical and biological warfare, radiological
attacks and cruise liner hijacking.
</P>
<P>
The details were revealed by Brigadier Philip McNamara,
commander of the Special Forces, during a speech to military
leaders in Canberra on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A warning to anybody who wants to interfere with the Olympic
Games: we will interfere with them," McNamara told a Royal United
Service Institute lunch.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to meet any challenge," he said.
</P>
<P>
McNamara said soldiers would be on 24-hour readiness at the NSW
's Holsworthy barracks, Garden Island navy base and Royal
Australian Air Force Richmond from mid-August until after the
Paralympics at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
His comments were the most comprehensive outline yet of the
complex security operation that will attempt to secure the games
from terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Units comprising soldiers from the Special Air Service, the 4th
Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment and the reserve 1st
Commando Company will be on call to deal with any emergencies that
arise.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Olympic Security Command Center had already
identified 65 sites in Sydney that could be targeted by terrorists,
with another 50 likely to be added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report that volunteers would undertake security
duties during the Games was dismissed by Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games President Michael Knight.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Knight said all security staff would be paid
professionals.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Warned of Floe Flood in Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Yellow River, the second longest
river in China, is facing serious possibility of floes flood in
the middle reaches as the warm spring approaches.
</P>
<P>
The middle part of the 5,464-kilometer-long river has received
much more water from the upper reaches this winter when the river
was becoming frozen in the surface. And it saw much thicker ice
than ordinary years since the passing winter has been the coldest
over the past one to two decades.
</P>
<P>
If the upcoming spring is warm enough, the frozen river will
thaw quickly and ahead of normal schedule. The water reserved in
the middle reaches would possibly break the ice surface into floes
with its accumulated energy.
</P>
<P>
"The reserved water in the channel would lead to ice-jam flood
in this case," according to the Flood Control Headquarters of the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China.
</P>
<P>
According to survey by local water and soil conservation
departments, the maximum dammed water in one section of the river
has reached a record 1.71 billion cubic meters compared with one
billion cubic meters in ordinary years. In some sections of the
Yellow River within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, trucks
still run on the frozen Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government has formed various teams to
keep close watch on the river and to deal with emergent ice flood
with explosion when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The ice-jam flood is a special disaster occurred along the
Yellow River in spring when different temperatures cause thaw at
different time. The floes jamming the channel could have damage on
river banks or even cause flowage.

KUNMING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Preparations are being made for
the application of more Chinese scenic spots to be registered in
the World Heritage list, a senior official with the Yunnan
Provincial construction department has said.
</P>
<P>
The scenic spots include, among others, the renowned Stone
Forest and Sand Forest in Yunnan Province in southwest China, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Stone Forest, 120 km southeast of the provincial capital of
Kunming, is one of the top wonders in the world with its unique
typical karst formations, and typical ethnic customs and
traditions. It was visited by nearly 3 million tourists, both
Chinese and foreign, last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sand forest, about 140 km from Kunming, covers
an area of six sq km, with a kaleidoscope of vivid colors. It
became known to the outside world in the late 1980s, and more than
one million visitors have since flocked to the site.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, China's scenic spots of Wulingyuan in central
China's Hubei Province, and Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong in southwest
China's Sichuan Province have been placed on the World Heritage

<HEADLINE> Network to Enhance Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities nationwide
are developing a series of long-distance education networks to
ensure Chinese people receive learning opportunities throughout
their lives.
</P>
<P>
An official of the People's University of China (PUC), said at
a consultation conference on adult education enrollment held
recently in Beijing that computerized long-distance teaching
networks is an advanced teaching method for adult education and
post-graduate training.
</P>
<P>
Through the networks, learners can handle all school affairs
such as application, consultation, enrollment, tuition and
teaching materials, the official said, adding that the networks
also offer the learners opportunities to select their favorite
specialties and complete studying programs at home.
</P>
<P>
The PUC established its long-distance education network two
years ago. So far, it has offered a number of such specialties and
professional training programs in the fields of accounting,
marketing, commercial administration, economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, a dozen of famous universities across the country
including Qinghua University, Zhejiang University and Hunan
University have opened long-distance network education programs
for millions of people in urban and rural areas, he said. In the
coming years, more and more colleges and universities will be
linked into the networks.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Consumption Boosts Economic Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to use various leverages
together to accelerate economic growth, including fiscal, monetary,
pricing, taxation and income re-distribution policies.
</P>
<P>
Now the policies of stimulating consumption demand have seen
effects. Retail sales in the country jumped 6.8 percent over the
previous year to above three trillion yuan last year. In the first
month of this year, the decrease of price level has slowed down
markedly. The sales rate of industrial products rose steadily and
exceeded the growth rate of production.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS figures, 60 percent of Chinese consumers
believe that China's GDP growth will grow faster this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that education, housing and automobile will be
flashing spots of this year's consumption market. Since 1999, the
Chinese government has begun to increase the number of recruit of
universities. At the same time, the reforms in medical care,
housing system and experiments in consumer loans are also expected
to make breakthrough in the next 24 months.
</P>
<P>
China is working even harder to relieve the burden of farmers
and stop all kinds of illegal charges. The move is aimed to scrap
discriminative rules that the country adopted against personal
consumption under the old planned economic system.
</P>
<P>
The government's implementation of the strategy of vigorously
developing west China will open up new tourism and
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that consumption demand will make a
significant contribution to China's GDP increase in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Consumption Boosts Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Increasing consumption demand will
play an important role in China's attempt to maintain a high
economic growth rate this year, economic experts said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Qiu
Xiaohua said today that due to the Chinese government's effort to
increase domestic demand, the declining trend of retail price
index will tail off this year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that retail price index (RPI) in January
was up one percentage point over last December. Though the January
RPI was 2.1 percentage points lower than the same month of last
year, it marked a much slower declining rate. In January, 1999,
the RPI dropped 2.8 percentage points over the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI) in January rose by 0.9 percent
over last December, registering the highest jump for the same
period in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Stimulating consumption demand is playing an increasingly
important role in the Chinese government's battle against
deflation. Consumption demand contributed 5.5 percentage points to
economic growth in 1999, more than doubling the contribution that
investment demand made to the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
NBS Director Liu Hong said that despite that the growth of
investment in fixed assets fell short of the target last year, the
government's efforts to increase compensations to low-income
persons and promote wages of government workers, coupled with the
pro-active fiscal policy, helped secure a 7.1 percent growth of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say that since Chinese banks are cautious to
take risks in giving loans and some local governments are unable
to provide counterpart funding to match the investment made by the
central government, the central government is yet to fully achieve
its goals of promoting economic growth by increasing investment in
fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
For example, the central government's investment in fixed
assets increased by 43 percent in 1999, while those funded by bank
loans increased merely 4.8 percent and investment by enterprises
and local governments 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese government will continue to rely on
increasing both consumption and investment demand to secure a
sustained economic growth this year.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said today
that China is ready to work with other people of the Asia-Pacific
and the world at large for the progress in the regional and
international cause of human rights, for the establishment of a
fair and equitable new international political and economic order,
and for the maintenance and promotion of world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang made the remarks in a message of
congratulations to the participants of the Eighth Workshop on
Regional Cooperation for the Promotion and Protection of Human
Rights in the Asia-Pacific Region, which opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 20th century is one of great changes for China.
The Chinese people won national independence and liberation
through unyielding and dauntless struggles. The Chinese government
has adopted the policy of reform and opening-up to develop the
economy, shake off poverty and build democracy and a sound legal
system, Jiang said, adding that China has also done a lot of work
in the field of human rights and scored spectacular results.
</P>
<P>
"In the 21st century, we will improve our democracy, run the
country according to law, ensure our people more extensive rights
and freedoms and strive to build China into a strong and
prosperous modernized country with a higher degree of democracy
and civilization," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have just rung in the new millennium. It is one of
the common aspirations of mankind to fully enjoy human rights.
Looking back into the past one hundred years, we have seen people
of various countries wage dauntless struggle for human rights and
fundamental freedoms and score remarkable achievements in this
regard."
</P>
<P>
The Fascist demon that once did havoc in Asia and Europe has
been eliminated, and the colonialist system that had held out for
centuries has fallen apart, and the vast number of Asian, African
and Latin American countries have won national liberation and
independence, adding that the fight against apartheid has ended
with a complete victory, and a number of international instruments
on human rights have been formulated, he said.

said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is an important task facing the international
community to further strengthen international cooperation in the
field of human rights and promote the development of the
international cause of human rights in the new century.
</P>
<P>
"We have both opportunities and challenges. Although we have
differences on the issue of human rights due to different national
conditions, we share common goals in promoting and protecting
human rights," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"All countries should conduct dialogues and exchanges in the
spirit of equality and mutual respect to deepen mutual
understanding, narrow differences, expand common ground and seek
common progress," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Asia-Pacific countries are developing countries
that experienced similar sufferings in the past and share the
common desire for development now, Jiang said, adding that
therefore, it is of great significance to conduct regional
exchanges on human rights.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that with the joint efforts of all

<P>
BEIRUT, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Five members of the pro-Israeli
militia were killed on Wednesday in a roadside bomb attack by
Lebanese guerrillas in the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said.
</P>
<P>
The five members of the South Lebanon Army, which is helping
Israel patrol the occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon, were
killed as their jeep, carrying six SLA militiamen, travelled in Ein
Kenia village near Hasbaya town in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas also fired at Hazbaya town, injuring one Lebanese
civilian, Israeli army said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
is leading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupation troops and
the SLA, claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, Israeli troops retaliated by
firing shells against suspected Hezbollah targets just north of the
buffer zone, the sources said. Information on possible casualties
of the Israeli attack was not available so far.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said in Washington
on Tuesday that if Syria, which is maintaining over 30,000 troops
in Lebanon, continues to aid Hezbollah in launching attacks against
Israeli troops in south Lebanon, Israel would retaliate by
attacking Syrian economic interests in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Telecom Giant Posts Big Income Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Telecommunications giant Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) bared Wednesday its last
year's net income totaling 2.8 billion pesos (70 million U.S.
dollars), an increase of 151 percent over the 1998 figure of 1.1
billion pesos (27 million dollars), Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
In a disclosure to the Philippines Stock Exchange (PSE), PLDT
reported its consolidated net income grew by 18 percent to 11.7
billion pesos (292 million dollars) in 1999 from 9.8 billion pesos
(245 million dollars) in 1998 due to a 7-percent reduction in
operating expenses which was partly offset by a one percent
decrease in operating revenues.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure added its earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization improved by 24 percent to 25.5
billion pesos (637 million dollars) in 1999 compared to 20.6
billion pesos(515 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, this improvement in income performance is being
threatened by the impact of the on-going losses of its sister
company, Pilipino Telephone Corporation (Piltel), amounting to 2.1
billion pesos (52 million dollars) as of December 1999.
</P>
<P>
But PLDT's net income before equity losses by its subsidiaries,
rose by 43 percent to 4.9 billion pesos (122 million dollars) in
1999.Operating revenues reached 46.4 billion pesos (116 million
dollars)last year.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Step Up Utilization of Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China is working to have natural
gas account for eight percent of its energy consumption by the
year 2020, from the present two percent, according to the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
A CNPC expert said here today China is expected to produce 100
billion cubic meters a year by 2020, equivalent to 100 million
tons of crude oil, based on an anticipated increase in its proven
gas reserves at an annual average rate of 120 billion cubic meters
between 2001 and 2020.
</P>
<P>
China has started a nationwide gas pipeline project to
accelerate the use of gas, said the CNPC source.
</P>
<P>
Priority has been given to laying gas pipelines extending from
major gas production bases in Sichuan Province, the Shaanxi-Gansu-
Ningxia region, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to
developed areas in north and northeast parts of China as well in
the Yangtze River and Pearl River deltas.
</P>
<P>
A long-distance gas pipeline running from Shaanxi to Beijing
has been completed and is now operational.

BEIRUT, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Five members of the pro-Israeli

Lebanese guerrillas in the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon, Lebanese
security officials said.

The five members of the South Lebanon Army, which is helping
Israel patrol the occupied buffer zone in southern Lebanon, were
killed as they travelled in a jeep in Ein village of Ein near
Hasbaya in the zone.

The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
is leading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupation troops and
the SLA, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Immediately after the attack, Israeli troops retaliated by
firing shells against targets just north of the buffer zone, the

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Cuts Int'l Phone Call Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia cut its international
phone call prices by about 30 percent starting Wednesday in an
effort to attract more customers.
</P>
<P>
The number of telephone users are increasing every year in
Cambodia, and the aim of the move is to attract more customers by
making the tariffs closer to the international standards,
according to officials of the Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the new prices, during the week-days, the costs of
phone calls to Thailand, Vietnam and Laos were reduced from 2.40 U.
S. dollars per minute to 1.68 dollars, and prices to other Asian
countries were cut from 2.60 dollars per minute to 1.82 dollars.
Prices to the rest of the world were declined from 2.90 dollars a
minute to 2.03 dollars. On the weekends, prices will be discounted
by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local calls from the state-run landline to a mobile phone
were cut from 0.18 dollar a minute to 0.15 dollar, while long-
distance calls within the state-run fixed network were reduced
from 0.30 dollars to 0.15 dollar a minute.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia now has about 120,000 telephones, some 20-fold as
compared with six years ago, among them about 17,000 are users of
the state landline network and 100,000 users are in the mobile
phone market. But the high prices of calls have prevented many
people from making calls, especially international ones.
</P>
<P>
The price-cutting move is warmly welcomed by consumers,
especially foreign investors. The Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry made about 26 million dollars in revenue from
telecommunication service in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Coca Cola Branch Loses Case Over Telephone Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A Coca Cola branch in Qingdao, an
east China port city in Shandong province, was forced to pay a
Chinese family 5,000 yuan (about 600 U.S. dollars) and apologize
to them because of a telephone number.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao Coca Cola Company's hotline number is 0532-8701818,
but the company did not print Qingdao's area code 0532 on the
bottle's label.
</P>
<P>
Many customers called the Company Branch in Jinan, the
provincial capital, forgetting to first dial Qingdao's area code.
As a result, calls were received by an elderly couple in Jinan.
Their home number is 0531-8701818. The area code for Jinan is 0531.
</P>
<P>
The elderly couple complained that frequent calls greatly
disrupted their normal routine and caused unnecessary anxiety.
Their son, with the surname Wang, took the Company to court.
</P>
<P>
The Licheng District Court in Jinan ruled that the Coca Cola
Branch in Qingdao should make new labels on which the area code of
Qingdao must be clearly printed before the local number. The
Branch must also write an apology to the couple and pay them 5,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Although the case is over, Wang is concerned that old labeling
on Coca Cola bottles in Jinan means that people will continue to
call his parents.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Intuit Invests in China's Software Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. computer software company
Intuit Inc. has joined hands with a Chinese company in Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, in developing the
latest version of its finance software.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Suda Software Co. and Intuit clinched a 150
million yuan deal last week for developing QuickBooks8.0 software
for managing finance in small and medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
The two partners also plan to invest 42 million yuan in China's
e-commerce market and another 100 million yuan for promoting
software sales.
</P>
<P>
Intuit, a major computer software producer in the U.S. next to
Microsoft, is known for its Quicker and Quicks software products
which are considered to be ideal instruments for individuals and
small and medium-sized companies for managing finance. This is the
first time that Intuit makes a major investment in China.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Intuit is keeping a close eye on China's 20
million small and medium-sized companies, but the sales of finance
management software meant for them stood at merely 40,000 to 50,
000 sets last year.
</P>
<P>
The output value of China's software industry is expected to
exceed 100 billion yuan in five to eight years, compared with the
present 10 billion yuan. China's software sales account for less
than one percent of the world's total.

<HEADLINE> Ion Beam Bio-Engineering Improves Crops in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have successfully
bred seven new strains of crops by using "ion beam bio-engineering
" technology.
</P>
<P>
These strains include rice, soybean, wheat, maize and water
melon. They are of a high quality and are disease resistant,
according to sources with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The new strains have already been used in some areas and have
generated huge incomes. A new strain of rice, for example, has
raised output by 750 to 1,500 kg per ha.
</P>
<P>
The technology requires infusing the desired ion beam into a
certain area inside a crop seed. This causes a physiological and
bio-chemical reaction. Some mutation may occur as a result.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the technology is comparable to the most
advanced levels of ion beam engineering overseas and will greatly
accelerate the development of agriculture in China.

WELLINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A number of New Zealand service
men and women in East Timor have contracted dengue fever.
</P>
<P>
Local media Wednesday quoted brigadier Martin Dunne of New
Zealand troops, who returned from East Timor on Friday, as saying

"Fewer New Zealand troops have contracted dengue than troops

risk of contracting the fever," he said.

Dunne said the greatest fear is contracting malaria, which
around 10 New Zealanders have contracted.

Dengue fever is an acute, infectious, haemorrhagic fever that
is temporarily completely incapacitating. It is also known as "

<HEADLINE> Bush Wins Primaries in Virginia, North Dakota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W.
Bush won the Republican primaries for the presidential nomination
in Virginia and North Dakota Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With 99 percent of precincts reporting results, Bush defeated
Arizona Senator John McCain 53 percent to 44 percent in Virginia
State.
</P>
<P>
Bush scored the victory with the support from party regulars
and the religious right. Exit polls showed Bush gained the backing
of 83 percent of self-declared religious conservatives. Religious
conservatives accounted for 20 percent of the Virginia vote.
</P>
<P>
McCain Monday delivered a harsh attack on two prominent
leaders of the Christian right, Pat Robertson, founder of the
Christian Coalition, and Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral
Majority. He depicted the evangelical leaders as "agents of
intolerance."
</P>
<P>
Bush also claimed victory in presidential caucuses in North
Dakota. With 73 percent of 49 precincts reporting, Bush won 76
percent of the vote while McCain got only 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bush's victory in the state is slowing the momentum of his
rival Senator John McCain on the brink of next week's critical 13-
state Republican presidential showdown.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we are one step closer to victory; we are one step
closer to having a united party, and we are one step closer to
getting rid of Clinton-Gore in Washington, D.C.," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McCain said he would look forward to Super Tuesday "
when we have a broad cross section of Americans all voting on the
same day."
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor has won in Iowa, Delaware and South Carolina,
but lost to McCain in New Hampshire, Michigan and Arizona in the
primaries. Bush badly needed to win after McCain beat him in
Michigan and Arizona last week.
</P>
<P>
The result of the biggest battle Tuesday in Washington state is
yet to be announced. Polls there closed at 11 p.m. EST (0400 GMT
Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
The three contests Tuesday were not expected to settle very
much in the bitter fight between Bush and McCain, but they could
set the tone for next week's "Super Tuesday" on March 7, when over
a dozen states including California and New York hold primaries or
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley
and Vice President Al Gore also faced each other in a nonbinding
vote of Democrats in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the vote there is a mere popularity
contest and no delegates will be distributed, Bradley hoped for a
symbolic victory to breathe life into his troubled campaign.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin on Importance of Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin described
the healthy growth of youths as pressing, and said it is a major
issue concerning the direction of China's education development if
they are able to develop morally, intellectually and physically.
</P>
<P>
After hearing of a second-grader at a high school in Jinhua
city of east China's Zhejiang Province who hammer his mother to
death because she pressed him to learn harder still and two other
similar incidents, Jiang said, the issue of reducing the students'
workload became a nationwide concern and it is worth pondering.
</P>
<P>
Education departments and leading education officials have been
urged to take effective, prompt measures for further improving
education, according to President Jiang's talk, which was carried
in today's "People's Daily'.
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of tragic incidents at schools at
different levels around the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite these incidents, President Jiang recalled, the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and central authorities have been
working very hard to develop education ever since new China was
founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Tremendous progress has been scored over the past 50 years in
the cause of education, which has helped train a great number of
outstanding, talented people for the country's socialist
construction, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Before 1949, however, some 80 percent of the China's 400
million-plus population were illiterate, he noted. And today, out
of China's population of 1.25 billion, 240 million are young
people and children who are receiving education in schools
nationwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Jiang further noted that education is a systematic
project, which is aimed at increasing the knowledge and improving
moral integrity of students.
</P>
<P>
Teachers, who are often referred to as "soul engineers", should
play an exemplary role. Schools, students' families and society at
large should look after youths and encourage them to make progress
and turn themselves into healthy adults, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Today, as most families in China have only one child, they
naturally want very much to provide their child with easy access
to still better education. The education system should cultivate
and help these children to become valuable members of society. But
some students complain about heavy workload and too much home
assignments and they are enduring enormous pressure to perform
well at school, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
While focusing on the academic attainments of the students,
quite a number of schools do not attach due importance to
developing and cultivating the students as individuals, Jiang
added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that it is essential for China's young people
to apply themselves to their work. And pedagogical methods are
extremely important in the process. Nevertheless, if students are
only confined themselves to their class rooms or studies, burying
themselves in piles of homework, they will, beyond any doubt, lack
essential social skills and practical experiences. So schools are
crucial in educating China's youth.
</P>
<P>
All educational authorities should give scope to their role of
education in China and strike a balance between theory study and
social practice, Jiang said.

<P>
Although China's higher education has made very rapid progress
in the last two decades and a drastic rise was reported in the
enrollment of universities and colleges in China, not every person
has the opportunity to get a higher education.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that not only are college graduates valuable
workers for the construction of socialism. The country is also in
urgent need of skilled people from all professions. China requires
knowledge-based industries as well as labor-intensive industries,
as economic development and social progress require diversified
demands for qualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
Since education is a systematic project, whole society should
care for and support the education cause, and patriotism,
collectivism and socialism among the young people should be
enhanced. And everyone should work hard to cultivate moral conduct
and develop a healthy outlook on life for China's youth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, ethics should be further promoted at schools and
incorrigible students should be given particular attention. Jiang
also stressed that legal studies become a compulsory part of
education in students and young people as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Cultivating socialist ethics and cultural progress among China'
s youths is an indispensable part of education and vital for
training and upbringing healthy, useful adults who can make all
kinds of valuable contributions for their socialist country.

The trade surplus in January this year was 4.5 percent higher
than that in the same month a year ago, it said, adding the higher
surplus for the month under review was due to stronger growth in

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Launch Revised Conduct Code for Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will launch a
revised code of conduct and market practices for the bond market
in the near future to promote best and standard trading practices,
Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia Governor Ali Abul Hassan
Sulaiman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A working committee comprising representatives from the
Malaysian Bond Traders Institute, industries and regulatory
authorities, would be formed to review their existing codes and to
streamline the private debt securities trading practices and
procedures, he said when addressing the seminar on "The Banking
and Financial Law School 2000 -- The Ringgit Bond Market," here.
</P>
<P>
Besides this, he said, to further enhance market liquidity, the
existing restrictions on repurchase agreement transactions by
corporates were expected to be relaxed.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said that Bank Negara Malaysia's
focus in the months ahead is to improve the liquidity of the
Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) market.
</P>
<P>
By improving liquidity in this market, participants would be
more willing to transact and take positions in markets where they
expect liquidity to continue at a high level for the foreseeable
future, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a liquid government securities market would also
result in lower cost of funds for the government.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara would forge ahead its efforts to increase the
degree of transparency and standardization of trading and
settlement practices in the trading of government securities to
increase market liquidity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that when these practices are standardized,
there would be greater participation from a wider range of
participants and this would contribute to market liquidity, he
said.

WELLINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Team New Zealand on Wednesday
won the 4th race in the America's Cup Finals nine series on the
Hauraki Gulf off Auckland, the biggest city of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Defender Team New Zealand made an ideal start crossing at the
favored left-hand end of the line a boat length ahead of the

shifts in the fickle eight knots of breeze during the first leg to
round a commanding 45 seconds in front at the first mark. It
covered every move the Italians made to extend its lead to one
minute 39 seconds by the halfway stage.
</P>
<P>
The Prada of Italy eventually crossed the finish one minute 49
seconds behind Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Team New Zealand now holds a four-nil lead over Prada. It is

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Eyes Top 16 For Sprinters in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Amateur Athletics
Association (PASI) targets the world's top 16 for women's and men'
s sprinters, and men's relay team at the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
PASI Secretary-General Tigor M. Tanjung said that the sprinters
had great chances to enter the semifinals of the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, scheduled from September 15 to October 1.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the sprinters can compete until the semifinal, or
top 16," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
PASI is grooming nine athletes for the Olympics. They are Irene
(women's 100m), Supriati Sutono (women's 5,000m), Yanis (men's
100m), Nyoman Rae Trisandiana (women's long jump), Nunung Jayadi (
men's pole vault) and four 4x100m relay team members.
</P>
<P>
Of the lineup, only Irene, Yanis and the relay team have met
the time limit B qualification for the Olympics. Irene has
qualified with a best time of 11.56 seconds in the women's 100m
dash in the 1999 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games. Yanes also qualified
in the 100m dash with a time of 10.40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The men's relay team qualified after clocking 39.95 seconds in
the 1999 SEA Games in Brunei Darussalam last August.
</P>
<P>
But Tigor did not brush aside the other athletes' chances to
reach the prestigious spot in the world event. He named Supriati
and women's marathon runner Ruwiyati who were expected to qualify
for the quadrennial event before September 11.
</P>
<P>
"If qualified, I hope Supriati can enter the world's top 10.
Ruwiyati is also expected to qualify. For Nunung and Nyoman Rae, I
want to be realistic, their chances are very slim. Their personal
bests are far from the entry standards requirement. But we must
dare to set a target for them. They have to train hard to achieve
the target," he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks in Philippines Hit Record Low in 15 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Stocks in the Philippines plunged
further Tuesday, with the main index falling 4.6 percent to its
lowest level in more than 15 months, the nation's leading
newspaper the Philippine Post said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 78.71
points, or 4.6 percent, to 1,641.94, its lowest closing level
since November 10, 1998, when it finished at 1,637.10, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The index lost 74.16 points or 4.1 percent on Monday, the press
report noted, adding that the index has fallen 10 percent in three
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Philippine Dealing System, the peso breached
the 41-peso level in Tuesday morning trade, hitting a five-month
low of the 41.02 pesos against the U.S. dollar before recovering
in late trading to close at 40.935 pesos to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some traders said the market continued to be pressured by
foreign selling fueled by expectations of higher interest rates
and negative investor sentiment over irregularities in the trading
of shares of gambling operator BW Resources Corp.
</P>
<P>
Others said foreign investors are increasingly concerned over
the sluggish pace of structural reforms needed to support the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, Philippine Central Bank (PCB) Governor Rafael
Buenaventura on Tuesday said he expects the peso to remain at the
40-peso level to the dollar even as he dismissed suggestions that
the PCB would soon be intervening in the foreign exchange market.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian security forces
will give security guarantee for foreign investors in the country,
according to Polri (National Police) Chief Gen. Rusdihardjo.
</P>
<P>
He said the Polri will do their best to carry on security
guarantee particularly for foreign investors, the Bisnis Indonesia
daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The security is a main guarantee (which will be given by the
police to investors) in proceeding business activities, therefore
security and safety of the projects and foreign investments in
Indonesia are the priority of the Polri," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the police are ordered to take a stern
measure against those who try to disturb the safety of foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ad interim Coordinating Minister for Political and
Security Affairs Surjadi Sudirdja said that to boost the ongoing
economic recovery process the government will meet its commitment
to give security guarantee for foreign investors who will and have
been investing in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Scrap Special Treatment for Military: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to end the special
treatment and facilities enjoyed by the Indonesian Defense Forces
(TNI), the government is set to audit military-linked businesses,
according to Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie.
</P>
<P>
"Military foundations have been conducting business for a long
time and have obtained licenses easily as well as obtained special
treatment. Now we are trying to end it by beginning to audit them,
" Kwik Kian Gie said.
</P>
<P>
Under former president Soeharto, who was forced down in May
1998 after 32 years in power, the military invaded all lucrative
sectors from the bureaucracy to businesses.
</P>
<P>
"If they (military) now ask for a signature on a special
concession in any sector ... that'll be impossible," Kwik Kian Gie
was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the State Financial and Development Supervisory Agency
(BPKP) has carried out audits of several military foundations.
</P>
<P>
He, however, refused to name the foundations.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is also accused of using charities as his business
vehicles. During his reign, corrupt, collusive and nepotistic
practices flourished in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Abdurrahman Wahid has launched
sweeping political and economic reforms focusing on anti-
corruption measures and efforts to reduce the influence of the
military in the social, political and business sectors.

 Honduras proposed holding naval patrols with Nicaragua in the

TIANJIN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port city in
north China, approved a total of 575 overseas-financed projects in
1999, with overseas investment contracts worth 3.62 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although these figures were down slightly on 1998 figures, the
investment from overseas reached 2.532 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pi Qiansheng, head of the Tianjin Municipal Commission of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that the amount of
investment by Hong Kong and Japanese investors rose by 32 percent
and 54 percent respectively, due partly to the recovery of the
Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investment made by investors from Europe and the
United States in Sino-foreign joint ventures also increased
steadily. Hong Kong, the U.S., the Republic of Korea, Japan and
Singapore have become Tianjin's top five investors.
</P>
<P>
The city's manufacturing sector continues to be the focus of
overseas investment. According to Pi, 40 percent of last year's
approved overseas-backed ventures were involved in the
manufacturing and construction industries.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of overseas businesses have made good profits.
One hundred and sixty-eight overseas investors injected more money
into Tianjin last year, amounting to 830 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Calls on East Timor to Open New Era of Ties  with Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Tuesday called on East Timorese to bury the hatchet of the
past and open a new era of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before thousands of East Timor's capital of Dili
residents, the president said the people in East Timor and
Indonesia had become the victims of oppression from his
predecessor's regime.
</P>
<P>
"You were oppressed, we also were under tyranny ... But the
past period, which was full of hardship and pain, will end soon.
Let us start building a better future for Timor Leste (East Timor)
and Indonesia," Wahid was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid arrived in Dili on Tuesday morning for a one-day visit,
becoming Indonesia's first head of state to set foot in East Timor
since the majority of people in the territory voted for a
breakaway from Indonesia last August.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the president held a dialog with East
Timorese leaders and the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) head Sergio de Mello.
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference with East Timorese independence
leader Xanana Gusmao and de Mello, the president reiterated his
commitment to close cooperation with East Timor in achieving its
full independence.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Indonesia would give financial assistance to
its new neighbor, the president said that Indonesia is determined
to help East Timor build its future, but the assistance should not
be merely in the form of money.
</P>
<P>
"The form of assistance varies ... The assistance could also
take the form of the opening of air and sea links," he was quoted
by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president also visited Santa Cruz Cemetery and prayed at
the small chapel inside. According to the Indonesian version, at
least 50 people were killed and many went missing when the
military allegedly opened fire at cemetery visitors on November 12,
1991.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to apologize for the sins that have happened in
the past, to the victims or the families of Santa Cruz and those
friends who are buried in the military cemetery. Both are the
victims of circumstances that we didn't want," he was quoted by
the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also witnessed the signing of a joint communique by
Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab and de Mello.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the two parties have reached
several understandings, "including on the status of refugees, land
border demarcation and maritime delimitation and the state
pensions of East Timorese who were Indonesian civil servants."
</P>
<P>
The president concluded his visit by laying the foundation
stone for a new Indonesian mission in Dili.
</P>
<P>
He later flew to Indonesian-held West Timor where about 120,000
East Timorese refugees are still sheltering in camps there.

the religious right.
</P>
<P>
His victory in the state is slowing the momentum of his rival
Senator John McCain on the brink of next week's critical 13-state
Republican presidential showdown.
</P>
<P>
Bush has won in Iowa, Delaware and South Carolina, but lost to
McCain in New Hampshire, Michigan and Arizona in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
Bush's victory in Virginia, which was projected based on
surveys of Virginia voters conducted by Voter News Service, a
consortium of the Associated Press and television networks, was a
result that Republican voters overwhelmed independents and
Democrats who crossed party lines in support of McCain.
</P>
<P>
Religious conservatives accounted for 20 percent of the
Virginia vote.
</P>
<P>
McCain Monday delivered harsh attack on two prominent leaders
of the Christian right, Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian
Coalition, and Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority,
depicting the evangelical leaders as "agents of intolerance."
</P>
<P>
The see-sawing Republican presidential race was fought also in
North Dakota and Washington State Tuesday, but the results are not
yet clear.
</P>
<P>
The three contests Tuesday are not expected to settle very much
in the bitter fight between Bush and McCain, but they could set
the tone for next week's "Super Tuesday" on March 7, when over a
dozen states including California and New York hold primaries or
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley
and Vice President Al Gore squared off in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the vote there is a mere popularity
contests and no delegates will be distributed, Bradley hopes for a
symbolic victory to breathe life into his troubled campaign.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Senators Criticize U.S. for Certifying Anti-Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States' unilateral
practice to certify the legitimacy of the fight against drugs is a
"game of political pressure" against Mexico, Mexican senators said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress' annual evaluation of other countries'
success in fighting against the drug problem was repudiated by
senators from the Revolution Institutional Party (PRI), National
Action Party (PAN) and the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The senators said they were upset by the controversial position
of the United States regarding Mexico's position against drugs,
adding that in the next Mexican-U.S. Interparliamentary Meeting,
they will demand that procedure be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Senate Commission on Foreign Relations
Martha Lara Alatorre, said that "the certification is a process of
political order that is performed annually to play with Mexico,
and we are falling into the U.S. congressmen's trap."
</P>
<P>
Senator Norberto Corrella said the anti-drug certification does
not have a real purpose in the fight against drugs, and that its
intent is to pressure the Latin American governments politically.

<HEADLINE> IDB President Supports Single Currency Within Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, February 29 (Xinhua) -- The President of the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) Enrique Iglesias said Tuesday that
he supports the policy of a single currency within the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Iglesias, who is to attend the inaugural ceremony of Uruguayan
President Jorge Batlle on Wednesday, said the creation of a single
currency inside Mercosur will benefit the whole region. He also
recommended setting a goal for that objective.
</P>
<P>
"I am a supporter of following the unified currency process.
I think that if a single currency is possible, that place is in
the Mercosur," he said.
</P>
<P>
The single currency was first proposed by former Argentine
President Carlos Menem in 1998, evoking arguments in economic
circles.
</P>
<P>
Iglesias pointed out that a single currency is neither for
today nor for tomorrow, saying that it took Europe many years to
finally adopt the euro as their single currency.
</P>
<P>
"I think we should continue proposing it as a reality. The
future world will not continue having 180 different currencies,
but is going to have only one currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, with Bolivia and Chile as associate members, is
composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Loses in Trademark Dispute with Chinese Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The German-U.S. automobile giant
DaimlerChysler has lost a litigation case with a Chinese tyre
company.
</P>
<P>
DaimlerChysler accused the Dongyu Group of using a similar
trademark -- an upright "Y" instead of an inverted one -- with its
Mercedes-Benz passenger car model. The litigation case has been
going on for four years.
</P>
<P>
Dongyu defended its position by stating that their trademark is
made up of the capital letters of their company name, "D" and "Y"
with the upright "Y" in the round "D". There are also two Chinese
characters "dong" (east) and "yu" (world) on either side of the
trademark.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) threw
out the case in 1997 deciding that consumers could be able to
easily figure out the difference between the two trademarks.
However, DaimlerChrysler was not happy with SAIC's decision and
requested a second hearing in 1997.
</P>
<P>
SAIC gave its final judgment in December 1999 and ruled that
both trademarks, while similar, are nonetheless quite distinct.

<HEADLINE> China Drafting Long-Term Plan to Harness Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is drafting
a long-term plan for controlling floods, cut-offs, pollution and
the build-up of sediment on the Yellow River, according to the
Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Harnessing the river will ensure the sustainable development of
the areas along the 5,464-km-long river, the second largest in
China, says a ministry report, quoted by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A total of 174.1 billion yuan (20.9 billion U.S. dollars) is
needed to control the river, and 64 percent will come from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River supplies 12 percent of water for the country's
population and 15 percent for farmlands. The control of the river
mainly involves two steps, tackling eco-environmental problems and
flood control.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaoguo, deputy director of the Yellow River Conservancy
Commission under the ministry, suggested that the central
government raise the prices of the river's water that is used for
agricultural and industrial purposes.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, a new regulatory agency will be needed to oversee
the ever-growing demand for the river's water, which can be used
to push development in northwestern China, a national priority,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
The ministry report also states that the government must limit
water-consuming industrial projects and construction of diversion
works along the river.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, all of the levees downstream of the Yellow River need
to be reinforced to meet state flood-control standards for the
river's changing watercourse.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River has substandard dikes along a 440-km stretch
of the lower reaches with another 471-km-long section with dikes
that leak, says the ministry report.
</P>
<P>
The cut-off of the river can be solved by adopting water-
efficiency irrigation and reusing 75 percent of the industrial
water supply, it states.

<HEADLINE> "Guangming Daily" Editorial on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's "Guangming Daily" carries
a front-page editorial today calling on departments and
educational institutions at all levels to study President Jiang
Zemin's speech on education.
</P>
<P>
The editorial asks the government officials and educaters
across China to change their attitudes to the prevailing education
system and help to push forward quality-oriented education.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a 17-year old high school student in east China's
Zhejiang Province killed his mother with a hammer because she
pressured him to improve his grades. The incident sent shock waves
around the country and reflected a number of problems in the
education system, in families and society.
</P>
<P>
"Young people should develop and cultivate morals, intelligence,
physique, and aesthetics, which are all inseparably linked," said
the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Schools as well as society should do their part in improving
and developing the present education system and pay special
attention to young people.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also said that schools should do more to relieve
the burden of students and help young people foster a healthy
outlook on life and values.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed that all educational departments across
the country, the Communist Party and society must work with each
other in supporting education.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Asia: Getting Ready For New Economy  Challenges  By Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Asia could soon re-emerge as the
world's fastest growing region after a severe financial crisis,
but its sustainable growth in the new millennium would depend, to
a large extent, on its scientific capabilities, which would help
meet the challenges of a "New Economy."
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Asia has made great strides in science
and technology development in the past decades, but it still lags
far behind the west. Such gaps became wider in the past three
years, when Asia was hit by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
While Asia was struggling out of the crisis, the rest of the
world did not stand still. On the contrary, a so-called "New
Economy" led by the information and technology sector has proved
successful in the United States, where extraordinary economic
expansion has continued since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Although many economists still wonder if the New Economy would
go global, some experts said it has already evolved and Asia must
boost its scientific capabilities to meet the challenges of the
New Economy, which springs from the confluence of high
technologies, including the explosive growth of computing power
and revolutions in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"The pursuit of wealth is now largely the pursuit of
information and its application to production," Walter Wriston,
former chairman of Citibank once said.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Asians are more aware of the urgency of boosting
scientific capabilities than people in other regions, since the
lack of high technologies to meet the challenges of globalization
was partly blamed for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Now, Asian governments are trying their best to boost their
countries' scientific capabilities. In South Korea, the government
plans to increase spending on key hi-tech projects by 17 percent
this year and aims to make the country one of the world's top 10
science powers by 2010. Seoul also wants 30 percent of its foreign
trade to be conducted online by 2003, six times more than 1999.
</P>
<P>
"(South) Korea is in a good position to bolster the foundations
of electronic commerce. (South) Koreans are zealous about getting
educated, so this kind of new information age will be tremendous
opportunity for (South) Korea," said South Korean Trade Minister
Hand Ducksoo recently.
</P>
<P>
In India, the government vows to remove bureaucratic hurdles to
ensure that India's success in information technology is
replicated in all areas of science. In Thailand, Malaysia, the
Philippines and many other Asian countries, the development of
information technology and other hi-techs have been placed as
priorities of the governments.
</P>
<P>
However, to catch up with the west is not an easy job for Asian
countries, because they must invest much more in developing high
technologies for a New Economy to take off, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, business poured more than 2 trillion
dollars into computers, software and other technological products
during the 1990s. U.S. investment in information technology is at
about 34 percent of its total business investment. But its rival
Japan is spending only 20 percent. For other Asian countries,
investments in technology is even much less.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, experts said that Asian countries must try their
best to increase investments in technology. Otherwise, They will
lag far behind the west in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
But, while Asian countries need to pour more funds in
technology to raise scientific capabilities, people in the region
must also learn to apply high technologies.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys show that while the rest of the world is going e-
commerce crazy, Asian companies seem reluctant to play.
</P>
<P>
A recent Visa International survey found that senior executives
in Asia's top firms do not think e-commerce has benefits for them.
In Singapore, a government survey suggests that 63 percent of
firms there simply do not like e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
If the trend continues, Asia would need much more time to catch
up with the west in scientific capabilities, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries should not only increase investments in high
technologies but change attitude toward new technologies, if they
really want to boost scientific capabilities, they said.

PARIS, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Marseille missed half its first-
choice players but managed to pull off a 1-0 surprise win against
Chelsea on Tuesday in the second round of the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Robert Pires put the French side ahead in the 16th minute when
he stormed down the inside right channel, skipped round French
international teammate Marcel Desailly and slammed in a powerful
shot from an acute angle.
</P>
<P>
The French club, lying a lowly 13th place in its domestic
league, inflicted Chelsea first defeat in 14 leagues and cup games.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea looked out of sorts and only a superb saving tackle
from John Harley stopped Pires doubling the lead in the 28th
minute. Dalmat nearly scored for Marseille in the 80th minute
after a solo run.
</P>
<P>
Without the injured Florian Maurice, William Gallas, Franck
Dumas and Stephane Porato, and suspended Yannick Fischer and
Sebastian Perez, the home team was barely recognizable from the
one that beat Manchester United 1-0 in the last round of the
competition.
</P>

Chelsea lined up with three French world champions, including
Didier Deschamps and Desailly who won the European champions
league with Marseille in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese puppet play based on the
historical novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" will start its
world tour in Beijing on March 2.
</P>
<P>
The play is a collaboration of a Japanese drama troupe and the
Sichuan Puppet Troupe and will tour the US, France, Mexico, the
Republic of Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is a tale of retribution and
intrigue and chronicles the break up of the Han dynasty into three
kingdoms--Wei, Shu and Wu--from 168 A.D. to 280 A.D, when the
Kingdom of Jin unified China.
</P>
<P>
Tales and stories from the novel have inspired military
strategists in Chinese history and in the present reform period
continues to inspire entrepreneurs and businesspeople vying for
larger market shares.
</P>
<P>
Adaptations of the novel have been made into films, TV plays,
and historical dramas. In 1998, tales and stories from the novel
were made into a puppet play to celebrate the 10th anniversary of
the Sino-Japan diplomatic relations.

<HEADLINE> Economist Calls For Freer Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese economist
suggested China's capital market to better adjust itself to the
international market after the nation joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Professor Xiao Zhuoji from Beijing University was quoted by
today's China Daily as saying that China's fledgling capital
market needs to further play down its Chinese characteristics and
adjust to better comply with international practices.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures Xiao suggested are the restructuring of
equity of listed companies and a number of adjustments in both A-
share and B-share markets aiming at lifting the current
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
At present, stocks owned by the state and legal persons,
accounting for about two-thirds of the total capitalization of
China's stock market, cannot be circulated.
</P>
<P>
Xiao called for a change to that, but only expecting it to take
place gradually.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions as to what kind of capital is allowed in A-
share or B-share markets should also be removed after the nation's
WTO entry, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of foreign capital into the A-share market
will usher China's capital market into a new stage of development.
"
</P>
<P>
Xiao also pointed out that the B-share market should be open to
domestic investors, widely believed to have an estimated 50
billion U.S. dollars in hand.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, foreign capital can only find its way into
the B-share and H-share markets while domestic capital is only
allowed to invest in A-shares. Foreign intermediary companies are
not permitted to participate in issuing and trading in the A-share
market, too.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a major indication of China merging into the
international capital market if foreign intermediary companies are
allowed in A-share market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao believes the issuance of stocks of foreign companies will
bring foreign financial institutions to invest in China, which
will help China' stock market expand and speed up development.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are the highlights
of today's major Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The paper front-pages President Jiang Zemin's talk on
education on February 1, this year, describing education as a
systematic project and calling for the whole society, including
schools and families, to do a good job in educating the children.
</P>
<P>
-- The eighth meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) closed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

over Tuesday closing session. The three-day meeting was aiming at
making preparations for the upcoming Third Plenary Session of the
Ninth CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
--The paper carries a front-page report on progress Beijing
scored in 1999 in all fields and various economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
-- Han Zhubin, procurator-general of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, announced Tuesday 10 new rules in a bid to maintain
a disciplined and clean and honest contingent of prosecutors.

demands of the Party and the people, Han said.
</P>
<P>
 China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The central government is drafting a long-term plan for
controlling floods, cut-offs, pollution and the build-up of

Harnessing the river will ensure the sustainable development of
the areas along the 5,464-kilometer river, the second longest in
China.
</P>
<P>
-- China Tuesday criticized the US State Department, saying it
gave a distorted assessment of Hong Kong's human rights situation
in its annual report on the issue throughout the world.
</P>

"It is most inappropriate for the United States to make
uninvited remarks and unwarranted interference in Hong Kong's
internal affairs," Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in

<HEADLINE> China's 1st Clean Plating Equipment Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
the country's first non-pollution plating equipment -- new
composite vacuum ion plating film equipment.
</P>
<P>
The new plating equipment, developed by an institute under the
China Academy of Space Technology, has recently passed an official
appraisal by experts from the China Aerospace Science and
Technology Group Corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to experts participating in the appraisal, the new
equipment is of world level and can be used to substitute
traditional plating equipment that causes pollution with drainage
of plating liquor and waster water.
</P>
<P>
By using vacuum ion plating film technique, pure metal, alloy,
metallic compound or metallic ceramic materials are deposited on
base materials to form single- or multiple-layer film, and no
wastes are produced in the process, said one expert.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists began working on the new plating equipment
and technology in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
The management committee of Zixiao Temple is under the
jurisdiction of the Mount Wudang Taoist Association, a non-
governmental, religious organization with 147 members. Wang
Guangde, chairman of the association, is a member of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang is as experienced in operating the temple's tourism as he
is in handling religious affairs. His association now runs
businesses ranging from making of pharmaceuticals, commerce,
catering to martial arts training courses. These activities rake
in about 10 million yuan annually, most of which goes for
repairing temples, protecting cultural relics and charitable
offerings.
</P>
<P>
The grand ancient temple complex at Mount Wudang has been
included on the world cultural heritage list by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
In the past 15 years, Taoists have raised 250 million yuan to
renovate the ancient architecture. More than two million yuan has
been donated to poverty-stricken areas, flood-hit regions and
Project Hope, a program which returns young dropouts back to
school.
</P>
<P>
Taoists on Mount Wudang receive a monthly stipend of 200 yuan (
about 24 U.S. dollars). "That's enough, as we mainly use the money
to buy books, not cosmetics," said Xuan Qing. Taoist nuns do not
use makeup. They do not need to pay for their robes and receive
free meals in the temple dining hall.
</P>
<P>
Taoists used to refine concoctions that they believed made
people live longer, but the "immortality pills" are no longer made.
The Mount Wudang Taoists Association now reimburses the nuns for
their medical bills.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research
Society under the association have selected four ancient formulas
of "immortality pills" and put them into mass production.
</P>
<P>
"Taoism is thriving because of the current tolerant atmosphere
in society," said the association chairman Wang Guangde.

<P>
MADRID, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid suffered its worst
home defeat in Europe's top tournament as they bowed to Bayern
Munich 4-2 in the Champions league on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Scholl and Stefan Effenberg scored early goals for
Bayern Munich which replaced Real in first place with seven points
in Group C.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid was simply outplayed by Bayern, which is hoping to
avenge its heartbreaking 2-1 loss in last year's Champions League
final against Manchester United in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Real cut Bayern's lead from two goals to one, but that's as
close as the Spaniards would get. German goalie Oliver Kahn made
half a dozen impressive saves, particularly late in the game as
Real Madrid fought to save face.
</P>
<P>
Bayern scored first as Scholl dribbled to beat Real goalie Iker
Casillas in the 20th minute. Effenberg made it 2-0 in the 24th
minute with a low-flying free kick from 30 meters out.
</P>
<P>
Madrid pulled one back a minute later when a shot from Raul
Gonzalez hit the crossbar and fellow striker Fernando Morientes
headed in.
</P>
<P>
In the 39th minute Thorsten Fink gave Bayern a 3-1 cushion with
a powerful left-foot kick from the edge of the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
It went to 3-2 three minutes into the second half as Brazilian
Roberto Carlos made a long pass from the left and found Raul whose
header beat the Munich keeper Kahn.
</P>
<P>
Bayern iced the game in the 66th minute as striker Sergio Paulo
of Brazil headed in a corner kick.

<P>
FUZHOU, March 1(Xinhua) -- Police in east China's Fujian
Province seized 2,173 illegal emigrants in 218 cases last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of stowaways soared 60.1 percent over the previous
year, although the cases went down by 6.8 percent, a local police
source said.
</P>
<P>
During the year, security forces in the coastal province
intensified attacks on the organizers of the smugglers, known as "
snakeheads," catching 586 of them.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 4,188 stowaways were repatriated to the province.
</P>
<P>
A number of snakeheads were brought to justice. For example,
the Putian County Court sentenced smugglers Wu Wenfeng to a 11-
year imprisonment and Wu Jinhui to a term of 10 years for
illegally organizing people to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strict surveillance, illegal emigrating in groups
has declined in recent months, the police said.

<P>
WUHAN, February 29 (Xinhua) -- In the 2,000-year tradition of
her ancestors, Taoist nun Xuan Qing recites holy scriptures and
prays in front of statues of gods every morning, the woody smell
of incense filling her small room in Zixiao Temple.
</P>
<P>
And after that, she logs onto the Internet for some quality
time in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a new era, therefore we must learn to adapt to the
changes of the times," said Xuan Qing, a lifelong Taoist.
</P>
<P>
One of 43 Taoist nuns with the temple at Mount Wudang in
central China, 36-year-old Xuan Qing has spent 20 years in this
Taoist shrine.
</P>
<P>
Since the policy of religious freedom was resumed in China 20
years ago, 1,500 Taoist temples have re-opened to domestic and
overseas followers of the faith. The tourists have exposed Taoists
to the ways of the modern world, and they've kept Xuan close to
her office in the temple, where as an elected member of the temple
's management committee, she organizes religious affairs, cultural
protection activities and tourism promotion programs.
</P>
<P>
"The computer and telephone help me a lot," she said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
Taoism was founded in the second century by ancient philosopher
Lao Zi and is known as the root of traditional Chinese culture. It
is considered to be the earliest religion in China and was
designated the "state religion" many times by feudal regimes
throughout history.

<HEADLINE> Iverson May Miss Game with Partially Torn Rotator Cuff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 29 (Xinhua) -- All-Star guard Allen
Iverson, the league's leading scorer, may miss tonight's contest
with the Dallas Mavericks because of a partially torn right
rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
According to 76ers team physician Jack McPhilemy, Iverson is
experiencing right shoulder pain. He aggravated the injury Sunday
against the New York Knicks and will have his status updated prior
to tonight's home game.
</P>
<P>
Iverson suffered the injury in an 87-84 loss to the Los Angeles
Lakers on February 20. He was just 7-of-25 in that game, including
0-of-11 in the second half. He has rebounded to score at least 22
in each of Philadelphia's next three games but shot just 25-of-73
over that stretch.
</P>
<P>
If Iverson is sidelined for a prolonged period of time it could
spell doom for the 76ers, who currently are tied for fourth place
in the Eastern Conference at 30-25. The fourth and eighth playoff
spots are separated by just three games.
</P>
<P>
When Iverson missed 11 games earlier this season, Philadelphia
went 6-5. But the 76ers scored more than 84 points on just three
occasions and got by with a balanced attack and defensive
intensity.
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia could count itself fortunate with the addition of
proven scorer Toni Kukoc just before the trading deadline. Kukoc
is familiar with the rigors of shouldering an offensive burden.
</P>
<P>
Iverson was the Most Valuable Player of the 1997 Rookie Game en
route to winning Rookie of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
He was elected to his first All-Star team this year and is
averaging 30.2 points, 3.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game. He
had 50 points against Sacramento on February 6 and eclipsed the 40-
point plateau on five other occasions.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Lazio notoriously racist-minded
hard-core fans were quickly at it again Tuesday night when the
Italian runners-up played host to Dutch champs Feyenoord in a
European Champions League Group D match at the Olympic Stadium
here.
</P>
<P>
Despite recently being threatened with virtual eviction by
their own chairman for jeering black opponents -- and with harder-
hitting sanctions by the Italian league for racist banners -- the
fans immediately started booing all of Feyenoord's black players
the minute they touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
The fans also raised their lusty voices in praise of Eugenio
Fascetti, the Bari coach who on Sunday was quoted as saying after
a scuffle involving Torino's Senegalese defender Djibril Diawara
that "(the blacks) should be sent back home."
</P>
<P>
Fascetti later said he had been misunderstood and was worried
that an alleged spit by Diawara might have been infectious.
</P>
<P>
The hard-core chants were met with choruses of derision by the
main body of the home support, and soon stopped.
</P>
<P>
The Lazio chairman, industrialist and financier Sergio
Cragnotti, said after the most recent torrent of racist taunts
that he would prefer to play games with an empty stadium.

HONG KONG, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Top women's seed Sun Jin of
China sailed into the top eight after she accumulated three
straight wins in Group A of the 2000 Olympics Table Tennis Asian
Qualifying Tournament which opened here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After beating Kim Yun Mi from DPR Korea, 20-year-old left-
hander Sun, a member of the Chinese team crowned in World Team
Championships last week, outclassed Tsui Hsiu Li of Chinese Taipei
and Japanese Umemura Ava both in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
The world fourth ranked Chinese player became the first one to
finish the group matches with three wins and entered the top eight
round robin competition.
</P>
<P>
"The real contest will start tomorrow," said Sun.
</P>
<P>
Powerhouse China fielded three men and three women in the
singles. They will vie for just one berth to Sydney because based
on the ITTF world rankings, the top two Chinese men players Liu
Guoliang and Kong Linghui and women players Wang Nan, and Li Ju
had already clinched their berths automatically in the finals of
the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
All seeded players including China's men's single players Ma
Lin, Wang Liqin and Liu Guozheng and two other women players Zhang
Yining and Yang Ying, all ranked top twenty in the world, did not
meet much trouble to win all their competitions in their groups on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Seeded Jing Jun Hong of Singapore and her teammate Li Jia Wei
also made the top eight with three straight victories in their
group competitions respectively.
</P>
<P>
A total of 108 competitors from 20 Asian countries and regions
will vie for 11 men's singles and women's singles berths and six
men's and women's doubles berths respectively.
</P>
<P>
The six-day tournament features four events -- men's singles,
women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles, which are
played on a round robin format.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Vice President Calls for Adherence to Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice President Atiku
Abubakar Tuesday urged the country's northern states to revert or
adhere to the existing penal code.
</P>
<P>
The northern states should restore their situation to that
before last October when the Zamfara State announced it would
adopt the Islamic Sharia Law, said Abubakar while addressing an
emergency meeting of the Council of States in the capital city of
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Sharia is concerned, the nation will return to the
status quo ante," he told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Council of States is made up of the West African country's
36 state governors, service chiefs in the federal government,
former heads of state and the federal attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the meeting have made a decision "to
restore normalcy. ..and confidence among all communities" in the
multi-ethnic populous nation, which is secular by constitution,
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the existing penal code, which has already included
provisions for the Sharia Law, would continue to apply in the
affected northern states, but without the additions introduced by
the Zamfara State.
</P>
<P>
According to Abubakar, Sharia had been part of Nigeria's penal
code, especially in the Moslem-dominated north, since the country
won independence from Britain in October, 1960.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called up to study the situation after last
week's bloody clash over the introduction of Sharia in the
northern city of Kaduna, where some 300 people had been killed.
</P>
<P>
The incident was echoed nationwide and reportedly provoked a
reprisal in the eastern Abia State, where Christian population
dominates, on Monday, killing dozens of people.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Desires to Boost Ties with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A "dialog process" between Turkey
and Syria is gaining momentum, said a Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The process started after the two countries signed an agreement
in southern Turkey's Adana in 1998 under which Damascus pledged to
curb the activities of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) in Syria, said deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli at a weekly
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors Turkey and Syria had been at odds for more
than a decade over the PKK issue and water sharing of cross-border
rivers.
</P>
<P>
During his official visit to Syria last month, Turkish State
Minister Ramazan Mirzaoglu stated that Turkey was satisfied with
Syria's commitment to the Adana agreement.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli announced that, as a follow-up diplomatic effort,
Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Ugur Ziyal is scheduled to
visit Damascus on March 6.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at forging a general framework for further
promoting the Turkish-Syrian ties, Atacali said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the contacts will be a positive beginning for the
improvement of the relations between the two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the water issue will be included on the
agenda of the contacts, Atacanli said that "Naturally, we want the
water issue to be regarded as a cooperation element with our
neighbors and want this issue to be solved from this point of
view."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Syria had often complained that it did not
get enough water from the upper reach of the Euphrates River in
Turkey while Ankara blamed Syria for not using the water in an
efficient way.
</P>
<P>
Syria, together with Iraq, rejects Turkey's offers to create
joint commissions to investigate the real water needs of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a report of the Anatolia News Agency,
preparation work is under way for a possible meeting between
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and his Syrian counterpart
Faruk Shareh.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday praised
Tajikistan's recent parliamentary elections, calling the polls as a
step toward establishing peace and security in the republic.
</P>
<P>
The elections led to the formation of a multi-party parliament
in Tajikistan, which is a new experience in the Central Asian
region, foreign ministry spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying that Iran hopes the Tajik officials concerned would examine
complaints lodged by various parties to guarantee the justice of
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan's ruling Popular Democratic Party won nearly 65
percent of the country's first parliamentary elections held on
Sunday. But the election results were rejected by some parties and
candidates, citing election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party was followed by the Communists, with 20
percent, and the opposition Islamic Revival Party, with about 8
percent.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Repeats Rejection to U.N. Resolution 1284 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan reiterated on Wednesday that Iraq will not accept the U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1284, signalling that Iraq will not
allow the U.N. arms inspectors back to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at a pilgrims reception center near the
border with Saudi Arabia, Ramadan lashed out at the resolution by
saying that it was just aimed at prolonging the decade-long
sanctions imposed on Iraq and keeping Iraq under the colonial
control by the U.S. and Britain, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as the new U.N. arms chief inspector Hans Blix
formally took office in the day.
</P>
<P>
Blix was appointed in late January as executive chairman of the
U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or
UNMOVIC, which replaced the defunct U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan's remarks were also seen as a response to what U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Tuesday that he hoped Iraq
would show flexibility in dealing with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Blix will start formally on the 1st of March and begin to
work out his plans. I am sure at an appropriate time he will be in
touch with the Iraqi authorities," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that their (Iraq's) position will be flexible," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, adopted last December, requested the new
chief inspector to pick up the personnel for the UNMOVIC and draw a
working plan, subject to the approval of the U.N. Security Council
within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspection in Iraq has been suspended since
December 1998, following the U.S. and British four-night air
strikes to punish Baghdad for what they called Iraqi intransigence.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince Worries About Possible Chaos in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Saudi Crown Prince and
First Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz expressed
concern Wednesday that the Middle East might fall in chaos and
violence.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, also Commander of the National Guards, said upon his
arrival in Damascus this afternoon,"I fear that the region might
slip into a state of confusion and violence that could impact on
the whole world."
</P>
<P>
However, he believed,"The train of peace will chug ahead to its
termination despite the obstacles or barriers."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official noted that resisting occupation was a
legitimate right, and that only just peace can ensure the legal
rights of all parties and provide safe and secure life for all
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of his visit to Syria is exchanging views and
close ranks under such difficult and volatile circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Syrian sources considered Abdullah's visit favorable for the
stalled peace talks on the Syrian track with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Abdullah and Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
are expected to focus on the Middle East peace process, the
situation in Lebanon and the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, accompanied by a high-level official delegation,
stopped in Cairo before coming to Damascus to continue his Arab
tour
which will also take him to Beirut.

CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries:

ANKARA -- A Turkish private company Suralsu has started to
export water to Israel from the Taurus Mountains in southern
Turkey, Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Suralsu General Coordinator Suleyman Sural said that an initial
consignment had already been sent to Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Up to 3,000 tons of water would be sent to Israel by the end of
the year 2000, for which Israel will pay 450,000 U.S. dollars. The
water will be transferred to Israel by ship from Antalya harbor.
</P>
<P>
The export agreement came at a time when Turkey offered to sell
water from the Manavgat water project, known as the Peace Water
Project, to Middle East and Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government has allowed car importers to
bring in a total of 1,470 passenger cars from Hungary customs

JERUSALEM -- A bill raised by Israeli opposition Likud party
that will make a future deal with Syria more difficult to be
approved passed Wednesday its preliminary reading in the Knesset
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
The bill that requires an absolute majority in endorsing a
possible deal with Syria in a referendum was approved in its
preliminary reading by a vote of 60 to 53, with one absention.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which needs more readings before becoming law, a
special majority of all registered voters is required to approve
the handover of the occupied Golan Heights to Syria in a referendum
instead of a simple majority of votes cast. The votes of registered
voters' who fail to cast their ballots will be regarded as "no."

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Defense Ministry might start to issue
tenders within a week for moving military and civilian positions
and building new ones in preparations for a troop withdrawal from
south Lebanon, a local daily said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tenders will be issued to dismantle most of the military
outposts built in the so-called security zone Israel carved out in
1985 in southern Lebanon with a self-claimed aim of protecting its
northern areas, The Jerusalem Post quoted defense sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Some of the outposts straddling the international border will be
moved and new ones will be built within Israeli land according to a
redeployment plan dubbed New Horizon, which Israeli Chief of Staff
Shaul Mofaz is studying and is expected to approve in the coming

National Authority (PNA) will not receive any foreign official who
rejects to meet Palestinian officials in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local media, Sha'ath said the PNA took this
decision after the recent Israeli attempts aimed at preventing any
meetings between European and Palestinian officials in the Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said it was impossible for the PNA to stand still without
taking a crucial and decisive move over this issue which is of
great importance to Jerusalem and the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "We asked all authorized Palestinian
ambassadors all over the world to convey to the governments of the
concerned countries our clear message that any official who is
subject to the Israeli pressures and refuses to visit East
Jerusalem will not be received elsewhere by Palestinian officials."

<HEADLINE> Experts: Higher Education Key to Knowledge Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Higher education in developing
countries is inadequate and falling further behind, an independent
panel of world experts in education and international development
warned Wednesday, adding that without swift action, these
countries will be unable to compete in the knowledge economy.
</P>
<P>
Higher Education in Developing Countries: Peril and Promise
marks the final report of the Task Force on Higher Education and
Society, an autonomous body of specialists convened two years ago
by UNESCO and the World Bank. The study was launched at the World
Bank's Human Development Week taking place in Washington from
Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Well educated people from the developing world can be a
powerful force for change, but they need schools and academic
opportunities in their own countries. This is especially true in
the face of such staggering problem as the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and
the need to build up basic infrastructure and telecommunications
in poor countries," World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn said
in launching the task force's report.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the task force not only articulates compelling
reasons for renewed public interest in supporting higher education,
but also suggests specific areas for emphasis by developing
countries. These range from improving scientific and technological
capacity, to respecting principles of good governance, to
supporting both general and specialized education.
</P>
<P>
The task force secured the valuable insights of some of the
world's foremost authorities in higher education, and was composed
of 14 members from 13 countries. The Harvard Institute for
International Development served as home to the task force
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The task force sounds an alarm that higher education in
developing countries in crisis: it is generally overcrowded,
chronically under-funded, poorly managed, and beset with
inadequate faculty and curricula.
</P>
<P>
The report underscores the need for a holistic approach to
education policy, emphasizing that poor countries should view
higher education as a vital part of their overall human
development strategy. It argues that advanced education is crucial
for developing countries if they hope to engender the capacity
required to overcome serious problems, such as hunger, persistent
poverty, environmental degradation, and economic under-performance.
</P>
<P>
Demand for higher education is rising rapidly, compounding the
challenges for countries that hope to improve quality, reduce
public cost, and increases access to all strata. The task force
report advocates a policy of systemic reform emphasizing planned
diversity, where both public and private actors coordinate their
actions within a clear strategic framework.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we can succeed in the eradication of poverty
if the developing world is not a part of knowledge creation, its
dissemination and utilization to promote innovation," said
Mamphela Ramphele, co-chair of the task force. "Higher education
is a critical factor in making this possible and must be part of
any development strategy."

<HEADLINE> Greece Warns Against Kosovo Independence From Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday warned against
Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said in the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki that any ideas of autonomy and
independence in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo would surely lead
to a conflict, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the recent tense situation in Kosovo to the
aggressiveness of ethnic Albanians, who promoted views opposing
the legal basis on which the solution for Kosovo was founded in
accordance with the U.N. Security Council decision.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that any attempt to return to a state of
conflict in the province must be averted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
Wednesday described the situation in Kosovo as "tense", warning
that any flare-up of fighting in Kosovo would be disastrous to all.
</P>
<P>
Reppas called for the implementation of U.N. resolution 1244
for the supervision of forces in the region and the inviolability
of borders.
</P>
<P>
Greece currently has a battalion of 1,200 men participating in
the NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo, which has
recently seen rising violence between NATO peacekeepers, ethnic
Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Greece has also made it clear that it will not send more
troops to Kosovo and will not participate in the NATO force's
military exercise that is to take place in the region late this
month.

<HEADLINE> Jorge Batlle Assumes Uruguayan Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Jorge Batlle assumed Wednesday
presidency of Eastern Republic of Uruguay, being the fourth
president following the return of democracy in 1985.
</P>
<P>
During his conference of taking office , Batlle announced a
hard austerity plan in public spending and in backing to fishing
and farming production, as well as exports.
</P>
<P>
Batlle, a 72 year-old lawyer, had failed in previous attempts
of elections in 1966, 1971, 1984 and 1989. He achieved it in a run-
off voting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He is replacing Julio Maria Sanguinetti, who ended his second
non-consecutive term of office. They both belong to the Colorado
Party, political power having governed Uruguay the longest.
</P>
<P>
The Colorado candidate defeated in balloting of last November
28, leader of leftist Progressist Encounter, Tabare Vazquez, after
reaching a coalition accord with the National Party.
</P>
<P>
The assumption ceremony is celebrated in two instances, first
before the General Assembly of the Legislative Palace where Batlle
swore fidelity to the Constitution, and later in the Palace of
Independence, where an act of transfer of leadership will be
signed and he'll receive the Presidential ribbon.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Pledges Over One Million Dollars for Flood Victims In Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland has pledged more than 2.
2 million Swiss francs (about 1.3 million U.S. dollars) for flood
victims in Mozambique, Swiss Radio International reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The money were pledged by the Swiss government, non-
governmental organizations and private donors.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Swiss Development Agency was quoted as
saying that the main need at the moment was for helicopters to
rescue people, many of whom have been stranded for days.
</P>
<P>
"Helicopters are available in the region, so what is needed
right now is financing for these operations," said Thomas Frey,
program co-ordinator for the agency.
</P>
<P>
"A second need is now also emerging, which is a consequence of
the first, and that is that there seems to be a lack of jet fuel
in Mozambique now, so this could hamper the relief operation,"
Frey added.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Grant 13,000 Asylum-Seekers Temporary residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has decided to
recommend that some 13,000 long-term asylum-seekers, most of them
Tamils and Kosovars, be given temporary residence, according to
Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
The ruling on Wednesday applies to people whose asylum
applications are still at the first hearing stage, or whose
requests have been turned down, but who have yet to be sent home.
The applicants must have filed their requests at least eight years
ago and not have a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
The decision, named Humanitarian Action 2000, was taken after
representations from the cantons. It affects around 6,500 Tamils
and almost 5,000 ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Justice Minister Ruth Metzler said that the cabinet
decided that people who had lived for a long time in Switzerland
had the right to have their status clarified.
</P>
<P>
"We can't leave people in the dark any longer," she said, but
adding that the Swiss government would not do this again.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has just signed an accord of repatriation with
Albania to have those whose applications were refused by
Switzerland sent back home.

<P>
The report says Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay were not

The two countries were not certified because they "have been
world headquarters for the heroin business" for several years, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a briefing at the State
Department.

"In Afghanistan, the opium harvest grew substantially, and the
Taliban's full complicity in the drug trade has extended to the
point where both the harvesting and trafficking of opium is taxed,
" Albright told reporters.

The annual certification report has been attacked by the

<HEADLINE> Greek FM: Cyprus Issue Should be Solved Within U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou stressed here Wednesday that the protracted Cyprus
problem should be resolved within the parameters of U.N.
resolutions and the two agreements signed between the two sides in
1977 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
Speaking while attending a book publication ceremony,
Papandreou also said that all new parameters, including the Greek-
Turkish dialogue and the European Union (EU) aspect, should be
used appropriately in efforts to eventually settle the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU's role was decisive not only from the accession angle
but also on a political scale and its involvement in efforts for a
solution to the division problem of the island republic, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that he had made it clear to the
Turkish leadership that Greek-Turkish relations could not be
completely ironed out unless the unacceptable status in Cyprus was
overturned and a just and viable settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Both Athens and Nicosia have insisted that the Cyprus problem
must be resolved on the basis of the establishment of a bizonal,
bicommunal federation in line with U.N. resolutions, but Ankara
and northern Cyprus, illegally declared in 1983, demand that
northern Cyprus be recognized internationally as a prelude to
reunification in the form of a two-state confederation.
</P>
<P>
To reunite the island, the two communities on Cyprus have held
two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks in New York and
Geneva respectively, and the third such talks is expected to take
place in New York in May.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Passes Anti-Iran Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Wednesday voted 420-0 to accept the Senate
version of a bill aimed at strengthening sanctions against Iran,
which claims would punish any other countries, especially Russia,
to transfer weapons technology to Teheran.
</P>
<P>
The bill would add pressure on President Bill Clinton to sign
it into law at a time when the administration was trying to
improve relations with Iran after its parliamentary elections,
which Washington sees a victory for reformists.
</P>
<P>
The White House threatened to veto the bill after the Senate
voted 98-0 the bill on February 24, saying the new measure against
Iran and other countries like Russia was unneeded and only
complicated international nonproliferation efforts.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton vetoed a similar bill approved by Congress
that requires the president to impose sanctions on Russia and
other countries that supply weapons technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has later imposed sanction 10
Russian companies that Washington alleged to have transferred
technology to Teheran. But Congress said it was not enough and
staged a slightly revised bill, which has now been passed by both
the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the 1998 bill, the legislation gives the president the
authority to impose sanctions on companies from Russia and other
countries that supply Iran with weapons material or technology,
but does not require him to do so.
</P>
<P>
It does require him to report to Congress twice a year on
foreign persons or groups identified as offering Iran weapons
materials. The president has the power to prohibit U.S. purchases
from that person or country, or bar the sale of items on the U.S.
Munitions List.

<HEADLINE> Changing Technology Shakes Up Worldwide Fax Services Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Although e-commerce threatens
to replace much of the current ad hoc fax traffic involving
invoices and purchase orders, the use of enhanced fax service as
complements to e-commerce service will boost overall fax service
traffic, a U.S. market research firm reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fax service providers are getting creative and finding ways to
exploit the Internet's infrastructure to drive business and cut
costs, said International Data Corporation (IDC) in a research
report.
</P>
<P>
In fact, IDC said, the fax services industry is in the midst of
change. Although traditional broadcast and production fax services
make up nearly 90 percent of worldwide fax services revenues today,
integration with the Internet, email and unified messaging will
cause revenues from this segment to fall to 55 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Despite a number of factors to infringe on the prosperity of
the overall fax services market, worldwide revenues will climb
from 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 to 3.2 billion dollars in
2003, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
The reason, IDC said, is that as traditional fax services lose
some momentum, the outsourced fax and computer-based fax segment
of the market is picking up the slack. Worldwide revenues will
reach 1.1 billion dollars in 2003, and total pages transmitted
will increase at an annual growth rate of 66.7 percent from 1998
to 2003.
</P>
<P>
The final segment in the fax services market is fax-to-emailbox
and unified messaging services. These solutions involve relaying
non-email messages so they are ultimately accessible through the
user's emailbox. This segment of the market has been jump-started
by a free service model, which has breathed new life into the
market, but may ultimately threaten its existence, according to
IDC.

<HEADLINE> Two Afghan Hijack Passengers Get Asylum in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Two of the 79 passengers on the
hijacked Afghan plane, which landed at a London airport earlier
last month, were on Wednesday granted asylum by Home Secretary
Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to grant refugee status in two cases because I
am satisfied that their applications disclose a well-founded fear
of persecution," Straw said in a written answer in the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
But he signaled a get-tough approach on asylum-seekers when he
rejected 27 others.
</P>
<P>
The home secretary said he was not satisfied that the claimants
had "a well founded fear of persecution" if they returned to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The public interest in deterring future hijacks for the
purposes of claiming asylum is a very strong one and, therefore, I
have decided that they should not be given permission to stay in
this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Straw took personal charge of the cases, and had expressed a
wish to see the passengers from the jet leave the United kingdom "
as soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
However, he was legally obliged to consider each case
individually, and lawyers for the asylum seekers are expected to
appeal against the decisions.
</P>
<P>
But the 27 people and their dependents who are being refused
asylum will not face enforced removal to Afghanistan because of
the current situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 79 passengers, including several families, are being held
at an immigration detention center near London.
</P>
<P>
They were among more than 150 hostages who landed at Stansted
airport, north London, after the Boeing 727 jet was diverted while
on an internal flight in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The other 73 passengers returned to Afghanistan, while another
14 people have been charged with hijacking the plane.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 plane involved in the hijack is due to return to
Kabul on Thursday evening. The plane has been at Stansted since
the drama, but has now been declared air-worthy and the return
flight has been authorized.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, WHO, OAU to Co-fight Against Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, with the collaboration of
the World Health Organization and the Organization of African
Unity, is to launch a 10-year program to combat acute malaria in
the country, Nigerian Minister of Information Dapo Sarumi said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media in the capital Abuja after the weekly
cabinet meeting, Sarumi said that the campaign is intended to
achieve a 30-percent increase in the protection of attacks through
the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and a 10-fold access
to treatment by victims.
</P>
<P>
It would also increase national capacity to protect pregnant
women by 30 percent, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, Sarumi did not provide statistics of deaths from
malaria, which is endemic in the tropics, but adding that the
program would "reduce the high incidents of death".
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 500 million people worldwide suffer
from malaria, among which 90 percent are victims from the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, has reportedly
lost 720 million man-hours annually to malaria.
</P>
<P>
An african summit on roll back malaria is therefore scheduled
to be held in Abuja on april 24-25 this year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Starts Political Settlement Progress in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said Wednesday that the political phase of Russia's
anti-terrorist campaign in the breakaway republic of Chechnya had
started since Russian troops Tuesday liberated the town of Shatoi,
some 60 km south of the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Shatoi, located in the center of the Argun gorge at the
foothills of south Chechen mountains, was the last fortress held
by the rebel remnants after they escaped from Grozny into the
mountains in late February.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Security Council (the top security policy agency of
the country) decided to launch the political progress in Chechnya
at its latest session, said the Russian presidential aide, noting
that the previous military phase "could only be a precondition for
the political resolution to the Chechen issue, which is the most
important goal."
</P>
<P>
The political phase is aimed to restore peaceful life,
administration system and the constitutional order in Chechnya, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There are different ways to solve this problem, but the
problem of restoring the economy, the normal social sphere and
political governance in Chechnya cannot be solved without relying
on those people who command respect among the Chechen population,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Now many dignified and respected Chechen people have been
actively cooperating with the provisional administration and
federal troops on the level of regional and local government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia began its military offensive against the Chechen
separatists in last September after their invasion into
neighboring republic of Dagestan and a series of apartment blasts
in Moscow and other two Russian cities, which claimed over 300
people. After five-month hard and bloody fighting, Russia has
liberated 99 percent of Chechen territories and nearly all
population of the province.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Russian military announced that its full-scale
military operation in Chechnya was over after the federal troops
took full control of the town of Shatoi and it will withdraw most
of its nearly 100,000-soldier combating units out of the province
very soon but keep 25,000 permanent troops there.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise on Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose on the
strength of technology Wednesday amid reports on the surge of
prices for manufacturing supplies and a rise in spending on
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 9.62 at 10,137.93,
expanding its gains in the previous two sessions after falling
below the 10,000 mark last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 87.39 at 4,784.08, surpassing the
record closing high of 4,696.69 set Tuesday and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 12.77 at 1,379.19.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as investors rushed in to buy stocks from
telecommunications and technology companies. Lucent Technology
rose after announcing its plan to spin off the units that sell
corporate phone systems and maker wire cabling for office networks.
</P>
<P>
Other tech companies such as 3Com, Sun Microsystems and SBC
communications were also higher.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm for technology stocks eased investors' concerns
about higher interest rates. New data suggest that the Federal
Reserve would probably raise interest rates again to keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing management reported that
the prices paid for manufacturing supplies rose to a new five-year
high while the Commerce Department said  spending on construction
projects jumped by 2.7 percent in January, the biggest increase in
nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since last June
in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan warned recently that more rate hikes will
be likely if the robust economy and hot stock market will not cool
off quickly.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 6.84 at 599.48 and the American Stock

<HEADLINE> Russia Blasts U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia Wednesday strongly condemned
the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, describing
it as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report's section on Russia blamed Moscow for a "
deteriorating situation" of legal protection in several regions.
It also accused the Russian authorities of human rights violations
during the anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department "used unreliable, specially selected
information about the federal action in Chechnya," the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The accusing tone of the report is unacceptable. It
demonstrates the State Department's bias concerning the legal
situation in Russia," the statement says.
</P>
<P>
The report "keeps quiet about the scale of illegal Chechen
terrorist activity, while calling for the Russian authorities to
implement extraordinary measures to restore constitutional order
and protect Russia's territorial integrity," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. State Department ignored the fact that the anti-
terrorist operation was aimed at restoring human rights and
legality in Chechnya," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the report says nothing about the systematic and
mass human rights violations of tens of thousands of people during
last year's Kosovo war and the bombing of Iraq by the United
States and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"The surprising thing is that the report does not have a
section on the human rights situation in the United States.
According to a lot of non-governmental organizations, it is far
from perfect in the issues of the death penalty, racial
discrimination and anti-Semitism," the statement reads.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Approves Dollarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guzman said it is a far-reaching law and historic milestone in
Ecuador, which will change this country's history.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian Congress approved Tuesday evening project "
Fundamental Law of Economic Transformation" of President Gustavo
Noboa's government, called "Trolley-Bus Law" for dollarizing this
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In this minister's opinion, the law would send a signal of
seriousness to the international community and Ecuadorians "are
capable of helping ourselves in order to afterward receive the
international community's help".
</P>
<P>
The government plans to introduce dollarization on April 1,
when the paying of employees and workers of the public sector will
start and many businesses will adopt prices in dolllars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guzman said the amount of liquid Monetary Reserve will be
enough for the change from sucres to dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the 936 million dollars reserve is enough for the
changing of all bills in circulation.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador declared a moratorium on foreign debt payments last
year as total public foreign debt reached more than 13 billion
dollars, equal to its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
 Dollarization was first proposed on January 9 by President
Jamil Mahuad, who was ousted on January 21. The proposal was taken
up by his vice president Noboa, after he took office on January 22.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said after the approval of the bill, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) will make agreements with
Ecuador. This would allow Ecuador to resume its debt restructuring
talks with private creditors and the Paric Club.

<HEADLINE> Sponeck Says Oil-For-Food Program Inadequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Departing U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator in Iraq, Von Sponeck, said on Wednesday that the U.N.
oil-for-food program in Iraq was inadequate and it failed to meet
minimum requirements of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Sponeck, who will leave the post on
March 31, said in spite of the revenue improvements over the last
years, the humanitarian program was still financially very
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"if you take a calculator, and you take 2.9 billion dollars
which is the net value of the humanitarian program in phase six as
well as for the moment phase seven. You divide that by 23 million
people. Then you get the per capita value of 252 dollars over a 12-
month period. That means 252 dollars is that which is available to
finance a humanitarian program. That put Iraq into the category of
the least developed country," Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
The content of this oil-for-food program, because of the
resources constraints and other reasons, was also inadequate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime victim in this is the education sector, the very
sector which is meant to prepare young people for life. Less than
4 percent of the 2.9 billion dollars has become available to
education," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck said the delay of the arrival of items weakened the
efficiency of the program. "At the end of phase six last November,
you had less than 10 percent arrived what should have arrived
during that phase,"
</P>
<P>
Sponeck quoted a statistic by the United Nations Children's
Fund as saying, 56 children under the age of five died out of
every 1000 children in 1991, and that the number now had risen to
131 children per thousand .
</P>
<P>
He also said that malnutrition was widespread and children were
often forced to go out to earn money.
</P>
<P>
Street children, working children and abandoned children were
in the trend of sharp increase, he told the press.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck, who said he had promised not to say spicing things
before coming to the press conference, described some sad stories
and showed some sad pictures. he said they were not propaganda,
they were what he had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian Coordinator said he had never resigned in his
life and this was the first time, which was a new experience for
him.
</P>
<P>
It is widely seen here that Sponeck resigns to protest the
sanctions against Iraq. On occasions, he has sharply criticized
the U.N. policy saying it had resulted in " a true human tragedy".
He urged to separate the sanctions from the U.N. arms inspection
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck has briefed the U.N. Secretary-General and the Security
Council on the implementation of the program. U.N. chief Kofi
Annan has reiterated that it is up to the Security Council, not
Sponeck or anybody in the Secretariat, to decide the policy on
Iraq. The U.N. chief is apparently unhappy with Sponeck's open
comments.

<HEADLINE> Italy Says Public Accounts in 1999 the Best Since 1961 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy's 1999 budget deficit of 1.9
percent of gross domestic product is the best result under this
heading since 1961, when the ratio was 1.6 percent, and is
especially significant in light of the economic slowdown during
the year, said Istat, the Italian National Statistics Institute
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reporting the surprise performance in curbing the 1999 deficit
by nearly 18 trillion lire (about 9 billion U.S. dollars) under
the '98 figure, to top the most optimistic government forecast of
a 2 percent deficit/GDP ratio, Istat cited the surge in tax
revenues which more than offset worries about the economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
Istat said a revision of the public accounts also disclosed the
excellent trend of the national debt, down from 116.3 percent of
GDP in 1998 to 114.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The institute said reduced interest rates in the euro area led
to savings of 22 trillion lire (about 11 billion U.S. dollars) in
debt servicing in Italy, a figure nearly equal to that of an
entire annual budget of recent years.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the ledger, Istat said GDP grew by 1.4
percent last year, compared to the government's conservative
forecast of 1.3 percent, but dipped from the figure of 1.5 percent
for 1998 which resulted from reviewing the accounting which
produced the earlier figure of 1.3 percent growth in 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Beef Exporters Urge for Granting PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The National Cattlemen's Beef
Association (NCBA) of the United States on Wednesday urged
Congress to grant permanent normal trading relations for China,
citing China's potential in consuming U.S. beef.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. beef industry sees huge potential gains in the China
trade package that was finalized during November 1999," said the
trade association of America's cattle farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement were implemented, tariffs on some major beef
categories would decline from a current rate of 45 percent to 12
percent in 2004. "China has the potential to be in the top three
markets for U.S. beef worth 500 million U.S. dollars if the
agreement is implemented," NCBA said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. beef industry exported 1,114 million tons of beef
products at 3.2 billion dollars in 1999, setting record levels on
a volume basis.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Mexico and South Korea are the top three markets for U.S.
beef exports right now, totaling 832 million tons in 1999 or
almost 75 percent of the U.S. beef exports.
</P>
<P>
U.S. domestic beef demand improved by nearly 4 percent in 1999 -
- the first increase in beef demand in 20 years, according to NCBA.
"To keep that growth, expanding trade beyond U.S. borders will be
vitally important," the association said.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Satisfied With Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said
Wednesday that he was enormously satisfied with the "extraordinary
results" achieved in public finances and economic growth reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato and
Vincenzo Visco, the finance minister, for a study of the data and
report issued Wednesday by Istat, the National Statistics
Institute, D'Alema said the 1999 figures show "significant
improvement, even in the quality of public spending."
</P>
<P>
He noted the decline in current accounts spending and "
significant increase in spending on investments."
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of inflation worries fueled by steep crude
price increases, D'Alema said concern is justified but "the
figures disclosed yesterday show that it's not an Italian issue
which arose out of a government's lack of responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the premier said his government intends to use
the time remaining in the legislature, until spring 2001, to
pursue reforms aimed at strengthening the national economy. "We
have work for us for another year. We want to commit this year to
achieving reforms which will strengthen the economy, provide
stability and improve the country's competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government will continue "reducing taxes"
in light of the brilliant economic picture, he affirmed and
assigned at least a part of the trend to successes in the ongoing
battle against tax evasion and avoidance.
