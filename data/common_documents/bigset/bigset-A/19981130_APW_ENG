Former millionaire found guilty of 28 child sex crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Sydney millionaire Phillip
Harold Bell, a fugitive who fled to Albania, Italy and South
Africa, was found guilty Monday of 28 sex crimes involving young
boys.
	   A New South Wales district court jury also found him innocent of
nine sex offenses.
	   Bell, 64, had denied all charges, which involved five boys in
their early teens during the mid 1980s.
	   He showed little reaction to the verdicts before Judge Thomas
Davidson entered convictions on the 28 offenses and adjourned the
matter for sentencing on Feb. 5.
	   As Bell was about to leave the dock, he turned to the public
gallery and said, ``Homophobia is alive and well and living in
Sydney and you can quote me.''
	   During his trial, Bell denied having any sexual contact with
three of the complainants, but admitted having sex with two, and
with two other witnesses, but at a later time than they said acts
occurred.
	   Bell said his relationship with one of the witnesses began when
the youth was 16, which was illegal in Australia, where the age of
consent is 18 years, but not in Switzerland, where he took the
youth on a visit and where the age of consent is 16.
	   ``In that one specific relationship I was a criminal according
to (Australian) law but a perfectly ordinary gay guy according to
Swiss law,'' Bell said.
	   Bell was arrested last December in South Africa after fleeing
Australia. An international search lasting more than a year found
him running a surfing school at Jeffrey's Bay on South Africa's
southern coast.
	   He had previously been tracked through Italy and Albania.
	   Bell was extradited back to Australia after spending nearly five
months in jail near Port Elizabeth.
	   Last month, chief prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said Bell had preyed
on vulnerable youths for his own sexual gratification, enticing
them with offers of cash for odd jobs and showering them with gifts
and privileges in return for sexual favors.

Woman in Vietnam sentenced for burning husband's penis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A woman has been sentenced to two years in
jail for burning her husband's penis because she suspected him of
having a mistress, a local court official said Monday.
	   Nguyen Thi Thu Lan, 40, was convicted during a one-day trial
Nov. 12.
	   The incident took place in April in the central coastal province
of Binh Thuan. Lan, using cotton soaked with gasoline, burned her
husband after he came home drunk, the official said.
	   Her husband suffered 56 percent burns on his private parts and
has paid some 20 million dong (dlrs 1,500) for medical treatment, a
huge amount in a country where the annual per capita income is only
about dlrs 340.

Quebec's pro-independence government bids for re-election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls open at 1500 GMT and close at 0100 GMT Tuesday &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's pro-independence government sought
re-election Monday, hoping for a decisive victory that could
accelerate the drive for secession from Canada.
	   If the Parti Quebecois returns to power, Premier Lucien Bouchard
has pledged to hold a referendum on secession whenever he judges
conditions right for a separatist victory.
	   Most polls in the final stages of the campaign forecast a
comfortable victory for Bouchard's party, which now holds 74 of the
provincial legislature's 125 seats.
	   His main opponent was Jean Charest of the anti-separatist Quebec
Liberal Party, which holds 45 seats and would need to gain 18 to
eke out a slim legislative majority.
	   Charest insisted he still had a chance of victory. But he spent
the campaign's final days trying to solidify support in Liberal
districts, while Bouchard ventured into anti-separatist territory
in a bid for a landslide win.
	   Critics said Charest, who left federal politics in March to
enter the race, failed to convince the bulk of Quebec's
French-speaking majority that he was the best choice to defend
their interests.
	   At his last campaign stop, in a Montreal district, Charest
insisted he was proud to be both a Quebecker and Canadian.
	   ``I love Quebec dearly, and I love its people, and I love
Canada, and I'm determined to make this place work,'' he said.
	   A decisive separatist victory could intensify the push for a
referendum on secession, while a narrow win might prompt a more
cautious approach. A surprise loss to Charest's Liberals would
derail the separatist cause for years.
	   Twice before, separatists lost secession referendums, by a big
margin in 1980 and narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, not wanting a third defeat, plans to call another
referendum only when convinced the separatists would win. In the
meantime, he says he would press for more autonomy for all 10
provinces, particularly in regard to control over social programs.
	   He expressed hope that anti-separatist animosity in the rest of
Canada would subside after the election, even if his party won.
	   ``If I was the person who is described in English Canada I would
be the first to detest myself _ a dangerous man, negative,
ungrateful,'' he said.
	   ``Afterwards, things should become more normal, and we will be
able to resume a healthier dialogue.''
	   Charest said voters should be wary of Bouchard's promise to
cooperate with other provinces.
	   ``If someone chooses to vote for the Parti Quebecois they're
giving a mandate to the government of Quebec to enter into a new
period of confrontation and conflict with the rest of the
country,'' Charest said.
	   The final round of polls showed support for the Parti Quebecois
at about 47 percent and the Liberals at about 41 percent, with most
other voters backing a third party, Democratic Action, led by
28-year-old Mario Dumont, which favors greater autonomy for Quebec
but stops short of supporting outright secession.
	   But many Quebeckers support Bouchard even though they do not
favor secession. Several polls have suggested that two-thirds of
the voters do not want a referendum on independence during the next
government's five-year term in office.
	   About 5.2 million Quebeckers were eligible to vote. Turnout in
the province usually is high; it was 93.5 percent for the 1995
referendum. Polls were to open at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) and close
at 8 p.m. EST (0100 GMT Tuesday).
	   Though the secession debate dominated coverage of the election
in the rest of Canada, many French-speaking Quebeckers saw the
campaign as a simple choice of a day-to-day government, with the
issue of another referendum to be settled at a later date.
	   ``The time wasn't right for deep existential debates,'' said the
Montreal daily Le Devoir in an editorial. ``Lucien Bouchard
understood that and reduced the election to its most essential
element, that of confidence.''
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived non-francophone
immigrants from various countries.
	   Quebeckers favoring independence have various motivations _
basically, they feel different culturally from the rest of Canada
and would like to call their own shots and have their own national
symbols. There are many francophones who do not want independence,
and there are a few non-francophones who do.

Australia's trade slides heavily into the red as Asian crisis hits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Clarifies last graf, restores dropped word `demand.' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Strong domestic growth and the Asian
economic crisis combined Monday to produce one of the worst set of
monthly trade figures Australia has ever seen.
	   The government statistician reported that the nation slipped 1.1
billion Australian dollars (U.S. 696 million) into the red on its
goods and services trade account in October, the worse figure since
August 1989.
	   There was also a huge extraordinary item in the latest figures
--Australia has been importing, melting down and re-exporting vast
amounts of gold from Asian countries this year.
	   That trade has surged as hard-pressed Asians began cashing in
their savings, often held in the form of gold jewelry.
	   Once that is taken into account, Australia's trade performance
in October was probably the worst on record.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello said the latest data confirmed his
prediction that the nation's current account deficit will blow out
to 31 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 19.6 billion) this
financial year.
	   That would be 5.25 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product.
	   The Australian economy grew by 3.9 percent in the 12 months to
the end of June.
	   Costello said the figures had also been affected by low
commodity prices and the loss of Australian markets in Asia, as a
result of the region's economic woes.
	   Australia has offset its losses in Asia by increasing its export
sales to the United States and Europe.
	   But the nation has also been facing some big import bills in
recent months as high domestic demand produced big orders for a
wide range of consumer goods.

Inquiry called after woman lost, man saved in yacht rescue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hometown of rescued yacht captain not released &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Authorities launched an inquiry
Monday into the presumed death of a woman who fell from a yacht
during a rescue in rough seas off New Zealand's north island.
	   The New Zealand Maritime Safety Authority will examine reports a
container ship which helped in the rescue crushed the stricken
yacht's hull, sinking the boat during the operation.
	   The woman is missing and presumed drowned after she fell from a
life-ring while being hauled from the deck of the dismasted yacht
Salacia off Cape Brett, 403 miles (650 kms) north of Wellington,
just before dawn Sunday morning.
	   Rescue teams from the container ship Direct Kookaburra plucked
the yacht's captain, American Michael Fritz, to safety up the side
of the ship using a life-ring.
	   The woman had also been thrown a life-ring, but had panicked and
fallen out, falling either back into the yacht or into the sea,
Emma Peel, spokeswoman for the National Rescue Coordination Center,
said.
	   The woman's name and nationality have been withheld until next
of kin are informed, she said.
	   Local newspapers reported Monday that the French skipper of the
20,000 (metric) ton ship feared he had crushed the yacht.
	   An air search for the missing woman and the yacht was called off
Monday and would not be resumed unless new information came to
light, Peel said.
	   Some debris was spotted from the Salacia, including some decking
and some cushions, but no further wreckage was found.
	   The authority said it expected the inquiry would take some weeks
to complete.
	   The Direct Kookaburra was sent to the area off the Northland
Coast by the rescue center.
	   ``Two aircraft (Sunday) searched for more than five hours with
no sign of the missing woman,'' Peel said.
	   ``They were both thrown life-rings on lines ... but the woman
seems to have slipped out of her life-ring,'' she said. ``She was
suffering from hypothermia and panic.''
	   Appalling weather conditions, including winds gusting up to 80
mph (130 kph) and 30-foot (9 meter) swells, hampered the rescue
effort.
	   The two people on the yacht had earlier sent out a distress
call, telling rescuers they were cold and wet and wanted to get off
the 36-foot (11 meter) sloop.

Former Philippines president visits South Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Former Philippines president Fidel
Ramos will have talks with South Australian state Premier John
Olsen during his official visit to Australia.
	   Olsen, who hosts a gala dinner for Ramos on Monday night, said
they would meet again Tuesday.
	   Ramos' visit to South Australia follows an invitation from the
premier when they met in Manila last year.
	   ``The Philippines is an important trading partner for the state
and there are many opportunities in a range of industry sectors
which the government is exploring,'' Olsen said.
	   ``Ramos' visit will have an extensive business focus with
discussions concentrating on the status of the Philippine economy
and bilateral trade opportunities between the state and the
Philippines.
	   ``The government is currently working on projects related to the
pig meat industry, wine industry and education,'' he said.
	   Olsen said he would discuss further opportunities with Ramos.
	   While in the state, Ramos will address the Australia-Philippines
Business Council and participate in the Australian Open Golf ProAm.
	   On Sunday, human rights activists condemned a plan by the
University of Sydney to award Ramos an honorary doctorate of laws.
	   The Philippines Australia Union Link accused Ramos of human
rights abuses while martial law administrator and later armed
forces chief of staff under President Ferdinand Marcos.
	   The protesters gathered outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney on
Sunday night while inside, Ramos was the guest of honor at the
Philippines Community Council awards.
	   The group also said in a statement that as President, Ramos'
economic reforms destroyed the trade union movement and fixed
minimum wages as below poverty levels, while promoting the
slave-like export of Filipino workers as contract labor.
	   But the business manager for Sydney University's Research
Institute for Asia and the Pacific, Phillippa Adams, said that as
president, Ramos played an important leadership role in the
Asia-Pacific region.
	   ``He's placed the Philippines in a position among the ASEAN
nations as a country of economic and social stability at a time of
political and economic turmoil,'' Adams said.
	   ``Reforms that he instituted have allowed the Philippines to
weather the storm.''
	   She said Ramos' human rights record had to be taken in context.
	   ``I think that during the six-year term of his office, he
managed to bring the vast majority of his country with him in
implementing the reforms that he articulated. He was also very
successful in healing the wounds of previous regimes in human
rights,'' Adams said.
	   Ramos will receive the honorary doctorate in a ceremony at the
University of Sydney on Thursday.

Anwar's defense lawyer jailed for contempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chaos rocked the sensational
corruption and sex trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Monday when one of his defense attorneys was sentenced
to three months imprisonment for contempt of court.
	   Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer in Anwar's defense team, was
ordered to surrender himself to the police by 4 p.m. (0800 GMT).
	   Anwar, prevented by police from talking to his attorneys in the
courtroom, angrily shouted to reporters that he could no longer get
a fair trial.
	   ``I can't even discuss this with my lawyers now,'' Anwar said.
``Where is justice?''
	   The uproar was sparked by an affidavit filed by Anwar in the
High Court on Saturday. In it, he accused two prosecutors of trying
to cajole a potential witness into fabricating evidence of sex
crimes by Anwar.
	   Anwar asked the court to remove senior government prosecutors
Abdul Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed from the corruption and sexual
misconduct trial.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing
and beating while in custody has led to international interest in
the case and support for his fledgling political reform movement.
	   His trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   Anwar denies the charges, calling them part of a political
vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   In the affidavit, Anwar said the two prosecutors had tried to
negotiate a plea bargain with his former tennis partner,
Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
	   Nalla, as he is known, was indicted shortly before Anwar's
arrest and charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live
ammunition. He faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted.
	   The bullets were said to have been found in Nalla's house during
a police investigation of allegations published in the book,
``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while Anwar was still in power.
	   Anwar said Abdul Gani and Azahar indicated that they would try
Nalla under a lesser charge if he was prepared to lie about how
Anwar committed sexual offenses with ``various married and
unmarried women.''
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul on Monday refused to listen to
defense attorneys' arguments on the affidavit, saying there was
nothing to support the allegations made against the two attorneys.
	   Instead, he ordered defense attorney Zainur Zakaria, who
submitted the affidavit, to apologize to Attorney General Mohtar
Abdullah. The attorney general, who does not normally attend the
trial, was in court Monday and asked to speak.
	   ``What has been done by Zainur Zakaria undermines the integrity
of the trial,'' Mohtar told the court, recommending an immediate
contempt hearing.
	   There was then an angry exchange between the judge and Anwar's
leading defense attorney Raja Aziz Addruse.
	   When Raja Aziz objected to Paul demanding an apology, the judge
ordered him to sit down.
	   ``I will only do so if you record my objections,'' Raja Aziz
said, adding that the defense should have been allowed to present a
case for the allegations.
	   ``We should have been heard before your Lordship came to the
conclusion already that the allegations are scandalous,'' Raja Aziz
said.
	   Defense attorney Zainur then refused to apologize.
	   ``I have come to a decision that I am unable to tender my
apologies,'' he told the court.
	   ``OK, fair enough,'' Paul said.
	   The judge rejected the defense request that it be given three
days to prepare for the contempt hearing and ordered the hearing to
be held after the lunch break.
	   He also refused to consider a bail application on behalf of
Zainur.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet has told his family that he
would rather die than stand trial in Spain on charges of genocide
and torture, a British tabloid reported in Monday's editions.
	   Meanwhile, many remain skeptical about Chilean claims that the
former dictator might be tried at home if Britain frees him.
	   ``He would rather kill himself or be killed by his guards than
face the humiliation and indignity of being sent to face trial in
Spain,'' Pinochet's nephew Rafael Pinochet Savedra was quoted as
saying in Monday editions of the tabloid, The Mirror.
	   The general's wife, Lucia, told the tabloid that Pinochet was
``very weak and depressed about his position.''
	   Pinochet, 83, who is sought by Spanish authorities for crimes
allegedly committed by his secret police during his 17-year-rule,
remains under police guard at a London hospital, where he is
recovering from back surgery. He was arrested by British police on
Oct. 16, and Britain's highest court of appeal ruled Wednesday that
Pinochet could not claim immunity from prosecution as a former head
of state.
	   Pinochet was reported in British papers to be planning a move
this week to a nine-bedroom home on the private Wentworth estate in
Surrey, southwest of London. He is due in court on Dec. 11 _ the
date set for Home Secretary Jack Straw to decide whether to permit
extradition proceedings to begin or to release the general to
return home.
	   Chilean officials have stepped up their lobbying campaign to
have Pinochet released to face justice in his own country. Chilean
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, who is currently in London,
was expected to meet with Defense Secretary George Robertson on
Monday, before flying to Spain.
	   Fourteen lawsuits brought by families of those disappeared or
tortured during Pinochet's reign are pending in Chile. But despite
government efforts to highlight these, chances of trying Pinochet
remain doubtful, experts said.
	   Earlier this month, the supreme court turned down a government
request to name a more senior judge to handle the cases.
	   And, Pinochet granted himself immunity while in power, and also
has immunity as a senator-for-life. An all-party parliamentary
committee of 150 British lawmakers, mostly from Straw's own Labor
Party, issued a statement to the home secretary calling a Chilean
trial for Pinochet unlikely, The Independent newspaper reported in
Monday's editions.
	   ``Claims have been made that General Pinochet would face
prosecution if he were allowed to return to Chile,'' the newspaper
quoted from the lawmakers' statement. ``These cases stand no chance
of success given the constitutional blocks provided by the amnesty
laws.''
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's
dictatorship, which began in 1973 when he overthrew President
Salvador Allende. Allende died in the coup.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A runaway steer charged at its
pursuers and frustrated attempts to capture it for hours even after
it was cornered in cricket nets Monday.
	   The steer was first spotted on a sports field shortly before
8:30 a.m. when a passersby reported that it was charging about.
	   Then it charged at police and animal control officers trying to
round it up.
	   About 10 a.m. they boxed it into a cricket practice backstop box
with wire netting and brought in a truck to carry the animal away.
	   But the steer was in no mood to submit and it was still loose in
the cricket net shortly before midday while an animal control
officer was called to tranquilize it.
	   A police spokeswoman said they had no idea where the steer came
from.
	   No one was injured.

North Korea denounces South Korea's invitation to Japan's emperor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea denounced South Korea on Monday for
inviting Japan's Emperor Akihito to visit Seoul in the year 2000.
	   A broadcast on Korean Central Radio called South Korean Prime
Minister Kim Jong-pil, who reportedly made the invitation on
Saturday, ``a pro-Japan traitor.''
	   The report was monitored in Tokyo by the Radiopress agency.
	   Kim reportedly offered the invitation at a meeting over the
weekend of Cabinet ministers from both nations in the southern
Japanese city of Kagoshima. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi also
attended.
	   ``Our people will never forgive such a criminal act by the
traitor of currying favor more and more with the 100-year-old enemy
of Japanese aggressive forces,'' the radio report said.
	   Last month, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung expressed hope
that Emperor Akihito could visit South Korea before the two
countries co-host the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament.
	   Making his first visit to Tokyo after taking office, Kim told
Japanese officials it was ``unnatural'' that a Japanese emperor has
not visited South Korea, considering the countries are neighbors
and have had diplomatic relations for 33 years.
	   Japan colonized the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and
memories of its 35 years of brutal rule remain vivid among many
Koreans.
	   During Kim's visit to Japan last month, Japan offered its
clearest apology yet for its colonial rule of the peninsula. The
wording of the apology was negotiated between the two sides and
printed in an official document.
	   Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic relations.

Warne does it tough on comeback trail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Shane Warne's bid to return to the
Australian cricket side for his hometown test against England on
Dec. 26 is in doubt after being knocked badly by South Australia's
Darren Lehmann on the weekend.
	   Warne, playing just his second first-class game since a shoulder
operation, went for nearly five runs an over against South
Australia in returning match figures of 4-185 off just 37.4 overs
as Warne's Victorian side slumped to a seven-wicket defeat.
	   Warne suffered at the hands of Lehmann, who scored 171 and 78
not out at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in his first outing since
his surprise dumping from the Australian side.
	   Victorian cricket manager Shaun Graf said Monday that Warne
still had ``a little way to go'' before he could contemplate a
return to the test arena.
	   ``Subconsciously Shane has set himself for Boxing Day (the
fourth Ashes test) and the Australian selectors, even though they
haven't said anything, probably have as well, but I think the next
month will tell whether that's possible.''
	   ``We've got two Shield (domestic) games plus a game against
England before that and if you see Shane back taking wickets then
you will know he is ready.'' (djp)

Former millionaire found guilty of 28 child sex crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Sydney millionaire Phillip
Harold Bell, a fugitive who fled to Albania, Italy and South
Africa, was found guilty Monday of 28 sex crimes involving young
boys.
	   A New South Wales district court jury also found him innocent of
nine sex offenses.
	   Bell, 64, had denied all charges, which involved five boys in
their early teens during the mid 1980s.
	   He showed little reaction to the verdicts before Judge Thomas
Davidson entered convictions on the 28 offenses and adjourned the
matter for sentencing on Feb. 5.
	   As Bell was about to leave the dock, he turned to the public
gallery and said, ``Homophobia is alive and well and living in
Sydney and you can quote me.''
	   During his trial, Bell denied having any sexual contact with
three of the complainants, but admitted having sex with two, and
with two other witnesses, but at a later time than they said acts
occurred.
	   Bell said his relationship with one of the witnesses began when
the youth was 16, which was illegal in Australia, where the age of
consent is 18 years, but not in Switzerland, where he took the
youth on a visit and where the age of consent is 16.
	   ``In that one specific relationship I was a criminal according
to (Australian) law but a perfectly ordinary gay guy according to
Swiss law,'' Bell said.
	   Bell was arrested last December in South Africa after fleeing
Australia. An international search lasting more than a year found
him running a surfing school at Jeffrey's Bay on South Africa's
southern coast.
	   He had previously been tracked through Italy and Albania.
	   Bell was extradited back to Australia after spending nearly five
months in jail near Port Elizabeth.
	   Last month, chief prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said Bell had preyed
on vulnerable youths for his own sexual gratification, enticing
them with offers of cash for odd jobs and showering them with gifts
and privileges in return for sexual favors.

Hun Sen to strive for U.N., ASEAN seats as new government formed
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Four months after grabbing a narrow
victory in disputed elections, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
gained parliament's approval Monday for a new government he
promised would carry out much-needed reforms.
	   With armed police and bodyguards maintaining tight security
around parliament, Hun Sen and his coalition Cabinet were approved
99-13 by the 122-seat National Assembly. Three lawmakers abstained,
six were absent and one vote was declared invalid.
	   Hun Sen told reporters that reclaiming Cambodia' seat at the
United Nations and gaining entry to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations would be among his first initiatives.
	   Cambodia's international standing plummeted after Hun Sen
deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
bloody coup last year. The formation of a new government following
elections should restore international legitimacy.
	   ``I hope the U.N. will keep its promise to give back Cambodia's
seat and ASEAN will admit Cambodia as a member after a government
is fully formed,'' Hun Sen said.
	   ASEAN members are reportedly divided on Cambodia's prospects for
entry at the group's annual meeting next month in Hanoi. Vietnam,
which is close to Hun Sen, strongly supports quick entry while the
Philippines and Singapore have indicated they hope to see signs of
stability first.
	   Ten ministers have retained their posts in the new
administration, but Hun Sen promised his team would implement
sweeping changes to put the struggling country on a path to
prosperity.
	   ``I must respond to the expectations of you and the people, who
want to see a new government function better and be stronger and
more effective than before,'' Hun Sen told the assembly before the
vote.
	   Anti-corruption measures, judicial independence, economic
reforms, a streamlined civil service, protection of the environment
and respect for human rights were all promised.
	   The statement read like a laundry list of concerns voiced by
foreign donors and investors, whose generosity is vital for the
desperately poor nation to function.
	   ``The royal government will change the priorities in the use of
the national budget to serve areas that support production and
areas that that are favorable for private investment, social
affairs and public health,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, said
his party supported the reform proposals but rejected the selection
of many ministers from the last government as ``a recipe for
disaster.''
	   After last year's coup, the prince and most of his ministers
fled Cambodia and did not return until a few months before the
elections.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won, but a political crisis
followed when parties led by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy alleged fraud
and violence and denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament
necessary to approve a government.
	   Ranariddh, bowing to what he described as intense international
pressure, broke the stalemate Nov. 13 with a coalition deal that
made the prince president of the National Assembly and gave his
party nearly half the positions in the Cabinet.
	   Hun Sen's party, however, has retained tight control of fiscal
and administrative functions, heading the ministries of finance,
commerce, foreign affairs, planning, industry and agriculture.

Australia's trade slides heavily into the red on Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Restores dropped letter in 1st graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Strong domestic growth and the Asian
economic crisis combined Monday to produce one of the worst sets of
monthly trade figures Australia has ever seen.
	   The government statistician reported that the nation slipped 1.1
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 696 million) into the red on
its goods and services trade account in October, the worst figure
since August 1989.
	   There was also a huge extraordinary item in the latest figures _
Australia has been importing, melting down and re-exporting vast
amounts of gold from Asian countries this year.
	   That trade has surged as hard-pressed Asians began cashing in
their savings, often held in the form of gold jewelry.
	   Once that is taken into account, Australia's trade performance
in October was probably the worst on record.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello said the latest data confirmed his
prediction that the nation's current account deficit will blow out
to 31 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 19.6 billion) this
financial year.
	   That would be 5.25 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product.
	   The Australian economy grew by 3.9 percent in the 12 months to
the end of June.
	   Costello said the figures had also been affected by low
commodity prices and the loss of Australian markets in Asia as a
result of the region's economic woes.
	   Australia has offset its losses in Asia by increasing its export
sales to the United States and Europe.
	   But the nation has also been facing some big import bills in
recent months as high domestic demand produced big orders for a
wide range of consumer goods.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Monday
appointed as Supreme Court chief justice a former legislator who
sought congressional probes of corruption and human rights
violations during the rule of dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Hilario Davide Jr. replaced Andres Narvasa, who retired the same
day.
	   ``He has the best track record,'' Estrada told reporters after
announcing Davide's appointment.
	   Davide, 63, said he will try to make the court an effective
instrument in fairly administering justice.
	   Davide was a member of the national congressional assembly under
Marcos and filed several bills that sought to end martial law rule
imposed by Marcos in 1972.
	   He also was chairman of the Commission on Elections from 1988 to
1990, and a member of the commissions that drafted the 1973 and the
1987 constitutions.
	   Under former President Corazon Aquino, who took power after
Marcos was overthrown by a 1986 ``people power'' revolt, Davide
headed a commission that investigated army officers and politicians
suspected of involvement in several coup attempts.
	   Marcos is accused of stealing billions of dollars during his
20-year rule. He died in exile in Hawaii three years after being
ousted.

China's basketball players confident of Asian Games gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Barring unforeseen problems, China's basketball
players reckon they've got another Asian Games gold in the bag.
	   Towering members of the national men's team said Monday they
viewed South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan as their
major adversaries at the games that open Sunday.
	   ``We should get the gold because the Chinese team is strong,''
Wang Zhizhi, a 2.12-meter- (7-foot-) tall center on the squad, said
in an interview.
	   Veteran team member Hu Weidong said the team was fitter and more
experienced than the one that won gold at the last Asian Games in
Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. The Chinese defeated South Korea 100-72
in the final for their third consecutive men's basketball gold.
	   ``If the squad plays to its normal level at the Asian Games I
think we will be champions,'' added Kuang Lubin, the national men's
team leader.
	   Kuang said victory at the games would boost the team's
confidence for next year's Asian championships that is a qualifying
tournament for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
	   Wang, the 21-year-old center for the Bayi Rockets in China's
basketball league, said the national team has been practicing
together for nine months.
	   ``Training has been intensive and quite tough, all in order to
get the gold at the Asian Games,'' he said.

Report: Ex-Suharto warns government against court action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A legal adviser to former President
Suharto has warned that Indonesia's current government could be
threatened if the former autocrat is made to face court charges for
corruption, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   ``If Suharto does go to court, it could drag down the
government, bringing senior incumbent and former officials _ as
well as all the cronies suspected of accruing ill-gotten wealth _
into messy litigation,'' The Jakarta Post quoted Yohanes Yacob as
saying.
	   Suharto, 77, who had ruled the would's fourth most populous
country with an iron hand since 1966, resigned in May amid
widespread student protests and riots that claimed about 1,200
lives.
	   Critics have since accused him of siphoning off state wealth to
benefit his family's massive business empires.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Some opponents claim it is many times that.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that he will
cooperate with any investigation into his affairs.
	   Students have been staging almost daily protests demanding
Suharto be tried. Police and soldiers heavily guard his residence
in an affluent neighborhood, and have blocked protesters from
marching there several times recently.
	   A special government assembly two weeks ago issued a decree that
demanded Suharto be included in a wide-ranging probe into past
corruption.
	   Suharto's successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie,
has ordered that a new inquiry be set up into the ex-leader's
wealth.
	   Details of the inquiry are expected to be announced soon.
	   An earlier investigation by Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib
failed to find any evidence against Suharto. Many rejected it as a
whitewash.
	   Also on Monday The Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted a former
Suharto Cabinet minister as doubting the new probe would uncover
much.
	   Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, an ex-environment minister who is now a
vocal government critic, questioned the resolve of officials to
investigate corruption under Suharto properly.
	   He said many members of the government had ties with Suharto.
	   ``How could these people possibly carry out an investigation? Be
realistic,'' Sarwono was quoted as saying.
	   ``It cannot be denied that there is a special link between the
leadership of President Habibie and his predecessor,'' he said.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend and former loyal subordinate of
Suharto.
	   He has repeatedly said that while his old boss should be
investigated, any inquiry must be conducted in accordance with
Indonesian law and be based on the presumption of innocence.

Tokyo stocks close lower, dollar higher at mid-afternoon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks closed lower Monday as investors
awaited more signs of economic recovery and details on the ruling
party's alliance with an opposition party. The U.S. dollar rose
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 185.69 points,
or 1.23 percent, ending the day at 14,883.70. On Friday, the Nikkei
closed down 138.38 points, or 0.91 percent.
	   The dollar bought 123.72 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.86
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of
123.07 yen late Friday.
	   Share prices declined as investors took to the sidelines to
await clarification on economic policies resulting from the
coalition between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the
Liberal Party.
	   ``Both foreign and domestic investors will be watching how
government policy develops,'' said Kenji Karikomi, general manager
of the equities department at Daiwa Securities.
	   The alliance has generated expectations for more economic
stimulus measures because the Liberals have pushed for a reduction
in Japan's unpopular consumption tax.
	   Experts say the government's raising of the sales tax rate to 5
percent from 3 percent last year was a leading factor in triggering
Japan's recession.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 14.85 points, or 1.28 percent, to 1,143.50.
The TOPIX closed down 6.24 points, or 0.54 percent Friday.
	   In currency trading, the dollar advanced as Japanese importers
bought the currency against the yen to settle end-of-month
accounts. Japanese investors also bought dollars ahead of Tuesday,
when Japanese banks and life insurers will be allowed to sell
mutual funds as part of the nation's deregulation measures.
	   Currently, only brokers are allowed to sell them.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.040 percent from its Friday finish of 1.075 percent,
driving up its price to 106.59 yen from 106.27 yen on Friday.

 &UR; Zimbabwe thrashes Pakistan by seven wickets in first Test &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwe tasted its maiden Test
victory abroad when it defeated Pakistan by seven wickets in the
first Test of the three-match series Monday.
	   The visitors, needing just 92 runs to win, achieved it in mere
101 minutes on the fourth day with Murray Goodwin hitting an
attractive unbeaten 73 which included 13 forceful boundaries.
	   Andy Flower remained undefeated on 17 and hammered leg-spinner
Mushtaq Ahmed for a big six over mid-wicket before bringing in
victory with a ferocious square cut off Aaqib Javed to point
boundary.
	   Pakistan, which got a vital 58-run first innings lead Sunday
after dismissing Zimbabwe for 238, was run out for 103 in the
second innings in less than three hours. This left Zimbabwe a
target of 162 in more than two days.
	   After resuming at the overnight total of 70 for one Zimbabwe
batsmen scored at a rapid pace with Goodwin leading the run-charge
and playing some exquisite drives on either sides of the wicket.
	   Wasim Akram, the left-arm paceman, playing in his 82nd Test
match got both wickets to finish with a match bag of eight for 99.
He raise his Test match wickets to 354 _ one short of Australian
Dennis Lillee's 355-mark.
	   Akram had Grant Flower (31) caught by wicketkeeper Moin Khan.
Flower put on 81 runs for the second wicket with Goodwin in 114
minutes and hit five fours.
	   A sloppy Pakistan fielding continued on the fourth morning when
Flower was dropped by Azhar Mahmood in second slip off Waqar
Younis. It raised the tally of dropped catches by the Pakistani
fielders to five in the match.
	   Captain Alistair Campbell (12) scored all his run in boundaries
which included two off Younis before he failed to keep Akram's
vicious bouncer down and spooned the ball to waiting Ijaz Ahmed in
gully.
	   Zimbabwe had lost 10 out of 14 Test matches played abroad before
Monday's victory. It was overall its third Test win in 32 matches
and second against Pakistan.
	   Zimbabwe had won two Tests at home _ both at Harare. It defeated
India by 61 runs last month and had earlier beaten Pakistan by
innings and 64 runs in 1994-95 season.

Australia takes a 1-0 lead with a seven-wicket win

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A remarkable spell of fast bowling by
comeback kid Jason Gillespie spearheaded Australia to a
comprehensive seven-wicket win in under three days in the second
cricket test at the WACA on Monday.
	   Australia, set to make 64 runs to win, had a three-wicket
setback a half hour before tea, but emerged to take a 1-0 lead in
the five-test series after the Brisbane test ended in a thundery,
rainy draw.
	   The Waugh twins _ Steve and Mark _ took Australia from 36 for
three to 64 for three, remaining unbeaten on 15 and 17
respectively.
	   Resuming the day on 126 for five, still two short of making
Australia bat again, England was bowled out for 191 just 10 minutes
before the lunch break.
	   After bowling out England for 112, Australia scored 240 to take
a 128-run lead.
	   Gillespie, playing his first test in 15 months since the 1997
Ashes series, dismissed four English batsmen in the space of six
balls.
	   Gillespie, 23, was forced to return home after the test in Trent
Bridge and missed 12 tests with a stress fracture in his lower
back. He was the 12th man in Brisbane.
	   The three-day finish is the second in three Ashes contests
following England's 19-run win at the Oval in the last test in
1997.
	   Australia's push for victory on the second day was stalled by a
spirited 91-run sixth-wicket stand between Mark Ramprakash and
Graeme Hick after coming together at 67 for five just after tea.
	   Hick, in his seventh-test comeback, pummeled the Australians for
68 off 73 balls with eight fours and two sixes.
	   Once Gillespie accounted for Hick with his second ball of the
day _ caught by Ricky Ponting at third slip _ the rest capitulated,
leaving Ramprakash high and dry on an unbeaten 47.
	   It was another all-too-familiar England collapse, its fourth in
as many innings in the two tests.
	   England, having recovered from 67 for five to 158 with a further
fall, lost the last five wickets for 33 runs in 11.2 overs to
Gillespie.
	   Gillespie, who was hit for 69 in his nine overs on the second
day, including 23 in one, took 5-15 in 35 balls after replacing
fellow fast bowler Glenn McGrath at the Lillee-Marsh stand end.
	   In the first innings England was shot out for 112, losing the
last five wickets for 38 runs.
	   In the first test in Brisbane, England collapsed from 315 for
five to be bowled out for 375 in the first innings. It was saved by
tropical thunderstorms after being set 348 to win, with England
facing defeat at 179 for six.
	   In a spell that matched England's rookie paceman Alex Tudor for
pace, Gillespie blew away the England tail in 65 minutes.
	   Gillespie stole the limelight from swing bowler Damien Fleming,
the chief destroyer with a nine-wicket match haul.
	   Man-of-the-match Fleming, who took a career-best 5-46 in the
first innings, finished with 4-45 in 19 overs for a tally of 9-91
in his eighth test.
	   On Hick's departure, Ramprakash and Dominic Cork added a further
31 runs to guide England close to the lunch break until Gillespie
struck for the second time.
	   Cork, who had shrugged off a blow to the head from Fleming early
in his innings, was trapped leg before wicket and Alex Tudor lasted
just two balls before edging to wicketkeeper Ian Healy.
	   Darren Gough fell next ball, trapped LBW, and Gillespie was on a
hat-trick in his next over.
	   Ramprakash denied Gillespie the hat-trick but took a single, and
in doing so exposed Mullally, who was bowled on a slow full toss to
end the English innings.
	   The third test begins Dec. 11 in Adelaide. (ik/djp)

Report: Smugglers evading Chinese crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Chinese chemical companies want the
government to intensify a five-month-old crackdown on smuggling,
complaining that they are being undercut by growing illegal
imports, state media said Monday.
	   China has been reporting success in the crackdown launched in
July to enforce import quotas and high tariffs that shield its
industries from foreign competition.
	   But since October, ``there has been a resurgence in smuggling,
and that has caused prices for raw chemical fibers to tumble
sharply,'' said the Shenzhen Securities Times, citing a complaint
by 17 of China's biggest chemical companies.
	   The companies appealed to regulators to step up anti-smuggling
efforts.
	   Illegal imports of food, consumer goods and other items have
forced down Chinese market prices. Imports surged after the Asian
financial crisis drove down currencies in neighboring countries,
making their exports cheaper.
	   The value of the Chinese currency, the yuan, has held steady,
making it harder for Chinese producers to compete.
	   As part of the crackdown, the government has acknowledged that
the military is a sponsor of smuggling and ordered it stopped. The
military also has been ordered to dismantle its vast business
empire, which ranges from gas stations and mobile phone networks to
nightclubs.
	   The complaint by chemical companies said the smuggling crackdown
had pushed up prices for polyester by some 30 percent, the Shenzhen
Securities Times said.
	   But a surge in smuggling last month forced prices back down to
near their all-time low, said the newspaper, published in the
southern financial center of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.

Newsweek: Lee Kuan Yew criticizes Al Gore for rudeness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew has
lashed out again at Al Gore, accusing the U.S. Vice President of
calculated rudeness towards Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Newsweek magazine reported.
	   Gore was ``ostentatiously rude'' to Mahathir during the recent
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur, said Lee
in the Dec. 7 edition of the magazine, which hit newsstands Monday.
	   During a dinner speech attended by Mahathir, Gore praised
Malaysian supporters of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim
and his political reform movement. Anwar, who was beaten during his
detention, is currently on trial for abuse of power and sexual
misconduct.
	   Following the controversial address, Gore left the room after
hastily shaking hands with Mahathir.
	   ``Walking out before dinner and shaking hands in a stiff manner
were designed to offend,'' Lee told the magazine. ``Gore didn't
spit Mahathir in the face, but he came pretty close.''
	   In a radio interview last week, Lee joined a chorus of criticism
from other Asian leaders over Gore's remarks and behavior at the
Malaysian summit. He argued that if Gore had at least stayed for
dinner, ``maybe it would have been seen in perspective.''
	   Senior Minister Lee, who was prime minister for 31 years, still
wields enormous influence in Singapore and the region. The
city-state of 3.1 million people is an important regional ally of
the United States.

Pavin predicts no easy win for American side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Former U.S. Ryder Cup standout Corey
Pavin doubts the Presidents Cup battle at Royal Melbourne will be
the walkover for Jack Nicklaus's Americans that some are
predicting.
	   And Pavin believes the golf clashes between the Unites States'
best and the Internationals could eventually rival the popularity
of the 71-year-old Ryder Cup duels between the United States and
Europe.
	   A lengthy form slump means Pavin will miss the Presidents Cup at
Royal Melbourne from Dec. 11-13 after playing a hand in the
American victories in the first two Cup events which were contested
on U.S. soil.
	   But he is tipping America to complete a Presidents Cup hat-trick
_ though not by a big margin.
	   Two-time major winner Mark O'Meara, the player of 1998, will
spearhead the 12-man American team which also boasts Tiger Woods
and David Duval.
	   The International team has form question marks over some
players.
	   Greg Norman returns to regular tournament competition in this
week's Australian Open at Royal Adelaide following his win in his
Shark Shootout with teammate Steve Elkington.
	   New Zealand's Frank Nobilo has struggled for much of the year.
On the positive side, Zimbabwe's Nick Price turned in a final-round
63 to win his national Open by five shots on Sunday.
	   Pavin starred for the U.S. in the 1991-93-95 Ryder Cups.
	   ``On paper it looks like a U.S. win, but you don't play the
tournament on paper,'' said Pavin, who was beaten in a playoff by
Australia's Stephen Leaney at the Players Championship in Brisbane
on Sunday.

Ian Roberts retires from rugby league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby league international
Ian Roberts announced Monday his retirement from the game after a
14-year career and 13 test matches.
	   A spokeswoman for his North Queensland club at Townsville said
Roberts had declined to speak with the media about his decision for
``at least a couple of months'' but cited mental fatigue as the
reason for his decision.
	   Roberts has been described as Australia's only openly gay
footballer.
	   The spokeswoman said the former South Sydney and Manly player
planned to stay in Townsville for another year and would remain
employed by the Cowboys on a coaching and community-based level.
	   Cowboys chief executive Rabieh Krayem said he was happy to
accept Roberts' decision.
	   ``I am sure this has been a very difficult decision for Ian
after such an impressive career,'' Krayem said.
	   ``He has had a great influence on a lot of players who have
played alongside him. He has been an inspirational player and has
always led by example both on and off the field.'' (djp)

Gadhafi blames U.S., Britain for delay in Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has blamed
delays in holding a trial in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103
on obstacles created by the United States and Britain.
	   Gadhafi, who has refused for years to turn over two Libyan
suspects for trial, said in a speech Sunday night that he had done
all he could to resolve the dispute but the other side ``does not
want to make any concessions.''
	   The speech, at a banquet in the Libyan capital Tripoli for
visiting Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, was broadcast on Libyan
television and monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Also at
the banquet was American Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of
Islam.
	   Gadhafi referred to an American-British proposal for the two men
to be tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges as a ``sterile
initiative'' and said the two countries had set unacceptable
conditions.
	   ``The two countries drafted a bilateral resolution which they
had imposed on the (U.N.) Security Council without consulting
Libya, due to their wish not to see the trial held in the first
place,'' he said.
	   Gadhafi did not specify the conditions he referred to, but said
that sticking to British and American law ``does fundamentally
undermine the initiative'' adopted in the Security Council for
holding a trial.
	   The Security Council is involved because it imposed sanctions on
Libya in 1992 for refusing to allow a trial of the two men, who are
accused of the bombing of the jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland,
which killed 270 people.
	   For years, Washington and London insisted on trying the men in
the United States or Scotland; Libya said they could not expect a
fair trial in either place and urged a neutral venue.
	   Recently Britain and the United States offered the Netherlands
as a site, and Libya accepted in principle. But Gadhafi has
demanded guarantees the suspects will not be extradited to the
United States and wants them imprisoned in Libya if convicted.
	   On Sunday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the
Libyan Lawyers' Union has created a defense fund for the two
Libyans, but it did not say how much money was in the fund.

and more than 100 homes and buildings were damaged on Mangole
Island. Roads were cut and bridges destroyed, hampering search and
rescue efforts.
	   Fearing aftershocks, hundreds of people ran to the safety of a
soccer field after the magnitude-6.5 quake struck Sunday night.
	   Dozens of wooden houses slid into the sea and one of many
landslide destroyed the island's main docks.
	   Witnesses said large cracks scarred the streets of the largest
town, Dofa, and elsewhere on the island, which has a population of
about 38,000.
	   Officials feared the numbers of dead and injured could rise as
information came in from outlying villages.
	   Military personnel and volunteers erected tents for the
homeless. Officials said urgent supplies of food and medicine were
needed.
	   The island has no major hospital. A local government official,
Karim Wamona, said emergency flights were taking seriously injured
victims to neighboring islands for urgent treatment.
	   ``People are now gathering in a football field. There was a lot
of panic. They are too afraid to sleep because there might be
aftershocks,'' police Sgt. Yopi Sariwating said by telephone.
	   He said the quake lasted only a few seconds.
	   ``But it was biggest anyone here had ever felt. This is the
worst damage this island has had from an earthquake,'' he said.
	   Another local policeman, Sgt. Hafid, said three men and three
women had been confirmed dead.
	   Hafid said five people were killed when the roof of a plywood
factory collapsed.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted factory executives as
saying more workers might still be trapped in the wreckage.
	   A sixth victim died when the landslide buried the docks. At
least three loading vehicles had been swept into the sea.
	   The search for casualties was continuing on the island, about
1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) northeast of Indonesia's capital,
Jakarta.
	   Electricity supplies had been cut and telecommunications with
the island were patchy.
	   Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said the quake
had a magnitude of 6.5.
	   It struck at 10:10 p.m. (1410 GMT) Sunday and was centered
beneath the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) south of
the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi, the agency said.
	   Earlier, the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said the quake
had a preliminary magnitude of 7.6.
	   The geological survey issued a tsunami warning for the Western
Pacific. The alert for Japan, however, was lifted after about two
hours.
	   Mangole, an island dominated by the timber industry, is part of
the Maluku archipelago, known in colonial times as the Spice
Islands. The earthquake was felt on neighboring islands, but no
damage was reported.
	   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on nearby Flores Island.
	   More than 2,000 people were killed in July when a tsunami hit
the northern coast of neighboring Papua New Guinea.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of
North America across to Japan, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific
and New Zealand.
	   A magnitude-6 quake can cause severe damage if centered beneath
a heavily populated area, while a magnitude-7 quake can cause
widespread, heavy damage.

Russian government again delays on budget plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government canceled plans Monday to
discuss the 1999 budget, once again delaying efforts to come up
with plans to tackle the country's economic crisis.
	   A government spokesman said the Cabinet meeting on the budget
had been rescheduled for Thursday, but gave no details.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has yet to produce
firm plans to tackle the financial crisis since Russia effectively
defaulted on some debts in August and devalued the currency.
	   Primakov's government has requested more aid from the
International Monetary Fund, warning Russia faces serious problems
unless it gets more funding. But the IMF and Western governments
say they won't provide any act until Russia adopts a realistic
budget.
	   Russia's finance minister repeated pleas Sunday for IMF
assistance.
	   ``Money is not the main thing we need from the IMF, although we
need that too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax
news agency. ``We, above all, expect understanding from the IMF,
and a program to relieve Russia's debt _ that is, dlrs 17.5
billion.''
	   Russia has been hoping the IMF would release the next
installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package that was frozen in
August after the crisis erupted.
	   Zadornov said he hoped the IMF would not only release the next
loan installment, but help Russia restructure its foreign debt _
and perhaps persuade some creditors to let Russia off the hook.
	   ``Without the consent of the IMF, creditors won't agree to
defer, or possibly partly write off, Russia's external debt,''
Zadornov said.
	   Another government financial officer, Alexander Pochinok, was
quoted as saying Sunday that a 1999 draft budget assumes that
Russia will receive the remaining dlrs 17.5 billion in loans from
the IMF, World Bank and Japan.

High security as Mikhailov trial begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos staffing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Police mounted a massive security operation Monday
for the opening of a trial of an alleged godfather of the Russian
mafia.
	   Sergei Mikhailov faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half years in
prison if found guilty of being a member of a criminal organization
and of breaking Swiss property laws.
	   Lawyers for Mikhailov are expected to ask for an adjournment.
They claim his case has been compromised by media reports and are
particularly concerned that photographs published in the Swiss
press appear to have come from official files.
	   Mikhailov was arrested two years ago at Geneva airport. He was
originally accused of money laundering, but in the course of the
investigation that charge was dropped because of problems of
gathering evidence in Russia.
	   Geneva prosecutors say Mikhailov is head of the Moscow-based
Solntsevskaya crime organization, linked to the worldwide network
of the mafia godfather Vyacheslav Ivankov _ known as Yaponchik _
who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in New York last
year.
	   Mikhailov denies all the charges against him and claims to be an
ordinary businessman.
	   The trial is expected to feature more than 90 witnesses speaking
six different languages and is due to last two weeks.
	   Unprecedented security measures are being taken inside and
outside the courthouse. Witnesses will receive special protection,
in some cases including provision of bullet-proof vests.
	   Among the prosecution witnesses will be former Moscow police
officer Nikolai Oporov, who has been given political exile in
Switzerland and is under heavy guard.
	   Also due to give evidence is Mikhailov's former lawyer, who is
himself waiting to be tried after being arrested leaving the prison
where Mikhailov was being held with letters which had not passed
through the censor.
	   One probable prosecution witness, Vadim Rozenbaum, was
assassinated in the Netherlands in July 1997.

Thai police give stern warning to racketeers at Asian Games venues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police have pledged to crack down
on racketeers waiting to prey on Asian Games spectators who park
their cars at designated lots, organizers said.
	   The Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee said in a weekend
statement that police have sent officers to the parking lots to
maintain security and crack down on extortion.
	   Bangkok drivers who park their cars in public places are often
targeted by gangs who demand payments in exchange for not damaging
the vehicles.
	   The games, the largest sporting event in Asia, will run from
Dec. 6 to Dec. 20 with more than 6,000 athletes from 41 nations
taking part.

Ian Roberts retires from rugby league
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds new details, recasts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Rugby league international Ian Roberts,
the first Australian player to openly declare his homosexuality,
announced Monday his retirement after a 14-year career and 13 test
matches.
	   A spokeswoman for his North Queensland club at Townsville said
Roberts, 34, had declined to speak with the media about his
decision for ``at least a couple of months'' but cited mental
fatigue as the reason for his decision.
	   The spokeswoman said the former South Sydney and Manly player
planned to stay in Townsville for another year and would remain
employed by the Cowboys on a coaching and community-based level.
	   Cowboys chief executive Rabieh Krayem said he was happy to
accept Roberts' decision.
	   ``I am sure this has been a very difficult decision for Ian
after such an impressive career,'' Krayem said.
	   ``He has had a great influence on a lot of players who have
played alongside him. He has been an inspirational player and has
always led by example both on and off the field.''
	   Roberts ventured where no other rugby league player and few
high-profile athletes have dared to go.
	   A strapping forward with all the strength and toughness to make
it to the top when he began his career with South Sydney 14 years
ago, Roberts quickly forged a reputation as a tough, no-nonsense
player.
	   In 1994 _ the year he rocked rugby league by declaring he was
gay _ Roberts was selected on Australia's tour of Britain and
France.
	   Former Manly teammate and Cowboys physiotherapist Greg Gibson
has seen the changes in Roberts since he stunned everyone with his
gay admission.
	   ``In football terms, he (Roberts) was already known as one of
the toughest guys ever to play the game,'' Gibson said recently.
``In a funny way, by coming out, he's gained even more respect.''

Chinese president concludes Japan trip
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jiang's message to Japan's emperor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin left for Beijing
Monday after meeting agricultural specialists and students in
northern Japan.
	   Jiang, concluding a historic six-day visit to Japan, boarded a
plane in the city of Sapporo on Japan's northernmost main island of
Hokkaido.
	   Before departing, Jiang sent a message thanking Japan's Emperor
Akihito for the warm reception he received in Tokyo, and asserting
that China and Japan had laid the foundations for friendly
relations in the future.
	   ``The establishment of long-term ties of friendship will benefit
not only China and Japan, but also serve to promote peace in Asia
and the world,'' the message read.
	   In spite of the upbeat tone of the letter, Jiang's trip to
Japan, the first by a Chinese head of state since World War II, was
viewed by many as a diplomatic failure.
	   The visit had been touted as an opportunity to bury acrimony
over Japanese wartime atrocities and form a closer economic and
political partnership.
	   But problems emerged over Tokyo's decision not to include a full
written apology for Japan's brutal invasion of China during World
War II, in which Imperial Army troops committed widespread
massacres.
	   Jiang repeatedly evoked Japanese wartime militarism at public
events and in private meetings during his visit.
	   Observers also speculated that China may have been disappointed
by the vagueness of Tokyo's assurances that it does not to support
independence for Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade
province.
	   During the visit, Tokyo offered China new loans of 390 billion
yen (dlrs 3.2 billion) for 28 environmental, farming and other
development projects for 1999-2000.
	   Jiang was accompanied to Japan by his wife, Wang Yeping. Sapporo
is 829 kilometers (518 miles) northwest of Tokyo.

Young Saudi man in drag sneaks into all-female university
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A young man disguised as a woman
spent half a day among women students at an all-female Saudi
university before being discovered, Al-Bilad newspaper reported
Monday.
	   The man wore the scarf and black cape mandatory for women in
this strict Muslim country, put on make-up and borrowed his
sister's identification card to enter the university in the eastern
city of al-Ahsa, said the paper.
	   The disguise was meant to evade Saudi laws that forbid mixing
between men and women who are not related. The punishment for such
a transgression is usually public flogging.
	   Al-Bilad did not give the man's name or say when the incident
happened. It said he attended lectures but refused to speak,
raising suspicions of students who reported him to security
officers.
	   The officers detained the man, and the incident is now being
investigated by police, Al-Bilad said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Fed up with traffic jams caused by
almost daily student street protests, dozens of garbage collectors
staged their own demonstration Monday _ against demonstrations.
	   The group marched more than two kilometers (1.2 miles) through
downtown Jakarta waving red and white Indonesian flags.
	   ``Student protests confuse people,'' said one of their banners.
	   A protest coordinator, who identified himself by the single name
of Zaki, said students had the right to criticize the government.
But they should not take to the streets, he said.
	   In recent weeks, students have stepped up a campaign for more
democracy and also have demanded that former President Suharto be
put on trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Often major roads in the already congested capital of 11 million
people have been choked by thousands of students and blocked by
squads of riot police and troops.

Report: Russia and North Korea close to new treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is close to agreement on a new treaty with
North Korea that would drop Soviet-era commitments to mutual
defense, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
	   Quoting unidentified government sources, Interfax said just a
few items remain to be agreed upon and the treaty could be signed
in the near future, although no date has been set.
	   The Soviet Union was among North Korea's principal supporters
and the two nations had a mutual defense agreement. Since the
Soviet collapse, Russia has revised relations with North Korea,
which is still staunchly Communist.
	   Russian and North Korean diplomats will hold more talks on trade
and economic relations to work out final details on a new treaty,
the report said.

Bus accident kills two Dutch tourists on SAfrican coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSSEL BAY, South Africa (AP) _ A tour bus carrying Dutch
vacationers crashed through a barrier on a mountain road, and two
passengers were killed, officials said Monday.
	   Twenty other tourists and the driver were injured in the
accident Sunday afternoon, said Frans Esterhuyse, a spokesman for
the Elwierda Gauteng bus company.
	   The group of 25 tourists and two tour leaders was traveling on a
road heading toward the southern coastal town of Mossel Bay, about
400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Cape Town.
	   The bus was crossing the Robinson Pass and approaching a sharp
curve, police Capt. Wollie Fourie said.
	   ``There's a possibility the brakes failed while they were going
downhill and they crashed through a barrier,'' he said. ``The bus
overturned and fell about 15 meters (yards)'' down the hillside.
	   Fourie said he could not release the names of the victims until
their relatives were told.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini will hold
talks Monday with senior Russian officials on a Kurdish rebel
leader now seeking asylum in Italy and could be returned to Moscow.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted unidentified Italian diplomats
as saying that Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan could be sent to
Russia if his request for asylum is rejected by the Italian
government. Ocalan went to Rome from Moscow.
	   Dini was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, with the Ocalan issue expected to
dominate the talks. Dini's visit was scheduled before Ocalan was
arrested in Rome.
	   Dini told La Stampa newspaper that he hoped to find out about
the events leading up to Ocalan's journey to Rome earlier this
month and ``above all what was the Russian position on his decision
to come to Italy.''
	   Turkey wants Ocalan extradited to stand trial on terrorism and
other capital crimes, but Italian law forbids extradition when a
suspect faces the death penalty. Ocalan is also wanted in Germany,
but German officials say they won't seek his extradition.
	   That leaves Italy stuck with Ocalan, a controversial figure who
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a
guerrilla war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14 years.

Young Saudi man in drag sneaks into all-female university
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A young man disguised as a woman
spent half a day among women students at an all-female Saudi
university before being discovered, Al-Bilad newspaper reported
Monday.
	   The man wore the scarf and black cape mandatory for women in
this strict Muslim country, put on make-up and borrowed his
sister's identification card to enter the university in the eastern
city of al-Ahsa, said the paper.
	   The disguise was meant to evade Saudi laws that forbid mixing
between men and women who are not related. The punishment for such
a transgression is usually public flogging.
	   Al-Bilad did not give the man's name or say when the incident
happened. It said he attended lectures but refused to speak,
raising suspicions of students who reported him to security
officers.
	   The officers detained the man, and the incident is now being
investigated by police, Al-Bilad said.

Judge orders Anwar's defense lawyer jailed for contempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with trial adjourned, comment about jailing of
attorney, other details &QL; 
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chaos rocked the sensational
corruption and sex trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Monday when one of his defense attorneys was sentenced
to three months in jail for contempt of court.
	   Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer in Anwar's defense team, was
ordered to surrender himself to police by 4 p.m. (0800 GMT). His
colleagues said they were too disturbed to continue, so Paul
adjourned the trial until Tuesday.
	   Anwar, prevented by police from talking to his attorneys in the
courtroom, angrily shouted to reporters that he could no longer get
a fair trial.
	   ``I can't even discuss this with my lawyers now,'' Anwar said.
``Where is justice?''
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing
and beating while in custody has led to international interest in
the case and support for his fledgling political reform movement.
	   His trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   Anwar denies the charges, calling them part of political
vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Monday's uproar was sparked by an affidavit Anwar filed in the
High Court Saturday. In it, he accused two prosecutors of trying to
cajole a potential witness into fabricating evidence of sex crimes
by Anwar.
	   Anwar asked the court to remove senior government prosecutors
Abdul Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed from the corruption and sexual
misconduct trial.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul refused Monday to listen to
defense attorneys' arguments on the affidavit, saying there was
nothing to support the allegations.
	   Instead, he ordered Zainur, who submitted the affidavit, to
apologize to Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah. The attorney
general, who does not normally attend the trial, was in court
Monday and asked to speak.
	   ``What has been done by Zainur Zakaria undermines the integrity
of the trial,'' Mohtar told the court, recommending an immediate
contempt hearing.
	   There was then an angry exchange between the judge and Anwar's
leading defense attorney Raja Aziz Addruse.
	   When Raja Aziz objected to Paul demanding an apology, the judge
ordered him to sit down.
	   Raja Aziz replied, ``We should have been heard before your
Lordship came to the conclusion already that the allegations are
scandalous.''
	   Zainur, who has been practicing law since 1975, then refused to
apologize.
	   The judge rejected the defense request that it be given three
days to prepare for the contempt hearing.
	   ``Nothing shocks me very much,'' Raja Aziz said of the contempt
ruling, which left many in the courtroom stunned.
	   In the affidavit, Anwar said the two prosecutors had tried to
negotiate a plea bargain with his former tennis partner,
Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
	   Nalla, as he is known, was indicted shortly before Anwar's
arrest and charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live
ammunition. He faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted.
	   The bullets were said to have been found in Nalla's house during
a police investigation of allegations published in the book,
``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while Anwar was still in power.
	   Anwar said Abdul Gani and Azahar indicated that they would try
Nalla under a lesser charge if he was prepared to lie about how
Anwar committed sexual offenses with ``various married and
unmarried women.''

 &UR; Deutsche Bank approves deal to acquire Bankers Trust for dlrs 10.1
billion &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Deutsche Bank confirmation; CHANGES price of deal
based on statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank AG announced Monday the
acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp., in a dlrs 10.1 billion deal
that will create the world's largest financial institution with
assets of more than dlrs 800 billion.
	   Deutsche Bank has offered Bankers Trust shareholders dlrs 93 a
share. The boards from both banks approved the offer during
separate meetings Sunday, Deutsche Bank said in a statement.
	   Deutsche Bank said the deal would be financed partly with a 4
billion mark (dlrs 2.35 billion) capital increase.
	   Bill McBride, a spokesman for the New York-based Bankers Trust,
declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting.
	   A joint statement from the two banks released last week said
that, ``while the parties have satisfactorily completed'' their
respective investigations of the merger, the banks still had to
work out final legal, structural and tax matters.
	   Deutsche Bank is Germany's largest with dlrs 675 billion in
assets, while Bankers Trust is the eighth-largest bank in the
United States with dlrs 156 billion in assets. The combined bank
would surpass both current No. 1 UBS AG of Switzerland and the
recently formed Citigroup Inc.
	   The deal would also be the largest takeover of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank.
	   The merger would still have to obtain approval of both New York
state and federal banking regulators.

Tokyo stocks fall, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, bond, comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell Monday as investors stopped
buying to await more signs of economic recovery and details on the
ruling party's new alliance with an opposition party. The U.S.
dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 185.69 points,
or 1.23 percent, closing at 14,883.70. On Friday, the Nikkei had
fallen 138.38 points, or 0.91 percent.
	   The dollar bought 123.82 yen in late afternoon, up 0.96 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 123.07
yen late Friday. The 123.82 yen rate was the highest since the
dollar was at 128.18 yen on Oct. 7. It ranged Monday between 123.20
yen and 124.07 yen.
	   Stock investors were awaiting clarification on whether the
coalition between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the
Liberal Party would bring additional economic stimulus measures,
traders said.
	   ``Market players are sitting out waiting to see if the economy
is going to recover,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general manger at Nikko
Securities. ``Buy orders aren't coming in.''
	   The alliance has generated expectations for more stimulus
measures because the Liberals have pushed for a reduction in
Japan's unpopular consumption tax.
	   Experts say the government's raising of the sales tax rate to 5
percent from 3 percent last year was a leading cause of Japan's
recession.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 14.85 points, or 1.28 percent, to 1,143.50.
It had slipped 6.24 points, or 0.54 percent, Friday.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 396.99 million
shares, down from 506.20 million Friday. Retreats outnumbered
advances 713 to 451, with 135 issues unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar advanced as Japanese importers
bought the U.S. currency to settle end-of-month accounts. Japanese
investors also bought dollars ahead of Tuesday, when Japanese banks
and life insurers will be allowed to sell mutual funds under the
nation's deregulation measures.
	   Currently, only brokers are allowed to sell them.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.040 percent from its Friday finish of 1.075 percent,
driving up its price to 106.59 yen from 106.27 yen.

Opposition shouts anti-government slogans; parliament adjourned

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Members of a small opposition group kept
up such a steady chant of anti-government slogans when India's
parliament opened for the winter session Monday that the house had
to be adjourned for several hours.
	   ``You have no right to rule! You have been wiped out in the
elections!'' shouted members of the Samajwadi Party who rushed out
of their seats and surrounded the speaker's chair. The party has 17
seats in the 545-strong lower house of parliament.
	   The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was routed by the main
opposition Congress party in elections in three states last week.
The Samajwadi Party supports Congress.
	   The shouting began shortly after the session opened Monday
morning when Congress leader Sharad Pawar rose to speak on rising
food prices, which have been blamed for the BJP's defeat. The house
was adjourned until the afternoon.
	   Though the state elections had no direct bearing on the federal
government, they were expected to increase already strong pressure
on the BJP coalition. Several coalition members who have hinted at
withdrawing support _ forcing the federal government to collapse _
may now be thinking even more seriously about backing Congress.
	   Congress leader Sonia Gandhi said Sunday her party wanted
federal power, but would not try to topple the BJP coalition. If
the BJP government fell before its five-year term ended, Congress
or another party could be asked to form a new government, or early
elections could be called.
	   The state election results have been widely interpreted as a
rebuff from voters to the eight-month-old coalition.
	   Monday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in a brief address
to lawmakers of his 19-party coalition admitted that the opposition
had successfully made prices a major election issue. He said the
government will take steps to bring down prices of vegetables and
other foods, which have sometimes risen sixfold in recent months.
The increases were blamed on rains ruining harvests and hoarding by
some merchants.
	   ``There have been some shortcomings in our administration,''
Vajpayee said.

First Philippine execution in 22 years scheduled for January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In the Philippines' first execution
in 22 years, a poor house painter convicted of raping his
10-year-old stepdaughter will be put to death in early January, the
justice secretary said Monday.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the date for Leo
Echegaray's execution will be between Jan. 4 and 8.
	   Echegaray is the first among 844 death-row inmates to be
scheduled for execution. The planned execution has triggered a
debate among Filipinos over capital punishment.
	   Several countries, including the European Union, the Vatican and
Canada, have appealed to President Joseph Estrada to cancel
Echegaray's execution and repeal the death penalty.
	   Estrada has refused to pardon Echegaray, saying his execution
will deter similar crimes.
	   Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court
earlier set the date for Echegaray's execution, but ordered prison
authorities not to announce it ahead of time.
	   Cuevas said he has discovered the execution will be sometime
between Jan. 4 and 8. He said he plans to ask the Supreme Court to
compel Ponferrada to publicly reveal the exact date.
	   Under current government rules, authorities cannot inform
Echegaray of his impending execution until after sunrise on
execution day. However, Cuevas said the rules do not prohibit the
date from being disclosed publicly.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos believe that the death penalty will deter crime,
and that crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor people
are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot afford
good lawyers.
	   Estrada, who won election in May by a wide margin on a pro-poor
platform, said Echegaray's crime was not caused by poverty.

Syrian President prepared to meet Israeli leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Syria President Hafez Assad is ready to meet
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, if Israel agrees to
resume peace talks from the point they were stopped nearly three
years ago, Israel army radio said Monday.
	   Netanyahu said he has not received any message from Syria, and
rejected what he called preconditions for resuming the talks.
	   Army radio quoted American sources, saying U.S. President Bill
Clinton initiated the contact, asking Assad whether he would be
prepared to move forward in talks with Israel.
	   Assad reportedly replied that he is ready to resume the talks
where they left off, and to meet Netanyahu. Up to now Assad has
refused to sit down with Israeli leaders.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz also said Assad was making overtures
to Israel. In two separate meetings with U.S. visitors, one a
diplomat and one a businessman, Assad said that if Israel withdrew
from the Golan Heights, it would enjoy quiet on the borders with
Syria and Lebanon, Haaretz reported.
	   The issue of where the talks left off is the main disagreement
between Israel and Syria. The Syrians claim Israel's previous
government offered to return all of the Golan, a strategic plateau
Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange
for peace. But the proposal was never made officially.
	   Netanyahu's government says a proposal that was never made
officially does not count. Therefore, Netanyahu insists that the
talks must resume without conditions.
	   ``We are prepared to enter into renewed negotiations with Syria,
but we are not prepared to accept dictation of terms that in fact
empty the negotiations of all content,'' Netanyahu said in an
interview with Israel radio.
	   Netanyahu's government opposes giving up all of the Golan,
fearing Syria would gain strategic control over Israel's north and
over vital water sources.
	   Asked about messages from Assad, Netanyahu said: ``If he sent me
a message, I didn't get it.''
	   Azmi Bishara, an Arab member of the Israeli parliament, is in
Damascus at the invitation of Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa. He told army radio he did not carry messages from
Israel's government, but would be glad to bring a message back from
Damascus.
	   However, he added, ``I don't think the conditions are right now
for exchanges of messages.''
	   A leading legislator from Netanyahu's party, Meir Shetreet, said
he had heard reports about the possible resumption of negotiations
with Syria.
	   Shetreet said Israel faces a ``historic window of opportunity to
finish the negotiations with the Lebanese, the Syrians and perhaps
the Palestinians.'' But to take advantage of it, he said, Israel
needs a government that can made decisions.
	   Netanyahu's parliamentary majority has virtually disappeared
over the debate over the latest agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians. Shetreet and other members of parliament believe
Netanyahu should bring the main opposition party, the moderate
Labor, into a unity government.

Suharto graft inquiry delayed because of lack of volunteers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with announcement postponed; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The formation of a commission to look
into corruption allegations against ex-President Suharto has been
postponed because not enough people have agreed to join it, a
senior Indonesian official said Monday.
	   President B.J. Habibie had been scheduled to announce the
commission's composition Monday.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said 30 people had been invited to
sit on the panel.
	   ``But not all have replied,'' he told reporters at the
presidential palace, adding that an announcement might be made in
one or two days.
	   Meanwhile, Suharto's legal adviser has warned that the
government could be threatened if the former autocrat is made to
face court charges for corruption.
	   ``If Suharto does go to court, it could drag down the
government, bringing senior incumbent and former officials _ as
well as all the cronies suspected of accruing ill-gotten wealth _
into messy litigation,'' The Jakarta Post quoted Yohanes Yacob as
saying.
	   The delay comes amid growing skepticism about the effectiveness
of the inquiry, which the government has said will be conducted by
a group of ``credible'' individuals.
	   Akbar said the commission would have the power to examine
Suharto's records over a three-month period so as to establish
whether he had acted corruptly during 32 years in power.
	   But it would not be authorized to search for money that Suharto
allegedly stashed overseas. This would be done by police and the
attorney general's office, Akbar said.
	   Suharto, 77, who had ruled the would's fourth most populous
country with an iron hand since 1966, resigned in May amid
widespread student protests and riots that claimed about 1,200
lives.
	   Critics have since accused him of siphoning off state wealth to
benefit his family's massive business empires.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Some opponents claim it is many times that.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that he will
cooperate with any investigation into his affairs. He has also
denied that he has hidden away a fortune in foreign banks.
	   Students have been staging almost daily protests demanding that
Suharto be tried. Police and soldiers heavily guard his residence
in an affluent neighborhood, and have blocked protesters from
marching there.
	   Habibie ordered the commission set up after an earlier
investigation by Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib failed to
find any evidence against Suharto. Many rejected it as a whitewash.
	   On Monday The Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted a former
Suharto Cabinet minister as doubting the new investigation would
uncover much.
	   Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, an ex-environment minister who is now a
vocal government critic, questioned the resolve of officials to
investigate allegations against Suharto.
	   He said many members of the government had ties with Suharto.
	   ``How could these people possibly carry out an investigation? Be
realistic,'' Sarwono was quoted as saying.
	   ``It cannot be denied that there is a special link between the
leadership of President Habibie and his predecessor,'' he said.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend and former loyal subordinate of
Suharto.
	   He has repeatedly said that while his old boss should be
investigated, any inquiry must be conducted in accordance with
Indonesian law and be based on the presumption of innocence.

Yeltsin stays in hospital, impeachment motion against him advances
</HEADLINE>
slowly &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin continued to be treated
for pneumonia in a government hospital Monday while his Communist
foes in the Russian parliament worked on an impeachment motion.
	   The president's office said that the 67-year old leader is
``getting better'' and was expected to hold several meetings with
officials on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, a parliamentary impeachment panel was pondering
Monday whether Yeltsin, as the commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, was responsible for the steady decay of the cash-strapped
Russian military.
	   The panel, set up last summer by the parliament's lower house,
the State Duma, has already named Yeltsin on three other counts _
instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, crushing his
foes in the previous parliament with troops and tanks in 1993, and
launching the botched war in separatist Chechnya.
	   When the commission wraps up its work, the Duma will decide
whether to launch the impeachment motion. The house would need a
two-thirds majority to do that.
	   To succeed, the move would then require the same majority in the
upper chamber of parliament as well as consent of both the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts _ a highly unlikely scenario.
	   While impeachment stands little chance of success, the
Communists and their allies see it as a political weapon to air
their criticism of the government and further erode the president's
crumbling authority.
	   Yeltsin has remained in hospital since Nov. 22 with a bout of
pneumonia _ the latest in a steady string of illnesses that have
raised concerns about his ability to perform his duties through the
end of his term in mid-2000.
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal lawmaker and a
presidential hopeful, predicted on Sunday that presidential
elections will take place ``very soon.'' He didn't elaborate.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Sunday that the
president would stay in the hospital for at least several more
days. ``Doctors are insisting that the president stay inside since
pneumonia is more serious than an ordinary respiratory infection,''
Yakushkin said on the Echo Moscow radio. ``Moreover, a period of
infectious diseases is beginning.''

Judge orders Anwar's defense lawyer jailed for contempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 4 grafs with judge granting Zainur bail until
hearing Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chaos rocked the sensational
corruption and sex trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Monday when one of his defense attorneys was sentenced
to three months in jail for contempt of court.
	   Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer in Anwar's defense team,
refused to apologize for accusing two prosecutors of trying to get
a potential witness to lie.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul, who had demanded the apology,
held Zainur in contempt of court and ordered him to surrender to
police by 4 p.m. (0800 GMT). Zainur's defense colleagues said they
were too disturbed to continue, so Paul adjourned the trial until
Tuesday.
	   Zainur immediately appealed the contempt ruling to the Court of
Appeals. He was allowed to remain free on 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,631) bail until his appeal hearing Friday.
	   Anwar, prevented by police from talking to his attorneys in the
courtroom, angrily shouted to reporters that he could no longer get
a fair trial.
	   ``I can't even discuss this with my lawyers now,'' Anwar said.
``Where is justice?''
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing
and beating while in custody has led to international interest in
the case and support for his fledgling political reform movement.
	   His trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   Anwar denies the charges, calling them part of political
vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Monday's uproar was sparked by an affidavit Anwar filed in the
High Court Saturday. In it, he accused two prosecutors of trying to
cajole a potential witness into fabricating evidence of sex crimes
by Anwar.
	   Anwar asked the court to remove senior government prosecutors
Abdul Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed from the corruption and sexual
misconduct trial.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul refused Monday to listen to
defense attorneys' arguments on the affidavit, saying there was
nothing to support the allegations.
	   Instead, he ordered Zainur, who submitted the affidavit, to
apologize to Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah. The attorney
general, who does not normally attend the trial, was in court
Monday and asked to speak.
	   ``What has been done by Zainur Zakaria undermines the integrity
of the trial,'' Mohtar told the court, recommending an immediate
contempt hearing.
	   There was then an angry exchange between the judge and Anwar's
leading defense attorney Raja Aziz Addruse.
	   When Raja Aziz objected to Paul demanding an apology, the judge
ordered him to sit down.
	   Raja Aziz replied, ``We should have been heard before your
Lordship came to the conclusion already that the allegations are
scandalous.''
	   Zainur, who has been practicing law since 1975, then refused to
apologize.
	   The judge rejected the defense request that it be given three
days to prepare for the contempt hearing.
	   ``Nothing shocks me very much,'' Raja Aziz said of the contempt
ruling, which left many in the courtroom stunned.
	   In the affidavit, Anwar said the two prosecutors had tried to
negotiate a plea bargain with his former tennis partner,
Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
	   Nalla, as he is known, was indicted shortly before Anwar's
arrest and charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live
ammunition. He faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted.
	   The bullets were said to have been found in Nalla's house during
a police investigation of allegations published in the book,
``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while Anwar was still in power.
	   Anwar said Abdul Gani and Azahar indicated that they would try
Nalla under a lesser charge if he was prepared to lie about how
Anwar committed sexual offenses with ``various married and
unmarried women.''

Japan's Obuchi dampens speculation on sales tax cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Monday
his government is unlikely to reduce Japan's unpopular consumption
tax, denting hopes raised by his ruling party's recent coalition
pact.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed on an alliance this
month with the opposition Liberal Party, a staunch advocate of
cutting the sales tax as a means of reviving Japan's enfeebled
economy.
	   Speaking to a special session of Parliament Monday, Obuchi said
a sales tax reform agreed upon with the Liberals would likely
amount to using revenue from the tax for health and welfare
purposes.
	   ``I want the nation to understand that it would be difficult to
lower the consumption tax,'' Obuchi said.
	   Many economists blame the LDP's decision last year to raise the
consumption tax to 5 percent from 3 percent for stifling domestic
demand and sending the economy into a tailspin.
	   The Liberal Party and others have said that reducing or
temporarily freezing the tax would be the most effective way to
jump start the economy.
	   The priority of the current 18-day extraordinary session of
Parliament is the passage of a new budget that includes Japan's
largest-ever stimulus plan, worth 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196
billion).
	   Japan is struggling through its worst recession in decades, and
Obuchi has repeatedly pledged to restore economic growth next year.
	   The LDP hopes that by joining forces with the Liberals it can
attract enough unaligned independents in Parliament that it will be
able to pass bills without cutting deals with the opposition.
	   The ruling party controls Parliament's lower house, but lacks a
majority in the upper house. Key financial bills during the last
Parliament session were delayed by wrangling with opposition
groups.
	   Naoto Kan, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party,
condemned the LDP's coalition agreement Monday, saying it goes
against the will of the public.
	   The alliance is ``not an administration that has been approved
by the people,'' Kan said.
	   Kan called for a dissolution of the lower house of Parliament
and early general elections.

Philippines arrests 20 Chinese fishermen near disputed Spratly
</HEADLINE>
Islands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PUERTO PRINCESA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine navy patrol has
arrested 20 Chinese fishermen and seized their six boats after they
were found fishing near a Philippine-claimed islet in the disputed
Spratly Islands, a navy officer said Monday.
	   Maj. Romulo Gualdrapa said the Chinese were arrested Sunday near
Alicia Annie Reef, which is claimed by both the Philippines and
China.
	   Gualdrapa said the Chinese were arrested for illegally fishing
in Philippine territory and for using sodium cyanide to catch fish
in violation of a Philippine law that bans the practice. Several
kilograms (about 10 pounds) of cyanide-stunned live fish were
recovered from the boats, he said.
	   Some fishermen add cyanide to sea water to stun fish so they can
be caught and sold alive to expensive restaurants in Hong Kong,
Japan and Taiwan. Cyanide kills many fish but several highly prized
species, especially groupers, have a high tolerance for the poison
and can stay alive for weeks after exposure.
	   Cyanide also destroys coral reefs it contacts.
	   Gualdrapa said charges are being readied against the Chinese. He
refused to give further details pending notification of the
Department of Foreign Affairs.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese Embassy. In
previous cases, the embassy has said the area belongs to China so
the fishermen cannot be charged with illegal entry.
	   The arrests were the latest in a series of recent incidents
between Manila and Beijing over territories in the South China Sea.
	   In August, 23 Chinese fishermen were arrested near a
Philippine-claimed islet but were later released after charges
against them were dropped.
	   Early this month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with
Beijing over its enlargement of buildings on Mischief Reef. China
claims the structures are shelters for Chinese fishermen but the
Philippines says they can be used militarily.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin discussed the dispute in a meeting in Malaysia early this
month and agreed to settle it peacefully.
	   They agreed as well that natural resources in the area should be
used jointly by the two nations.
	   The Spratlys are a chain of islands, shoals and atolls believed
to be rich in oil, gas and other minerals. China, Vietnam and
Taiwan claim all of the Spratlys, while the Philippines, Malaysia
and Brunei claim parts of the chain.

 &UR; Stewart blames the batting for defeat
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ England captain Alec Stewart blamed his
team's woeful batting for the seven-wicket drubbing by Australia in
the second cricket test that ended two days early Monday at the
WACA.
	   England has won just four of the last 30 Ashes clashes to
Australia's 18, and the defeat inside three days has opened new
wounds for Stewart in his first Ashes series as captain.
	   While refusing to blame the WACA pitch, which Australian skipper
Mark Taylor described as ``being caught in a transitional period,''
Stewart attributed the defeat to his side's poor batting.
	   ``It's the batting that was disappointing more than anything in
this test,'' said Stewart after England was bowled out for 112 in
the first innings.
	   ``It one of the poorest performance I can remember from an
England side. We didn't help ourselves by the way we batted. They
caught us half-forward, half-back.''
	   ``Full credit to those Australian bowlers for the length they
bowled. I thought (Glenn) McGrath and (Damien) Fleming were
outstanding.''
	   Stewart put down the batting downfall to playing deliveries that
were ``six inches'' outside off stump.
	   ``Australian batsmen showed good judgement in letting balls go.
Taylor left some that were six inches over middle stumps. They are
used to growing up on good surfaces. They trust the wicket and the
length and know where the ball is.''
	   England, having narrowly escaped defeat in the first test in
Brisbane, is 1-0 down in the five-test series with tests in
Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney to come.
	   ``We were 0-1 down against South Africa but came back to win
2-1. If we stay realistic about our performance and keep improving
on what we have done so far, I can't see why it can't happen
again,'' Stewart said.
	   Taylor said both teams batted poorly on a pitch that offered
``sideway'' movement and felt batting in Perth is a unique
experience and cannot be ``replicated'' anywhere else in the world.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nippon Express Co. said Monday it has
reached an agreement with America's Federal Express Corp. to form a
wide-ranging alliance in international transport services.
	   Cooperation will begin in December when Nippon Express, Japan's
largest transport company, starts using FedEx's international
delivery service now linking 120,000 global cities, Nippon Express
spokesman Koichi Ohori said.
	   The tie-up will include joint use of parcel collection points
and other facilities around the world, Ohori said.
	   Under the agreement, FedEx, America's second-biggest transport
company, and Nippon Express will also share information systems to
track cargo deliveries, Ohori said.
	   Ohori said details about cooperation in domestic transport
services in Japan have yet to be finalized. FedEx has its own
network in Tokyo, Osaka and other major Japanese cities.
	   The two companies hope to save money through increased
efficiency at a time when businesses worldwide are reviewing their
logistics systems, Ohori said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's housing starts fell 12.9 percent in October
from the year-earlier month, to 104,291, down for the 22nd month in
a row, the Construction Ministry said Monday.
	   Housing starts measure the number of new housing construction
projects. The latest slip followed declines of 14 percent in
September and 11.4 percent in August.
	   Annualized housing starts totaled 1.16 million units.
	   Private housing starts for individual homes in October fell 2
percent on the year to 36,439, while rental housing fell 10.1
percent to 44,203.
	   Multi-unit dwelling starts, including condominiums, fell 30.2
percent to 22,144 and company housing starts fell by 8.0 percent to
1,505.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has requested between dlrs
1.15 billion and dlrs 1.35 billion as a first installment from
Japan's dlrs 30 billion assistance fund to crisis-stricken Asian
economies, a Finance Ministry official said Monday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Thai
government asked the Japanese authorities last week for the first
payment from the so-called Miyazawa Fund to be made in April.
	   Financial support from Japan under the plan _ unveiled in
Washington recently by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa _
forms part of an package of support that Thailand is seeking from
various sources, including the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank.
	   The total request for assistance from Japan would depend on the
amount given by other sources, the Finance Ministry official said.
	   The official couldn't confirm reports that Thailand had asked
Japan for total assistance of dlrs 3 billion from the Miyazawa fund
and said the amount hadn't been fixed yet.
	   Japan said earlier this month it would respond quickly to a
request for financial aid from the Miyazawa fund made by Thai
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Strong domestic growth and the Asian
economic crisis combined Monday to produce one of the worst set of
monthly trade figures Australia has ever seen.
	   The government statistician reported that the nation slipped 1.1
billion Australian dollars (U.S. 696 million) into the red on its
goods and services trade account in October, the worse figure since
August 1989.
	   There was also a huge extraordinary item in the latest figures
--Australia has been importing, melting down and re-exporting vast
amounts of gold from Asian countries this year.
	   That trade has surged as hard-pressed Asians began cashing in
their savings, often held in the form of gold jewelry.
	   Once that is taken into account, Australia's trade performance
in October was probably the worst on record.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello said the latest data confirmed his
prediction that the nation's current account deficit will blow out
to 31 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 19.6 billion) this
financial year.
	   That would be 5.25 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Growth in Australia's 42 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 26 million) tourism industry is
expected to stagnate over the next decade as the Asian economic
crisis continues to bite.
	   With Asian currencies so low against the Australian dollar, more
Australians are expected to holiday overseas, the Tourism
Forecasting Council predicted Monday.
	   It said growth in travel at home would grow by an average 1.4
percent a year, while outbound travel would grow by an average 4.5
percent a year.
	   ``The industry can expect continued challenging times, however,
the slow growth in the domestic sector is building on what is
already a very large market,'' chairman Frank Moore said in a
statement.

Shevardnadze: Georgia begs IMF for help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia has asked the International
Monetary Fund for loans to help cope with the impact of Russia's
economic crisis, poor harvests and a lack of fuel, President Eduard
Shevardnadze said Monday.
	   ``I don't know what aid they will give us, but I hope it it will
be quite substantial,'' Shevardnadze said in a regular radio
address to the nation.
	   He said that the Russian economic crisis that hit in mid-August
has crippled Georgian exports. Georgia relies on its neighbor for
most of its export markets for fruit and wine.
	   A drought last summer halved Georgia's grain harvest to about
500,000 metric tons and caused a significant reduction in
hydro-electric output because water levels dropped, Shevardnadze
said.
	   The power shortage has already forced the authorities to tighten
energy rationing. Residents of the Georgian capital are now getting
electricity for only six hours a day, compared to eight hours last
year.
	   While lobbying for IMF help, Georgia must boost tax collections
that are far below target this year, Shevardnadze said. He said the
police were given broader powers to fight tax-dodgers.
	   ``We will punish those who are robbing their country, the
pensioners and others who struggle to get by,'' Shevardnadze said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong slumped Monday, with
the key index tumbling more than 3 percent as investors took
profits.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 339.79 points, or 3.2 percent, closing at 10,402.32.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.08 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
651 million), down from Friday's 5.79 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 742 million).
	   ``There's some profit-taking'' after the index gained 5 percent
last week, said John Lo, an associate institutional sales director
at BNP Prime Peregrine Securities Ltd.
	   Brokers said market sentiment was also dampened by the
government announcement Friday that the territory has sunk deeper
into recession.
	   The government said gross domestic product fell by 7 percent in
the third quarter, prompting its economist to predict the economy
will contract by 5 percent for all of 1998.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 2.75 Hong Kong dollars to

	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 4.50 dollars to

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwe tasted its maiden Test
victory abroad when it defeated Pakistan by seven wickets in the
first Test of the three-match series Monday.
	   The visitors, needing just 92 runs to win, achieved it in mere
101 minutes on the fourth day with Murray Goodwin hitting an
attractive unbeaten 73 which included 13 forceful boundaries.
	   Andy Flower remained undefeated on 17 and hammered leg-spinner
Mushtaq Ahmed for a big six over mid-wicket before bringing in
victory with a ferocious square cut off Aaqib Javed to point
boundary.
	   ``Pakistan is a great side, they have top class players and
after beating them I feel really good,'' Zimbabwean captain
Alistair Campbell said.
	   Pakistan, which got a vital 58-run first innings lead Sunday
after dismissing Zimbabwe for 238, was run out for 103 in the
second innings in less than three hours. This left Zimbabwe a
target of 162 in more than two days.
	   After resuming at the overnight total of 70 for one, Zimbabwe
batsmen scored at a rapid pace with Goodwin leading the run-charge
and playing some exquisite drives on either sides of the wicket.
	   Wasim Akram, the left-arm paceman, playing in his 82nd Test
match got both wickets to finish with a match bag of eight for 99.
He raise his Test match wickets to 354 _ one short of Australian
Dennis Lillee's 355-mark.
	   Akram had Grant Flower (31) caught by wicketkeeper Moin Khan.
Flower put on 81 runs for the second wicket with Goodwin in 114
minutes and hit five fours.
	   A sloppy Pakistan fielding continued on the fourth morning when
Flower was dropped by Azhar Mahmood in second slip off Waqar
Younis. It raised the tally of dropped catches by the Pakistani
fielders to five in the match.
	   ``They bowled superbly and outplayed us,'' Pakistani captain
Aamir Suhail said.
	   Captain Alistair Campbell (12) scored all his run in boundaries
which included two off Younis before he failed to keep Akram's
vicious bouncer down and spooned the ball to waiting Ijaz Ahmed in
gully.
	   Zimbabwe had lost 10 out of 14 Test matches played abroad before
Monday's victory. It was overall its third Test win in 32 matches
and second against Pakistan.
	   Zimbabwe had won two Tests at home _ both at Harare. It defeated
India by 61 runs last month and had earlier beaten Pakistan by an
inning and 64 runs in 1994-95 season.
	   But Campbell cautioned his side not to underestimate Pakistan in
the remaining two tests.
	   ``The second Test will be the most important one of the series.
I know Pakistan could bounce back but our job should be to stop

from December 10.

Land disputes settled in golf course project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The last 102 families in a village near
Hanoi have received compensation for their land, ending a 2
1/2-year dispute over a planned golf course, a local official said
Monday.
	   An official from the Kim No village people's committee said the
land is expected to be handed over in the coming weeks to the
project developer, a joint venture between South Korea's Daewoo
Corp. and a local company.
	   The dispute began in May 1996, when police used cattle prods and
tear gas to keep angry farmers at bay as workers started turning
rice fields into the golf course. Dozens of police and farmers
suffered mild injuries.
	   In a second clash last month, a dozen officials were injured,
with five hospitalized.
	   The newspaper New Hanoi reported Sunday that peace has returned
to the village, where in the past any stranger talking about
compensation would be held hostage. An unspecified number of
hostage incidents have been reported.
	   The paper quoted Nguyen Van Chanh, chief of the village, as
saying security and police have been deployed in some key positions
to ensure no trouble after compensation was paid out.
	   Over a period of five days until Saturday, the last 102 of the
443 families having farm land in the proposed golf course project
have received compensation, the official said.
	   Under the arrangement, each family will have one person
contracted to work for the project, he said.
	   Land-compensation disputes are not new in Vietnam, where in
recent years local residents have demanded higher rates than
offered by the government.
	   In Vietnam, there is no private ownership of land, which
theoretically belongs to all people but is administered by the
state. Residents are given land-use rights instead.

Iraqis won't get protein in food basket until January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqis will not get protein in their food
rations until January despite hopes for adding such products as
cheese and milk in November, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh
was quoted as saying in newspapers Monday.
	   Saleh spoke to Parliament on Sunday, giving an update on Iraq's
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   ``People will receive 250 grams of milk per person and two cans
of baby milk in addition to cheese in January,'' he was quoted as
saying by Al-Thawra, the daily of the ruling Baath Party.
	   U.N. officials confirmed to The Associated Press that Iraqis
would receive the extra rations in January. They spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   Plans to upgrade the food ration earlier were delayed by the
world slump in oil prices, which cut Iraq's earnings under the U.N.
program allowing it to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food and
other necessities for the 22 million Iraqis.
	   Saleh said that food portion of the deal in its fourth phase was
only 187 million dollars while the compensation fund portion
received more than 1.1 billion dollars.
	   Under the oil-for-food deal, which is an exception to U.N.
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, money from
the program goes to compensate the invasion's victims and to pay
salaries of U.N. employees working with the program.
	   The food is distributed for a small fee in monthly rations that
include flour, rice, sugar, lentils, cooking oil and tea _
providing about 2,000 calories a day per person.
	   While the addition of protein to the ration may sound like good
news, the government and many Iraqis argue the extension of the
program now going into its fifth phase also means the continuation
of sanctions.
	   ``We were hoping to see sanctions lifted not prolonged,'' said
Umm Yassin, 54, a civil servant who heard about upgrading the food
basket Monday.
	   The U.N. sanctions ban oil exports and have devastated Iraq's
economy. The oil-for-food program was approved in December 1996.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify
Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has had
repeated disputes with the inspectors, but they are again working
after the latest run-in ended in mid-November.
	   Iraq's official news agency reported that 14 U.N. nuclear and
arms inspection teams carried out 13 missions Sunday.
	   The inspectors' spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would not confirm
or deny the Iraqi report but said ``all our inspectors have gone to
work on Monday in a normal way.''

Syrian President prepared to meet Israeli leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad is ready to meet
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, if Israel agrees to
resume peace talks from the point they were stopped nearly three
years ago, Israel army radio said Monday.
	   Netanyahu said he has not received any message from Syria, and
rejected what he called preconditions for resuming the talks.
	   Army radio quoted American sources, saying U.S. President Bill
Clinton initiated the contact, asking Assad whether he would be
prepared to move forward in talks with Israel.
	   Assad reportedly replied that he is ready to resume the talks
where they left off, and to meet Netanyahu. Up to now Assad has
refused to sit down with Israeli leaders.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz also said Assad was making overtures
to Israel. In two separate meetings with U.S. visitors, one a
diplomat and one a businessman, Assad said that if Israel withdrew
from the Golan Heights, it would enjoy quiet on the borders with
Syria and Lebanon, Haaretz reported.
	   The issue of where the talks left off is the main disagreement
between Israel and Syria. The Syrians claim Israel's previous
government offered to return all of the Golan, a strategic plateau
Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange
for peace. But the proposal was never made officially.
	   Netanyahu's government says a proposal that was never made
officially does not count. Therefore, Netanyahu insists that the
talks must resume without conditions.

IAEA chief urges North Korea to open suspect underground nuclear
</HEADLINE>
facility &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The head of the United Nations'
nuclear watchdog agency was quoted Monday as saying North Korea
should open a suspected underground nuclear site to international
inspection.
	   Mohammad Elbaradei, director-general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, made the remark in a meeting with South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung, Kim's office said.
	   ``The best solution to the dispute is dialogue, through which
North Korea will voluntarily open the suspected facility,''
presidential spokeswoman Park Sung-suk quoted Elbaradei as saying.
	   The IAEA chief was in Seoul attending a nuclear safety seminar.
On the sidelines, he met with South Korean government officials to
discuss the North's nuclear programs.
	   The United States and South Korea suspect North Korea is
building an underground facility for nuclear weapons development,
but admit they have no solid proof.
	   In discussions with U.S. officials two weeks ago, North Korea
rejected Washington's demand for unlimited access to the suspected
underground site at Kumchang-ri, north of its capital, Pyongyang.
	   The site is 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the North's
main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, which has been frozen under a
1994 nuclear accord with the United States.
	   North Korea insists the new site is not nuclear related. But it
said it would allow a one-time inspection of the site, if the
United States paid it dlrs 300 million.
	   The United States has rejected the North's offer.
	   The two countries are scheduled to meet again in New York and
Washington later this week to discuss the issue.
	   Equating North Korea's nuclear issue with that of Iraq,
Elbaradei told the South Korean president that the North's
communist government has a tendency to use nuclear issues as
political and economic bargaining chips, the spokesman said.
	   North Korea refused the IAEA's repeated efforts to check its
nuclear activities before they were frozen by the 1994 accord with
the United States.
	   Before the accord was signed, North Korea was suspected of
having extracted enough weapons-grade plutonium to make one or two
atomic bombs.
	   The IAEA warns that it will not technically certify two modern
nuclear reactors being built in North Korea by Western countries
unless suspicions over its underground facility are cleared up.
	   The two Western-developed light-water reactors are a reward for
North Korea's promise to abandon its old Soviet-developed
graphite-moderated reactors, which produce far greater amounts of
weapons-grade plutonium.
	   Under a separate international accord, North Korea must obtain
the IAEA's technical verification before starting commercial
operation of the two reactors in 2003.

 &UR; ST. KITTS: Mudslide buries vehicles &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) _ Heavy rains launched a mudslide
that barreled along a gully into downtown Basseterre, burying as
many as 30 vehicles, police said Sunday.
	   Most of the cars were parked, and no deaths were immediately
reported, although police said one man, Steve Maynard, was missing.
	   Motorists and passengers in taxis scrambled out of their
vehicles after the mudslide, 15 feet (4.5 meters) deep in places,
occurred late Saturday night, said Deputy Police Commissioner
Robert Jeffers.
	   ``It's unbelievable _ you can touch the roofs of buildings
because there's so much silt in the street,'' said government
spokesman Erasmus Williams.
	   Rescuers used construction equipment to extract vehicles from
the debris Sunday. Workers cut open cars to free two women, and one
of the women remained hospitalized Sunday evening.
	   By Sunday night, workers had reached most of the cars and no
other victims had been found, Williams said.
	   The slide occurred after the island was drenched with 4.8 inches
of rain in four hours, Williams said. Smaller mud slides in other
areas blocked roads and downed utility and telephone polls,
plunging parts of the island into darkness.
 &UR; GRENADA: Foreign minister resigns, party loses majority
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Grenadian Foreign Minister Raphael
Fletcher resigned Sunday, citing differences with Prime Minister
Keith Mitchell over an audit of government finances.
	   ``This is something that grows, and there comes a time when you
feel you cannot take any more. I reached that point,'' Fletcher
told a local radio station.
	   Fletcher said he would join another defector, Grace Duncan, in
the opposition Grenada United Labor Party, robbing Mitchell's New
National Party of its majority when the House of Representatives
sits on Friday.
	   Duncan was banished from the Cabinet in 1997 over a disagreement
with Mitchell.
	   The change reverses the 9-6 majority of the New National Party
government to 8-7 in favor of the opposition.
	   It also leaves a gaping hole in the Cabinet. In addition to the
foreign ministry, Fletcher oversaw the government's legal affairs
and local government ministries, was leader of government business
in the House of Representatives and was Mitchell's deputy prime
minister.
	   The deputy prime minister title is an unofficial post given to a
senior member of government.
 &UR; CARIBBEAN: Two former leaders of Caribbean Community die
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Two former leaders of the
Caribbean Community, William Demas and Kurleigh King, have died
within hours of each other, officials confirmed Sunday.
	   Demas, 69, the trade group's first secretary general, died
Saturday of kidney failure linked to worsening diabetes at St.
Clair Medical Center in Trinidad, Caribbean Community officials
confirmed.
	   King, 65, led the group from 1978 to 1983 and died Friday night
in Iowa, where he was living. His death from cancer was confirmed
Sunday by the Barbados Central Bank, which he directed between 1987
and 1992.
	   Both men helped the collection of English-speaking states
weather recessions and lay the groundwork for stable economies
following centuries under British rule.
	   Demas, a Trinidadian economist, headed the Caribbean Free Trade
Area beginning in 1970 and was the first leader of the group's
successor, the 15-member Caribbean Community, which was formed in
1973. He left the position in 1974.
	   ``He laid the foundation for what the rest of us are trying to
build on,'' said current Secretary General Edwin Carrington, who is
also from Trinidad and Tobago.
	   Demas helped form the Caribbean Development Bank and was a
former chief of Trinidad and Tobago's central bank.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Leader of international group wants U.S. out
	   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The new leader of Socialist
International, an organization of left-leaning political parties,
said Sunday he will use the post to demand that the United States
pull out of Puerto Rico.
	   Ruben Berrios, a longtime activist for Puerto Rican
independence, said he will lobby for the United States to remove
its military bases and free 15 colleagues held in federal jails.
	   ``I am going to insist on the release of the political prisoners
and the de-militarization of Puerto Rico,'' Berrios said during a
radio interview in southern Ponce.
	   Berrios was appointed president of Socialist International on
Friday during the organization's meeting in Geneva. The group's 160
member parties includes 13 of the 15 governing parties in Western
Europe and those governing leading Latin America countries such as
Mexico and Brazil.
	   Berrios replaces Dominican Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, who died
earlier this year.
	   The United States invaded Puerto Rico in 1898 during the
Spanish-American War, only months after the island had won autonomy
from Spain. The island is now a U.S. commonwealth, meaning its 3.8
million people are U.S. citizens but cannot vote for president and
have no vote in the U.S. Congress.
	   The United States also maintains Navy and Army bases in Puerto
Rico and has taken over most of a neighboring island, Vieques, for
war games and weapons storage.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Cayman Islands woman sets freediving record
	   OCALA, Florida (AP) _ A 25-year-old woman from Grand Cayman
captured the freshwater freediving record by plunging 185 feet down
a sinkhole in 2:05.
	   ``It's not much of a spectator sport,'' joked Tayna Streeter
after her record-setting dive Saturday. ``I mean, first she's gone
two minutes then she's back. Tada! What a show.''
	   Streeter only discovered her freediving ability one year ago.
Since then, she has captured the American record in the women's
saltwater free-diving by diving to 175 feet, the world women's
record in saltwater free-diving at 220 feet and the ``no limits''
dive, in which Streeter dove in a weighted sled to 370 feet.
	   Streeter's non-stop drive to set new records has left her a
little breathless.
	   ``I'm physically in really good shape but I'm a little worn out.
... I think I'll take a break and ride this wave a while,'' said
Streeter, an American born in the Caymans.
	   Streeter, social secretary to the governor of the Cayman
Islands, said she never pictured herself a world record holder.
``Not even this time last year did I imagine I would be doing
this,'' she said.
	   Streeter, who has attempted the world record three times since
March, spent the morning at Hal Watt's Forty Fathom Grotto, a
technical diving center where there is 250-feet sinkhole.
 &UR; GUYANA: Government seeking buyer for half of Guyana Airways
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The Guyanese government said Sunday it
will sell a 50 percent stake in troubled Guyana Airways.
	   Advertisements seeking a buyer for the state-owned airline will
be placed in publications around the world this week, a government
statement said.
	   Guyana Airways has a monopoly on non-stop routes from Georgetown
to Miami, New York and Toronto. It also has Caribbean routes and
flies small airplanes to isolated villages deep in Guyana's South
American forests.
	   Authorities said terms of the sale would be similar to the
privatization this year of the Guyana Electricity Corp. Under that
arrangement, the private buyers would be allowed to manage the
company.
	   The airline, which leases aircraft for its North American
routes, has suffered a string of problems in the last year.
Mechanical difficulties stranded dozens of passengers for days in
Puerto Rico and Curacao, and this spring a leased Boeing 757
clipped the wing of another aircraft at the Georgetown airport.
	   In July, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration temporarily
banned one 757 from flying to the United States while it examined
the aircraft's maintenance records. It later removed the
restriction.
	   Before the recent troubles, the airline was the only
profit-making long-haul carrier in the Caribbean. In 1997 the
company lost dlrs 2 million, its first loss in four years,
prompting a reorganization in February.

Greeks brace for weeks of strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Motorists filled their tanks and apartment
managers rushed for heating oil Monday fearing shortages because of
a strike by customs officers.
	   The walkout is just one of many planned strikes this week that
could seriously disrupt life around Greece. Railway workers and
doctors at state-run hospitals also began strikes Monday.
	   Others expected later in the week include trolley and bus
drivers, tax officials and school teachers.
	   The strikes are part of growing labor union opposition to
government fiscal reforms aimed at gaining Greece a spot in the
European Union's single currency club by 2001. Teachers and others
also are resisting changes seeking to bring Greek education and
business practices more in line with the rest of the EU.
	   Customs union officials called the five-day strike to protest
government plans to unify pension funds from various agencies.
	   Greeks worry about shortages of gasoline and heating oil as
tankers and trucks are left stranded. The Socialist government is
seeking a court injunction ordering the workers back to their
posts.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of the single currency. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.

Singapore government defends detention of former political
</HEADLINE>
prisoners &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore on Monday defended an arrest that led
to 23 years' detention and then nine years of severe restrictions
for a former member of Parliament, saying his imprisonment without
trial was to avert civil unrest.
	   The government freed Chia Thye Poh, 57, from all restrictions
last week.
	   One of the world's longest-held political detainees, Chia
refused to sign a confession admitting to being a communist after
his 1966 arrest under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite detention without charge or trial.
	   He was a member of Parliament from the now defunct Barisan
Sosialis Party, but quit his post shortly before his arrest to
protest the ``death of parliamentary democracy'' in Singapore.
	   Immediately following his full freedom last Thursday, Chia
called for repeal of the ISA. He also has continued to deny he was
a communist bent on violent change.
	   The Ministry of Home Affairs countered Monday that ``Chia was
arrested for his involvement in the (Malaysian) communist united
front and to avert widespread unlawful demonstrations and
violence.''
	   The ministry's statement added that ``he advocated armed
struggle and violence'' and had ``declared his resorting to an
unconstitutional struggle on the streets,'' charges that Chia has
denied for years.
	   ``The Barisan Sosialis Party stated categorically at the time
that extra-parliamentary struggles are constitutional struggles,''
he told The Associated Press on Monday.
	   During years of detention, Chia told the authorities that ``all
my past activities were lawful and constitutional,'' he added.
	   He took part in a number of demonstrations prior to his arrest,
including some against the Vietnam War, but said all these protests
were peaceful.
	   Announcing his release, the government said Chia would be freed
from all restrictions, including those curbing his speech, because
``he is unlikely to engage in activities prejudicial to Singapore's
security.''
	   But it warned that ``should Chia in future re-involve himself in
such activities, he well be dealt firmly under the law.''
	   ``I think I am still being watched,'' Chia said three days
later.
	   Human rights organizations and various governments, including
the United States, have repeatedly criticized Singapore for its
tough stance against political dissent and for stifling the
opposition with libel suits.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to deflect public criticism as
casualties mount, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Monday he sympathizes with the mother of every Israeli soldier but
will not pull out of Lebanon without security guarantees.
	   Israel's security Cabinet met for four hours Sunday and heard
briefings from military commanders about the escalating clashes
between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks
while patrolling Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' inside
Lebanon.
	   As the security committee met at Netanyahu's office, opponents
of Israel's occupation of south Lebanon demonstrated outside,
chanting, ``Lebanon is a disaster.''
	   Netanyahu said Monday he understood the protesters' concern.
	   ``Our heart is with every mother and every person who has
suffered'' because of Israel's military presence in Lebanon, he
told Israel radio.
	   However, he added that ``we have the responsibility to do the
right thing for the state of Israel, not for the next newscast.''
	   Rejecting an unconditional pullout, Netanyahu said: ``I didn't
hear a single minister say we should just tuck our tail and get
out.'' He said his first priority is protecting the Israeli
villages along the border with Lebanon.
	   Other goals are to reduce casualties among Israeli soldiers and
to ``protect our allies,'' a reference to the South Lebanese Army,
an Israel-sponsored militia that patrols the security zone
alongside the Israelis.
	   Opponents of an Israeli pullout warn that without Israeli
patrols engaging Hezbollah inside Lebanon, the guerrillas would be
free to attack Israeli border villages.
	   Lebanon's government, demanding an unconditional Israeli
pullout, says that if the Israelis leave, Hezbollah would have no
reason to strike. Hezbollah refuses to give Israel any assurances.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has proposed that Israel
pull its soldiers out of Lebanon gradually, while threatening to
destroy Lebanese infrastructure if Hezbollah guerrillas continue
their attacks.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani agreed.
	   ``Let Beirut wake up one morning without water and electricity
and then, believe me, they (the Lebanese) will send forces (to
restrain Hezbollah), and so will the Syrians,'' Kahalani said.
	   In the Israel radio interview, Netanyahu did not refer
specifically to Sharon's proposal, but observed ``We have great
power. We also have great wisdom. We should use our power wisely.''
	   The Israelis have charged that Syria is behind the escalation of
Hezbollah attacks against Israeli forces, as a way of pressuring
Israel. Until recently, Israeli policy held that Israel could not
withdraw its forces from Lebanon in the absence of a peace
agreement involving Syria.
	   But the Syrians have made it clear that the price for such an
agreement is return of all of the Golan Heights, strategic
highlands overlooking Israel's north and captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's government rejects that.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A powerful earthquake struck two
small, remote islands in eastern Indonesia at night, killing at
least six people. Volunteers spent Monday searching through ruined
buildings and landslides for survivors.
	   Local government officials said at least 153 people were injured
and more than 180 homes and buildings were damaged.
	   Roads were cut and bridges destroyed, hampering search and
rescue efforts.
	   Local police Sgt. Hafid said three men and three women had been
confirmed dead on worst-hit Mangole Island. No deaths were reported
on neighboring Taliabu Island, despite widespread injuries and
damage.
	   Two strong aftershocks were felt and hundreds of people ran to
the safety of a soccer field on Mangole after the magnitude-6.5
quake struck Sunday night. More than 7,000 people were spending
Monday night in tents or in the open in fear of their homes
collapsing.
	   Dozens of wooden houses slid into the sea and one of many
landslide destroyed Mangole's main docks.
	   Witnesses said large cracks scarred the streets of Mangole's
largest town, Dofa, and elsewhere on the island, which has a
population of about 38,000.
	   Officials feared the numbers of dead and injured could rise as
information came in from outlying villages.
	   Urgent supplies of food and medicine were needed, they said.
	   Neither island has a major hospital. A local government
official, Karim Wamona, said emergency flights were taking
seriously injured victims to neighboring islands for urgent
treatment.
	   ``People are now gathering in a football field. There was a lot
of panic. They are too afraid to sleep because there might be
aftershocks,'' police Sgt. Yopi Sariwating said by telephone from
Mangole.
	   He said the quake lasted only a few seconds.
	   ``But it was biggest anyone here had ever felt. This is the
worst damage this island has had from an earthquake,'' Sariwating
said.
	   Hafid said five people were killed when the roof of a plywood
factory collapsed.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted factory executives as
saying more workers might still be trapped in the wreckage.
	   A sixth victim died when the landslide buried the docks. At
least three loading vehicles had been swept into the sea.
	   The search for casualties was continuing on the island, about
1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) northeast of Indonesia's capital,
Jakarta.
	   Electricity supplies had been cut and telecommunications with
both islands were patchy.
	   Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said the quake
had a magnitude of 6.5.
	   It struck at 10:10 p.m. (1410 GMT) Sunday and was centered
beneath the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) south of
the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi, the agency said.
	   Earlier, the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said the quake
had a preliminary magnitude of 7.6.
	   The geological survey issued a tsunami warning for the Western
Pacific. The alert for Japan, however, was lifted after about two
hours.
	   Mangole, an island dominated by the timber industry, is part of
the Maluku archipelago, known in colonial times as the Spice
Islands.
	   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on nearby Flores Island.
	   More than 2,000 people were killed in July when a tsunami hit
the northern coast of neighboring Papua New Guinea.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of
North America across to Japan, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific
and New Zealand.
	   A magnitude-6 quake can cause severe damage if centered beneath
a heavily populated area, while a magnitude-7 quake can cause
widespread, heavy damage.

FIFA still welcomes dialogue with North Korea on 2002 World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The head of soccer's world governing
body said Monday his organization would considering allowing North
Korea to stage a few games of the 2002 World Cup.
	   ``FIFA will not close the door. We are open to any dialogue,''
said Joseph S. Blatter, adding he will visit North Korea next fall
at the invitation of the North's sports minister.
	   But Blatter said the staging of World Cup games by North Korea
is a political issue that first has to be resolved between North
and South Korea.
	   ``FIFA is a sports organization. And the first step should be
made by a political entity, not a sports entity,'' he said.
	   Japan and South Korea are co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup, the
first in Asia and the first to have co-hosts.
	   South Korean soccer officials have said they would like North
Korea to share two or three of the 32 matches South Korea will
stage. North Korea has taken no position on the matter.
	   Blatter said FIFA officials who recently visited South Korea
submitted a ``positive'' report on its preparations for the games.
	   Blatter said he personally believes the 2002 Games should be
completed before the end of June to avoid the July rainy season in
Japan and South Korea.
	   The World Cup finals have traditionally been held in June and
July, avoiding pro league schedules in Europe and South America.
FIFA plans to make a final decision on the issue next month.
	   Blatter arrived in Seoul Sunday for a two-day visit. He paid a
courtesy call on President Kim Dae-jung on Monday and talked with
Chung Mong-june, chairman of the Korean Football Association.
	   From Seoul, Blatter flies to Tokyo to see the Toyota Cup, the
world club championship.

Opposition activist re-arrested minutes after posting bail

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An outspoken human rights activist
was arrested Monday, only minutes after he walked out of court
after posting bail on another charge.
	   Tian Chua, chairman of the opposition Coalition of People's
Democracy, was picked up 10 days ago by plainclothes officers after
police had dispersed an anti-government demonstration. The
protesters were voicing support for ousted Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, currently on trial on charges of corruption and
sexual misconduct.
	   Members of Tian's coalition, which is composed of 20 human
rights and opposition political groups, have protested that he was
beaten while in police custody.
	   Tian was charged in court Monday with illegal assembly. His
sister posted the 2,000 ringgit (dlrs 526) bail. As soon as he
walked out of the courthouse, however, police placed him in
handcuffs and put him into a waiting van.
	   ``Continue the struggle!'' Tian shouted from the police van, his
clenched fist held high. ``Long live the struggle!''
	   The police who arrested him Monday were from his Kuala Lumpur
neighborhood of Petaling Jaya.
	   Tian's attorney, Sivarasa Rasiah, said no reason was given for
his arrest. He believes it may be related to documents taken from
Tian's house when it was searched by police after his first arrest.
	   ``What happened to him is an abuse of the police process,'' said
Elizabeth Wong, coordinator of Malaysia's leading human rights
group, SUARAM, a member of Tian's coalition. ``By re-arresting him,
they are punishing him as well as prolonging his detention.''
	   Supporters who have held nightly vigils in front of the Campbell
Police Station, where he was held until his arraignment Monday,
said they would now stand vigil in front of the Petaling Jaya
police station.
	   Police have arrested more than 300 people at street rallies

Ex-POWs lose Japanese court case, but are hopeful about appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with lawyers for the group saying
decision acknowledges wrongdoing by Japanese military and
predicting possible victory on appeal &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Monday rejected a compensation
lawsuit by Dutch POWs from World War II, but the group called the
ruling a partial victory and said it could win an appeal.
	   ``The door is now slightly open,'' said Gerard Jungslager, a
legal counselor. ``We have strong grounds for appeal.''
	   The class-action lawsuit was filed by eight people who were
forced into slave labor by Japanese soldiers in countries now known
as Indonesia, Singapore and Myanmar.
	   The plaintiffs demanded a total of dlrs 176,000 from the
Japanese government to compensate for physical abuses suffered in
prison camps in the former Dutch East Indies, which Japan invaded
in the 1940s. The only woman among the plaintiffs sued for being
forced into sexual slavery by Japanese troops.
	   The suit was filed in January 1994 on behalf of more than 35,000
Dutch people who claim they were victimized by Japanese forces in
Asia during the war.
	   On Monday, the Tokyo District Court acknowledged that Japanese
soldiers had violated human rights protected by the 1907 Hague
conventions, but ruled that the international law does not permit
individuals to sue the government in wartime compensation cases.
	   It was that admission of wrongdoing, and a difference of opinion
over the kind of lawsuits that former Dutch POWs are permitted to
file, that left Jungslager optimistic about their chances of
winning the appeal before Japan's High Court.
	   During the war, Japan forced many POWs to work in shipyards,
mines and jungles in violation of international law. They were also
beaten and some were executed. Thousands of women across Asia were
forced into brothels for Japanese troops.
	   Worse still, the POW death rate at the Japanese camps was 27
percent, compared to a 4 percent rate at Allied camps.
	   After World War II, Allied nations used the 1951 San Francisco
peace treaty to forge bilateral treaties with Japan that resolved
the issue of compensation for POWs from their countries. For
instance, Japan paid the Netherlands about dlrs 1 million.
	   Japanese courts often use those treaties to reject compensation
claims by ex-prisoners, as the Tokyo District Court did last week
in a case by seven plaintiffs on behalf of 20,000 ex-POWs from
Britain, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
	   In Monday's ruling, Jungslager said, the court pointed out that
the Hague conventions don't permit Dutch individuals to file such
lawsuits, only their own governments on their behalf.
	   But he said that when Japan and the Netherlands signed their
Stikker Yoshida protocol in 1956, as part of the San Francisco
Peace Treaty, his country agreed to maintain Dutch rights to file
individual suits.
	   ``We are convinced that Dutch individuals can bring forward a
claim for compensation for the wrongdoings of the Japanese military
in the former Dutch East Indies,'' said Jungslager.

Rival Korean monks clash in leadership dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ At least seven shaven-headed monks
were injured Monday when rival monks clashed anew in a leadership
dispute in South Korea's largest Buddhist order.
	   Hundreds of gray-robed monks, many of them wearing yellow
helmets, exchanged punches and kicks as they tried to take control
of Chogye Temple in central Seoul.
	   It was the third violent clash at the temple since early this
month, when dissident monks drove out mainstream rivals from the
temple and took control of its administrative office.
	   The latest clash occurred as an estimated 2,000 mainstream monks
from throughout the country attempted to regain control of the
temple, which has been occupied by dissident monks for three weeks.
	   The temple grounds were strewn with smashed window panes,
sticks, burned furniture and garbage. Police said the injured were
hospitalized with minor head and other wounds.
	   About 1,000 Buddhist followers, holding placards appealing for a
peaceful solution, watched the battle as it continued for more than
three hours until after nightfall.
	   As a bulldozer moved into the temple grounds to clear piles of
sticks, panels and other debris set up as barricades, hundreds of
helmeted mainstream monks tried to move into the administrative
building.
	   About 800 rival monks holed up inside the building repelled them
by spraying fire extinguishers and water from hoses and hurling
rocks and furniture,
	   About 1,200 riot police stood by but did not intervene. Past
police interventions in religious disputes have given the force a
political black eye.
	   The leadership dispute in Chogye, the largest Buddhist
denomination in South Korea, erupted in November when Song Wol-ju
announced his bid for a third four-year term.
	   His opponents, including the order's spiritual leader, Wol Ha,
83, urged him to step down.
	   A rule stating that the order's chief monk cannot serve more
than two terms was enacted in 1994 in an attempt to prevent the
office from wielding too much power.
	   Song claims that the rule cannot be applied for his case,
because he could not finish his first term in the early 1980s
because of dispute with the then military government.
	   Chogye, which emphasizes zen meditation, claims 8 million
worshipers. South Korea has a population of 44 million.

Police kill 2 smugglers, seize 1.5 tons of hashish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Police fought an hour-long gun battle
with drug smugglers in central Sudan, killing two and confiscating
1.5 tons of hashish, state television reported Sunday night.
	   Police, acting on a tip, cornered seven smugglers near the town
of Ed-Dueim, which is 190 kilometers (miles 120) south of the
capital Khartoum, the television said.
	   Two of the men were killed in the gun battle, but five fled and
were being sought, it said.
	   A police statement said the 1.5 tons of hashish _ the country's
largest single drug seizure _ had a street value of more than a
billion Sudanese pounds (about dlrs 500,000) and was destined for
Khartoum for sale.
	   It said police acted after receiving a tip about the drug
shipment, which apparently originated in western Darfur state.
	   ``This is one of our greatest achievements that came as a result
of coordination among the various police departments,'' the police
statement said.

22 illegal gold miners die in central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Fifteen people drowned when they tried to
cross a river to a gold mining site in central Vietnam, local
police said Monday.
	   The incident occurred last week when a boat and a makeshift
craft carrying about 30 illegal gold miners capsized in Quang Nam
province, a police officer of Phuoc Son district said.
	   In another incident, seven illegal gold miners died in Phuoc Son
last week when their tunnels collapsed, the officer said.
	   The army has been deployed to crack down on illegal gold mining
in the district, but he said hundreds of miners still operate at
the jungle site.
	   Until last week, Quang Nam was suffering from its worst floods
in more than 30 years, with 47 people dead and 145 billion dong
(dlrs 10.4 million) in damage, a huge amount for the poor province.

Greeks brace for weeks of strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Motorists filled their tanks and apartment
managers rushed for heating oil Monday fearing shortages in
expectation of a strike by customs officers which could lead off a
week of crippling strikes.
	   Railway workers and doctors at state-run hospitals also began
strikes Monday. Others expected later in the week include trolley
and bus drivers, tax officials and school teachers.
	   The strikes are part of growing labor union opposition to
government fiscal reforms aimed at gaining Greece a spot in the
European Union's single currency club by 2001. Teachers and others
also are resisting changes seeking to bring Greek education and
business practices more in line with the rest of the EU.
	   Customs union officials called the five-day strike to protest
government plans to unify pension funds from various agencies.
	   Greeks worry about shortages of gasoline and heating oil as
tankers and trucks are left stranded. The Socialist government is
seeking a court injunction ordering the workers back to their
posts.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of the single currency. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.

Men or women, it's Austria No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ Only the Austrian women's team managed to
deflect the spotlight from the men.
	   While Stephan Eberharter won a super-G and Thomas Stangassinger
a slalom in this Colorado resort, Austria's Renate Goetschl won two
downhills and Alexandra Meissnitzer a super-G to give the unit
nicknamed the ``Power Team'' five victories in three days and eight
in 11 races this season.
	   Stangassinger, at 33 the oldest racer on the men's tour, gave
Austria its first slalom title of the season by holding off the
second-run charge of France's Sebastian Amiez. The Frenchman, only
22nd after Saturday's first run, outlasted all challengers until
Stangassinger came down Aspen Mountain.
	   ``I knew Amiez must have had a special run,'' Stangassinger
said. ``I had to wait a very long time for my second run, and I
knew the snow was getting softer.
	   ``I tried to have an easy, good run. I tried to find a feeling
and not be too fast through the first gates. My skiing style is to
look for the cleanest line. It was enough.''
	   But Amiez was not so happy.
	   ``My first run was no good,'' he said. ``It's the first time in
my career I've been so slow. I was upset between runs and said to
myself, `Let's go for it.'''
	   Although he lost most of his 1.47-second lead over Amiez,
Stangassinger prevailed by .26 seconds. Stangassinger's combined
time for two runs was 1 minute, 27.32 seconds. Amiez was timed in
1:27.58 and Norway's Tom Stiansen claimed third in 1:27.69, .01
better than teammate Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
	   Another Norwegian, Finn Christian Jagge, also made a big move in
the afternoon, using the fastest second run to improve 21 places to
finish seventh.
	   ``When I finished the second run in front of Jagge, I had a good
feeling,'' Amiez said. ``I was starting to hope for a top-10
finish. Then, as each racer came down, I realized I could finish
higher.''
	   Italian Angelo Weiss, who started 38th but placed ninth after
the initial run, finished fifth in 1:27.82. Austrian Christian
Mayer was sixth in 1:27.94.
	   Austria had a chance to sweep the podium, but Mayer fell back
after placing third in the morning and second-place Mario Reiter
straddled a gate within sight of the finish line.
	   Stangassinger, the 1994 Olympic champion, finished second in the
slalom standings behind teammate Thomas Sykora in 1997 and 1998 and
then decided to retire.
	   He changed his mind during the summer, however, saying he
couldn't pass up the excitement of racing against the new skiers on
the tour. And, he added, it was even better to beat them.
	   After deciding to come back, Stangassinger's bid for bigger
prizes got a major boost when Sykora went down with an injured
patellar tendon. He's expected to miss at least six weeks, which
makes Stangassinger the favorite for the slalom title and for the
gold medal in the World Alpine Ski Championships at Vail, Colo.,
starting Jan. 31.
	   Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., was the top American in the
race, but his time of 45.98 seconds for the first run wasn't enough
to get him into the field of 30 for the second run. He was 34th.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin continued to be treated
for pneumonia in a government hospital Monday while his Communist
foes in the Russian parliament worked on an impeachment motion.
	   The president's office said that the 67-year old leader is
``getting better'' and was expected to hold several meetings with
officials on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, a parliamentary impeachment panel was pondering
Monday whether Yeltsin, as the commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, was responsible for the steady decay of the cash-strapped
Russian military.
	   They failed to make a definite conclusion as several lawmakers
reasoned it would be hard to prove that Yeltsin's neglect of the
armed forces was a premeditated action.

Petrofina, giant in Belgian business, to be sold to European oil group,

paper says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Shares in the oil and petrochemicals company
Petrofina SA, a giant in Belgian business, were suspended Monday following a
report it will likely be sold to a leading European oil group in the next few
days. 
	   Monday's edition of La Libre Belgique newspaper said negotiators from an
unidentified potential buyer had reached a breakthrough over the weekend with
Petrofina's leading shareholder Albert Frere, agreeing to the terms of a
buyout. The company refused to comment Monday. 
	   Instead, Petrofina announced a press conference for early Tuesday.
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors that the
company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA. Other companies rumored
to be interested were France's Total SA and Italy's ENI SpA.
	   Petrofina, which employs some 15,000 people worldwide is one of Belgium's
biggest industrial companies. Its myriad interests in other enterprises,
forced the suspension in trading of other shares too, including energy
company Electrabel, utilities company Tractebel SA, holding companies
Companie National a Portefeuille, Sidro, Sofina SA, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert
SA and Electrafina SA.

Suharto graft inquiry delayed because of lack of volunteers

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The formation of a commission to look
into corruption allegations against ex-President Suharto has been
postponed because not enough people have agreed to join it, a
senior Indonesian official said Monday.
	   President B.J. Habibie had been scheduled to announce the
commission's composition Monday.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said 30 people had been invited to
sit on the panel.
	   ``But not all have replied,'' he told reporters at the
presidential palace, adding that an announcement might be made in
one or two days.
	   Meanwhile, Suharto's legal adviser has warned that the
government could be threatened if the former autocrat is made to
face court charges for corruption.
	   ``If Suharto does go to court, it could drag down the
government, bringing senior incumbent and former officials _ as
well as all the cronies suspected of accruing ill-gotten wealth _
into messy litigation,'' The Jakarta Post quoted Yohanes Yacob as
saying.
	   On Monday, about 200 students demanded that Suharto be put on
trial. They marched toward Suharto's house in an affluent Jakarta
suburb but were stopped by troops.
	   Police and soldiers heavily guard his residence and have blocked
protesters from marching there several times recently.
	   The delay comes amid growing skepticism about the effectiveness
of the inquiry, which the government has said will be conducted by
a group of ``credible'' individuals.
	   Akbar said the commission would have the power to examine
Suharto's records over a three-month period so as to establish
whether he had acted corruptly during 32 years in power.
	   But it would not be authorized to search for money that Suharto
allegedly stashed overseas. This would be done by police and the
attorney general's office, Akbar said.
	   Suharto, 77, who had ruled the would's fourth most populous
country with an iron hand since 1966, resigned in May amid
widespread student protests and riots that claimed about 1,200
lives.
	   Critics have since accused him of siphoning off state wealth to
benefit his family's massive business empires.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Some opponents claim it is many times that.
	   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that he will
cooperate with any investigation into his affairs. He has also
denied that he has hidden away a fortune in foreign banks.
	   Habibie ordered the commission set up after an earlier
investigation by Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib failed to
find any evidence against Suharto. Many rejected it as a whitewash.
	   On Monday The Indonesian Observer newspaper quoted a former
Suharto Cabinet minister as doubting the new investigation would
uncover much.
	   Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, an ex-environment minister who is now a
vocal government critic, questioned the resolve of officials to
investigate allegations against Suharto.
	   He said many members of the government had ties with Suharto.
	   ``How could these people possibly carry out an investigation? Be
realistic,'' Sarwono was quoted as saying.
	   ``It cannot be denied that there is a special link between the
leadership of President Habibie and his predecessor,'' he said.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend and former loyal subordinate of
Suharto.
	   He has repeatedly said that while his old boss should be
investigated, any inquiry must be conducted in accordance with
Indonesian law and be based on the presumption of innocence.

Cold kills 39 in Moscow this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unusually cold weather in Moscow killed at least
39 people in November, medical officials said on Monday.
	   Winter has come early to the Russian capital this year, with
temperatures below freezing through most of the month.
	   Since the beginning of October, 45 people have died of
hypothermia, the city ambulance service said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   In addition, 143 people were hospitalized with hypothermia and
51 with frostbite, it said. One man was injured by a falling
icicle, but he was not hospitalized.
	   Cold claims dozens of lives in Moscow each winter. The majority
of victims are homeless people or alcoholics who pass out on the
street.

Russian government again delays on budget plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 5th graf with Primakov to meet visiting IMF head

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government canceled plans Monday to
discuss the 1999 budget, once again delaying efforts to come up
with plans to tackle the country's economic crisis.
	   A government spokesman said the Cabinet meeting on the budget
had been rescheduled for Thursday, but gave no details.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has yet to produce
firm plans to tackle the financial crisis since Russia effectively
defaulted on some debts in August and devalued the currency.
	   Primakov's government has requested more aid from the
International Monetary Fund, warning Russia faces serious problems
unless it gets more funding. But the IMF and Western governments
say they won't provide any act until Russia adopts a realistic
budget.
	   Primakov will hold a series of meetings this week in Moscow with
visiting IMF chief Michel Camdessus, who will be in Russia to
discuss the government's efforts to deal with the economic
situation.
	   Russia's finance minister repeated pleas Sunday for IMF
assistance.
	   ``Money is not the main thing we need from the IMF, although we
need that too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax
news agency. ``We, above all, expect understanding from the IMF,
and a program to relieve Russia's debt _ that is, dlrs 17.5
billion.''
	   Russia has been hoping the IMF would release the next
installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package that was frozen in
August after the crisis erupted.
	   Zadornov said he hoped the IMF would not only release the next
loan installment, but help Russia restructure its foreign debt _
and perhaps persuade some creditors to let Russia off the hook.
	   ``Without the consent of the IMF, creditors won't agree to
defer, or possibly partly write off, Russia's external debt,''
Zadornov said.
	   Another government financial officer, Alexander Pochinok, was
quoted as saying Sunday that a 1999 draft budget assumes that
Russia will receive the remaining dlrs 17.5 billion in loans from
the IMF, World Bank and Japan.

Racy tape in Taiwan mayoral race questioned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The tape's contents may have been
incendiary, but its impact was muted.
	   District prosecutors in the southern city of Kaohsiung said
Monday they discovered signs of editing on a tape purporting to be
mayor Wu Den-yih whispering sweet nothings to a mistress.
	   Their findings raised questions about the tape's authenticity,
offering Wu some relief at the height of a re-election campaign in
which he has been accused of infidelity and lying.
	   Surrounded by cheering supporters at the courthouse in
Kaohsiung, Wu instantly went on the offensive by offering a 2
million Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 62,000) reward for the original
tape from which he says the copy was pieced together.
	   ``I'm grateful that this report has finally returned my
innocence. ... We're going to find who is behind this,'' Wu told
reporters.
	   Kaoshiung, 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of Taipei, is
Taiwan's second largest city.
	   Wu still leads in opinion surveys for the elections Saturday,
when the mayor of Taipei and the 225-seat national legislature will
also be chosen. But he has faced a tougher than expected challenge
in his bid for a third eight-year term from the Democratic
Progressive Party's Frank Hsieh, whose party has already won the
neighboring counties away from Wu's Nationalists.
	   Chen Chun-sheng, the DPP city council candidate who released the
tape, rejected the prosecutor's report, saying other independent
analyses _ including one performed in the United States _ had shown
the tape to be credible. Whether the tape actually contained Wu's
voice, possibly edited to form new sentences, remained unclear.
	   Wu has labeled the tape a crude smear attack, and suggested that
Hsieh was behind it, a claim Hsieh has denied.
	   Wu is not the only incumbent who has faced attacks on his sexual
morals this year. Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the DPP was forced
to deny accusations by a former ally that he had slipped into the
Portuguese enclave of Macau numerous times to gamble and visit
prostitutes.
	   Chen's accuser has been unable to present direct evidence
proving his claims.

Netanyahu threatens to hold up accord over Arafat statements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened
Monday walk away from the Mideast peace agreements if Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declares statehood in May.
	   Netanyahu's warning came a day after Arafat said in Washington
that ``I hope that this (coming) year will be the year of the
independent Palestinian state.''
	   The new acrimony came just a little over a week after the
implementation of stage one of the land-for-security agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the plan, Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in
exchange for Palestinian measures against Islamic militants.
	   As part of the accord, Israel also agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners. In the first stage, Israel released 250,
most of them criminals, prompting Palestinian complaints that the
agreement was breached. The Palestinians demand that Israel free
political activists and those jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, flew to
Washington on Monday to raise the issue with Clinton administration
officials. ``This is a crisis situation and we have asked for
American intervention,'' Erekat said Sunday.
	   Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult to
continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would not compromise. ``I do not free
murderers. I do not release people with blood on their hands,'' he
told Israel radio.
	   Israel holds about 2,500 prisoners. Popular pressure on Arafat
has grown, with prisoners' relatives demonstrating daily against
the Palestinian Authority and accusing it of abandoning the
prisoners.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, described Arafat's latest remarks
concerning statehood as a ``a gross violation'' of the Oslo
accords.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that if Arafat
declares a state ``this will mean the collapse of the Oslo
agreements.''
	   The five-year period of Palestinian autonomy expires in May
1999. At this time, the two sides are to have negotiated a
permanent peace agreement, but it seems highly unlikely the
deadline can be met. Arafat has said that once the autonomy period
is over, he has the right to declare a state without waiting for a
peace agreement with Israel.
	   Netanyahu has warned that he would respond by annexing parts of
the West Bank.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu did not make specific threats, saying only
that ``we can do a great deal.'' He said he would raise the issue
when his Cabinet meets again to consider the next stage of the Wye
River peace accord.
	   In another possible point of contention, Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon appointed low-level officials to negotiate an
additional Israeli troop pullback with the Palestinians.
	   Israel's Cabinet has already decided that it would only hand
over an additional 1 percent of the West Bank in an upcoming troop
withdrawal. By naming junior officials without a mandate, Israel
apparently was sending a message to the Palestinians that they
would not receive more than the 1 percent already decided on.
	   The Palestinian team is headed by Erekat.

Former prime minister and wife end marriage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former prime minister Paul Keating and
his wife Annita on Monday announced the end of their 23-year
marriage, but said their decision should not lend credibility to
``malicious'' rumors concerning his Keating's private life.
	   The couple, who married in 1975 and who had four children,
announced their separation in a joint statement.
	   ``We have decided amicably to separate after 23 years of deeply
fulfilling and for the most part happy marriage,'' they said.
	   ``This has been a difficult and painful time for both of us, and
for our children, and if only for their sakes we hope people will
respect our privacy.
	   ``The often malicious rumors that have been circulating for the
past two or three years have not helped us to negotiate these
difficult years, and we sincerely hope this announcement will not
lend them credibility.
	   ``It would be futile to attempt to publicly explain the reasons
for this decision, and we are sure no reasonable person would feel
that we are obliged to try.''
	   Unfounded rumors about Keating surfaced publicly recently when
former governor-general Bill Hayden aired them in a defamation case
in Canberra unrelated to the Keatings.
	   Hayden, like Keating a former federal Labor leader, told a court
about baseless stories that Keating had had an extramarital affair
with a prominent woman, and that he had a predilection for young
men.
	   Hayden said he was simply attempting to show the damage that sex
smears could do to politicians' reputations.

China's central bank says risks growing, pledges tougher rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's central bank chief has warned that risks
to the country's financial system ``can no longer be ignored'' and
pledged tougher regulation of the shaky banking sector.
	   In an article published Monday in the ruling Communist Party's
People's Daily, People's Bank of China governor Dai Xianglong cited
rising debts among state banks, small financial firms and local
government-run trust and investment houses.
	   Dai said there were too many trust and investment companies _
which act as investment arms of local governments _ and many were
putting short-term deposits into speculative property ventures.
	   The People's Bank shut down the Guangdong International Trust
and Investment Corp. in October because it couldn't pay dlrs 2
billion in debts.
	   In the People's Daily article, Dai said ``several'' of the 240
local trust companies ``now face difficulties'' because of
inadequate supervision.
	   In addition, Dai noted the ``relatively high'' proportion of bad
loans at state commercial banks and small and medium-size financial
institutions. The People's Bank has said more than 20 percent of
all state bank loans are non-performing, mainly those to
inefficient state industries.
	   ``In our financial industry, there are some risks that can no
longer be ignored,'' Dai wrote.
	   He called it ``utterly essential'' to intensify regulation of
companies trading in securities and the insurance industry. Aside
from tighter banking regulations, Dai indicated little change in
other financial policies.
	   He said that for the medium to long term, monetary policies will
remain ``appropriately tight'' to keep inflation at bay. Citing
more than dlrs 140 billion in foreign reserves, Dai vowed to
maintain the stability of China's currency, the yuan.
	   The People's Daily article was written to commemorate the
central bank's 50th anniversary, and Dai, who became the bank's
chief in 1995, lauded the institution's achievements.

Saddam's son Odai awarded Ph.D. with distinction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq leader Saddam Hussein's oldest son,
Odai, has been awarded a doctorate in political science with
distinction by Baghdad University, all of Iraq's state-run dailies
reported Monday on their front pages.
	   The awarding of the degree follows the printing and free
distribution by the government of thousands of copies of Odai's
dissertation, ``The Post-Cold War World,'' in which he predicted
the moral and economic decline of the United States.
	   The newspapers said that after receiving the degree Sunday, Odai
presented it to his father. On the cover of the government version
of the thesis, Saddam was depicted riding a white stallion and
spearing a snake _ presumably representing the United States.
	   In addition to his academic success, Odai, 34, runs the daily
newspaper Babil and a state-run television station and is head of
Iraq's Olympic committee.
	   He also commands the Fedayeen Saddam, or ``Saddam's Martyrs,'' a
paramilitary force of 40,000 who wear black masks on duty and are
often shown on television butchering cats, dogs and wolves and then
eating the raw meat to demonstrate their ferocity.

Petrofina to be sold to European oil group, paper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Shares in the oil and petrochemical
company Petrofina SA, a giant in Belgian business, were suspended
Monday following a report it will likely be sold to a leading
European oil group in the next few days.
	   Monday's edition of La Libre Belgique newspaper said negotiators
from an unidentified potential buyer had reached a breakthrough
over the weekend with Petrofina's leading shareholder Albert Frere,
agreeing to the terms of a buyout.
	   The company refused to comment Monday. Instead, Petrofina
announced a press conference for early Tuesday.
	   Petrofina stock has been gaining ground in recent days on rumors
that the company was in talks with France's Elf Aquitaine SA. Other
companies rumored to be interested were France's Total SA and
Italy's ENI SpA.
	   Petrofina, which employs some 15,000 people worldwide is one of
Belgium's biggest industrial companies. Its interests in other
enterprises forced the suspension in trading of other shares too,
including energy company Electrabel, utilities company Tractebel
SA, holding companies Companie National a Portefeuille, Sidro,
Sofina SA, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA and Electrafina SA.

Netanyahu threatens to hold up accord over Arafat statements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened
Monday to walk away from the Mideast peace agreements if
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declares statehood in
May.
	   Netanyahu's warning came a day after Arafat said in Washington
that ``I hope that this (coming) year will be the year of the
independent Palestinian state.''
	   The new acrimony came just a little over a week after the
implementation of stage one of the land-for-security agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the plan, Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in
exchange for Palestinian measures against Islamic militants.
	   As part of the accord, Israel also agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners. Israel released 250 prisoners in the first
stage, most of them criminals, prompting Palestinian complaints
that the agreement was breached. The Palestinians demand that
Israel free political activists and those jailed for anti-Israeli
activities.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, flew to
Washington on Monday to raise the issue with Clinton administration
officials. ``This is a crisis situation and we have asked for
American intervention,'' Erekat said Sunday.
	   Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult to
continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would not compromise. ``I do not free
murderers. I do not release people with blood on their hands,'' he
told Israel radio.
	   Israel holds about 2,500 prisoners. Popular pressure on Arafat
has grown, with prisoners' relatives demonstrating daily against
the Palestinian Authority and accusing it of abandoning the
prisoners.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, described Arafat's latest remarks
concerning statehood as a ``a gross violation'' of the Oslo
accords.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that if Arafat
declares a state ``this will mean the collapse of the Oslo
agreements.''
	   The five-year period of Palestinian autonomy expires in May
1999. At this time, the two sides are to have negotiated a
permanent peace agreement, but it seems highly unlikely the
deadline can be met. Arafat has said that once the autonomy period
is over, he has the right to declare a state without waiting for a
peace agreement with Israel.

Racy tape in Taiwan mayoral race questioned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to four-year term, graf 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The tape's contents may have been
incendiary, but its impact was muted.
	   District prosecutors in the southern city of Kaohsiung said
Monday they discovered signs of editing on a tape purporting to be
mayor Wu Den-yih whispering sweet nothings to a mistress.
	   Their findings raised questions about the tape's authenticity,
offering Wu some relief at the height of a re-election campaign in
which he has been accused of infidelity and lying.
	   Surrounded by cheering supporters at the courthouse in
Kaohsiung, Wu instantly went on the offensive by offering a 2
million Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 62,000) reward for the original
tape from which he says the copy was pieced together.
	   ``I'm grateful that this report has finally returned my
innocence. ... We're going to find who is behind this,'' Wu told
reporters.
	   Kaoshiung, 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of Taipei, is
Taiwan's second largest city.
	   Wu still leads in opinion surveys for the elections Saturday,
when the mayor of Taipei and the 225-seat national legislature will
also be chosen. But he has faced a tougher than expected challenge
in his bid for a third four-year term from the Democratic
Progressive Party's Frank Hsieh, whose party has already won the
neighboring counties away from Wu's Nationalists.
	   Chen Chun-sheng, the DPP city council candidate who released the
tape, rejected the prosecutor's report, saying other independent
analyses _ including one performed in the United States _ had shown
the tape to be credible. Whether the tape actually contained Wu's
voice, possibly edited to form new sentences, remained unclear.
	   Wu has labeled the tape a crude smear attack, and suggested that
Hsieh was behind it, a claim Hsieh has denied.
	   Wu is not the only incumbent who has faced attacks on his sexual
morals this year. Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the DPP was forced
to deny accusations by a former ally that he had slipped into the
Portuguese enclave of Macau numerous times to gamble and visit
prostitutes.
	   Chen's accuser has been unable to present direct evidence
proving his claims.

News reports: Italian man confesses killing family, missing since
</HEADLINE>
1989 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A day after returning from Britain, an Italian man
confessed Monday to killing his father, mother and younger brother,
who vanished in 1989, news reports said.
	   Ferdinando Carretta, 36, was arrested Sunday in Rome on arrival
from London, where he'd been living since the family disappeared.
He surfaced after a policeman stopped him for a routine traffic
violation.
	   He had always maintained he knew nothing about his family's
whereabouts, but confessed to the slayings after hours of
questioning in the northern Italian city of Parma, the Italian news
agency ANSA quoted his lawyer as saying.
	   Investigators were reportedly searching for the bodies.
	   Giuseppe Carretta, 62, his wife Marta Chezzi, 58, and younger
son Nicola, 32, were last seen the night of Aug. 4, 1989, leaving
their home in Parma in their camper. The camper was found, empty
and abandoned on Nov. 19, 1989, in Milan.
	   Italian newspapers were full of speculation about the
disappearances, including rumors that Giuseppe Carretta, an
accountant, has embezzled a fortune and had fled to the Caribbean
or South America, but no trace of the family was found.
	   Suspicion also focused on Ferdinando, who bought a pistol just
before the family disappeared. But he, too, remained missing and
the investigation was eventually closed.
	   Carretta surfaced by accident, when he was stopped in London for
ignoring a no-entry sign. He was listed as a missing person and
British authorities contacted their Italian counterparts, reports
said.
	   Italian newspapers said Carretta was living modestly in a
one-room apartment in a blue-collar neighborhood of London and
worked as a messenger for an express delivery service. Carretta
told interviewers he was estranged from his family and left home
because of family problems several days before the family vanished.

Saddam's son Odai awarded Ph.D. with distinction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq leader Saddam Hussein's oldest son,
Odai, has been awarded a doctorate in political science with
distinction by Baghdad University, all of Iraq's state-run dailies
reported Monday on their front pages.
	   The awarding of the degree follows the printing and free
distribution by the government of thousands of copies of Odai's
dissertation, ``The Post-Cold War World,'' in which he predicted
the moral and economic decline of the United States.
	   The newspapers said that after receiving the degree Sunday, Odai
presented it to his father. On the cover of the government version
of the thesis, Saddam was depicted riding a white stallion and
spearing a snake _ presumably representing the United States.
	   In addition to his academic success, Odai, 34, runs the daily
newspaper Babil and a state-run television station and is head of
Iraq's Olympic committee.
	   He also commands the Fedayeen Saddam, or ``Saddam's Martyrs,'' a
paramilitary force of 40,000 who wear black masks on duty and are
often shown on television butchering cats, dogs and wolves and then
eating the raw meat to demonstrate their ferocity.

Iraqis won't get first animal protein in food basket until January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqis will get cheese and milk in their
food rations for the first time in January, instead of in November
as previously planned, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh was
quoted as saying in newspapers Monday.
	   Saleh spoke to Parliament on Sunday, giving an update on Iraq's
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   ``People will receive 250 grams of milk per person and two cans
of baby milk in addition to cheese in January,'' he was quoted as
saying by Al-Thawra, the daily of the ruling Baath Party.
	   U.N. officials confirmed to The Associated Press that Iraqis
would receive the animal protein in their rations in January. They
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Plans to upgrade the food ration earlier were delayed by the
world slump in oil prices, which cut Iraq's earnings under the U.N.
program allowing it to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food and
other necessities for Iraq's 22 million citizens.
	   The proceeds are also used to compensate for losses suffered
during the Gulf War. Saleh said dlrs 187 million would be spent on
food during the fourth phase of the program, while dlrs 1.1 billion
dollars would be spent on compensating the victims of the invastion
and pay the salaries of U.N. employees working with the program.
	   The food is distributed for a small fee in monthly rations that
include flour, rice, sugar, lentils, cooking oil and tea _
providing about 2,000 calories a day per person.
	   While the addition of protein to the ration may sound like good
news, the government and many Iraqis argue the extension of the
program now going into its fifth phase also means the continuation
of sanctions.
	   ``We were hoping to see sanctions lifted not prolonged,'' said
Umm Yassin, 54, a civil servant who heard about upgrading the food
basket Monday.
	   The U.N. sanctions ban oil exports and have devastated Iraq's
economy. The oil-for-food program was approved in December 1996.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify
Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has had
repeated disputes with the inspectors, but they are again working
after the latest run-in ended in mid-November.

Sudan sends Saddam gift of 2 African lions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudan has sent Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein a gift of two African lions, the London-based Al-Wassat
weekly said in its Monday edition.
	   The paper said the beasts, apparently captured in Sudan, were
sent by Sudan's interior minister, Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohamed
Hussein.
	   ``The two lions crossed the Jordanian territories into Iraq last
week,'' the magazine said. Sudanese officials in Jordan confirmed
the report.
	   It was unclear if the lions were intended as a personal gift for
Saddam or for Iraq's zoo, where many animals reportedly have
perished since the United Nations imposed trade sanctions against
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Sudan is among a handful of Arab countries that have supported
Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, which drove Iraq from Kuwait, and its
Islamic government maintains close relations with Baghdad.

Silver Charm tops nominees for dlrs 4 million Dubai World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ America's Silver Charm, who
swept first prize at the last Dubai World Cup, tops the list of
horses nominated for the next running of the 4 million race,
organizers said Monday.
	   ``Should the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner
Silver Charm defend his crown in March, he will be the first Dubai
World Cup winner to attempt do do so,'' race organizers said in a
statement.
	   They said the 4-year-old colt ``retains all his fire and
enthusiasm for racing and so a return to Dubai looks very much on
the cards for the horse.''
	   Silver Charm, owned by Robert and Beverly Lewis, recently came a
close second behind Awesome Again at the Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill Downs.
	   Silver Charm's trainer, Bob Baffert, is leaving nothing to
chance for the dlrs 2.4 million prize he took home from Dubai last
March. Besides his silver wonder he's got four other entries for
the race: Pleasant Drive, Real Quiet, Tahoe Prospector and
Cavonnier.
	   Organizers said they have 62 nominations at the first closing
stage for the race, which made its inaugural run in 1996. Sixteen
will make the final cut for the March 28 race at the Nad Al Sheba
racecourse for the world's richest horse race.
	   Other entries from the United States include Dr. Fong, Victory
Gallop and Malek, the Richard Mandella-trained horse that finished
fourth at the last Dubai World Cup.
	   European entries include the 1998 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
winner Sagamix, Insight And Limnos, Second Empire, and Running Stag
	   Australian champ Might and Power and New Zealand's Champagne
also have been nominated.
	   The home defense from Dubai will come from the world famous
Godolphin stables that belong to Dubai's ruling Al Maktoum family.
Nominations include Cape Verdi, High Rise, Nedawi, Intikhab,
Central Park, City Honors, Faithful Son, Saratoga Springs and Xaar.
	   ``The overall quality of the nominations is very pleasing,''
said Michael Osborne, chairman of the Dubai World Cup.
	   ``I am confident that the 1999 Dubai World Cup will prove as
exciting and competitive as the first three runnings,'' he said.

Singapore.

or 3.2 percent, closing at 10,402.32.
	   Brokers said investors took profits after the index gained

	   Market sentiment in Hong Kong was also dampened by the
government announcement Friday that the territory has sunk deeper
into recession.
	   The government said gross domestic product fell by 7 percent in

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A court ruled Monday that an article in the
opposition Workers Party's newsletter had defamed the organizers of
an ethnic Indian grassroots event, state-run television reported.
	   Singapore's High Court awarded nearly 300,000 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 182,000) in damages to the organizing committee of the 1995
Tamil Language Week, a government-initiated program to promote the
use of the minority language.
	   Workers Party chief J.B. Jeyaretnam, the party's central
committee and its printing company were sued for an article in
their newsletter, The Hammer, that said the organizers were
government stooges seeking political power.
	   Among those on the Tamil organizing committee is member of
Parliament R. Ravindran.
	   The Workers' Party is appealing the judgment, the report added.
	   Jeyaretnam and his party organizers lost a similar legal battle
last year over the same article.
	   Five ethnic Indian legislators, including Foreign Minister S.
Jayakumar, were awarded 200,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 121,000) in
damages for the article's assertion that they had used the event to
advance their political careers, and that the government was merely
paying lip service to promoting the language.
	   Jeyaretnam is one of only three opposition members in the
84-seat Parliament. Members of the People's Action Party, in power
for 38 years, are not known to have ever lost a defamation suit, or
ever settled one without receiving money.
	   The U.S. government, Amnesty International and other human
rights groups have repeatedly criticized the Singapore government
for stifling political opposition through defamation suits and
other intimidation.

Deutsche Bank approves deal to acquire Bankers Trust for dlrs 10.1

 &UR; Eds: Updates with details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank AG announced Monday the
acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp., in a dlrs 10.1 billion deal
that will create the world's largest financial institution with
assets of more than dlrs 800 billion.
	   Deutsche Bank has offered Bankers Trust shareholders dlrs 93 a
share to seal one of the largest takeovers of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank. The boards of both banks approved
the offer Sunday.
	   The deal merging Germany's largest bank, with assets of dlrs 675
billion, with Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest U.S. bank with dlrs
156 billion in assets, is expected to be closed by next May.
	   The combined bank would surpass both current No. 1 UBS AG of
Switzerland and the recently formed Citigroup Inc.
	   The merger will result in 5,500 layoffs, mostly in New York and
London, Deutsche Bank Chairman Wolf Breuer said during a news
conference. He said not all of the lost jobs would be at Bankers
Trust.
	   Deutsche Bank said the deal would be financed partly with a 4
billion mark (dlrs 2.35 billion) capital increase, and a one-time
1.7 billion mark (dlrs 1 billion) restructuring charge for
personnel.
	   Breuer said the restructuring charge will affect Deutsche Bank's
earnings, but he did not say during which quarter the charge would
be made.
	   Deutsche Bank acknowledged that the deal was worth more than
Bankers Trust's assets, and said that it would make annual goodwill
payments of 630 million marks (dlrs 370 million) over 15 years.
	   The merger is part of Deutsche Bank's strategy to extend
operations into North America. But responding to analyst and market
concerns that the bank would lose focus on Europe, Deutsche Bank
said that it plans to expand its European asset management and
custody business.
	   Both Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are in the midst of
individual restructuring efforts aimed at cutting costs. Deutsche
Bank announced early this year a 2.5 billion mark (dlrs 1.5
billion) restructuring, while Bankers Trust announced a dlrs 300
million restructuring effort at the end of the third quarter.
	   The merger must obtain approval of both New York state and U.S.
federal banking regulators.

Turkey's military, civilian leaders discuss crisis over Kurdish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A diplomatic crisis over the return of a
Kurdish rebel leader to Turkey topped the agenda of a National
Security Council meeting Monday of Turkey's top brass and civilian
leaders.
	   Turkey is angry over Italy's refusal to return Abdullah Ocalan,
leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984.
	   The Turkish embassy in Rome was expected to hand over Turkey's
official request for extradition to Italian authorities later
Monday.
	   The powerful military have said little since the crisis erupted
on Nov. 12, when Ocalan was detained in Rome.
	   Newspapers speculated Monday that the council would issue a
harsh warning to Europe against lending support to Ocalan.
	   After fighting for over a decade, Turkey's military claims it
has all but eradicated the PKK in the southeast. It repeatedly
called on civilian leaders to take over the battle against
separatism, by investing in the impoverished southeast.
	   But politicians have failed to attract investments, and the
region remains stricken by unemployment _ one of the factors that
is said to push Kurds toward joining the PKK.
	   Italy has further infuriated the Turks by calling for a
political dialogue on the Kurdish problem.
	   ``The Italian government has manipulated the problem in a very
wrong, bad and insulting way,'' President Suleyman Demirel said
Sunday.
	   Demirel accused the West of having double standards and of not
applying international agreements against terrorism to the Ocalan
case. Turkey holds Ocalan responsible of the deaths of tens of
thousands of people.
	   The council meeting follows a solemn ceremony at Ankara's main
mosque for the 16 soldiers killed on Friday when PKK rebels downed
a helicopter near the Turkish-Iraqi border.

Japanese leader dampens speculation about possible sales tax cut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 8-9 with comments from senior politician; ADDS
details thruout, closing stock prices in final graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Monday his
government is unlikely to reduce Japan's unpopular consumption tax,
denting hopes raised by his ruling party's recent coalition pact.
	   Many economists blame the ruling party's decision last year to
raise the consumption tax to 5 percent from 3 percent for snuffing
out a budding recovery and tipping the economy back into recession.
	   Speculation that the government might cut or temporarily lift
the tax was sparked after Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party agreed
to form an alliance with a minority party that wants the tax
suspended.
	   The speculation encouraged a recent surge in Japanese stock
prices.
	   But Obuchi, speaking to a special session of Parliament Monday,
said, ``I want the nation to understand that it would be difficult
to lower the consumption tax.''
	   Instead, he said, the government would likely opt to simply
earmark proceeds from the tax for heath and welfare programs.
	   Members of the Liberal Party have been among the harshest
critics of the sales tax, fueling speculation that any formal
coalition with Obuchi's party would require a compromise on the
issue.
	   But a senior member of the ruling party said in a separate
speech Monday that the Liberal Party appears to have abandoned its
insistence that the sales tax be suspended.
	   Taku Yamasaki, who recently served as the ruling party's policy
chief, said: ``I believe that (Liberal Party head Ichiro) Ozawa,
for all intents and purposes, has stepped down from the demand.''
	   The LDP is betting that by joining forces with the Liberals, it
can attract enough unaligned independents in Parliament to pass
bills without having to cut deals with the leading opposition
party, the Democratic Party of Japan.
	   The priority of the current 18-day extraordinary session of
Parliament is the passage of a new budget that includes Japan's
largest-ever stimulus plan, worth 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196
billion).
	   Japan is struggling through its worst recession in decades, and
Obuchi has repeatedly pledged to restore economic growth next year.
	   The ruling party controls Parliament's lower house, but lacks a
majority in the upper house. Key financial bills during the last
Parliament session were delayed by wrangling with the Democratic
Party and other opposition groups.
	   Also Monday, Naoto Kan, the leader of the Democratic Party,
condemned the LDP's coalition agreement with the Liberal Party,
saying it goes against the will of the voting public.
	   Kan called for a dissolution of the lower house of Parliament
and early general elections.
	   Japan's benchmark stock average lost 185.69 points, or 1.23
percent, Monday amid spreading unease about the economic outlook.

Laotian revolutionary figure Sisana Sisane dies at 76
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sisana Sisane, a veteran Laotian
revolutionary and high-ranking member of the ruling communist
party, has died at the age of 76, the official Laotian news agency
KPL announced Monday. No cause of death was given.
	   Sisana died Friday, KPL reported. A funeral with pomp reserved
for the members of the national leadership is scheduled for
Thursday.
	   Sisana was born Sept. 13, 1922, in Savannakhet province and at
the age of 23 joined the independence movement to fight France's
attempt to reassert colonial rule over Indochina after World War
II.
	   France withdrew from Indochina in 1954 after the Vietnamese
victory at Dien Bien Phu. Sisana was editing revolutionary
newspapers and joined the Lao People's Revolutionary Party.
	   He was a candidate for parliament representing his home province
in 1957 elections and was jailed in an anti-communist roundup by
the conservative government in 1959.
	   The following year, he and other communist leaders escaped from
jail. Backed by communist North Vietnam, they waged guerrilla
warfare against the officially neutral, U.S.-backed government.
	   Sisana became head of the central propaganda organization, in
charge of revolutionary radio. Upon the movement's seizure of power
in 1975, he became propaganda and information minister.
	   In 1982, Sisana was elevated to the party's central committee.
Five years later, he left active political life and headed several
projects dealing with the party's history.
	   No details on survivors were available.

Taiwan's China Airlines to post loss, but forecasts better 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's China Airlines will lose 830
million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 25.6 million) in 1998, but
expects to break even next year, the airline's acting president
said Monday.
	   Efficiency at Taiwan's main international carrier should improve
considerably with the government's planned sale of more than half
its 71 percent stake in the airline, Sandy Liu said.
	   He gave no exact date for that move, saying only that
privatization was a ``long-term goal.''
	   Government control of the airline through the ostensibly private
China Aviation Development Foundation has been blamed for
permitting wasteful management and lax safety, leading to a string
of mishaps.
	   Passenger levels on China Airlines plummeted after the crash of
one of its Airbus A-300-600Rs outside Taipei on Feb. 16, which
killed 202 people. But efforts to improve safety and internal
structures are paying off in renewed confidence in the airline, Liu
told a news conference.
	   The airline has also been buoyed by the formation of a strategic
alliance with Singapore Airlines Ltd., Liu said. That included the
sale to Singapore Airlines of a 5 percent stake in China Airlines,
Liu added.

Inflation soars but exports and imports drop in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's annual inflation rate is
running at 78.2 percent, while both exports and imports have
slumped dramatically amid its worst economic crisis in decades, the
country's statistics bureau said Monday.
	   The figures cover the period January to November.
	   The bureau predicted inflation would rise further in December.
	   Earlier this year, the bureau forecast it would hit 80 percent
by the end of the year.
	   Prices of some basic food items dropped slightly. Even so,
government officials say millions of people have slipped into
poverty because of soaring inflation and unemployment.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, has been hit
hard by Asia's financial meltdown and is now in a deep recession.
	   For the January-September period, total exports were dlrs 37.24
billion, down from dlrs 39.5 billion in the same period last year,
while total imports were dlrs 20.2 billion, a 36.5 percent slump
from dlrs 31.8 billion a year earlier.

China can quickly break military-business ties, minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's military and government will completely
sever ties to businesses they control within five weeks, even
though the central government has tried and failed to cut these
ties for five years, a Cabinet minister said Monday.
	   Sheng Huaren, chairman of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, which is overseeing the enormous switchover, said the
military would ``absolutely'' relinquish its businesses by Dec. 15.
	   Businesses controlled by the Communist Party, the government and
the judicial system will follow suit before year's end, he added.
	   Large national enterprises will have their assets transferred to
the Finance Ministry and their workers supervised by the Personnel
Ministry; smaller ones will be put under the control of local
authorities, Sheng said.
	   Sheng's comments were the highest-level statement to date on how
the huge transfer will be managed.
	   In July, President Jiang Zemin ordered the military and armed
police to get rid of their vast empires of hotels, karaoke halls,
factories and other businesses to curb rampant corruption and
smuggling and make the armed forces concentrate on national
defense.
	   Involvement of judicial and government agencies in businesses
has also invited corruption and bad management and hindered China's
transformation from central planning to free markets.
	   ``The central government has very firmly determined to see
through this endeavor,'' Sheng said at a news conference.
	   But Sheng acknowledged that the central government first decided
to separate party and government departments from their businesses
in 1993, but the orders were ignored.
	   In Shanghai and Tianjin, military businesses have already been
turned over to local governments, Sheng said. He declined to
specify whether or how the military would be compensated.
	   Since the People's Liberation Army took up commerce to make up
for shrinking government outlays in the 1980s, military businesses
at times have been estimated to fund a third of the PLA's operating
expenses.
	   In an overall assessment of efforts to reform debt-burdened
state industries, Sheng noted that factory losses have risen and
profits dropped in the past year, although he provided no figures.
	   State factories, which employ more than 100 million people, are
burdened with backlogs of unsalable products, debts they cannot
repay and shrinking export markets because of the global financial
crisis.
	   Despite laying off millions of workers, many of these companies
still have several ``or even 10 times'' the number of workers they
need, Sheng said.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji was quoted by state media Monday as saying
China will turn the problem around by 2000. Sheng said the goal was
``absolutely achievable.''
	   The government has continued to pump large amounts of money into
state factories, despite their poor record of paying it back. Dlrs
40 billion has been earmarked to cover write-offs in bad loans to
state enterprises this year, and 57.7 billion yuan (dlrs 7 billion)
of outstanding loans has been reclassified as investment.
	   But Sheng said the new loans were being targeted for loss-making
companies that have potentially marketable products.

High security as Mikhailov trial begins

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with postponement refused, further appeal, ADDS

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Police mounted a massive security operation Monday
as the trial opened of an alleged godfather of the Russian mafia.
	   Sergei Mikhailov faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half years in
prison if found guilty of being a member of a criminal organization
and of breaking Swiss property laws.
	   A relaxed-looking Mikhailov appeared in a packed courtroom
Monday as proceedings opened with the judge throwing out a request
by his lawyers for a postponement of the trial.
	   The court rejected their claim that his case has been
compromised by media reports and the unprecedented security
measures.
	   Defense attorneys lodged another appeal, claiming that the case
against Mikhailov is invalid under European human rights law.
	   Mikhailov was arrested two years ago at Geneva airport. He was
originally accused of money laundering, but in the course of the
investigation that charge was dropped because of problems of
gathering evidence in Russia.
	   Geneva prosecutors say Mikhailov is head of the Moscow-based
Solntsevskaya crime organization, linked to the worldwide network
of the mafia godfather Vyacheslav Ivankov _ known as Yaponchik _
who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in New York last
year.
	   Mikhailov denies all the charges against him and claims to be an
ordinary businessman.
	   The trial is expected to feature more than 90 witnesses speaking
six different languages and is due to last two weeks.
	   Heavy security was in operation inside and outside the
courthouse. Witnesses will receive special protection, in some
cases including provision of bullet-proof vests.
	   Among the prosecution witnesses will be former Moscow police
officer Nikolai Oporov, who has been given political exile in
Switzerland and is under heavy guard.
	   Also due to give evidence is Mikhailov's former lawyer, who is
himself waiting to be tried after being arrested leaving the prison
where Mikhailov was being held with letters which had not passed
through the censor.
	   One probable prosecution witness, Vadim Rozenbaum, was
assassinated in the Netherlands in July 1997.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Four people were injured, one of
them critically, when an explosion tore through three 16th-story
apartment buildings early Monday.
	   The cause of Monday's blast was not immediately known. Police
evacuated 120 residents of the apartment block as a precaution.
	   The blast occurred in the same neighborhood on the outskirts of
Amsterdam where an El Al Boeing 747 cargo jet crashed in 1992,
killing at least 43 people.
	   Monday's explosion was so powerful that some residents told
Dutch television they initially thought another airplane had
crashed.
	   The 33-year-old owner of the apartment complex was reported in
critical condition in a hospital specializing in the treatment of
burn victims.

President to consult Parliament again on prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Emile Lahoud scheduled a new
round of consultations with Parliament on Monday to select a prime
minister after the current premier, Rafik Hariri, turned down an
informal request to form the next government.
	   The dispute pits Lahoud, an assertive army commander at the
start of a six-year presidential term, against Hariri, a
billionaire businessman who virtually has had a free hand in
running the country since he became prime minister in 1992.
	   Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining tactic, the
apparent tension between the two men could affect Lebanon's
economic stability as it recovers from its 1975-90 civil war.
	   Sources close to Hariri said Sunday that he had turned down an
informal offer from Lahoud to form a new government.
	   That offer _ but no formal request _ came after an inconclusive
round of consultations last week between Lahoud and the 128-member
legislative body.
	   A statement from the president's office on Monday said new
consultations with Parliament members would be held Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Hariri reportedly turned down Lahoud's first offer on grounds he
did not feel the president was following constitutional procedures
in naming his prime minister.
	   But the dispute appears to run deeper, with both men jockeying
to determine who will have the upper hand during Lahoud's tenure.
	   Lahoud and Hariri met Monday after the president announced he
accepted Hariri's decision not to take him up on his informal
offer. The meeting lasted just 10 minutes and apparently did not
help resolve the dispute.
	   Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday.
	   Hariri, 53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar
postwar reconstruction program, is credited with restoring economic
confidence and stabilizing the national currency. But he also was
faulted for declining living standards and a rise in corruption in
government.
	   Lahoud, 62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to
power with widespread popular backing, made his name rebuilding the
military after it disintegrated in the civil war.
	   The British-trained general pledged in a tough inauguration
speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.

Fire hits key army ammunition depot in northern Philippines

unlikely; other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A key ammunition depot in a northern
Philippine army camp caught fire before dawn Monday, triggering
explosions that damaged buildings and panicked residents several
kilometers (miles) away, officials said.
	   Military officials said there were no immediate reports of
casualties in the fire, which lasted several hours and damaged at
least seven buildings at Camp Servillano Aquino in Tarlac province.
	   Army Capt. Alvin Javier said authorities were investigating the
cause of the fire, which started in the office of an army official
and spread rapidly to the ammunition depot in the camp, the
headquarters of the military's Northern Luzon Command.
	   Army Maj. Gen. Rene Dado said sabotage was unlikely because the
ammunition depot was heavily secured.
	   The blaze caused ammunition stored in the depot to explode,
shattering windows and spreading the fire to other buildings in the
depot complex, located far from the camp's residential area.
	   Hundreds of mortars and rockets went off or rained down around
the complex, some landing without exploding in a village outside
the camp.
	   ``The building where the explosives originated vanished, the
whole building,'' Dado told reporters, adding that only a huge
crater was left.
	   ``We were swamped with calls from residents outside the camp who
were awakened by the explosions. We also heard it from here,'' said
police officer Ricardo Galang, assigned to a police station eight
kilometers (five miles) from the camp.
	   Tarlac is 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Manila.

German, French leaders to discuss European defense industry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Talks to start 1645 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German and French leaders meet Monday to try to
give new life to Europe's most important partnership and discuss
plans to bolster the European aerospace industry.
	   The two-day talks in Potsdam, outside Berlin, is the first such
summit for German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder since he won
September elections for the center-left Social Democrats.
	   Though both countries are now governed by the left, Schroeder's
victory has actually sent them drifting apart on one issue: the
role of nuclear power.
	   The new German government wants to shut down the nation's 19
nuclear plants. Paris worries this would mean lost business for a
French nuclear fuel reprocessing plant whose biggest foreign
customer is Germany.
	   With economics ministers from both countries attending the
summit, the issue seems likely to come up.
	   Schroeder, French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin will try to revive momentum in German-French ties _
traditionally the engine behind the drive for European unity _
after a slowdown under former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, aides
say.
	   The twice-yearly summit gains special significance ahead of Jan.
1 _ the day Europe launches its single currency, the euro, and
Germany takes over the rotating six-month presidency of the
European Union.
	   The leaders will seek common approaches to major EU projects,
including a slimming of its budget and administration to prepare
for new members from the former Soviet bloc. Schroeder has said
that Germany will bargain to lower its EU budget dues.
	   European efforts to merge national aerospace industries to
compete with U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also on the
agenda, German officials said.
	   Germany prefers a three-way merger of the European aerospace
industry, including France and Britain, but would move ahead with
Britain first if the French don't participate immediately.
	   The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced
talks on a two-way alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's
early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly
government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been
slow.

Silver Charm tops nominees for dlrs 4 million Dubai World Cup

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ America's Silver Charm, who
won first prize at the last Dubai World Cup, tops the list of
horses nominated for the next running of the 4 million race,
organizers said Monday.
	   ``Should the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner
Silver Charm defend his crown in March, he will be the first Dubai
World Cup winner to attempt do do so,'' race organizers said in a
statement.
	   They said the 4-year-old colt ``retains all his fire and
enthusiasm for racing and so a return to Dubai looks very much on
the cards for the horse.''
	   Silver Charm, owned by Robert and Beverly Lewis, recently came a
close second behind Awesome Again at the Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill Downs.
	   Silver Charm's trainer, Bob Baffert, is leaving nothing to
chance for the dlrs 2.4 million prize he took home from Dubai last
March. Besides his silver wonder he's got four other entries for
the race: Pleasant Drive, Real Quiet, Tahoe Prospector and
Cavonnier.
	   Organizers said they have 62 nominations at the first closing
stage for the race, which made its inaugural run in 1996. Sixteen
will make the final cut for the March 28 race at the Nad Al Sheba
racecourse for the world's richest horse race.
	   Other entries from the United States include Dr. Fong, Victory
Gallop and Malek, the Richard Mandella-trained horse that finished
fourth at the last Dubai World Cup.
	   European entries include the 1998 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe
winner Sagamix, Insight And Limnos, Second Empire, and Running Stag
	   Australian champ Might and Power and New Zealand's Champagne
also have been nominated.
	   The home defense from Dubai will come from the world famous
Godolphin stables that belong to Dubai's ruling Al Maktoum family.
Nominations include Cape Verdi, High Rise, Nedawi, Intikhab,
Central Park, City Honors, Faithful Son, Saratoga Springs and Xaar.
	   ``The overall quality of the nominations is very pleasing,''
said Michael Osborne, chairman of the Dubai World Cup.
	   ``I am confident that the 1999 Dubai World Cup will prove as
exciting and competitive as the first three runnings,'' he said.

Singapore authorities nab illegal immigrants hiding in tank truck
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Immigration authorities discovered 27 Thai and
Chinese citizens hiding inside an oil tank container driven into
Singapore from neighboring Malaysia, state-run television reported
Monday.
	   The first attempt to smuggle illegal immigrants inside such a
container was thwarted Sunday night when the police received a tip
about the unlikely cargo, the report said.
	   Bolts inside the tanker had been removed to allow the occupants
to breathe. The driver was arrested, and authorities have detained
the illegal immigrants, who all carried passports and were thought
to have entered Malaysia legally.
	   Foreigners who have entered illegally or overstayed their visas
have proliferated in this prosperous city-state since the regional
economic crisis intensified last year. Most are workers from poorer
neighboring countries desperate for employment.
	   Singapore authorities have stepped up efforts to patrol waters
around and roads into the island republic, and have conducted a
number of high-profile sweeps to catch illegal immigrants.

	   Gao Hongming outlined his complaints in a letter he delivered to
the executive committee of Beijing's Chaoyang district People's
Congress, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement said.
	   Since he declared his candidacy as an independent in October,
Gao said, police have kept his home under watch and followed him;
local elections officials have refused to tell him where his
would-be electoral district is located, the Information Center
reported.
	   Gao threatened to demonstrate Tuesday and Wednesday if the
Chaoyang People's Congress does not resolve his problems in
accordance with the law, the group said.
	   Beijing ordered Gao and two other dissidents last month not to
run for local legislative seats but the three have vowed to defy
the order.
	   Gao, a former official in the Beijing city foreign affairs
office, spent two years in a labor camp for opposing the military
quelling of the democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in
1989.

Solution Six wins multi-million Netherlands order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ International accountancy software
supplier Solution 6 Holdings Ltd., has won a multi-million dollar
software contract in the Netherlands, it announced Monday.
	   Solution 6 has been contracted to provide support services and
supply Dutch accountancy firm Moret Ernst and Young in The
Netherlands with its CABS2000 Practice Management System.
	   It is the company's second largest practice management software
and services sale ever and will provide support for at least 5,000
professionals in 50 offices throughout the Netherlands.
	   Moret Ernst and Young is the largest professional services firm
in The Netherlands and is Ernst and Young's third biggest practice
in the world.
	   The contract provides a significant springboard for Solution 6
into the European market, with the ongoing implementation and
support services covering an initial five-year period.
	   Chris Tyler, managing director and chief executive officer of
Solution 6,
	   said the contract reinforced the success of the company's export
strategies and its return to core revenue streams.
	   ``It follows our recent wins to supply practice management
software to 35,000 Deloitte and Touche professionals across the
globe and to Saba &AMP; Co., one of the largest practices in the Middle
East,'' Tyler said.
	   Solution 6's general manager of global sales and marketing,
Richard McLean, said the company was committed to a rapid expansion
of its European operations and that the positive economics of the
large scale implementation,
	   combined with the very large KPMG firm already using CABS2000 in
the Netherlands, gave Solution 6 a solid platform.
	   ``It means that we will locate staff on site, providing the
basis for a European sales office,'' McLean said.
	   ``We intend to pursue opportunities in every possible market
with vigour and commitment ... our return to core business activity
is now clearly paying off.``
	   Solution 6 is the world's leading supplier of business systems
to the accounting profession.
	   The company currently holds the largest market share in
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Britain in the practice
management, client accounting and taxation markets and in
Australia, has a presence in over 65 percent of the accounting
services industry firms.
	   Solution 6 acquired CABS -- a privately-owned, Australian
company and the leading international supplier of practice
management systems for large accountancy firms -- in July 1997.
	   CABS2000 is a 32 bit, client/server, practice management system,
which is
	   database independent and has been designed so that the software
can run on any size system, from a notebook PC to an enterprise
system.

Former prime minister and wife end marriage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Paul Keating and
his wife Annita on Monday announced the end of their 23-year
marriage, but said their decision should not lend credibility to
``malicious'' rumors concerning Keating's private life.
	   The couple, who married in 1975 and had four children, announced
their separation in a joint statement.
	   ``We have decided amicably to separate after 23 years of deeply
fulfilling and for the most part happy marriage,'' they said.
	   ``This has been a difficult and painful time for both of us, and
for our children, and if only for their sakes we hope people will
respect our privacy.
	   ``The often malicious rumors that have been circulating for the
past two or three years have not helped us to negotiate these
difficult years, and we sincerely hope this announcement will not
lend them credibility.
	   ``It would be futile to attempt to publicly explain the reasons
for this decision, and we are sure no reasonable person would feel
that we are obliged to try.''
	   Unfounded rumors about Keating surfaced publicly recently when
former Governor-General Bill Hayden aired them in a defamation case
in Canberra unrelated to the Keatings.
	   Hayden, like Keating a former federal Labor leader, told a court
about baseless stories that Keating had had an extramarital affair
with a prominent woman, and that he had a predilection for young
men.
	   Hayden said he was simply attempting to show the damage that sex
smears could do to politicians' reputations.

South Africa creep towards victory over West Indies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa, on 77 for three
at lunch on the final day, need 87 more to win the first test
against the West Indies at the Wanderers Stadium Monday.
	   But the start was a tenuous one, as the home side lost two early
wickets with their score on just 14.
	   The opening pace duo of Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh
removed Gary Kirsten (7) and Adam Bacher (6) respectively. Then
Jacques Kallis and Darryl Cullinan steadied things. Cullinan began
hitting out, speeding to a good-looking 35 before he was
brilliantly caught at midwicket by Stuart Williams.
	   The fall brought Hansie Cronje to the wicket, and he (7) and
Kallis (20) remained undefeated going into lunch.
	   With the pitch playing unpredictably, the match is neither won
nor lost yet. Wide cracks have made for uneven bounce, and Rawl
Lewis and Carl Hooper have a major role to play with their spin
bowling because of this.

Hong Kong posts seven-month deficit of dlrs 6.43 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong posted a 50.16 billion Hong Kong
dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.43 billion) deficit in the first seven months
of this fiscal year, the government reported Monday.
	   A statement said expenditure in the period amounted to 131.85
billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 16.9 billion), while revenue
totaled 81.69 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 10.47 billion).
	   The figure was well above the 21 billion Hong Kong dollar (dlrs
2.69 billion) deficit the government said it expects in the fiscal
year that ends March 31, 1999.
	   Hong Kong's fiscal reserves were 415.68 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 53.29 billion), a decrease of 41.86 million Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 5.37 million) since the end of March. Hong Kong's
fiscal year begins in April.
	   The government said it was not unusual to register a deficit in
the first seven months of the fiscal year because most taxes are
collected in the second half.
	   In the last fiscal year, Hong Kong had an 80.9 billion Hong Kong
dollar (dlrs 10.37 billion) surplus.
	   The government is forecasting a deficit this year because of tax
breaks and increased spending on programs to lift the economy out
of recession.

Fifteen Emirates children with terminal illnesses off to see Santa

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ For 10-year-old leukemia
patient Nitin Vijaya Raghavan, the prospect of meeting Santa Claus
and seeing his first snow outweighed fears of traveling without his
family.
	   ``I want to see snow and throw it at the other kids,'' said
Raghavan, his impish eyes sparkling behind wire-rimmed glasses.
``And I want to meet the real Santa, not the ones at the malls,''
added the Indian native.
	   Raghavan is one of 15 children with terminal diseases who left
Monday to take part in a dream trip to the mythical abode of Santa
Claus in Finnish Lapland.
	   The children, ages 6 to 14, suffer from cancer, the blood
disease thalassemia and mental and physical handicaps.
	   It was the first time children from Dubai _ who include those of
expatriate Asians and Europeans as well as Arabs _ were included in
the trip sponsored by an Irish charity fund that has sent Irish
youngsters on the journey for five years.
	   ``We wanted to send a rainbow of colors to see Santa Claus, a
bouquet of different-colored flowers instead of just Europeans,''
said Con Murphy, who created the Children for Lapland Appeal.
	   Murphy said the fund's goal is to give the children a respite
from constant blood transfusions, injections and chemotherapy _ and
maybe a final shot at happiness.
	   Of the 280 children from Ireland and Northern Ireland who
traveled last year, 30 died within months of their return.
	   ``I wanted to give happiness to terminally-ill children, even
for a short time,'' Murphy said. ``The idea was to create moments
of joy in the lives of the children who have been burdened with
these illnesses.''
	   Santa's home was chosen as the destination because, as Murphy
put it, ``No matter what nationality or religion a child is, the
idea of meeting Santa Claus is magical.''
	   Murphy, who runs a travel agency in Dublin, said his trips to
Dubai made him want to expand the appeal to include the emirate
with its multi-ethnic population.
	   Among the children chosen in Dubai are four Indians, three
Filipinos, three from the emirate as well as youngsters from Oman,
Jordan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and France. Three-quarters of the
United Arab Emirates population of 2.4 million are foreigners.
	   A four-month radio appeal for the children's trip and a concert
in Dubai by Irish performers raised 300,000 dirhams (dlrs 80,000)
by early November. Final figures on the fund were not available.
	   Children chosen to participate had to be healthy enough to
travel and not be wheelchair-bound, said John Flynn, the charity's
Dubai coordinator.
	   During the five-day trip, the children will join some 180 Irish
youngsters in Dublin, then travel to Finnish Lapland. They will
ride on snowmobiles and sleighs pulled by reindeer and huskies. The
highlight will be receiving presents from Santa.
	   ``I will ask him for a Mutant Ninja Turtles video game,'' said
Raghavan, the Indian youngster. ``I couldn't find it here, but I'm
sure Santa will have one.''

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs set fire to three mosques in West
Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands of Christians
degenerated into a riot, the military and residents said.
	   A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school.
Troops and riot police patrolled the streets.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests
as fighting between Muslims and Christians continued after dark,
said a military officer who spoke by telephone on condition of
anonymity.
	   The violence in the city of Kupang was in retaliation for the
burning and ransacking of 22 Christian churches by Muslim mobs in
the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were killed.
	   West Timor shares the same island as troubled East Timor, a
former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman Catholicism and
invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Many Christians, mostly Protestants, also live in Kupang, about
1,875 kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.
	   The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged a
peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church
attacks.
	   Most offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, which
is the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province.
	   Organizers of Monday's strike had called for a non-violent ``day
of mourning.''
	   However, residents said fires broke out in three mosques after
rival gangs pelted each other with rocks.
	   Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia.
	   Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation have
intensified as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   There is also political turmoil as students protesters demand
greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former
President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in
May.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet has told his family that he
would rather die than stand trial in Spain on charges of genocide
and torture, a British newspaper quoted his nephew as saying, while
Chile on Monday stepped up to get Britain to send the former
dictator home.
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, warning of damage
to relations with London, had a 40-minute meeting with the Defense
Secretary before heading to Spain with his message that the general
will likely be tried in Chile if Britain blocks extradition.
	   ``I made clear the value that we attach to our warm relations
with Chile, on which we hope to build in the future,'' Robertson
said in a brief statement after the meeting.
	   Chile, including Pinochet himself when he was commander-in-chief
of the military until March, has been a regular arms buyer from
Britain. Sales now average only about 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.65
million) a year, officials said.
	   However, Chile canceled a trip to inspect two frigates which
Britain's Royal Navy wants to sell after London police arrested
Pinochet Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant.
	   The Defense Ministry meeting wound up a four-day blitz by
Insulza on leaders of the Labor Party government which is under
increasing pressure from its own lawmakers and internationally to
send Pinochet, 83, for trial in Spain.
	   ``He would rather kill himself or be killed by his guards than
face the humiliation and indignity of being sent to face trial in
Spain,'' Pinochet's nephew Rafael Pinochet Savedra was quoted as
saying in a London tabloid, The Mirror.
	   The general's wife, Lucia, told the tabloid that Pinochet was
``very weak and depressed about his position.''
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police during in
1973-1990 rule after he overthrew a Marxist who had been elected.
	   But many are skeptical about the Chilean government's claims he
may be tried at home.
	   Fourteen lawsuits brought by families of people killed or
tortured are pending in Chile. But critics say there is scant
chance of Pinochet being tried in Chile, where he has immunity, and
if did face trial it would be before a military court packed with
his supporters.
	   Pinochet remained under police guard at a London hospital, where
he is recovering from back surgery. British newspapers reported he
is planning a move to a nine-bedroom home on the private Wentworth
estate in Surrey, southwest of London.
	   He is due in court on Dec. 11, the deadline for Home Secretary
Jack Straw to decide whether to permit extradition proceedings to
begin.
	   Some 150 lawmakers, mostly Laborites, signed a statement urging
extradition.
	   ``I am not trying to threaten Jack Straw in any way,'' Ann
Clywd, head of Parliament's all-party Human Rights Committee, said
in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Monday. ``But we
think it's a very important decision.''

Interior Minister says seized arms possibly aimed for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A large stockpile of weapons seized by
Croatian police might have been destined for the troubled province
of Kosovo, media reported Monday.
	   Croatian Interior Minister Ivan Penic said the weapons were
linked to an organized crime ring, state-run HINA news agency
reported.
	   Police in Sibenik in southern Croatia discovered the stockpile
on Saturday. The weapons, which included ground-to-air missiles as
well as multiple rocket launchers, worth up to one million dollars,
were stashed in several warehouses across the coastal town.
	   Five suspects, including four Bosnians and a Croatian national,
were arrested and will be charged with arms smuggling, illegal
possession of weapons and breaching customs, Penic said. Two other
suspects remain at large.
	   Penic said the shipment appeared to have been collected by an
organized crime ring and could also be related to international
terrorist rings. The weapons may have been destined for the
southern Serb province of Kosovo in neighboring Yugoslavia, where
ethnic Albanian separatists have been fighting government forces
for seven months, he said.
	   Police said they suspected the weapons came from neighboring
Bosnia, but declined to disclose further details. Media carried
reports Monday of missiles, rockets, machine guns and police flak
jackets from Croatia and the Serb-run half of Bosnia.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ On a visit to raise money for his impoverished
people, Yasser Arafat is urging President Bill Clinton to help him
protect Mideast peace from its enemies. The Palestinian leader also
says he hopes 1999 will be ``the year of the independent
Palestinian state'' with east Jerusalem as its capital. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, threatened Monday to walk
away from the Mideast peace agreements if Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat unilaterally declares statehood in May. Arafat had a meeting
scheduled Monday with Clinton before an international donors'
conference. The president plans to visit Israel, the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip in two weeks. He will address the Palestinian
National Council and oversee implementation of a critical element
of the Wye River peace accord with Israel reached in October. The
council, meeting in Gaza on Dec. 14, is due to reaffirm the
revocation of clauses in the Palestine Liberation Organization's
charter calling for Israel's destruction. (US-ARAFAT,
ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ He called himself the ``Serb
Adolf,'' and his crimes were as chilling as his nickname. In a
trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N.
prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge panel that Goran
Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most serious offense.
The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in October
to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing many
observers by reversing his earlier declarations of innocence.
Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war
crimes and crimes against humanity _ and the likelihood of a
maximum life sentence _ Jelisic has denied that the killing spree
constituted genocide. To convict Jelisic of genocide, prosecutors
must prove that the murders _ most of them carried out with
close-range shots from an automatic pistol _ were part of a
campaign intended to wipe out an entire ethnic group in the
northern Bosnian town of Brcko. (BOSNIA-WAR CRIMES)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A powerful earthquake struck two
small, remote islands in eastern Indonesia at night, killing at
least six people. Volunteers spent Monday searching through ruined
buildings and landslides for survivors. Local government officials
said at least 153 people were injured and more than 180 homes and
buildings were damaged. Roads were cut and bridges destroyed,
hampering search and rescue efforts. Local police Sgt. Hafid said
three men and three women had been confirmed dead on worst-hit
Mangole Island. No deaths were reported on neighboring Taliabu
Island, despite widespread injuries and damage. Two strong
aftershocks were felt and hundreds of people ran to the safety of a
soccer field on Mangole after the magnitude-6.5 quake struck Sunday
night. (INDONESIA-EARTHQUAKE)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chaos rocked the sensational
corruption and sex trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Monday when one of his defense attorneys was sentenced
to three months in jail for contempt of court. Zainur Zakaria, a
prominent lawyer in Anwar's defense team, refused to apologize for
accusing two prosecutors of trying to get a potential witness to
lie. High Court Judge Augustine Paul, who had demanded the apology,
held Zainur in contempt of court and ordered him to surrender to
police. Zainur's defense colleagues said they were too disturbed to
continue, so Paul adjourned the trial until Tuesday. Zainur
immediately appealed the contempt ruling to the Court of Appeals.
Anwar, prevented by police from talking to his attorneys in the
courtroom, angrily shouted to reporters that he could no longer get
a fair trial. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was
fired as deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent
jailing and beating while in custody has led to international
interest in the case and support for his fledgling political reform
movement. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's pro-independence government sought
re-election Monday, hoping for a decisive victory that could
accelerate the drive for secession from Canada. If the Parti
Quebecois returns to power, Premier Lucien Bouchard has pledged to
hold a referendum on secession whenever he judges conditions right
for a separatist victory. Most polls in the final stages of the
campaign forecast a comfortable victory for Bouchard's party, which
now holds 74 of the provincial legislature's 125 seats. His main
opponent was Jean Charest of the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal
Party, which holds 45 seats and would need to gain 18 to eke out a
slim legislative majority. Critics said Charest, who left federal
politics in March to enter the race, failed to convince the bulk of
Quebec's French-speaking majority that he was the best choice to
defend their interests. (CANADA-QUEBEC ELECTION)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Monday, with prices slumping in Hong Kong and Tokyo, but rising in
Singapore. In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index fell 339.79
points, or 3.2 percent, closing at 10,402.32. Brokers said
investors took profits after the index gained 5 percent last week.
Market sentiment in Hong Kong was also dampened by the government
announcement Friday that the territory has sunk deeper into
recession. Japanese stocks slumped as investors awaited more signs
of Japan's economic recovery and details on the ruling party's new
alliance with an opposition party. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average lost 185.69 points, or 1.23 percent, closing at
14,883.70. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 123.82 yen in
late afternoon, up 0.96 yen from late Friday in Tokyo. The rate was
the highest in more than six weeks. Share prices in Singapore
closed sharply higher following heavy buying of banking stocks,
dealers said. The Straits Times Index rose 21.79 points, or 1.6
percent, to 1,416.55. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank AG announced Monday the
acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp., in a dlrs 10 billion deal that
will create the world's largest financial institution with assets
of more than dlrs 800 billion. Deutsche Bank has offered Bankers
Trust shareholders dlrs 93 a share to seal one of the largest
takeovers of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank. The
boards of both banks approved the offer Sunday. The deal merging
Germany's largest bank, with assets of dlrs 675 billion, with
Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest U.S. bank with dlrs 156 billion
in assets, is expected to be closed by next May. The combined bank
would surpass both current No. 1 UBS AG of Switzerland and the
recently formed Citigroup Inc. The merger will result in 5,500
layoffs, mostly in New York and London, Deutsche Bank Chairman Wolf
Breuer said during a news conference. He said not all of the lost
jobs would be at Bankers Trust. (US-DEUTSCHE BANK-BANKERS TRUST)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government canceled plans Monday to
discuss the 1999 budget, once again delaying efforts to come up
with plans to tackle the country's economic crisis. A government
spokesman said the Cabinet meeting on the budget had been
rescheduled for Thursday, but gave no details. Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's government has yet to produce firm plans to
tackle the financial crisis since Russia effectively defaulted on
some debts in August and devalued the currency. The government has
requested more aid from the International Monetary Fund, warning
Russia faces serious problems unless it gets more funding. But the
IMF and Western governments say they won't provide any act until
Russia adopts a realistic budget. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Strong domestic growth and the Asian
economic crisis combined Monday to produce one of the worst set of
monthly trade figures Australia has ever seen. The government
statistician reported that the nation slipped 1.1 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. 696 million) into the red on its goods and
services trade account in October, the worse figure since August
1989. There was also a huge extraordinary item in the latest
figures _ Australia has been importing, melting down and
re-exporting vast amounts of gold from Asian countries this year.
That trade has surged as hard-pressed Asians began cashing in their
savings, often held in the form of gold jewelry. Once that is taken
into account, Australia's trade performance in October was probably
the worst on record. (AUSTRALIA-TRADE)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nippon Express Co. said Monday it has
reached an agreement with America's Federal Express Corp. to form a
wide-ranging alliance in international transport services.
Cooperation will begin in December when Nippon Express, Japan's
largest transport company, starts using FedEx's international
delivery service now linking 120,000 global cities, Nippon Express
spokesman Koichi Ohori said. The tie-up will include joint use of
parcel collection points and other facilities around the world,
Ohori said. Under the agreement, FedEx, America's second-biggest
transport company, and Nippon Express will also share information
systems to track cargo deliveries, Ohori said. The two companies
hope to save money through increased efficiency at a time when
businesses worldwide are reviewing their logistics systems, Ohori
said. (JAPAN-TRANSPORT ALLIANCE)

Third case detected this month of mad cow disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A new case of mad cow disease has been detected in
France's northern Pas de Calais region, near the English Channel --
the third case reported in France this month, the Agriculture
Ministry announced Monday.
	   It was the 15th case of mad cow disease reported this year in
France and the 46th case since 1990, the ministry said.
	   In keeping with current regulations, the entire herd of 180 cows
was incinerated over the weekend, the ministry said.
	   It did not specify who owned the cows or when the illness in the
one cow, a milk cow born in September 1994, was detected.
	   Mad cow disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was first
detected in 1985. It causes holes in the brain, making cattle
stagger and drool. There is no known cure.
	   Scientists believe mad cow disease may be linked to an equally
fatal human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

67 former Muslim rebels return to army camp after walkout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 67 former Muslim rebels
have returned to an army camp after a walkout protest against
Christian officers who did not issue them firearms, officials said
Monday.
	   The former Moro National Liberation guerrillas were among some
7,000 being integrated into Philippine military and police units
under a peace agreement signed between the MNLF and the government
in 1996.
	   They had fled their army units Nov. 22, but began returning to
camp Saturday after receiving assurances that the army would issue
them guns, said Col. Horacio Lapinid, spokesman of the military's
Southern Command.
	   ``We have assured them that the grievances would be properly
addressed,'' Lapinid said.
	   Last year, two groups of former MNLF guerrillas walked out of
army training after complaining of discrimination by their
Christian trainers.
	   Army trainers often complain that the former rebels are unruly
and stubborn, and often disregard camp regulations and training
policies.
	   Two smaller Muslim rebel groups _ the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front _ are still fighting the
government.
	   The government opened peace talks with the MILF early this year
but no comprehensive agreement is in sight.

Report: border guards general may face new trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Military prosecutors are seeking a tougher
punishment against a general in the border guards who was convicted
of beating and humiliating his subordinates, a newspaper said
Monday.
	   Gen. Vladimir Ruzlyayev, 50, the former commander of the Russian
border guards in the Caucasus Mountains, was convicted of publicly
beating several soldiers and officers and ordering them sent to a
military prison.
	   While the soldiers were in prison, Ruzlyayev told the prison
chief to feed the men from the same buckets that they used to
defecate, the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets reported, citing military
prosecutors.
	   Ruzlyayev was dismissed from his post shortly after the incident
in July 1997, but has kept his general's rank and remained in the
military.
	   A military court found him guilty of abusing his powers and
banned him from occupying senior posts in the armed forces for six
months.
	   But military prosecutors have called the sentence too soft and
have appealed for Ruzlyayev to be tried again by the military
branch of Russia's Supreme Court, the newspaper said. The Supreme
Court has not ruled on the appeal.
	   There are frequent reports of senior soldiers abusing junior
soldiers in Russia's cash-strapped and demoralized military.

Dream of diploma survives poverty in Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos SOF101-102 of Nov. 16 &QL; 
 &UR; By VESELIN ZHELEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The paint on the walls is peeling,
textbooks are tattered, and the school is so poor it suspended
classes for a week last winter for lack of funds to replace broken
windows.
	   But classrooms are full and morale is high at Sofia's High
School No. 66, in keeping with a resurgence of interest in
education in post-communist Bulgaria that defies the alarming
falloff in state funding.
	   ``If we want to achieve the living standards of the West, we
need to be educated,'' says 18-year-old Ivan Behchiiski, who plans
to join Bulgaria's university enrollment boom next year after
graduating from School 66.
	   Schools across Eastern Europe have fallen on hard times in the
1990s, deprived of much of their support by governments reeling
from economic crisis.
	   Few countries have been harder hit than Bulgaria, singled out by
a UNICEF report on 27 countries this year for its three-fourths
drop in public spending on education, in real terms, since 1989.
	   Yet the dream of a diploma is stronger than ever. Braving
sharply rising education costs in one of Europe's weakest
economies, Bulgarians surprisingly are investing in their future at
a higher rate than many of their regional neighbors.
	   Schooling is only obligatory until age 16, but high schools and
universities are full. Most young Bulgarians are optimistic because
of their country's gradual turnaround and the belief that a good
education will lead them to opportunities only dreamed of in
communist times.
	   The number of university students has leaped by two-thirds in
the past five years and 60 percent of high school graduates
continue on to higher education, compared with 52 percent in
Hungary, 44 percent in Romania and 36 percent in the Czech
Republic.
	   Education at state-funded universities still is considered
strong despite the funding crunch, and superior to that of
fledgling private schools. It has been virtually free for those who
pass entry exams, and even with new fees next year will cost only
30,000-60,000 leva (dlrs 17-34) per semester.
	   Education Minister Veselin Metodiev compares the rush to study
in his country to a similar phenomenon in Western Europe
immediately after World War II.
	   ``In times of hardship people invest in human capital, which
pays off over the longer term,'' he says. ``Studies delay going out
onto the labor market while it's tough.''
	   Eleven percent unemployment and limited job opportunities for
college graduates limit young Bulgarians' options for working.
	   There also is a historical tradition: ``Bulgarians had schools
before they had established their modern state,'' Metodiev says.
	   This Slavic people kept its culture intact through five
centuries of Turkish rule, ending in 1878, largely due to a branch
system of community-sponsored schools. Since then, education has
remained a way to keep abreast with the modern world in spite of
the turns of history and their isolated location in the
southeastern corner of Europe.
	   Many young Bulgarians believe education opens a door to escape
from their country's poverty by studying in the West.
	   Foreign languages, particularly English, and business studies
are especially popular, reflecting more savvy about the job market
and a move away from the ideological disciplines of the past.
	   Angelina Todorova, 18, a student at Sofia's elite First English
Language School, spends more than 12 hours a day on her studies.
She wants to study in Britain and then return, in a position to
``change things in Bulgaria.''
	   Under the pro-Western government that took power last year and
is now pursuing reforms, the trend of wanting to go abroad for good
is lessening.
	   ``Of course I dream of world stages, but wouldn't be unhappy
with a career in my country,'' says Mihaela Mitova, 18, a budding
opera singer who hopes to study at a Sofia conservatory after
finishing School 66. She says Bulgaria is finally ``on the right
path.''
	   Although the new government doubled state subsidies for the
country's 4,000 schools, they barely cover the basics _ utility
bills, repairs and paltry teachers' wages that average 112,000 leva
(dlrs 68) per month. Fearful of being unemployed during tough
times, most teachers have kept their jobs but give private lessons
or find other work to get by.
	   Some schools rely on private companies for additional funding,
but parents shoulder an increasing load for their children's
education. Buying a year's school supplies for a first-grader costs
about a month's average pay in Bulgaria, roughly dlrs 100 (180,000
leva).
	   At School 66, many students can't afford to buy textbooks and do
their homework in the school library.
	   None of that, though, has been enough to dim the interest in
education.
	   ``I'll give all I can to secure my children a proper
education,'' says Stefan Aleksandrov, 45, a government employee.
``That's all that I can leave them.''

South Korea's Tongil Heavy Industries goes bankrupt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tongil Heavy Industries Co., a
flagship corporation of the Tongil (Unification) group, owned by
the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, went bankrupt Monday,
bank officials said.
	   The auto parts manufacturer was declared insolvent after it
defaulted on 234 million won (dlrs 167,000) in maturing loans.
	   Tongil officials were not immediately available for comment, but
the local Yonhap news agency reported that the company plans to
seek court receivership.
	   The fact that the amount of money involved in the default is
small shows that the company's financial structure has been
extremely weakened over the years, bank officials said.
	   The company has a bank debt worth 447.9 billion won (dlrs 319
million), more than 10 times its capital.
	   The Tongil group is South Korea's 38th largest conglomerate in
net assets. It has 17 subsidiaries but only four, including Tongil
Heavy Industries, are listed on the Korea Exchange.
	   Trading of the three other listed Tongil subsidiaries _ Hankook
Titanium Industry Co., Il Shin Stone Co. and Il Sung Construction
Co. _ was suspended earlier Monday on rumors that they also would
default on maturing loans.
	   Founded in 1962, Tongil Heavy Industries employs 2,500 workers.
	   Many South Korean companies have faced severe cash shortages as
banks have become increasingly reluctant to lend amid an economic
and debt crisis.
	   Under Korean law, a company can continue to operate pending a
court decision on its request for receivership, which usually takes
two or three months.

<TEXT>
	   NYUNZU, Congo (AP) _ Rwandan-backed Congolese rebels, despite
talk of a cease-fire, Monday said they were regrouping while
battlefields were quiet to prepare a new offensive.
	   Moving by night and resting by day, columns of insurgents
carrying machine guns and anti-tank missiles marched silently
beneath a full moon across bridges in southeast Congo to avoid
Zimbabwean warplanes and helicopters seeking to stop their advance.
	   Rwandan and Congolese rebel commanders paid little attention to
last week's Paris agreement between leaders of Rwanda, Uganda,
Zimbabwe and Congo who agreed to stop fighting but have not pulled
back their troops.
	   Speaking on the British Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday, Patrick
Mazimhaka, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu's minister,
downplayed the importance of the agreement and said Rwandan troops
will continue backing the rebels in the absence of a political
solution in Congo.
	   Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, who was in
northern Congo welcoming new recruits into rebel ranks, said the
cease-fire will work only if the rebels are part of it.
	   The truce was to be signed at peace talks in Lusaka, Zambia next
week. It wasn't clear if the rebels were invited.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila has refused to negotiate
directly with a rebel coalition of minority Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Congolese army and opposition politicians who took up
arms Aug. 2. He accuses them of being the puppets of Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   But while both countries are supplying troops, arms and food to
the rebels, an estimated 60,000 rebel force is still doing most of
the fighting on the ground in the eastern half of the country.
	   On Monday, a Rwandan commander, who only identified himself as
Milton, said he had received no cease-fire orders and instead was
reinforcing positions in preparation for an attack across the Congo
River at Kabalo, 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of the eastern
rebel stronghold at Goma.
	   ``We are waiting for orders to attack. There is no cease-fire,''
Milton said.
	   Zimbabwe, Kabila's main ally, flew MiG-21s fighter jets, Puma
helicopter gun ships as well as Russian-built Mi-24 HIND transport
helicopters over the southern frontlines. Rebels scurried for cover
in thick forests and banana groves.
	   Occasional air strikes have slowed down the rebels and disrupted
the communication lines, but Milton said most of the bombs missed
their targets and changed nothing on the battlefield.
	   ``The aircraft keep us tied down while helicopters drop off the
Zimbabweans behind our defense lines,'' Milton said. ``But at the
end, we always engage them, and there has been little advancing on
either side.''
	   He said so far his forces had killed more than 100 Zimbabweans.
The claim could not be confirmed independently, although identity
cards of some of Zimbabweans were put on display.
	   Milton dismissed the government's claims of a counteroffensive
at Kabalo and Lake Tanganyika ports of Kalemie and Moba, 150
kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Nyunzu, saying the towns were
quiet on Monday and last week's aerial bombing did little damage.
	   The rebels said they had surrounded Manono, 80 kilometers (50
miles) south of Nyunzu and Kabila's birthplace, which lies on route
to Lubumbashi, the capital of copper-rich Katanga Province.

Oman, China score big wins; Turkmenistan upsets Vietnam

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Hani al-Dabit scored three second-half
goals Monday in Oman's 6-0 demolition of Hong Kong in the
preliminary soccer round of the Asian Games, unofficially opening
the continent's biggest sporting event in impressive style.
	   China crushed Lebanon 4-1, while Turkmenistan upset Vietnam 2-0.
	   Oman's performance before a handful of spectators in Bangkok's
National Stadium sounded a warning for host Thailand, the third
team in Group F. The Thais are under pressure to show they can play
after last week's embarrassing brawl against Qatar in a friendly
match.
	   After an initial probe of defenses, Oman moved ahead of Hong
Kong with goals in the 13th and 42nd minutes. The outclassed,
inexperienced Hong Kong side crumbled in the second half as the
Omanis easily threaded their defenses.
	   Al-Dabit skirted past two defenders to slot his first goal in
the 74th minute. Teammate M. Qasim eluded a charge out of the box
by the goalkeeper a minute later and put Oman ahead 4-0.
	   Al-Dabit scored his second goal in the 80th minute, and the
third seconds before the end.
	   In the southern city of Surat Thani, China had chances to
destroy Lebanon in equally convincing style, but two strong early
shots were blocked by the near post and crossbar.
	   The Chinese scored on an alert secondary attack by Fan Chiyi off
a free kick in the 21st minute. Seven minutes later, Ma Mingyu sent
in a blistering shot from just above the penalty area.
	   Li Jinyu and Wang Peng padded China's tally in the second half,
with a lone Lebanese reply coming from Jamal Taha in the 59th
minute.
	   Both sides should easily crush Cambodia, the third team in Group
B.
	   Meanwhile, Turkmenistan proved itself a contender in a tough
group with Vietnam and South Korea, beating the Vietnamese on two
first-half goals.
	   Twenty-three countries are fielding teams in soccer, the most
popular event of the games, Asia's premier Olympic-style event.
	   The games, which do not officially open until Sunday, will bring
together more than 6,000 athletes from 41 nations.

Forbes: Cowboys most valuable team in North America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dallas Cowboys is the most valuable
franchise among the 113 that play North America's four major
professional sports, Forbes magazine reported.
	   The National Football League team has a net worth of dlrs 413
million and is the most profitable, earning dlrs 41.3 million last
year, Forbes estimates in its Dec. 14 issue.
	   The NFL's Washington Redskins, worth dlrs 403 million, and
Carolina Panthers, at dlrs 365 million, are the second and third
most valuable franchises, while Major League Baseball's New York
Yankees are fourth at dlrs 362 million.
	   Forbes' estimated valuation of the Yankees is far below what
Cablevision Systems Inc. and George Steinbrenner have valued the
team at in their sale discussions _ dlrs 600 million to dlrs 1
billion, according to various reports.
	   The Chicago Bulls is the most valuable National Basketball
Association franchise at dlrs 303 million, followed by the New York
Knicks (dlrs 296 million) and Los Angeles Lakers (dlrs 268
million). The New York Rangers, at dlrs 195 million, take the
honors in the National Hockey League.
	   While the Los Angeles Dodgers were sold to Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. earlier this year for about dlrs 350 million, Forbes says the
team is worth dlrs 236 million, eighth among pro baseball teams.
	   The Baltimore Orioles are ranked second in baseball at dlrs 323
million, followed by the Cleveland Indians (dlrs 322 million),
Colorado Rockies (dlrs 303 million) and Atlanta Braves (dlrs 299
million).
	   Estimates are based on 1997 revenue and expenses for baseball
and NFL teams, and 1997-98 revenue and expenses for NBA and NHL
teams. Where public data was not available, Forbes used estimates
from consultants, bankers, stadium operators and trade
publications.

Afghan opposition claims gains in north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The northern-based opposition
alliance Monday claimed to have routed the Taliban Islamic militia
from a district in northern Jozjan province after heavy fighting.
	   They said more than 200 Taliban troops were captured.
	   ``The Taliban have taken a heavy beating in Sangcharak district.
The area is now under our control,'' Haji Sadiq, a spokesman of the
opposition Hezb-e-Wahadat party, said.
	   Sangcharak is around 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of the
capital, Kabul.
	   More than 200 Taliban fighters were taken prisoners, while about
2,000 switched allegiance, Sadiq said.
	   There has been no independent confirmation of the opposition
claims nor was there any immediate response from the Taliban.
	   Wahadat is a Shiite Muslim party that is part of the opposition
alliance comprised mainly of religious and ethnic minorities that
also includes Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and are
mostly Pashtun _ the majority ethnic group of Afghanistan.
	   They rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, including the
capital, while the opposition controls the remaining 10 percent of
the country.

Solution Six wins multimillion-dollar Netherlands order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ International accountancy software
supplier Solution 6 Holdings Ltd. said Monday it has won a
multimillion-dollar software contract in the Netherlands.
	   Solution 6 has been contracted to provide support services and
supply Dutch accountancy firm Moret Ernst and Young in the
Netherlands with its CABS2000 Practice Management System.
	   It is the company's second largest practice management software
and services sale ever and will provide support for at least 5,000
professionals in 50 offices throughout the Netherlands.
	   Moret Ernst and Young is the largest professional services
company in the Netherlands, and is Ernst and Young's third biggest
practice in the world.
	   The contract provides a significant springboard for Solution 6
into the European market, with the implementation and support
services covering an initial five-year period.
	   Chris Tyler, managing director and chief executive officer of
Solution 6, said the contract reinforced the success of the
company's export strategies and its return to core revenue streams.
	   ``It follows our recent wins to supply practice management
software to 35,000 Deloitte and Touche professionals across the
globe and to Saba and Co., one of the largest practices in the
Middle East,'' Tyler said.
	   Solution 6's general manager of global sales and marketing,
Richard McLean, said the company was committed to a rapid expansion
of its European operations and that the positive economics of the
large-scale implementation, combined with the very large KPMG firm
already using CABS2000 in the Netherlands, gave Solution 6 a solid
platform.
	   ``It means that we will locate staff on site, providing the
basis for a European sales office,'' McLean said.
	   ``We intend to pursue opportunities in every possible market
with vigor and commitment. ... Our return to core business activity
is now clearly paying off.``
	   Solution 6 is the world's leading supplier of business systems
to the accounting profession.
	   The company currently holds the largest market share in
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Britain in the practice
management, client accounting and taxation markets and in Australia
has a presence in more than 65 percent of the accounting services
industry firms.
	   Solution 6 acquired CABS _ a privately owned Australian company
and the leading international supplier of practice management
systems for large accountancy firms _ in July 1997.
	   CABS2000 is a 32-bit, client/server, practice management system,
which is database independent and has been designed so that the
software can run on any size system, from a notebook PC to an
enterprise system.

Afghan barbers trim beards despite fear of punishment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos ISL101-102
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Professional beard trimming is a
clandestine business in Taliban-ruled Kabul, where shaving is a
crime that can land you in jail or get you beaten.
	   Inside their homes, barbers trim the beards of a brave few who
sneak a quick trim while getting a haircut.
	   The ban on shaving was imposed by the Taliban army _ Islamic
religious students turned guerrilla fighters _ after it took
control of Kabul in September 1996 and imposed a strict version of
Islamic law.
	   ``It is not just women who have suffered under the Taliban ...
men have also borne the brunt,'' said Zulmair Khan, who was having
his beard trimmed because, he said, ``hairs comes into my mouth
when I eat.''
	   His frustration surpassed his fear of punishment.
	   ``The Taliban can punish me for this, but this long beard _
especially when it is untrimmed _ really makes my life miserable,''
he said.
	   The job was done quickly and only after the barber posted his
8-year-old son as a sentry to watch for patrolling Taliban
soldiers.
	   ``Don't fall asleep ... warn us if you see them,'' said Zahir,
who gave only one name.
	   He snipped briskly, worrying his young son would tire of his
task and his vigilance wane.
	   ``Some men really beg and implore me to shorten their beards ...
so I have to take the risk,'' Zahir said.
	   He said he wasn't worried Taliban authorities might be able to
identify him from a news story, because his name is common in
Afghanistan.
	   In Kabul, once a relatively sophisticated capital where European
fashions were worn by the city's well-to-do, music has been banned
by the Taliban along with most forms of light entertainment.
	   ``Men miss even small things in life, which comes so normally
everywhere else,'' Khan said while getting his beard trimmed.
	   The Taliban's no-shaving edict comes from their belief that
Islam's prophet Mohammed ruled against shaving.
	   Barbers have been given strict orders to not even touch a beard
with a pair of scissors because it is ``un-Islamic.''
	   Taliban leaders also have their own idea of an ``Islamic hair
style,'' Zahir said.
	   The forehead should be free of hair so as not to interfere when
a man prays and touches his forehead to his prayer mat. Center
parting is fine and closely shaved in the back is best.
	   About 1,000 Taliban militiamen patrol the streets, often armed
with steel wires, to publicly beat offenders.
	   One shopkeeper, Innyat Ullah, said he misses the looser rules of
the days of communist rule under then President Najibullah, who was
hanged by the Taliban for prolonging the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan and causing the death of 1.5 million Afghans.
	   But for Ullah those days were memorable for other reasons.
	   ``I used to shave my beard daily ... wear trousers and live a
normal life, but now all those days are a memory. The present is
bitter and dark.''
	   Today men are required to wear the traditional Afghan ``shalwar
kameez,'' a pajama-like outfit of baggy pants and long shirt.
	   When the Taliban first arrived in Kabul, the more zealous
religious policemen would check men's armpits for hair, which also
is forbidden.
	   Zahir, who charges 10,000 Afghanis (28 cents) for a hair cut,
says his business is barely operating. Where he once employed eight
barbers, there is now only one.

UConn No. 1 for second time

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Connecticut moved to the top of The Associated
Press college basketball poll Monday, the second time in school
history the Huskies have been ranked No. 1.
	   After a week that saw 10 ranked teams suffer their first loss of
the season, the Huskies (4-0) climbed one spot to their first No. 1
ranking since Feb. 13, 1995.
	   That stint at the top lasted just one week as Connecticut won at
Georgetown, which had been ranked the week before, before losing at
home to No. 15 Villanova by 23 points, the worst loss in their nine
seasons at Gampel Pavilion.
	   The Huskies will play two ranked teams this week _ No. 15
Washington in the Great Eight in Chicago on Tuesday night and No. 9
Michigan State on Saturday in Gampel. They received 52 first-place
votes and 1,751 points from the national media panel.
	   Maryland (7-0), which won the Puerto Rico Shootout in impressive
fashion last week, jumped from fifth to second with 16 No. 1 votes
and 1,698 points. The ranking is the Terrapins' highest since they
were No. 2 during the 1975-76 season.
	   Preseason NIT champion North Carolina (6-0) moved from ninth to
third and had one first-place vote and 1,549 points, 18 more than
Duke (5-1), which dropped from No. 1 after losing to Cincinnati in
the final of the Great Alaska Shootout.
	   The new poll has teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference ranked
Nos. 2-4 with a fourth member, Clemson, ranked 24th.
	   Stanford (4-1) lost to North Carolina in the Preseason NIT title
game and fell two spots to fifth. The Cardinal had one first-place
vote as did Cincinnati (4-0), which jumped from 15th to sixth after
beating Duke.
	   Kansas moved up one place to No. 7 and was followed by Kentucky,
Michigan State and Temple.
	   Oklahoma State was 11th and was joined in top 20 by Syracuse,
Arizona, Purdue, Washington, Indiana, New Mexico, UCLA, Arkansas
and Pittsburgh.
	   Nos. 21-25 were Utah, Miami of Ohio, Xavier, Clemson and St.
John's.
	   Tennessee (3-2), which beat Chattanooga in its only game last
week, dropped from the rankings. The Volunteers were ninth in the
preseason, dropped to 18th after losing to Arizona and then to 25th
after losing to Miami of Ohio.
	   Pittsburgh (6-1), which beat unbeaten ranked teams Xavier and
Kentucky on consecutive days in Puerto Rico before losing to
Maryland in the championship game, is in the Top 25 for the first
time since 1992-93. The Panthers got as high as No. 13 that season.
	   The other ranked teams to lose for the time this week were
Temple, UCLA, Purdue, Indiana, Clemson and St. John's.
	   UCLA and Xavier each lost two games at the Puerto Rico Shootout
and dropped eight and 10 places, respectively.

President to consult Parliament again on prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS top 11 grafs to clarify that offer formal, Hariri
declined; CORRECTS dates for consultations in 3rd graf.
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Emile Lahoud announced Monday
that the country's current prime minister, Rafik Hariri, had
declined to form a new government and said he was scheduling a
fresh round of consultations to choose a premier.
	   The move by Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992,
could be a bargaining tactic. Still, the apparent tension between
the two men may affect Lebanon's economic stability as it recovers
from its 1975-90 civil war.
	   The president said consultations with the 128-member Parliament
on choosing a prime minister would be held Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Sources close to Hariri said Sunday that he had turned down an
offer from Lahoud to form a new government.
	   That offer _ which Hariri supporters had described as an
informal request _ came after a round of consultations last week
between Lahoud and the legislative body.
	   A statement from the president's office on Monday made the offer
formal but said the prime minister bowed out and the president
accepted the decision.
	   Hariri apparently was miffed that the Parliament consultations
had not resulted in an overwhelming mandate for him.
	   The prime minister did not feel the president followed
constitutional rules in the consultation process, the sources close
to Hariri added.
	   The dispute pits Lahoud, an assertive army commander at the
start of a six-year presidential term, against Hariri, a
billionaire businessman who virtually has had a free hand in
running the country since he became premier in 1992.
	   Lahoud and Hariri met Monday after the president announced he
accepted Hariri's decision. The meeting lasted just 10 minutes and
apparently did not help resolve the dispute.
	   Hariri declined to speak with reporters after the meeting.
	   Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday.
	   Hariri, 53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar
postwar reconstruction program, is credited with restoring economic
confidence and stabilizing the national currency. But he also was
faulted for declining living standards and a rise in corruption in
government.
	   Lahoud, 62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to
power with widespread popular backing, made his name rebuilding the
military after it disintegrated in the civil war.
	   The British-trained general pledged in a tough inauguration
speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.

Germany's biggest industry union fills leadership post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Germany's main industrial labor union,
IG Metall, filled a senior post Monday that was vacated by the man
who became the new government's labor minister.
	   Former IG Metall vice chairman Walter Riester now is Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's point man for job creation talks between
government, industry and labor that start next week.
	   Schroeder has made the talks a centerpiece of his strategy to
fight unemployment.
	   IG Metall delegates voted 559-50 to replace Riester with Juergen
Peters, a combative and outspoken former regional boss, against the
wishes of union chief Klaus Zwickel, who had backed a more moderate
candidate.
	   Peters is known as a tough negotiator, for instance in 1993
talks that led to shorter working hours at automaker Volkswagen.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ For 10-year-old leukemia
patient Nitin Vijaya Raghavan, the prospect of meeting Santa Claus
and seeing his first snow outweighed fears of traveling without his
family.
	   ``I want to see snow and throw it at the other kids,'' said
Raghavan, his impish eyes sparkling behind wire-rimmed glasses.
``And I want to meet the real Santa, not the ones at the malls,''
added the Indian native.
	   Raghavan is one of 15 children with terminal diseases who left
Monday to take part in a dream trip to the mythical abode of Santa
Claus in Finnish Lapland.
	   The children, ages 6 to 14, suffer from cancer, the blood
disease thalassemia and mental and physical handicaps.
	   It was the first time children from Dubai _ who include those of
expatriate Asians and Europeans as well as Arabs _ were included in
the trip sponsored by an Irish charity fund that has sent Irish
youngsters on the journey for five years.
	   ``We wanted to send a rainbow of colors to see Santa Claus, a
bouquet of different-colored flowers instead of just Europeans,''
said Con Murphy, who created the Children for Lapland Appeal.
	   Murphy said the fund's goal is to give the children a respite
from constant blood transfusions, injections and chemotherapy _ and
maybe a final shot at happiness.
	   Of the 280 Irish children who traveled last year, 30 died within
months of their return.
	   ``I wanted to give happiness to terminally-ill children, even
for a short time,'' Murphy said. ``The idea was to create moments
of joy in the lives of the children who have been burdened with
these illnesses.''
	   Santa's home was chosen as the destination because, as Murphy
put it, ``No matter what nationality or religion a child is, the
idea of meeting Santa Claus is magical.''
	   Murphy, who runs a travel agency in Dublin, said his trips to
Dubai made him want to expand the appeal to include the emirate
with its multi-ethnic population.
	   Among the children chosen in Dubai are four Indians, three
Filipinos, three from the emirate as well as youngsters from Oman,
Jordan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and France. Three-quarters of the
United Arab Emirates population of 2.4 million are foreigners.
	   A four-month radio appeal for the children's trip and a concert
in Dubai by Irish performers raised 300,000 dirhams (dlrs 80,000)
by early November. Final figures on the fund were not available.
	   Children chosen to participate had to be healthy enough to
travel and not be wheelchair-bound, said John Flynn, the charity's
Dubai coordinator.
	   On the five-day trip, the children will join some 180 youngsters
from Northern Ireland and Ireland in Dublin, then travel to Finnish
Lapland. They will ride on snowmobiles and sleighs pulled by
reindeer and huskies. The highlight will be receiving presents from
Santa.
	   ``I will ask him for a Mutant Ninja Turtles video game,'' said
Raghavan, the Indian youngster. ``I couldn't find it here, but I'm
sure Santa will have one.''

South Africa creep towards victory over West Indies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa, on 77 for three
at lunch on the final day, need 87 more to win the first test
against the West Indies at the Wanderers Stadium Monday.
	   But the start was a tenuous one, as the home side lost two early
wickets with their score on just 14.
	   The opening pace duo of Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh
removed Gary Kirsten (7) and Adam Bacher (6) respectively. Then
Jacques Kallis and Darryl Cullinan steadied things. Cullinan began
hitting out, speeding to a good-looking 35 before he was
brilliantly caught at midwicket by Stuart Williams.
	   The fall brought Hansie Cronje to the wicket, and he (7) and
Kallis (20) remained undefeated going into lunch.
	   With the pitch playing unpredictably, the match is neither won
nor lost yet. Wide cracks have made for uneven bounce, and Rawl
Lewis and Carl Hooper have a major role to play with their spin
bowling because of this.

Yeltsin stays in hospital, impeachment motion advances slowly

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin meeting with his aide in grafs 2 and 12,
minor editing to tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained in a government
hospital Monday receiving treatment for pneumonia, while his
Communist foes in parliament pressed ahead with an impeachment
motion.
	   The president's office said the 67-year-old Yeltsin was
``getting better'' and held a meeting with his chief-of-staff
Valentin Yumashev. The president has been hospitalized since Nov.
22, the latest in a string of illnesses.
	   Meanwhile, a parliamentary impeachment panel debated whether
Yeltsin, as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, was
responsible for the steady decay of the Russian military.
	   The panel failed to reach a definite conclusion. Several
lawmakers accused Yeltsin of neglecting the armed forces, but said
it would be hard to prove it was a premeditated action, and
therefore an impeachable offense.
	   The panel, set up last summer by the parliament's lower house,
the State Duma, has already accused Yeltsin on three offenses they
say are grounds for impeachment _ instigating the 1991 collapse of
the Soviet Union, using force against lawmakers holed up in
parliament in 1993, and launching the botched war in separatist
Chechnya in 1994.
	   When the commission wraps up its work, the Duma will decide
whether to launch a full-fledged impeachment motion. The Duma would
need a two-thirds majority to do that.
	   To succeed, the move would then require the same majority in the
upper chamber of parliament as well as consent of both the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts.
	   Several previous impeachment attempts have failed and this one
also appears to have little chance of forcing Yeltsin from office.
But the Communists and their hard-line allies have been able to use
the panel to keep up pressure on Yeltsin at a time when he has not
been able to effectively govern.
	   Yeltsin's repeated illnesses, and his infrequent appearances in
the Kremlin, have raised concerns about his ability to perform his
duties through the end of his term in mid-2000.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said Sunday that the
president would stay in the hospital for at least several more
days.
	   ``Doctors are insisting that the president stay inside since
pneumonia is more serious than an ordinary respiratory infection,''
Yakushkin said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Yakushkin said last week that doctors advised Yeltsin against
seeing visitors because of a virus going around Moscow. However,
Yeltsin held meetings over the weekend and again on Monday.

Real Madrid seeking second world club title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ European champion Real Madrid of Spain seeks its
second world soccer club title in 38 years when it meets South
American champion Vasco Da Gama of Brazil on Tuesday.
	   Vasco Da Gama, meanwhile, is counting on its spirit to make up
for the lack of a big-name player. It is hoping to celebrate the
club's 100th birthday with its first victory in the Toyota Cup, the
game to decide the world's No. 1 soccer club team.
	   The Brazilians arrived two weeks ahead of the game to train in
Japan.
	   Real Madrid, which won the first world club championship in
1960, has some top players, including Davor Suker, who led the
Croatian team to a bronze medal in the World Cup in France this
year. With six goals, he was the World Cup's top scorer.
	   But some analysts suggest the Real Madrid players may be
dragging a bit because of their hard schedule, including two games
in the last week.
	   Real Madrid lost 3-1 to AC Milan of Italy in the Championship
League Cup in Milan, Italy, last Wednesday before flying into Japan
Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Vasco Da Gama, since arriving Nov. 16, has been
training in Kagoshima, southwestern Japan, adjusting to local
conditions.
	   ``We had the best training here,'' Brazilian national team
member Felipe was quoted as saying by the newspaper Nikkan Sports.
	   The game starts at 7:10 p.m. (1010 GMT) Tuesday at the
55,000-seat National Stadium in downtown Tokyo.
	   Mitsugu Hakkaku, a spokesman of the Toyota Europe-South American
Cup office, said all tickets were sold out in three hours after
they went on sale Oct. 11. Ticket prices ranged from 3,000 to 9,000
yen (dlrs 24 to dlrs 72), he said.
	   The Europe-South American championship originally was called the
Intercontinental Cup and used a best-of-three game format from 1960
until a two-game format was instituted in 1968.
	   In 1980, Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, became
the sponsor, and changed it to a one-game championship staged in
Tokyo.
	   In 1997, Borussia Dortmund of Germany beat Cruzeiro of Brazil
2-0, giving European teams their third straight victory.
	   So far, South American clubs (Copa Libertadores champions) have
won 20 times and European Clubs (European Champions Cup champions)
16 times.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Hani al-Dabit scored three second-half
goals Monday in Oman's 6-0 demolition of Hong Kong in the
preliminary soccer round of the Asian Games, unofficially opening
the continent's biggest sporting event in impressive style.
	   China crushed Lebanon 4-1, while Turkmenistan upset Vietnam 2-0.
	   Oman's performance before a handful of spectators in Bangkok's
National Stadium sounded a warning for host Thailand, the third
team in Group F. The Thais are under pressure to show they can play
after last week's embarrassing brawl against Qatar in a friendly
match.
	   After an initial probe of defenses, Oman moved ahead of Hong
Kong with goals in the 13th and 42nd minutes. The outclassed,
inexperienced Hong Kong side crumbled in the second half as the
Omanis easily threaded their defenses.
	   Al-Dabit skirted past two defenders to slot his first goal in
the 74th minute. Teammate M. Qasim eluded a charge out of the box
by the goalkeeper a minute later and put Oman ahead 4-0.
	   Al-Dabit scored his second goal in the 80th minute, and the
third seconds before the end.
	   In the southern city of Surat Thani, China had chances to
destroy Lebanon in equally convincing style, but two strong early
shots were blocked by the near post and crossbar.
	   The Chinese scored on an alert secondary attack by Fan Chiyi off
a free kick in the 21st minute. Seven minutes later, Ma Mingyu sent
in a blistering shot from just above the penalty area.
	   Li Jinyu and Wang Peng padded China's tally in the second half,
with a lone Lebanese reply coming from Jamal Taha in the 59th
minute.
	   Both sides should easily crush Cambodia, the third team in Group
B.
	   Meanwhile, Turkmenistan proved itself a contender in a tough
group with Vietnam and South Korea, beating the Vietnamese on
first-half goals by Andrei Zavlayov and Roman Bondarenko.
	   Twenty-three countries are fielding teams in soccer, the most
popular event of the games, Asia's premier Olympic-style event.
	   The games, which do not officially open until Sunday, will bring
together more than 6,000 athletes from 41 nations.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs set fire to three mosques in West
Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands of Christians
degenerated into a riot, the military and residents said.
	   A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school.
Troops and riot police patrolled the streets.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests
as fighting between Muslims and Christians continued after dark,
said a military officer who spoke by telephone on condition of
anonymity.
	   The violence in the city of Kupang was in retaliation for the
burning and ransacking of 22 Christian churches by Muslim mobs in
the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were killed.
	   West Timor shares the same island as troubled East Timor, a
former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman Catholicism and
invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Christians, mostly Protestants, dominate Kupang, about 1,875
kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.
However, a sizable Muslim minority also lives there.
	   The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged a
peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church
attacks.
	   Most offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, the
capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor called for
calm.
	   Organizers of Monday's strike had called for a non-violent ``day
of mourning.''
	   However, residents said fires broke out in three mosques after
rival gangs pelted each other with rocks.
	   Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia.
	   Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation have
intensified as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   There is also political turmoil as student protesters demand
greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former
President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in
May.
	   Religious strife erupted recently in the eastern part of the
main island of Java, where more than 150 people, many of them
Islamic clerics, have been murdered, apparently by rival Muslim
groups. Many of the dead were accused of practicing black magic.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ It's clear to at least one group of
Indian lawmakers what the governing party's poor showing in recent
state elections means.
	   ``Resign! Resign! You have no moral right to govern,'' chanted
opposition lawmakers in the federal Parliament Monday, taunting
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Hindu nationalist
colleagues. The uproar forced parliament, just beginning its winter
session, to adjourn for several hours.
	   Final results released over the weekend showed that the
Bharatiya Janata Party lost power to the main opposition Congress
party in the key states of New Delhi and Rajasthan and failed to
oust Congress in Madhya Pradesh. Elections were also held Wednesday
in the far northeastern state of Mizoram, where a local party won
in a field that did not include the BJP.
	   The results do not directly affect Vajpayee's 19-party
coalition. But they're seen as a rebuff for the party that came to
federal power eight months ago. Skyrocketing prices of vegetables
and other food became the single biggest issue, eclipsing the
nuclear tests in May that had briefly increased the popularity of
the BJP.
	   ``The price rise issue was like a wave that swept everything
away,'' said BJP vice president J.P. Mathur. ``We got drowned in
that wave. What could we do? Who care about the good things we have
done? Nobody. Absolutely nobody.''
	   Even Prime Minister Vajpayee conceded the failure of his
government to curb the rise in prices.
	   ``There have been some shortcomings,'' he told members of his
coalition, during a post-election stocktaking.
	   The results have again turned the spotlight on Sonia Gandhi,
president of the Congress Party and widow of former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi. After being chosen president of the party in March,
she began a program to revamp it, relying on trusted lieutenants to
campaign against the BJP.
	   Over the months, party workers have urged her to make a bid to
bring down the Vajpayee government. She has regularly refused, as
she has this time, too.
	   Asked during a Sunday interview with the private STAR television
network whether her party would seek a vote of no-confidence
against the government, she said: ``We ought not to rush into
certain situations. I wouldn't like to do so.''
	   ``Even if she does, can the Congress come to power?'' asked
Inderjit Gupta, a communist lawmaker and is regarded as one of
India's leading intellectuals. ``Congress just doesn't have the
numbers.''
	   No single party has a simple majority in the 545-member lower
house of Parliament. The BJP, the single largest group, came to
power with the help of independents or small regional groups, all
of whom have been constantly threatening to withdraw from the
government over local issues.
	   Following last week's defeat, BJP allies have formally said they
will support the government, although some of them too have
complained that the administration is inefficient.
	   Several coalition members who have hinted at withdrawing support
_ forcing the federal government to collapse _ may now be thinking
even more seriously about backing Congress. If the BJP government
falls before its five-year term ends, Congress or another party
could be asked to form a new government, or early elections could
be called.
	   Mamata Banerjee, leader of the Trinamul Congress, which is part
of the coalition, said the BJP has been unable to govern. But she
said her party would continue to support the coalition _ for now.
	   Rejecting both the BJP and the Congress, some lawmakers _
including some members of Vajpayee's own coalition _ are suggesting
formation of a third front of socialists and communists backed by
the Congress. But lack of a mutually acceptable leader _ let alone
policies _ is hampering the formation of such a front.

Gay rights campaigner in court over church protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A gay rights activist appeared in court Monday
charged with ``indecent behavior in a church'' under a
seldom-invoked law branded ``archaic and repressive'' by
free-speech campaigners trying to get it repealed.
	   Peter Tatchell, who heads the British gay rights group Outrage,
was arrested under the 1860 Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act
after he staged a three-minute protest beneath the pulpit as the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Britain's top cleric, was about to
deliver his Easter Sunday sermon April 12 at Canterbury Cathedral.
	   He could face two months in jail for the interruption in which
he criticized the archbishop's opposition to lowering the
homosexual age of consent and the church ban on the ordination of
gay clergy. He denies the charge of indecent behavior.
	   ``A two month jail sentence is extraordinarily draconian and
hugely harsh, given that you can assault people and get community
service these days,'' said Keith Wood, general secretary of the
National Secular Society, which is trying to get the law repealed.
	   The law was last used in 1967 when two anti-war activists were
jailed for two months after protesting in a Methodist church as
then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson delivered a sermon.
	   ``This is an archaic remnant of church privilege designed to
stifle dissent,'' Wood said. ``It clearly isn't needed, otherwise
ti would have been used more frequently.''
	   Amnesty International has expressed concern that Tatchell will
not have a fair trial because the courts have already refused him
permission to call the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, as a
witness at his two-day trial.
	   ``Mr. Tatchell is not being prosecuted on account of any views
that he may hold in regard to the matters that were the subject of
his protests,'' prosecutor Montague told the court. ``It was
inappropriate both as to time and place. It was unseemly. It was
indecorous.''
	   Public figures such as playwright Harold Pinter called for the
law to be abolished in a letter to The Times newspaper Monday,
while other celebrities such as actor Ian McKellan and actress
Vanessa Redgrave have also come to Tatchell's defense.

150,000 Cambodians HIV-positive on World AIDS Day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia marks World AIDS Day with a
somber estimate that 150,000 people _ 1.3 percent of the population
_ are infected with the AIDS virus.
	   The Health Ministry's announcement Monday on the eve of the
world AIDS observance indicated that public campaigns to reduce the
highest HIV infection rate in Asia have had little impact.
	   The ministry estimated that 90 percent of those infected with
HIV, the virus that leads to the deadly acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, are unaware they are infected and carrying the disease.
	   The ministry's HIV-AIDS control center estimated earlier in the
year that 50 to 70 people catch HIV in Cambodia every day.
	   ``The situation of HIV is serious, dangerous and causing
concerns,'' said Dr. Mean Chhi Vun, the center's director.
	   Because AIDS has yet to be recognized by Cambodians as a serious
health problem, sexual habits have not changed and the infection
rate continues to soar, Mean Chhi Vun said.
	   ``The change in behavior that would lead to prevention of
HIV-AIDS, the main desire of health experts, must become the
objective of public policy-makers and other groups in society,''
Mean Chhi Vun said.
	   Prostitution is a tolerated, dlrs 32 million a year business and
a main contributor to the spread of HIV.
	   Forty-two percent of Cambodia's 20,000 prostitutes are
HIV-positive, according to ministry statistics, and 90 percent of
infections are caused by sexual intercourse.

UN report says developing countries face food problems in cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ As cities in developing countries, particularly in
Asia and Africa, continue their fast-paced growth, more and more
people will face food shortages, according to a U.N. food agency.
	   The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization's annual report
said that in the next 20 years 93 percent of the world's urban
growth will occur in cities of the developing world.
	   The trend means people previously living in rural areas and
accustomed to growing their own food will be forced to use up to 80
percent of their income on food, straining their ability to pay for
shelter and other needs.
	   Government policies, including the suspension of food subsidies
and structural adjustments which have reduced job opportunities and
led to currency devaluation. have also worsened city dwellers'
ability to buy food.
	   According to figures by the World Bank, cited in the report, the
number of poor people in cities will rise from approximately 400
million in 1990 to 1 billion by the end of the decade.
	   The report, which was released last week, devoted a separate
chapter to the problem of feeding the cities.

Report: Y2K glitches to cost Dutch companies billions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Computer glitches triggered by the
new millennium will cost Dutch companies up to 6 billion guilders
(dlrs 3.15 billion), the government warned Monday.
	   Of that amount, 3.5 billion guilders (dlrs 1.8 billion) will be
for new year-2000 software, while wage costs will be the second
largest expense, the Central Bureau of Statistics said in a report.
	   The agency said about 2,500 Dutch companies are not prepared for
the so-called millennium bug, which could cause computers that are
set to read only the last two digits of the year to malfunction
when the calendar changes to 2000.
	   ``These are companies with five or more employees which expect
that even by the end of next year, the most crucial of their
software won't be millennium-proof,'' the report said.
	   Although this group is relatively small considering there are
97,000 companies in the Netherlands, the CBS said the ripple effect
will impact many more businesses.
	   It said the least-prepared industry is the energy sector. Only 2
percent of energy companies questioned said their computer systems
are protected.

Hun Sen to strive for U.N., ASEAN seats as new government formed

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Four months after his narrow victory
in disputed elections, Hun Sen was sworn in as prime minister
Monday with a new government that he promised would carry out
much-needed reforms.
	   Hun Sen, his 27 new ministers and 54 secretaries of state donned
traditional white tunics and orange pantaloons for the swearing-in
ceremony at the Royal Palace.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk confirmed the government in a royal decree
sent from Beijing, China, where he is receiving medical treatment.
His son Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the National
Assembly, presided over the ceremony as acting head of state.
	   ``This is another historic day,'' Ranariddh said after the
ceremony. ``The newborn baby is healthy. It is now easy for all of
us to be together because we have settled all of the problems.''
	   Earlier Monday, Hun Sen and his coalition Cabinet were approved
99-13 by the 122-seat National Assembly. Three lawmakers abstained,
six were absent and one vote was declared invalid.
	   Hun Sen told reporters that reclaiming Cambodia's seat at the
United Nations and gaining entry to the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations would be among his first initiatives.
	   Cambodia's international standing plummeted after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh, his co-prime minister, in a violent coup last
year. The installation of a new elected government should restore
international legitimacy.
	   ASEAN members are reportedly divided on Cambodia's prospects for
entry at the group's annual meeting next month in Hanoi. Vietnam
strongly supports quick entry while the Philippines and Singapore
have indicated they hope to see signs of stability first.
	   Ten ministers have retained their posts in the new Cabinet, but
Hun Sen promised his team would implement sweeping changes to put
the struggling country on a path to prosperity.
	   ``I must respond to the expectations of you and the people, who
want to see a new government function better and be stronger and
more effective than before,'' Hun Sen told the assembly before the
vote.
	   Anti-corruption measures, judicial independence, economic
reforms, a streamlined civil service, protection of the environment
and respect for human rights were all promised.
	   The statement read like the list of concerns voiced by foreign
donors and investors, whose generosity is vital for the desperately
poor nation to function.
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, said
his party supported the reform proposals but rejected the selection
of many ministers from the last government as ``a recipe for
disaster.''
	   After last year's coup, Ranariddh and most of his ministers fled
Cambodia and did not return until a few months before the
elections.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won, but a political crisis
followed when parties led by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy alleged
election fraud and denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament
necessary to approve a government.
	   Ranariddh, bowing to what he described as intense international
pressure, broke the stalemate Nov. 13 with a deal that made him the
president of the National Assembly and gave his party nearly half
the positions in the Cabinet.
	   Hun Sen's party, however, has retained tight control of fiscal
and administrative functions, heading the ministries of finance,
commerce, foreign affairs, planning, industry and agriculture.

Murderer of 12 who teased him about school failure given death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A criminal court on Monday sentenced to
death a 19-year-old Jordanian convicted of murdering 11 members of
his family and a friend who had all harassed him about his failures
in school.
	   Judge Mohammed Ajamieh rejected a plea of mercy from Saeed
Qashash, who sat passively in the courtroom. As is customary, the
sentence was announced on the same day as the verdict, guilty on 12
counts of premeditated murder.
	   Qashash reportedly confessed to police that he shot his father,
mother, two brothers, four sisters and the husband and two children
of one sister, as well as a 19-year-old schoolmate, all on last
June 10.
	   According to the charges, the defendant who had failed his
secondary school exam lured the victims one by one to a basement
and shot each of them while they had their backs to him. He then
sealed the basement with bricks and cement.

Aircraft maintenance company to lay off 350 workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's leading aircraft maintenance
company is laying off 352 employees, or about 8 percent of its work
force, because of the downturn in the aviation industry, local
media reports said Monday.
	   The government-owned Radio Hong Kong quoted an official of the
the Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co. Ltd. as saying that the move
was necessary because of high operating costs.
	   The company announced earlier this year that net profit for the
six months to June 30 fell 22 percent to 140.4 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 18 million).
	   Cathay Pacific Airways has a 25 percent stake in the company,
which maintains and overhauls aircraft in the territory. Cathay
Pacific laid off more than 800 employees earlier this year because
of the region's economic slump.
	   Unemployment in Hong Kong rose to a record 5.3 percent for the
three months ended Oct. 31. Hong Kong's economy, mired in
recession, also shrank by 7 percent in the third quarter.

GE affiliate, others in talks to buy major Japanese leasing firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The finance arm of General Electric Corp. has begun
talks about a possible takeover of a major leasing subsidiary owned
by a failed Japanese bank, a court-appointed administrator said
Monday.
	   The talks come as the Japanese government is moving to deal with
the leasing company's recently nationalized parent, the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., and as GE Capital Corp. is rapidly
expanding its presence in Japan.
	   Yoshihiko Okuno, the administrator, declined to provide details
on the discussions, but said GE Capital was one of several foreign
and domestic companies that had expressed interest in the leasing
company.
	   On Sunday, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported that
Stamford, Connecticut-based GE Capital was considering buying Japan
Leasing for about 900 billion yen (dlrs 7.3 billion).
	   Japan Leasing declared bankruptcy in September with debts of
more than 2 trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion). It was Japan's biggest
corporate collapse since the end of World War II.
	   The court-appointed board of administrators would likely
announce the results of the talks with the suitors within the next
few months, possibly as soon as December, Okuno said, adding he
hoped a single buyer could be found.
	   In February, GE Capital reached an agreement with Toho Mutual
Life Insurance Co. to establish a new life insurance company in
Japan. It bought 80 percent of a Japanese automobile leasing
subsidiary in 1996.
	   Japan Leasing, a leasing agent for computers, aircraft and other
equipment, collapsed under massive soured debts incurred from real
estate speculation during Japan's ``bubble'' economy of easy credit
in the late 1980s.

Japan hopes to win at least 64 golds in Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan hopes to win at least 64 gold medals at the
Asian Games starting Sunday in Bangkok, team leader Teruji Kogake
said.
	   Kogake was speaking Monday at a ceremony inaugurating Japan's
team for the games. Prince Akishino, the younger son of Emperor
Akihito, attended.
	   The Asian Games are an ``important event for us as we look ahead
to the Sydney Olympics in 2000,'' Kogake said.
	   ``We would like to win more gold medals than we had in the last
Asian Games'' in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994, he added.
	   In Hiroshima, China won 125 golds, followed by Japan with 64 and
South Korea with 63.
	   Japan is sending 634 athletes to compete in all 36 sports to be
contested in the games.
	   Tsuneharu Kida, a spokesman of the Japanese delegation, said
Japan particularly hopes to win gold medals in judo, swimming,
track and field, rugby, karate and yachting.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained in a government
hospital Monday receiving treatment for pneumonia, while his
Communist foes in parliament pressed ahead with an impeachment
motion.
	   The president's office said the 67-year-old Yeltsin was

Valentin Yumashev. The president has been hospitalized since Nov.
22, the latest in a string of illnesses.
	   Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin sitting in a
chair across a small table from Yumashev. The president, dressed in
a white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale, listened intently
to his aide, nodding periodically. Like most footage of Yeltsin
released over the past few weeks, Monday's tape don't not contain

Deutsche Bank approves deal to acquire Bankers Trust for dlrs 10.1

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank AG announced Monday the
acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp., in a dlrs 10.1 billion deal
that will create the world's largest financial institution with
assets of more than dlrs 800 billion.
	   Deutsche Bank has offered Bankers Trust shareholders dlrs 93 a
share to seal one of the largest takeovers of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank. The boards of both banks approved
the offer Sunday.
	   The deal merging Germany's largest bank, with assets of dlrs 675
billion, with Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest U.S. bank with dlrs
156 billion in assets, is expected to be closed by May.
	   The combined bank would surpass both current No. 1 UBS AG of
Switzerland and the recently formed Citigroup Inc.
	   The merger will result in 5,500 layoffs, mostly in New York and
London, Deutsche Bank Chairman Rolf Breuer said during a news
conference. He said not all of the lost jobs would be at Bankers
Trust.
	   To retain top management for an undisclosed period, Deutsche
Bank has set aside dlrs 400 million for bonus payments.
	   Deutsche Bank said the deal would be financed partly with a 4
billion mark (dlrs 2.35 billion) capital increase, and a one-time
1.7 billion mark (dlrs 1 billion) restructuring charge for
personnel.
	   Breuer said the restructuring charge will affect Deutsche Bank's
earnings, but he did not say during which quarter the charge would
be made.
	   Deutsche Bank acknowledged that the deal was worth more than
Bankers Trust's assets, and said that it would make annual goodwill
payments of 630 million marks (dlrs 370 million) over 15 years.
	   The merger is part of Deutsche Bank's strategy to extend
operations into North America. But responding to analyst and market
concerns that the bank would lose focus on Europe, Deutsche Bank
said it plans to expand its European asset management and custody
business.
	   Both Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are in the midst of
individual restructuring efforts aimed at cutting costs. Deutsche
Bank announced early this year a 2.5 billion mark (dlrs 1.5
billion) restructuring, while Bankers Trust announced a dlrs 300
million restructuring effort at the end of the third quarter.
	   The merger must obtain approval of both New York state and U.S.
federal banking regulators.

Russians to rescue TV crew trapped on Arctic island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian rescue team will try Tuesday to reach a
three-man television crew that's stranded on a remote Arctic island
and is quickly running out of supplies, a news report said Monday.
	   The Russians will send a helicopter to evacuate the trio, which
includes a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian who were making a
documentary on polar bears, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 and intended to
leave Oct. 15, but was delayed by bad weather. The weather has also
kept Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry from being able to
carry out a helicopter rescue.
	   The three have been holed up in a cabin on the island's
northeast coast, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) west of Alaska.
	   The crew's food supplies have been dwindling, and residents of a
village about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the hut have been
trying to drive a snow tractor to take emergency supplies to the
crew, but the effort has been slowed by bad weather.
	   The temperature has been around minus 30 Celsius (minus 22
Fahrenheit), with a strong wind. The crew has a diesel generator, a
computer, a cellular phone and access to e-mail, but was running
low on fuel, news reports said.
	   The Japanese crew member is Tatsuhiko Kobayashi, an employee of
NHK, the Japanese television company. The Australian is cameraman
John McGuiness. The name of the Russian was not available.

Thailand requests aid from Japanese assistance plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has requested between dlrs
1.15 billion and dlrs 1.35 billion as a first installment from
Japan's dlrs 30 billion assistance fund to crisis-stricken Asian
economies, a Finance Ministry official said Monday.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Thai
government asked Japanese authorities last week for the first
payment from the so-called Miyazawa Fund to be made in April.
	   Financial support from Japan under the plan _ unveiled in
Washington recently by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa _
forms part of a package of support that Thailand is seeking from
various sources, including the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank.
	   The total request for assistance from Japan would depend on the
amount given by other sources, the Finance Ministry official said.
	   The official couldn't confirm reports that Thailand had asked
Japan for total assistance of dlrs 3 billion from the Miyazawa
fund. He said the amount hadn't been fixed yet.
	   Japan said earlier this month it would respond quickly to a
request for financial aid from the Miyazawa fund made by Thai
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda.
	   Thailand is suffering its deepest recessions in decades, with
the economy set to contract by 7 percent this year. The country is
already receiving a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout organized by the
International Monetary Fund.

EU clears dlrs 3.24 million for Caribbean victims of Hurricane
</HEADLINE>
Georges

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union granted 2.8 million
European currency units (dlrs 3.24 million) Monday to help victims
of Hurricane Georges which struck the Caribbean in late September.
	   The money will be spent on food, water, survival kits and home
repair materials on St Kitts, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and
Cuba _ islands worst hit by the storm, the European Commission said
in a statement.
	   The aid will be disbursed through non-governmental organizations
such as the International Federation of the Red Cross, the World
Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, it added.
	   Hurricane Georges killed more than 400 people and caused an
estimated dlrs 2 billion in insured property in four Gulf Coast
states and the Caribbean.
	   The EU's humanitarian aid office is coordinating the aid
package. The EU is the world's biggest aid donor. Between 1992 and
1997, its humanitarian relief aid exceeded 3.4 billion ecus (dlrs 4
billion), the commission statement said.

Britain's Vickers set to take over Norway's Ulstein group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Britain's Vickers PLC concern on Monday
announced plans to take over the Norwegian maritime engineering
concern Ulstein Holding ASA, excluding its shipbuilding division,
for 304 million pounds (dlrs 502 million).
	   On completion of the deal, Ulstein's shipbuilding division will
be split off and sold back to its original Norwegian owners, the
British engineering company said. The agreement is subject to
financing and the approval of stockholders and regulatory agencies.
	   Ulstein, which employs 4,150 people in 17 countries, designs and
produces such marine equipment as propellors, steering mechanisms
and stabilizers. Its projected turnover for 1998 is 4.18 billion
kroner (dlrs 560 million), with an operating profit of 350 million
kroner (dlrs 46.7 million).
	   Vickers is an international concern with interests in marine,
motor vehicle and defense systems, as well as making components for
gas turbines. Earlier this year, Vickers sold the British car maker
Rolls Royce to Volkswagen of Germany.

Israel rules out army withdrawal from Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes by Israeli defense minister, newspaper
commentary &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Claiming that Israel's occupation of south
Lebanon is ``dictated by reality,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai on Monday ruled out removing his soldiers despite
mounting casualties in a guerrilla war there.
	   Opposition to Israel's military presence in Lebanon has flared
as seven Israeli solders died in the last two weeks.
	   But Israeli leaders insisted that Israeli soldiers must remain
in their positions in order to protect Israeli border villages from
attacks by Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday he
understood the protesters' concern. ``Our heart is with every
mother and every person who has suffered'' because of Israel's
military presence in Lebanon, he told Israel radio.
	   However, he added that ``we have the responsibility to do the
right thing for the state of Israel, not for the next newscast.''
	   Mordechai appeared before parliament's Defense and Foreign
Affairs committee on Monday. Afterwards, he told reporters that
keeping Israeli soldiers in Israel's self-declared ``security
zone'' is the only option, and ``this is the opinion of security
officials after they examined all the possibilities.''
	   Opposition legislator Yossi Beilin, who advocate a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, stormed out of the committee
session, slammed the door, and called Mordechai ``a liar.''
	   ``It's nonsense,'' fumed Beilin, normally a soft-spoken academic
type with a doctorate in political science. ``There are many
(Israeli) generals who believe we must leave this area,'' he
declared, ``and I'm sure the minister knows it.''
	   Beilin said the security zone was a ``death trap.''
	   Israel's security Cabinet met for four hours Sunday and heard
briefings from military commanders about the escalating clashes
between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   During the meeting, opponents of Israel's occupation
demonstrated outside, chanting, ``Lebanon is a disaster.''
	   A front-page commentary in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot
predicted that the fuss over Lebanon would die down after a few
days without new Israeli casualties in Lebanon, as it has before.
	   Columnist Nahum Barnea said the special Cabinet debate on
Lebanon was convened not so much in hopes of finding answers, but
to appease the public. ``All eyes were not focused on the
blood-drenched strip of land in Lebanon, but rather on the public
opinion polls in Lebanon,'' Barnea wrote.
	   Lebanon's government, demanding an unconditional Israeli
pullout, says that if the Israelis leave, Hezbollah would have no
reason to strike. Hezbollah refuses to give Israel any assurances.
	   The Israelis have charged that Syria is behind the escalation of
Hezbollah attacks against Israeli forces, as a way of pressuring
Israel. Until recently, Israeli policy held that Israel could not
withdraw its forces from Lebanon in the absence of a peace
agreement involving Syria.
	   But the Syrians have made it clear that the price for such an
agreement is return of all of the Golan Heights, strategic
highlands overlooking Israel's north and captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's government rejects that.
	   Mordechai said that Israel is constantly looking for a political
solution to the Lebanon conflict, but none is attainable now.

Ex-Prime minister's son detained for multi-million dollar fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ The son of a former Indian prime
minister was ordered jailed Monday for 14 days in connection with a
suspected multimillion dollar import fraud.
	   P.V. Prabhakar Rao was arrested Monday after defying a summons
for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate, the government's
economic crimes unit, about an order for fertilizer from a
Cyrpus-based Turkish company.
	   The fertilizer was purchased for tens of millions of dollars
when his father, P.V. Narasimha Rao, was prime minister. It was
never delivered.
	   The case returns to the headlines at a damaging time for the
Congress Party, which Narasimha Rao led from 1991 to 1996. It could
remind the public of a series of scandals that tainted his
government and led to the party's defeat in 1996. The Congress
Party made a comeback in last week's state legislative elections.
	   Prabhakar Rao was detained Saturday in Mehbubnagar, 70
kilometers (45 miles) from Hyderabad, and brought Monday to a jail
in Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh state.
	   Prabhakar Rao is accused of taking a commission in the
fertilizer deal. The Enforcement Directorate also is investigating
possible foreign currency violations in bringing his commission
into India.
	   Other defendants in the case include Prabhakar Rao's cousin,
Sanjeeva Rao.
	   During his five years in office, Narasimha Rao was credited with
opening India's highly regulated economy to the global trade, but
the latter years were repeatedly disrupted by scandals in high
office. Narasimha Rao himself faces charges of bribery and abuse of
office.

Judge orders Anwar's defense lawyer jailed for contempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS report on alleged prosecution bargain, last 2 grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chaos rocked the sensational
corruption and sex trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Monday when one of his defense attorneys was sentenced
to three months in jail for contempt of court.
	   Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer in Anwar's defense team,
refused to apologize for accusing two prosecutors of trying to get
a potential witness to lie.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul, who had demanded the apology,
held Zainur in contempt of court and ordered him to surrender to
police by 4 p.m. (0800 GMT). Zainur's defense colleagues said they
were too disturbed to continue, so Paul adjourned the trial until
Tuesday.
	   Zainur immediately appealed the contempt ruling to the Court of
Appeals. He was allowed to remain free on 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,631) bail until his appeal hearing Friday.
	   Anwar, prevented by police from talking to his attorneys in the
courtroom, angrily shouted to reporters that he could no longer get
a fair trial.
	   ``I can't even discuss this with my lawyers now,'' Anwar said.
``Where is justice?''
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing
and beating while in custody has led to international interest in
the case and support for his fledgling political reform movement.
	   His trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   Anwar denies the charges, calling them part of political
vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Monday's uproar was sparked by an affidavit Anwar filed in the
High Court Saturday. In it, he accused two prosecutors of trying to
cajole a potential witness into fabricating evidence of sex crimes
by Anwar.
	   Anwar asked the court to remove senior government prosecutors
Abdul Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed from the corruption and sexual
misconduct trial.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul refused Monday to listen to
defense attorneys' arguments on the affidavit, saying there was
nothing to support the allegations.
	   Instead, he ordered Zainur, who submitted the affidavit, to
apologize to Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah. The attorney
general, who does not normally attend the trial, was in court
Monday and asked to speak.
	   ``What has been done by Zainur Zakaria undermines the integrity
of the trial,'' Mohtar told the court, recommending an immediate
contempt hearing.
	   There was then an angry exchange between the judge and Anwar's
leading defense attorney Raja Aziz Addruse.
	   When Raja Aziz objected to Paul demanding an apology, the judge
ordered him to sit down.
	   Raja Aziz replied, ``We should have been heard before your
Lordship came to the conclusion already that the allegations are
scandalous.''
	   Zainur, who has been practicing law since 1975, then refused to
apologize.
	   The judge rejected the defense request that it be given three
days to prepare for the contempt hearing.
	   ``Nothing shocks me very much,'' Raja Aziz said of the contempt
ruling, which left many in the courtroom stunned.
	   In the affidavit, Anwar said the two prosecutors had tried to
negotiate a plea bargain with his former tennis partner,
Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
	   Nalla, as he is known, was indicted shortly before Anwar's
arrest and charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live
ammunition. He faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted.
	   The bullets were said to have been found in Nalla's house during
a police investigation of allegations published in the book,
``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while Anwar was still in power.
	   Anwar said Abdul Gani and Azahar indicated that they would try
Nalla under a lesser charge if he was prepared to lie about how
Anwar committed sexual offenses with ``various married and
unmarried women.''
	   In reply to allegations that the prosecution was threatening to
use the death sentence as a bargaining tool to gather evidence from
Nalla against Anwar, Judge Paul said the prosecution has the power
to enter into such bargains, the national news agency Bernama
reported.
	   It said the judge added that this is practiced in all civilized
law and has been accepted as public policy.

Juve official: team nervous about trip to Istanbul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A Juventus official confirmed Monday the
Italian club will show for its politically tinged Champions League
match against Turkey's Galatasaray, but said the players are
worried as they prepare to head to Istanbul.
	   ``We are ready to go, but we will not be going calmly,''
Juventus general director Luiciano Moggi said. ``We still want
guarantees of security. We want to know what the security measures
are, not just that there are measures.''
	   Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader who was
arrested in Rome three weeks ago has prompted anti-Italian
demonstrations in Turkey.
	   With tensions high, European soccer's governing body postponed
by one week the Champions League match, which was originally slated
for last Wednesday.
	   Several Juventus players, including French World Cup hero
Zinedine Zidane, had threatened to refuse to play in Istanbul.
	   The team is scheduled to fly to Istanbul Tuesday.

Syrians cast votes for new parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Millions of Syrians headed to polling
stations Monday to elect a new 250-seat Parliament from among 7,350
candidates.
	   Voting started at 8 a.m. (0600gmt) at some 8,000 polling booths
throughout the country's 15 voting districts. Polls will close at 8
p.m. (1800gmt) and be open again Tuesday from 8 a.m. to noon
(0600gmt-1000gmt). No results are expected before Thursday.
	   The National Assembly, or parliament, has limited legislative
power, with effective control held by President Hafez Assad, who
came to power in a bloodless coup in 1970.
	   Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam told reporters as he
cast his vote that taking part in the election ``is a national
duty.''
	   Kheir Eddin Nakhleh, head of a polling station in Damascus, said
``there is an excellent turn out. ... I hope that the candidates
will meet their promises made to the people.''
	   Two-thirds of the seats in the assembly are allotted to the
National Progressive Front, a coalition of seven parties led by the
Baath Party which has ruled Syria since 1963.
	   The allotment of seats was the same in the previous four-year
term which ended in September. The Baath gets 135 seats, and 32 go
to allied parties. Independents run for the remaining 83 seats.
	   Campaigning began Oct. 29 with candidates putting up posters and
banners in almost all cities. The campaign ended Saturday.

Gadhafi blames U.S., Britain for delay in Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has blamed
delays in holding a trial in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103
on obstacles created by the United States and Britain.
	   Gadhafi, who has refused for years to turn over two Libyan
suspects for trial, said in a speech Sunday night that he had done
all he could to resolve the dispute but the other side ``does not
want to make any concessions.''
	   The speech, at a banquet in the Libyan capital Tripoli for
visiting Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, was broadcast on Libyan
television and monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Also at
the banquet was American Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of
Islam.
	   Gadhafi referred to an American-British proposal for the two men
to be tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges as a ``sterile
initiative'' and said the two countries had set unacceptable
conditions.
	   ``The two countries drafted a bilateral resolution which they
had imposed on the (U.N.) Security Council without consulting
Libya, due to their wish not to see the trial held in the first
place,'' he said.
	   Gadhafi did not specify the conditions he referred to, but said
that sticking to British and American law ``does fundamentally
undermine the initiative'' adopted in the Security Council for
holding a trial.
	   The Security Council is involved because it imposed sanctions on
Libya in 1992 for refusing to allow a trial of the two men, who are
accused of the bombing of the jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland,
which killed 270 people.
	   For years, Washington and London insisted on trying the men in
the United States or Scotland; Libya said they could not expect a
fair trial in either place and urged a neutral venue.
	   Recently Britain and the United States offered the Netherlands
as a site, and Libya accepted in principle. But Gadhafi has
demanded guarantees the suspects will not be extradited to the
United States and wants them imprisoned in Libya if convicted.
	   On Sunday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the
Libyan Lawyers' Union has created a defense fund for the two
Libyans, but it did not say how much money was in the fund.

Sharif leaves for U.S. visit, plans to raise Kashmir issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif left
Monday for a two-day visit to the United States promising to
highlight the disputed Kashmir region -- the flash point of two
wars on the newly nuclear Asian subcontinent.
	   ``I will underscore the need for greater world attention in
resolving the (Kashmir) dispute, the root cause of tension and
instability in South Asia,'' Sharif said in his departure
statement.
	   Pakistan and India fought two wars in 1948 and again in 1965
over the remote Himalayan region of Kashmir since independence from
Britain in 1947. They fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh or
what was then East Pakistan.
	   Kashmir, the only Muslim majority state in Hindu-dominated
India, is divided between Pakistan and India and each country lays
claim to a united Kashmir.
	   Sharif said Pakistan's security concerns and nonproliferation
issues will be high on his agenda during talks with U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
	   The United States is expected to press Pakistan to sign the
global nuclear test ban treaty, but Islamabad says it wants lifting
of economic sanctions first.
	   The sanctions were imposed on Pakistan and India last May
following their tit-for-tat nuclear tests.
	   Earlier this month Washington eased some sanctions.
	   ``Talks with the United States on nuclear issues always tend to
test Pakistan's diplomacy to its limits,'' Maleeha Lodhi,
Pakistan's former ambassador to the United States, said in an
editorial Monday in the leading English-language daily newspaper,
The News.
	   ``Clinton's invitation to Sharif to visit the U.S. reflects
Washington's assumption that more progress is possible with
Pakistan on the nonproliferation,'' she said. ``No such invitation
to Indian prime minister is indicative of Delhi's greater reticence
on the Washington sponsored road-map of nuclear restraint.''
	   Sharif said he wants to restore close economic and defense ties
between the two countries.
	   Sharif will stop briefly in Norway en route to the United States
where he will inaugurate a Pakistan Television network aimed at the
Pakistani community living in Europe.

train accident &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMRITSAR, India (AP) _ Five days after one of the worst train
accidents in India, officials were still trying to identify 10
bodies in a hospital mortuary in northern India.
	   The bodies of all the other 201 victims have been claimed since
Thursday's collision of the Sealdah Express and the Frontier Mail
near Khanna town in the state of Punjab, railroad and police
officials said Monday.
	   ``It's very difficult to identify these disfigured bodies,''
said Dr. Manjit Singh, hospital superintendent of the Patiala
Medical College, where the bodies have been kept. Authorities plan
to either cremate the bodies later or use them for medical studies,
he said.
	   Officials have videotaped the bodies and the personal belongings
found at the site of the accident, which occurred on a foggy
morning when an express train plowed into derailed coaches of
another train.
	   State-run television has shown the videotapes repeatedly, hoping
relatives and friends of the victims would help identify the
bodies. Most people in India do not carry identification cards.
Tickets of passengers traveling on unreserved coaches do not carry
their names.
	   On Monday, three families all claimed the body of a 21-year-old
woman. Police settled the case in favor of one of them after a
relative who had seen her off in Bombay identified the clothes.
	   Police also scurried to stop a truck transporting the body of a
woman after they realized that the claimants had misidentified her.
Police realized that a body that had been claimed in the morning
matched the description given by another frantic family, and
radioed highway police to intercept the truck.
	   The search ended on a happy note for two men who rushed to the
mortuary when told that their brother _ for whom they had been
searching for five days _ was among the dead.
	   While going through the bodies, they got a phone call that their
brother had returned home. He had been injured in the crash.

Gay rights campaigner in court over church protest

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A gay rights activist appeared in court Monday
charged with ``indecent behavior in a church'' under a
seldom-invoked law branded ``archaic and repressive'' by
free-speech campaigners trying to get it repealed.
	   Peter Tatchell, who heads the British gay rights group Outrage,
was arrested under the 1860 Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act
after he staged a three-minute protest beneath the pulpit as the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Britain's top cleric, was about to
deliver his Easter Sunday sermon April 12 at Canterbury Cathedral.
	   He could face two months in jail for the interruption in which
he criticized the archbishop's opposition to lowering the
homosexual age of consent and the church ban on the ordination of
gay clergy. He denies the charge of indecent behavior.
	   ``A two month jail sentence is extraordinarily draconian and
hugely harsh, given that you can assault people and get community
service these days,'' said Keith Wood, general secretary of the
National Secular Society, which is trying to get the law repealed.
	   The law was last used in 1966 when two anti-war activists were
arrested after protesting the Vietnam War in a Methodist church as
then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson delivered a sermon. The
protesters were jailed for two months in 1967 for the offense.
	   ``This is an archaic remnant of church privilege designed to
stifle dissent,'' Wood said. ``It clearly isn't needed, otherwise
ti would have been used more frequently.''
	   Amnesty International has expressed concern that Tatchell will
not have a fair trial because the courts have already refused him
permission to call the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, as a
witness at his two-day trial.
	   ``Mr. Tatchell is not being prosecuted on account of any views
that he may hold in regard to the matters that were the subject of
his protests,'' prosecutor Montague told the court. ``It was
inappropriate both as to time and place. It was unseemly. It was
indecorous.''
	   Public figures such as playwright Harold Pinter called for the
law to be abolished in a letter to The Times newspaper Monday,
while other celebrities such as actor Ian McKellan and actress
Vanessa Redgrave have also come to Tatchell's defense.

Netanyahu threatens to hold up accord over Arafat statements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinian reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened
Monday to walk away from the Mideast peace agreements if
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declares statehood in
May.
	   Netanyahu's warning came a day after Arafat said in Washington
that ``I hope that this (coming) year will be the year of the
independent Palestinian state.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians are
paying no heed to Netanyahu's threats. ``Let him shout as much as
he pleases,'' Asfour said of the Israeli leader.
	   The Palestinians say the peace agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians do prevent Arafat from declaring statehood on May 4,
1999, the day the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip ends.
	   The new acrimony came just a little over a week after the
implementation of stage one of the land-for-security agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the plan, Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in
exchange for Palestinian measures against Islamic militants.
	   As part of the accord, Israel also agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners. In the first stage, Israel released 250,
most of them criminals, prompting Palestinian complaints that the
agreement was breached. The Palestinians demand that Israel free
political activists and those jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, flew to
Washington on Monday to raise the issue with Clinton administration
officials. ``This is a crisis situation and we have asked for
American intervention,'' Erekat said Sunday.
	   Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult to
continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would not compromise. ``I do not free
murderers. I do not release people with blood on their hands,'' he
told Israel radio.
	   Israel holds about 2,500 prisoners. Popular pressure on Arafat
has grown, with prisoners' relatives demonstrating daily against
the Palestinian Authority and accusing it of abandoning the
prisoners.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, described Arafat's latest remarks
concerning statehood as a ``a gross violation'' of the Oslo
accords.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that if Arafat
declares a state ``this will mean the collapse of the Oslo
agreements.''
	   Netanyahu has warned that he would respond by annexing parts of
the West Bank.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu did not make specific threats, saying only
that ``we can do a great deal.'' He said he would raise the issue
when his Cabinet meets again to consider the next stage of the Wye
River peace accord.
	   In another possible point of contention, Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon appointed low-level officials to negotiate an
additional Israeli troop pullback with the Palestinians.
	   Israel's Cabinet has already decided that it would hand over
only an additional 1 percent of the West Bank in an upcoming troop
withdrawal. By naming junior officials without a mandate, Israel
apparently was sending a message to the Palestinians that they
would not receive more than the 1 percent already decided on.
	   Asfour said Israel was humiliating the Palestinians by making
such appointments. ``This is just another example of Israel's lack
of seriousness in implementing the agreement,'' he said.
	   The Palestinian team to the talks is headed by Erekat.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on
churches, mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after
a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerated into a
riot, the military and a Muslim leader said.
	   A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school.
Troops and riot police patrolled the streets.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests
as fighting between Muslims and Christians continued after dark,
said a military officer who spoke by telephone on condition of
anonymity.
	   The violence in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang was in
retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim
mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were
killed.
	   Islamic leaders urged Indonesia's Muslim majority not to
retaliate with more violence.
	   Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's largest Muslim grouping,
the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accused provocateurs of
whipping up religious strife when the sprawling Southeast Asian
nation is trying to head toward democracy.
	   ``I hope Muslims ... are not deceived by such provocations,''
said Wahid, who has been pushing for religious unity.
	   West Timor shares the same island as troubled East Timor, a
former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman Catholicism and
invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Christians, mostly Protestants, dominate Kupang, about 1,875
kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.
However, a sizable Muslim minority also lives there.
	   The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged a
peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church
attacks.
	   Most offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, the
capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor called for
calm.
	   Organizers of Monday's strike had called for a non-violent ``day
of mourning.''
	   However, residents said fires broke out in three mosques after
rival gangs pelted each other with rocks.
	   Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia.
	   Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation have
intensified as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   There is also political turmoil as students protesters demand
greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former
President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in
May.
	   Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition
United Development Party, urged his followers not to hit back. More
than 100,000 party supporters filled a sports stadium in Jakarta
Sunday at the opening of a four-day convention.
	   Religious strife erupted recently in the eastern part of the
main island of Java, where more than 150 people, many of them
Islamic clerics, have been murdered, apparently by rival Muslim
groups. Many of the dead were accused of practicing black magic.

Israel rules out army withdrawal from Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

newspaper commentary. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Claiming that Israel's occupation of south
Lebanon is ``dictated by reality,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai on Monday ruled out removing his soldiers despite
mounting casualties in a guerrilla war there.
	   Opposition to Israel's military presence in Lebanon has flared
as seven Israeli solders died in the last two weeks.
	   But Israeli leaders insisted that soldiers must remain to
protect Israeli border villages from attacks by Shiite Muslim
Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday he
understood the protesters' concern. ``Our heart is with every
mother and every person who has suffered'' because of Israel's
military presence in Lebanon, he told Israel radio.
	   However, he added that ``we have the responsibility to do the
right thing for the state of Israel, not for the next newscast.''
	   Mordechai appeared Monday before parliament's Defense and
Foreign Affairs committee. Afterwards, he said that keeping Israeli
soldiers in Israel's self-declared ``security zone'' is the only
option, and ``this is the opinion of security officials after they
examined all the possibilities.''
	   Opposition legislator Yossi Beilin, who advocates a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, stormed out of the committee
session, slammed the door, and called Mordechai ``a liar.''
	   ``It's nonsense,'' fumed the normally soft-spoken Beilin, who
holds a doctorate in political science. ``There are many (Israeli)
generals who believe we must leave this area,'' he declared, ``and
I'm sure the minister knows it.''
	   Beilin said the security zone was a ``death trap.''
	   Israel's security Cabinet met Sunday for four hours and heard
briefings from military commanders about the escalating clashes
between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   During the meeting, opponents of Israel's occupation
demonstrated outside, chanting, ``Lebanon is a disaster.''
	   A front-page commentary in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot
predicted that the fuss over Lebanon would die down after a few
days without new Israeli casualties in Lebanon _ as it has before.
	   Columnist Nahum Barnea said the special Cabinet debate on
Lebanon was convened less to find answers than to appease the
public. ``All eyes were not focused on the blood-drenched strip of
land in Lebanon, but rather on the public opinion polls in
Lebanon,'' Barnea wrote.
	   Lebanon's government, demanding an unconditional Israeli
pullout, says that if the Israelis leave, Hezbollah would have no
reason to strike. Hezbollah refuses to give Israel any assurances.
	   The Israelis have charged that Syria is behind the escalation of
Hezbollah attacks against Israeli forces, as a way of pressuring
Israel. Until recently, Israeli policy held that Israel could not
withdraw its forces from Lebanon in the absence of a peace
agreement involving Syria.
	   But the Syrians have made it clear that the price for such an
agreement is return of all of the Golan Heights, strategic
highlands overlooking Israel's north and captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's government rejects that.
	   Mordechai said that Israel is constantly looking for a political
solution to the Lebanon conflict, but none is attainable now.

AIDS continues devastating march in southern Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ AIDS has rapidly crept up on
South Africa and poses a tragedy worse than apartheid, the top U.N.
AIDS official said Monday.
	   ``We are faced with an unprecedented crisis,'' Dr. Peter Piot,
head of the U.N. AIDS program told reporters. The scourge is
greater than the system of white minority rule or natural tragedies
like drought: ``None of them will claim so many victims,'' he said.
	   Piot traveled from his Geneva headquarters to emphasize the
latest global AIDS figures, which were released last week and show
the crisis still burns hottest in Africa, particularly the southern
part.
	   About two-thirds of the 33 million people infected with the AIDS
virus, HIV, live south of the Sahara. Two million people will die
of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa this year, four times the
total for the rest of the world.
	   Piot said it was ``striking and shocking'' how young girls on
the continent were particularly affected -- because of their
vulnerability. In South Africa, 9.5 percent of pregnant under-15s
were HIV positive.
	   Adult HIV infection rates in Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and
Zimbabwe -- South African neighbors -- hover between 20 percent and
25 percent, the United Nations said.
	   Apartheid, which ended in 1994, helped isolate South Africa and
made it a latecomer to the AIDS epidemic. But it is fast catching
up with its neighbors, with 3.2 million South Africans HIV
positive, or about 12 to 14 percent of adults.
	   South Africa accounts for more than half of the region's new
infections this year, with 1,500 infections occurring every day,
UNAIDS said Monday.
	   More than 1 million South Africans will have died of AIDS by
2001, bringing the life expectancy from 68 years to 48 within the
first decade of the new millennium, the U.N. Development Program
said.
	   According to other reports released Monday by South African
health authorities and UNDP, the causes for the fast spread here
are: poverty, greater mobility in a country with good
transportation, the apartheid legacy of migrant workers, the low
status of women which makes it difficult for them to protect
themselves and resistance to condom use.
	   With its relative wealth and sophisticated business community,
South Africa could face pronounced damage to its economy as the
disease kills off educated and skilled workers.
	   David Whaley, the U.N. coordinator for South Africa, said the
country had ``significantly less success than other developing
countries'' in using its resources to fight poverty, which
development officials blame for helping spread the disease.
	   South Africa launched a ``partnership'' program in October with
industries, unions and other groups to mobilize the country in
education and prevention.
	   Geraldine Fraser-Moloketi, the welfare minister, acknowledged
the African National Congress government was ``a little bit late''
in responding.

Gay rights campaigner in court over church protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in graf 8 that trial started Monday and will last two
days; no UPPICK

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A gay rights activist appeared in court Monday
charged with ``indecent behavior in a church'' under a
seldom-invoked law branded ``archaic and repressive'' by
free-speech campaigners trying to get it repealed.
	   Peter Tatchell, who heads the British gay rights group Outrage,
was arrested under the 1860 Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act
after he staged a three-minute protest beneath the pulpit as the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Britain's top cleric, was about to
deliver his Easter Sunday sermon April 12 at Canterbury Cathedral.
	   He could face two months in jail for the interruption in which
he criticized the archbishop's opposition to lowering the
homosexual age of consent and the church ban on the ordination of
gay clergy. He denies the charge of indecent behavior.
	   ``A two month jail sentence is extraordinarily draconian and
hugely harsh, given that you can assault people and get community
service these days,'' said Keith Wood, general secretary of the
National Secular Society, which is trying to get the law repealed.
	   The law was last used in 1966 when two anti-war activists were
arrested after protesting the Vietnam War in a Methodist church as
then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson delivered a sermon. The
protesters were jailed for two months in 1967 for the offense.
	   ``This is an archaic remnant of church privilege designed to
stifle dissent,'' Wood said. ``It clearly isn't needed, otherwise
it would have been used more frequently.''
	   Amnesty International has expressed concern that Tatchell will
not have a fair trial because the courts have already refused him
permission to call the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, as a
witness at his two-day trial.
	   ``Mr. Tatchell is not being prosecuted on account of any views
that he may hold in regard to the matters that were the subject of
his protests,'' prosecutor Montague told the court Monday at the
start of the two-day trial. ``It was inappropriate both as to time
and place. It was unseemly. It was indecorous.''
	   Public figures such as playwright Harold Pinter called for the
law to be abolished in a letter to The Times newspaper Monday,
while other celebrities such as actor Ian McKellan and actress
Vanessa Redgrave have also come to Tatchell's defense.

Judge orders Anwar's defense lawyer jailed for contempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS report on alleged prosecution bargain, last 2 grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Chaos rocked the sensational
corruption and sex trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Monday when one of his defense attorneys was sentenced
to three months in jail for contempt of court.
	   Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer in Anwar's defense team,
refused to apologize for accusing two prosecutors of trying to get
a potential witness to lie.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul, who had demanded the apology,
held Zainur in contempt of court and ordered him to surrender to
police by 4 p.m. (0800 GMT). Zainur's defense colleagues said they
were too disturbed to continue, so Paul adjourned the trial until
Tuesday.
	   Zainur immediately appealed the contempt ruling to the Court of
Appeals. He was allowed to remain free on 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,631) bail until his appeal hearing Friday.
	   Anwar, prevented by police from talking to his attorneys in the
courtroom, angrily shouted to reporters that he could no longer get
a fair trial.
	   ``I can't even discuss this with my lawyers now,'' Anwar said.
``Where is justice?''
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. His subsequent jailing
and beating while in custody has led to international interest in
the case and support for his fledgling political reform movement.
	   His trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be
tried on another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   Anwar denies the charges, calling them part of political
vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Monday's uproar was sparked by an affidavit Anwar filed in the
High Court Saturday. In it, he accused two prosecutors of trying to
cajole a potential witness into fabricating evidence of sex crimes
by Anwar.
	   Anwar asked the court to remove senior government prosecutors
Abdul Gani Patail and Azahar Mohamed from the corruption and sexual
misconduct trial.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul refused Monday to listen to
defense attorneys' arguments on the affidavit, saying there was
nothing to support the allegations.
	   Instead, he ordered Zainur, who submitted the affidavit, to
apologize to Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah. The attorney
general, who does not normally attend the trial, was in court
Monday and asked to speak.
	   ``What has been done by Zainur Zakaria undermines the integrity
of the trial,'' Mohtar told the court, recommending an immediate
contempt hearing.
	   There was then an angry exchange between the judge and Anwar's
leading defense attorney Raja Aziz Addruse.
	   When Raja Aziz objected to Paul demanding an apology, the judge
ordered him to sit down.
	   Raja Aziz replied, ``We should have been heard before your
Lordship came to the conclusion already that the allegations are
scandalous.''
	   Zainur, who has been practicing law since 1975, then refused to
apologize.
	   The judge rejected the defense request that it be given three
days to prepare for the contempt hearing.
	   ``Nothing shocks me very much,'' Raja Aziz said of the contempt
ruling, which left many in the courtroom stunned.
	   In the affidavit, Anwar said the two prosecutors had tried to
negotiate a plea bargain with his former tennis partner,
Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
	   Nalla, as he is known, was indicted shortly before Anwar's
arrest and charged with unlawful possession of 125 rounds of live
ammunition. He faces a mandatory death sentence if convicted.
	   The bullets were said to have been found in Nalla's house during
a police investigation of allegations published in the book,
``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   In the book, it is alleged that Nalla set up sexual trysts for
Anwar while Anwar was still in power.
	   Anwar said Abdul Gani and Azahar indicated that they would try
Nalla under a lesser charge if he was prepared to lie about how
Anwar committed sexual offenses with ``various married and
unmarried women.''
	   In reply to allegations that the prosecution was threatening to
use the death sentence as a bargaining tool to gather evidence from
Nalla against Anwar, Judge Paul said the prosecution has the power
to enter into such bargains, the national news agency Bernama
reported.
	   It said the judge added that this is practiced in all civilized
law and has been accepted as public policy.

Turkish military chides Islamic leader over comment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's secular military leadership
warned a pro-Islamic party Monday against dragging the army into
politics, after its leader said the party has the backing of the
army in forming a new government
	   Recai Kutan, leader of Islamic Virtue Party, was quoted by the
daily Milliyet on Saturday as saying that they were receiving
signals that the army liked the party's new moderate tone.
	   ``It is out of question for the armed forces to express whether
it likes the tone of a political party or not,'' the general staff
said in a statement. ``Everyone should refrain from making comments
that would drag the armed forces into politics.''
	   Kutan's Virtue Party is the successor of another Islamic party,
Welfare, which was forced to step down from power by the military
last year after it tried to increase the influence of Islam in
society. Welfare was banned earlier this year for anti-secular
activities.
	   A pro-secular alliance replaced Welfare, but it collapsed last
week over corruption charges,.
	   Traditionally, the job of forming a new government should go to
Kutan, as his party has the largest number of seats in Parliament.
However, President Suleyman Demirel has not given any indication
that he would designate him.
	   No party has the votes to govern alone.

Romania split as it prepares for great day of national unity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Romanian president urged people to
be optimistic about their future Monday, amid criticism of
extravagance for spending an estimated dlrs 300,000 on festivities
marking the country's national day.
	   Romania's national day marks the country's reunion with
Transylvania, on Dec. 1, 1918 and is supposed to celebrate unity
among its 23 million people. But this year political leaders have
been riven by disagreement.
	   ``Although the country is on the brink of despair, enormous
amounts of money are being spent,'' Ticu Dumitrescu, a lawmaker was
quoted as saying in daily Evenimentul Zilei on Monday. ``What's
more, all the festivities are being held in (former dictator
Nicolae) Ceausescu's palace... hardly a citadel of democracy.''
	   The government is to stage a huge military parade in front of
Ceausescu's palace Tuesday, which will cost the country 3 billion
lei (dlrs 300,000) _ more than 30 percent of the annual military
budget _ daily Jurnal National reported.
	   For the past week, tanks have rolled past the giant palace,
which now houses Romania's parliament. Military planes and
helicopters have flown low over Bucharest and hundreds of soldiers
have marched outside its gates for days, rehearsing for the
festivities.
	   Speaking from the Transylvanian city of Alba Iulia to mark 80
years since Romania was reunited with Transylvania President Emil
Constantinescu said Monday: ``The country is in winter, blanketed
by snow and fog ... but we must go on.''
	   Former King Michael, who was in Romania over the weekend to
officially mark the celebrations, quit the country ahead of the
festivities to avoid getting embroiled in the discord.
	   Thanks to his grandmother Queen Marie, Transylvania returned to
Romania in 1918 as part of the spoils of WWI.

Nuclear-capable missiles to be put on ships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India will put an advanced version of
its nuclear-capable Prithvi missile on board fighting ships by next
month, domestic news agencies reported Monday.
	   United News of India and Press Trust of India quoted Chief of
Naval Staff Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat as setting Jan. 26 as the
deadline for arming an unspecified number of ships with the
missiles. Jan. 26 is the national holiday on which India celebrates
the day in 1950 when its constitution came into effect.
	   India and neighbor and rival Pakistan both set off underground
nuclear test explosions in May and declared themselves nuclear
weapons powers. Analysts say the next step will be developing
delivery systems for their weapons.
	   India's two nuclear-capable missiles, the medium-range Prithvi
and the long-range Agni, are expected to be the mainstay of its
nuclear delivery system, according to Jane's Intelligence Review, a
magazine that specializes in defense analysis. While the Agni is
still in the development stage, India's Prithvi force is considered
to be in the range of 20 to 50 missiles, Jane's says.
	   India's Defense Research and Development Organization is also
working on a submarine-launched missile called Sagarika, which
could become operational by 2010, Jane's says. But Admiral Bhagwat
was quoted by UNI Monday as saying India had no such project.

Russian government again delays on budget plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet further delaying the budget debate,
harvest figures, in new grafs 2, 12-14. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government canceled plans Monday to
discuss the 1999 budget, once again delaying efforts to come up
with plans to tackle the country's economic crisis.
	   A government spokesman said the Cabinet meeting on the budget
had been rescheduled for Thursday, but gave no details. Several
hours after that, officials said the government would only consider
it after 10 days.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has yet to produce
firm plans to tackle the financial crisis since Russia effectively
defaulted on some debts in August and devalued the currency.
	   Primakov's government has requested more aid from the
International Monetary Fund, warning Russia faces serious problems
unless it gets more funding. But the IMF and Western governments
say they won't provide any cash until Russia adopts a realistic
budget.
	   Primakov will hold a series of meetings this week in Moscow with
visiting IMF chief Michel Camdessus, who is coming to Russia to
discuss the government's efforts to deal with the economic
situation.
	   Russia's finance minister repeated pleas Sunday for IMF
assistance.
	   ``Money is not the main thing we need from the IMF, although we
need that too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax
news agency. ``We, above all, expect understanding from the IMF,
and a program to relieve Russia's debt _ that is, dlrs 17.5
billion.''
	   Russia has been hoping the IMF would release the next
installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package that was frozen in
August after the crisis erupted.
	   Zadornov said he hoped the IMF would not only release the next
loan installment, but help Russia restructure its foreign debt _
and perhaps persuade some creditors to let Russia off the hook.
	   ``Without the consent of the IMF, creditors won't agree to
defer, or possibly partly write off, Russia's external debt,''
Zadornov said.
	   Another government financial officer, Alexander Pochinok, was
quoted as saying Sunday that a 1999 draft budget assumes that
Russia will receive the remaining dlrs 17.5 billion from the 22.6
billion bailout package from the IMF, World Bank and Japan _ logic
criticized by the IMF mission that visited Moscow earlier this
month.
	   The IMF assailed the 1999 budget revenue forecast as too
optimistic and criticized the government's plan to lower some taxes
and offer support to ailing industries.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov told reporters Monday
that the government would need several days to finalize tax changes
and therefore couldn't complete the new draft this week. Maslyukov
said the Cabinet would likely debate the budget Dec. 10, the
Interfax reported.
	   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Ministry said on Monday that this
year's grain harvest of 51.5 million metric tons _ the worst in 45
years _ has left Russia's grain reserves 7 million tons short of
this year's demand of 79.6 million tons.

Netanyahu threatens to hold up accord over Arafat statements

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinian reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened
Monday to walk away from the Mideast peace agreements if
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declares statehood in
May.
	   Netanyahu's warning came a day after Arafat said in Washington
that ``I hope that this (coming) year will be the year of the
independent Palestinian state.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians are
paying no heed to Netanyahu's threats. ``Let him shout as much as
he pleases,'' Asfour said of the Israeli leader.
	   The Palestinians say the peace agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians do not prevent Arafat from declaring statehood on May
4, 1999, the day the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip ends.
	   The new acrimony came just a little over a week after the
implementation of stage one of the land-for-security agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians. Under the plan, Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in
exchange for Palestinian measures against Islamic militants.
	   As part of the accord, Israel also agreed to free 750
Palestinian prisoners. In the first stage, Israel released 250,
most of them criminals, prompting Palestinian complaints that the
agreement was breached. The Palestinians demand that Israel free
political activists and those jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, flew Monday to
Washington to raise the issue with Clinton administration
officials. ``This is a crisis situation and we have asked for
American intervention,'' Erekat said Sunday.
	   Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult to
continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would not compromise. ``I do not free
murderers. I do not release people with blood on their hands,'' he
told Israel radio.
	   Israel holds about 2,500 prisoners. Popular pressure on Arafat
has grown, with prisoners' relatives demonstrating daily against
the Palestinian Authority and accusing it of abandoning the
prisoners.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, described Arafat's latest remarks
concerning statehood as a ``a gross violation'' of the Oslo
accords.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying that if Arafat
declares a state ``this will mean the collapse of the Oslo
agreements.''
	   Netanyahu has warned that he would respond by annexing parts of
the West Bank.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu did not make specific threats, saying only
that ``we can do a great deal.'' He said he would raise the issue
when his Cabinet meets again to consider the next stage of the Wye
River peace accord.
	   In another possible point of contention, Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon appointed low-level officials to negotiate an
additional Israeli troop pullback with the Palestinians.
	   Israel's Cabinet has already decided that it would hand over
only an additional 1 percent of the West Bank in an upcoming troop
withdrawal. By naming junior officials without a mandate, Israel
apparently was sending a message to the Palestinians that they
would not receive more than the 1 percent already decided on.
	   Asfour said Israel was humiliating the Palestinians by making
such appointments. ``This is just another example of Israel's lack
of seriousness in implementing the agreement,'' he said.
	   The Palestinian team to the talks is headed by Erekat.

Gay rights campaigner in court over church protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES prosecutors first name in graf 8

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A gay rights activist appeared in court Monday
charged with ``indecent behavior in a church'' under a
seldom-invoked law branded ``archaic and repressive'' by
free-speech campaigners trying to get it repealed.
	   Peter Tatchell, who heads the British gay rights group Outrage,
was arrested under the 1860 Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act
after he staged a three-minute protest beneath the pulpit as the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Britain's top cleric, was about to
deliver his Easter Sunday sermon April 12 at Canterbury Cathedral.
	   He could face two months in jail for the interruption in which
he criticized the archbishop's opposition to lowering the
homosexual age of consent and the church ban on the ordination of
gay clergy. He denies the charge of indecent behavior.
	   ``A two month jail sentence is extraordinarily draconian and
hugely harsh, given that you can assault people and get community
service these days,'' said Keith Wood, general secretary of the
National Secular Society, which is trying to get the law repealed.
	   The law was last used in 1966 when two anti-war activists were
arrested after protesting the Vietnam War in a Methodist church as
then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson delivered a sermon. The
protesters were jailed for two months in 1967 for the offense.
	   ``This is an archaic remnant of church privilege designed to
stifle dissent,'' Wood said. ``It clearly isn't needed, otherwise
it would have been used more frequently.''
	   Amnesty International has expressed concern that Tatchell will
not have a fair trial because the courts have already refused him
permission to call the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, as a
witness at his two-day trial.
	   ``Mr. Tatchell is not being prosecuted on account of any views
that he may hold in regard to the matters that were the subject of
his protests,'' prosecutor Robert Montague told the court Monday at
the start of the two-day trial. ``It was inappropriate both as to
time and place. It was unseemly. It was indecorous.''
	   Public figures such as playwright Harold Pinter called for the
law to be abolished in a letter to The Times newspaper Monday,
while other celebrities such as actor Ian McKellan and actress
Vanessa Redgrave have also come to Tatchell's defense.

Malaysia's flag carrier reports dlrs 116 million loss for six
</HEADLINE>
months &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia Airline on Monday
reported a group net loss of 441.1 million ringgit (dlrs 116
million) for the six months ended Sept. 30 as demand and the
Malaysian currency weakened.
	   In the same period last year, mostly before the onset of the
Asian financial crisis, it made a net profit of 23.5 million
ringgit (dlrs 6.2 million).
	   In the fiscal first half, revenue rose slightly to 3.4 billion
ringgit (dlrs 995 million) from 3.37 billion ringgit (dlrs 886.8
million) a year earlier, the company said in a statement.
	   For the earnings loss, the airline cited declining demand on
domestic and regional routes, higher costs and foreign exchange
losses due to the weak ringgit.
	   MAS said demand for air travel in the second half of the fiscal
year is expected to remain poor, and price competition is expected
to put pressure on yields.
	   MAS took delivery of two Boeing 777-200 and one Boeing 747-400,
and disposed of one Boeing B747-400 and one DC-10-30 in the first
half.
	   It started thrice weekly service to New York through Dubai while
service to Macau was stopped.

U.N. envoy calls for inquiry into oil damage in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A United Nations human rights envoy has
called for an independent inquiry into claims of widespread
environmental damage in Nigeria by international oil companies, a
U.N. human rights envoy was reported as saying Monday.
	   U.N. Rapporteur Solil Sorabjee said a neutral agency appointed
by the Nigerian government may be able to help settle environmental
disputes between ethnic Ogoni activists and international firms
such as Shell Oil, the Lagos Guardian reported.
	   Ogonis have long demanded monetary compensation for spills and
other environmental damage in southern Nigeria, claims that Shell
and other companies have rebutted.
	   Sorabjee said he was perplexed by the fact that in many cases
the oil companies unilaterally decided whether to give
compensation, or how much.
	   ``This independent agency should assess the situation since the
activists say there is damage to the environment and Shell says
no,'' Sorabjee was quoted as saying.
	   Nigeria, the world's sixth largest oil producer, is plagued by
hundreds of offshore and underground pipeline spills every year.
Many are the result of sabotage aimed at securing compensation from
the companies while others are used by scavengers to collect the
spilled oil to use and resell.
	   An unknown number of spills are allegedly the result of neglect
by the Nigerian government, which owns many pipelines, or
international oil companies.
	   Sorabjee met over the weekend with Ogoni leaders and Shell
officials in the southern coastal city of Port Harcourt. Tensions
have run high for years between the two sides, culminating in the
execution of Ogoni human rights crusader Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995 on orders from the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Saro-Wiwa, who was outspoken in his criticism of Shell and other
multinational companies, was along with eight other people
summarily convicted by the junta of murder.
	   The tension has persisted in the Niger River delta region
despite Abacha's death in June and the appointment of his reformist
successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on
churches, mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after
a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerated into a
riot, the military and a Muslim leader said.
	   A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school.
Troops and riot police patrolled the streets.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests
as fighting between Muslims and Christians continued after dark,
said a military officer who spoke by telephone on condition of
anonymity.
	   The violence in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang was in
retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim
mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were
killed.
	   Islamic leaders urged Indonesia's Muslim majority not to
retaliate with more violence.
	   Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's largest Muslim grouping,
the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accused provocateurs of
whipping up religious strife when the sprawling Southeast Asian
nation is trying to head toward democracy.
	   ``I hope Muslims ... are not deceived by such provocations,''
said Wahid, who has been pushing for religious unity.
	   West Timor shares the same island as troubled East Timor, a
former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman Catholicism and
invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Christians, mostly Protestants, dominate Kupang, about 1,875
kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.
However, a sizable Muslim minority also lives there.
	   The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged a
peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church
attacks.
	   Most offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, the
capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor called for
calm.
	   Organizers of Monday's strike had called for a non-violent ``day
of mourning.''
	   However, residents said fires broke out in three mosques after
rival gangs pelted each other with rocks.
	   Air services to Kupang were canceled because of security
concerns, Merpati Airlines said.
	   Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia.
	   Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation have
intensified as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   There is also political turmoil as students protesters demand
greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former
President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in
May.
	   Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition
United Development Party, urged his followers not to hit back. More
than 100,000 party supporters filled a sports stadium in Jakarta
Sunday at the opening of a four-day convention.
	   Religious strife erupted recently in the eastern part of the
main island of Java, where more than 150 people, many of them
Islamic clerics, have been murdered, apparently by rival Muslim
groups. Many of the dead were accused of practicing black magic.

Italian foreign minister to discuss Kurdish case

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini held talks
Monday with senior Russian officials about a Kurdish rebel leader
who is seeking asylum in Italy and could be returned to Moscow.
	   Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in Rome earlier this
month after traveling there from Moscow. The ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted unidentified Italian diplomats as saying Ocalan could be
sent to Russia if his request for asylum is rejected by the Italian
government.
	   The Ocalan issue was expected to dominate Dini's talks in Moscow
with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov. But officials refused to release any details
after Monday's meetings.
	   ``The discussion of the (Ocalan) question was not the purpose of
my visit, but we've had a chance to exchange information,'' Dini
told reporters after meeting with Ivanov. He refused to elaborate.
	   Dini also stressed that his visit was scheduled ``several weeks
ago'' _ long before Ocalan was arrested.
	   Dini told Italy's La Stampa newspaper that he hoped to find out
about the events leading up to Ocalan's journey to Rome and ``above
all what was the Russian position on his decision to come to
Italy.''
	   Turkey wants Ocalan extradited to stand trial on terrorism and
other capital crimes, but Italian law forbids extradition when a
suspect faces the death penalty. Ocalan is also wanted in Germany,
but German officials say they won't seek his extradition.
	   That leaves Italy stuck with Ocalan, a controversial figure who
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a
guerrilla war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14 years.
	   In the Moscow meetings Monday, Dini also discussed Russia's
economic crisis and sought to ``confirm our will to help Russia at
this difficult moment.'' He didn't offer any specific aid.
	   ``Russia is not only a great nation, a great military and
international power, Russia is also a country with a great economic
potential, and therefore it has every chance to overcome the
crisis, especially with help from friendly nations,'' Dini said.
	   Dini and Ivanov signed an agreement on preventing dual taxation,
and a deal on opening an Italian cultural center in Moscow and a
Russian one in Rome.
	   Ivanov, meanwhile, promised that Russia's government would
continue economic and democratic reforms despite the country's
worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   ``The democratic reforms will grow, and these reforms will have
a clear social orientation, so that life in Russia improves as a
result,'' Ivanov told a news conference.

South Africa one up against West Indies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with final scores; No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Monday won its
first test against the West Indies by four wickets at the Wanderers
Stadium, in a match dominated throughout by bowlers.
	   It took a grinding effort by the South Africans on the final day
when the pitch was deteriorating rapidly.
	   The home team eventually drew away to be in a position of safety
only after lunch, when captain Hansie Cronje launched an assault on
the attack which was led at that stage by Curtly Ambrose and
legspinner Rawl Lewis.
	   South Africa, on 77 for three at lunch, were certainly not home
and dry after a tenuous start. The opening pace duo of Curtly
Ambrose and Courtney Walsh had removed Gary Kirsten (7) and Adam
Bacher (6) respectively.
	   Then Jacques Kallis and Darryl Cullinan steadied things.
Cullinan began hitting out, speeding to a good-looking 35 before he
was brilliantly caught at midwicket by Stuart Williams.
	   Once Cronje accelerated proceedings after lunch, the initiative
was finally wrested from the West Indies.
	   His dismissal for 31 off the bowling of Courtney Walsh slowed
things considerably, and, while South Africa didn't look as if they
would lose the match, it became a very slow process.
	   Jacques Kallis picked up his second half-century of the match as
he played the anchor-role. He finished undefeated on 57, and lost
partners Jonty Rhodes for nine and Shaun Pollock for the same
score, before he was joined by Mark Boucher with the scores tied.
	   It was Boucher who hit the winning run through the covers off
Curtly Ambrose.
	   West Indian Captain Brian Lara said afterwards: ``We did not bat
as we should have in the second innings, but overall, we have to
accept South Africa played better cricket. We have to get better
prepared for second test.''
	   Said Cronje: ``It's a relief to win after our two losses in
England during our last tour. After lunch, Jacques (Kallis) and I
tried to get positive to keep the initiative, and that obviously
worked.''
	   The next test is Dec. 10-14 at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth,
on the southern coast.
	   The West Indies have a one-day match in Zwide in the Eastern
Cape on Wednesday before taking on the top-of-the-log South African
provincial team Border in East London from Friday to Sunday.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Emile Lahoud announced Monday
that the country's current prime minister, Rafik Hariri, has
declined to form a new government and said he was scheduling a
fresh round of consultations to choose a premier.
	   The move by Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992,
could be a bargaining tactic. But Future Television, a private
station owned by Hariri, appeared to close the door to a
reappointment, saying Hariri was not a candidate.
	   The tension between the two men may affect Lebanon's economic
stability as it recovers from its 1975-90 civil war.

Economic slowdown puts air line with Kazakstan on hold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The transport minister told a
delegation from Kazakstan on Monday that because of Asia's economic
slowdown, Malaysia is not yet ready to establish air links between
the two countries.
	   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Malaysia welcomed the
proposal and was prepared to study the route, but likely would not
be able to establish air links immediately, the national news
agency Bernama reported.
	   Ling told the Kazakstan delegation, led by Anvar Saidenov,
minister of state on investment, that ``establishing an air link is
important to businessmen because this will create a business
link,'' Bernama added.
	   In this year's first nine months, trade between Malaysia and
Kazakstan amounted to 11 million ringgit (dlrs 2.9 million), with
exports from Malaysia amounting to 9.9 ringgit million (dlrs 2.6
million) and imports from Kazakstan 1.1 million ringgit (dlrs
290,000).

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A day after returning from Britain, an Italian man
confessed Monday to killing his father, mother and younger brother,
who vanished in 1989.
	   Ferdinando Carretta, 36, was arrested Sunday in Rome on arrival
from London, where he'd been living since the family disappeared.
He surfaced after a policeman stopped him for a routine traffic
violation.
	   He had always maintained he knew nothing about his family's
whereabouts, but confessed to the slayings during questioning in
the northern Italian city of Parma, officials said.
	   ``He couldn't wait to confess,'' an investigating magistrate,
Vittorio Zanichelli, told the Italian news agency ANSA. ``He
confessed immediately.''
	   Investigators later began a search for the bodies in a garbage
dump outside Parma.
	   Giuseppe Carretta, at the time 53, his wife Marta Chezzi, 49,
and younger son Nicola, 23, were last seen the night of Aug. 4,
1989, leaving their home in Parma in their camper. The camper was
found, empty and abandoned on Nov. 19, 1989, in Milan.
	   Italian newspapers were full of speculation about the
disappearances, including rumors that Giuseppe Carretta, an
accountant, has embezzled a fortune and had fled to the Caribbean
or South America, but no trace of the family was found.
	   Suspicion also focused on Ferdinando, who bought a pistol just
before the family disappeared. But he, too, remained missing and
the investigation was eventually closed.
	   Carretta surfaced by accident, when he was stopped in London for
ignoring a no-entry sign. He was listed as a missing person and
British authorities contacted their Italian counterparts, reports
said.
	   Italian newspapers said Carretta was living modestly in a
one-room apartment in a blue-collar neighborhood of London and
worked as a messenger for an express delivery service. Carretta
told interviewers he was estranged from his family and left home
because of family problems several days before the family vanished.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on
churches, mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after
a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerated into a
riot, the military and a Muslim leader said.
	   A rampaging crowd also burned down a market, a Muslim school and
a hostel for Islamic pilgrims. Troops and riot police patrolled the
streets.
	   The official Antara news agency said several Muslim prayer rooms
and other small places of Islamic worship were attacked.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests
as fighting between Muslims and Christians continued after dark,
said a military officer who spoke by telephone on condition of
anonymity.
	   The violence in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang was in
retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim
mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were
killed.
	   Hoping to cool tensions, Kupang's Roman Catholic Bishop Petrus
Turang apologized for the burnings in an interview with privately
owned RCTI television.
	   Islamic leaders urged Indonesia's Muslim majority not to
retaliate with more violence.
	   Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's largest Muslim grouping,
the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accused provocateurs of
whipping up religious strife when the sprawling Southeast Asian
nation is trying to head toward democracy.
	   ``I hope Muslims ... are not deceived by such provocations,''
said Wahid, who has been pushing for religious unity.
	   West Timor shares the same island as troubled East Timor, a
former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman Catholicism and
invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Christians, mostly Protestants, dominate Kupang, about 1,875
kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.
However, a sizable Muslim minority also lives there.
	   The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged a
peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church
attacks.
	   Most offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, the
capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor called for
calm.
	   Organizers of Monday's strike had called for a non-violent ``day
of mourning.''
	   However, residents said fires broke out in three mosques after
rival gangs pelted each other with rocks.
	   Air services to Kupang were canceled because of security
concerns, Merpati Airlines said.
	   Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia.
	   Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation have
intensified as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   There is also political turmoil as students protesters demand
greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former
President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in
May.
	   Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition
United Development Party, urged his followers not to hit back. More
than 100,000 party supporters filled a sports stadium in Jakarta
Sunday at the opening of a four-day convention.
	   Religious strife erupted recently in the eastern part of the
main island of Java, where more than 150 people, many of them
Islamic clerics, have been murdered, apparently by rival Muslim
groups. Many of the dead were accused of practicing black magic.

South Africa one up against West Indies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with final scores; No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Monday won its
first test against the West Indies by four wickets at the Wanderers
Stadium, in a match dominated throughout by bowlers.
	   It took a grinding effort by the South Africans on the final day
when the pitch was deteriorating rapidly.
	   The home team eventually drew away to be in a position of safety
only after lunch, when captain Hansie Cronje launched an assault on
the attack which was led at that stage by Curtly Ambrose and
legspinner Rawl Lewis.
	   South Africa, on 77 for three at lunch, were certainly not home
and dry after a tenuous start. The opening pace duo of Curtly
Ambrose and Courtney Walsh had removed Gary Kirsten (7) and Adam
Bacher (6) respectively.
	   Then Jacques Kallis and Darryl Cullinan steadied things.
Cullinan began hitting out, speeding to a good-looking 35 before he
was brilliantly caught at midwicket by Stuart Williams.
	   Once Cronje accelerated proceedings after lunch, the initiative
was finally wrested from the West Indies.
	   His dismissal for 31 off the bowling of Courtney Walsh slowed
things considerably, and, while South Africa didn't look as if they
would lose the match, it became a very slow process.
	   Jacques Kallis picked up his second half-century of the match as
he played the anchor-role. He finished undefeated on 57, and lost
partners Jonty Rhodes for nine and Shaun Pollock for the same
score, before he was joined by Mark Boucher with the scores tied.
	   It was Boucher who hit the winning run through the covers off
Curtly Ambrose.
	   West Indian Captain Brian Lara said afterwards: ``We did not bat
as we should have in the second innings, but overall, we have to
accept South Africa played better cricket. We have to get better
prepared for the second test.''
	   Said Cronje: ``It's a relief to win after our two losses in
England during our last tour. After lunch, Jacques (Kallis) and I
tried to get positive to keep the initiative, and that obviously
worked.''
	   The next test is Dec. 10-14 at St. George's Park, Port
Elizabeth, on the southern coast.
	   The West Indies have a one-day match in Zwide in the Eastern
Cape on Wednesday before taking on the top-of-the-log South African
provincial team Border in East London from Friday to Sunday.

Mass grave with more than 25 bodies unearthed in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A human rights group affiliated with an
Iraqi opposition group said Monday that a mass grave contains the
remains of more than 25 bodies has been unearthed near a farm in an
eastern Iraqi province.
	   The Center for Human Rights said the mass grave was discovered
in Oct. 15 by Jubeir Abdullah Alaywi while digging near his farm in
the Diyala province, 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Baghdad.
	   The group, affiliated to the London-based Iraqi Communist Party
said that shortly after Alaywi found the grave, security men
arrested him and his family still unaware of his whereabouts.
	   The group did not say who was behind the murders of the 25
victims, but it put the slayings in the context of its complaints
about the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``We once again call on the U.N. human rights organizations to
take urgent steps to put an immediate halt to the continuing mass
terror,'' the group said in a statement faxed to The Associated
Press in Cairo.
	   The statement also said that four Iraqi political prisoners,
including two officers, were executed in Nov. 12 in the Badoush
prison in Mosul, 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Baghdad.
	   It named the officers as Major Mehdi Saleh Rakan and Captain
Omar Taha Salem and said the prison authorities did not hand over
the bodies to their families and instead left them at the
province's municipality.
	   Iraq has been systematically executing political prisoners, some
of them have been in detention since the abortive uprising of the
Shiite Muslim southern towns in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   In April, the U.N. human rights commissioner responsible for
Iraq, former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, said as many
as 1,500 people may have been executed in Iraq last year.

Zimbabwe unions aim to defy strike ban if talks flounder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Trade unions on Monday vowed to defy a
government ban on strikes if ongoing official talks on economic and
wage policies fail to make progress.
	   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said it would seek to have
the ban declared unconstitutional in the nation's highest court,
the Supreme Court.
	   ``Strong arm tactics...do not augur well for the talks and if we
see no progress in a reasonable period we will go on'' with mass
action, said federation president Gibson Sibanda. ``We (are) very
much ready to be locked up.''
	   The government, facing the threat of civil unrest over the
nation's crumbling economy, on Saturday banned national strikes.
The presidential order calls for sweeping penalties, imprisonment
for unspecified periods and fines of up to 100,000 Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 3,000) against strike organizers.
	   Companies that encourage the strikes and unions could have their
trading or registration licenses canceled, making it illegal for
them to receive revenue.
	   The labor federation said it would decide later about a national
strike planned for Wednesday. An important factor would be the
outcome of two meetings with government and employers on economic
and wage issues, part of a series of ongoing talks.
	   ``We want to give these negotiations a chance,'' Sibanda said.
	   The exact times for the next meetings were not available.
	   Sibanda called the strike ban unconstitutional and a breach of
free expression and rights to strike enshrined in the nation's
labor laws.
	   The labor federation shut down the economy four times since
January to protest soaring prices, 40 percent inflation and alleged
rampant economic mismanagement by the government.
	   More recently, the unions have denounced the deployment of 8,000
troops to support embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Those operations, backed by helicopter gun ships and fighter
jets, are estimated to be costing Zimbabwe at least dlrs 500,000 a
day.
	   Morgan Tsvangirai, the federation's powerful secretary-general,
called President Robert Mugabe's order to ban strikes a desperate
move.
	   ``The workers are expressing discontent over the economy and the
government is telling them to shut up. The ban is in desperation,''
he said.
	   The government blames price increases on an 80 percent slide in
the value of the Zimbabwe currency against the U.S. dollar in the
past year because of world economic conditions.
	   But public protest presents the most serious challenge to Mugabe
since he took power in the former Rhodesia at Independence in 1981.

Ukraine's most notorious accused killer demands new lawyer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's most notorious accused killer
refused Monday to testify at his trial on 52 murder counts after
the court rejected his request for a new lawyer.
	   The unexpected development came as judges began looking into the
first alleged murder, the killing of a Ukrainian couple in June
1989.
	   That attack started a bloody trail attributed to Anatoliy
Onoprienko, 39, a former forester and sailor. Onoprienko is accused
of killing 52 people, including entire families with small
children, in 1989 and 1995-96. His lawyer says he has confessed to
all of them.
	   In Monday's proceedings, Onoprienko suddenly demanded that his
state-appointed attorney, Ruslan Mashkovsky, be replaced with a
lawyer who, unlike Mashkovsky, is ``at least 50 years old, Jewish
or half-Jewish, economically independent and has international
practice.''
	   ``A lawyer who would want to defend Onoprienko can be found,''
he said in remarks carried by the Interfax news agency. The report
did not elaborate on his reasons for the request, nor carry any
comment from Mashkovsky.
	   After the court declined his request, Onoprienko, who has been
cooperative in the past, flatly refused to testify further.
	   None of the witnesses summoned for Monday's proceedings appeared
at the trial in Zhytomyr, 140 kilometers (90 miles) west of the
capital Kiev, Interfax reported. It was unclear why the witnesses
didn't show up.
	   About a dozen killings in 1989 allegedly were carried out along
with accomplice Serhiy Rogozin.
	   On Monday, Rogozin insisted that his earlier self-incriminating
testimony was false and resulted from both physical and
psychological pressure by the investigators. Rogozin said he had
nothing to do with the first 1989 slaying and had not even heard of
it, Interfax reported.
	   Psychiatrists have ruled Onoprienko fit to stand trial. He faces
a likely death sentence if convicted.
	   Ukraine imposed a moratorium on capital punishment last year to
meet its obligations as a Council of Europe member. But President
Leonid Kuchma said last week that he was ready to appeal to the
Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
organization, about the possible execution of Onoprienko if he is
found guilty.

Conservationists to push plan on governments to save Asian tigers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asia's tigers face extinction soon
unless governments in the region quickly take concrete steps to
save them, top conservationists warned Monday.
	   ``If you take a step back 95 years, the population has declined
by 95 percent,'' said Robert Mather, local director of the World
Wide Fund for Nature. ``So how long will it be before the next 5
percent disappear?''
	   Asia has only 5,000 tigers left, half of them in India, Mather
said. With that in mind, conservation groups and other
organizations met Monday in Bangkok to draft an action plan to save
tigers that will be handed to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Dec.
26.
	   One major problem facing tigers is demand for their organs,
especially among Asian traditional healers who believe eating tiger
parts can help cure disease.
	   ``Some people think eating tiger penis soup gives them great
power,'' said Australian zoologist Anthony Lynam. ``Actually,
tigers make love for only 15 seconds at a time. We should be able
to do better than this without eating tiger products.''
	   Lynam, of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, is
working with Southeast Asian nations to establish the density and
distribution of the region's tiger population.
	   Thailand is more ready to conserve tigers than many other
Southeast Asian countries, Lynam said, with a system of protected
areas that could serve as a model for others. Thailand has an
estimated 250 tigers, but many regularly cross borders.
	   The plan drafted Monday will propose that a ``tiger zone'' be
defined within the protected area system so that conservation
management is designed around the survival of the tigers. It will
call for better conservation training for forestry officials and
educating villagers living near the areas.
	   Studies have shown that the number of tigers declines rapidly in
forest that has been reduced to 150 square kilometers (60 square
miles).
	   The animals require large areas to survive and reproduce, and
extensive hunting of the animals that tigers eat has contributed to
their decline.

Financial group gets dlrs 140 million injection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Pahang state
government, through its investment arm, will inject 530 million
ringgit (dlrs 140 million) to boost the assets of the financial
services group Rashid Hussain Bhd, its executive chairman said
Monday.
	   The chairman, tycoon Abdul Rashid Hussain, will stay in that
position.
	   The Pahang State Development Corp. is to take a 29 percent stake
in the company, with the investment taking the form of a share
swap.
	   Rashid said a new chief executive officer will be appointed to
manage the assets put forward by the development corporation.
	   ``This alliance will transform RHB from an investment holding
company into a diversified Malaysian conglomerate, adding further
strength to its balance sheet and diversification of its earnings
base,'' Rashid said.
	   Khalil Yacoob, chief minister of Pahang, said the deal is in
line with the government's goal of promoting wider share ownership
for the country's majority Muslim Malay population.
	   ``This is indeed a quantum leap for Pahang State Economic
Development Corp. as we are now shareholders in one of the most
respected financial services groups in the country with an
excellent franchise base,'' Khalil said.

Palestinian police arrest militant suspected of ordering car bomb

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence agents have
arrested a member of the Islamic Jihad group on suspicion that he
ordered a November car bombing in a Jerusalem market, an Islamic
Jihad leader said Monday.
	   The suspected mastermind, Iyad Hardan, 22, was arrested last
week during a raid of the home of a relative in the West Bank town
of Jenin, said the Islamic Jihad leader who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Palestinian officials would not comment on the arrest.
	   Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the Nov. 6 bombing
in Jerusalem's outdoor Mahane Yehuda market. The attack killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israeli soldiers.
	   Israel radio said Monday that Palestinian police also arrested
two members of the Islamic militant group Hamas who were on a list
of suspected militants sought by Israel.
	   Security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians was a
key Israeli demand in the Wye River land-for-security agreement.
The Palestinian Authority agreed to take tougher measures against
the militants.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on
churches, mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after
a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerated into a
riot, the military and a Muslim leader said.
	   A rampaging crowd also burned down a market, a Muslim school and
a hostel for Islamic pilgrims. Troops and riot police patrolled the
streets.
	   The official Antara news agency said several Muslim prayer rooms
and other small places of Islamic worship were attacked.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests
as fighting between Muslims and Christians continued after dark,
said a military officer who spoke by telephone on condition of
anonymity.
	   Residents said the violence ended by mid-evening.
	   The violence in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang was in
retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim
mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were
killed, some hacked to death.
	   Hoping to cool tensions, Kupang's Roman Catholic Bishop Petrus
Turang apologized for the burnings in an interview with privately
owned RCTI television.
	   Islamic leaders urged Indonesia's Muslim majority not to
retaliate with more violence.
	   Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's largest Muslim grouping,
the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accused provocateurs of
whipping up religious strife when the sprawling Southeast Asian
nation is trying to head toward democracy.
	   ``I hope Muslims ... are not deceived by such provocations,''
said Wahid, who has been pushing for religious unity.
	   West Timor shares the same island as troubled East Timor, a
former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman Catholicism and
invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Protestants and Catholics, dominate Kupang, about 1,875
kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.
However, a sizable Muslim minority also lives there.
	   The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged
what was supposed to be a non-violent ``day of mourning'' over the
Jakarta church burnings.
	   Witnesses said tens of thousands of people blocked the streets
and stopped vehicles.
	   Residents said fires broke out in the mosques after rival gangs
pelted each other with rocks.
	   Most offices and shops were closed in the city of 120,000, the
capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor called for
calm.
	   Air services to Kupang were canceled because of security
concerns, Merpati Airlines said.
	   Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   About 90 percent of its 202 million people are Muslims, with the
rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia.
	   Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation have
intensified as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   There is also political turmoil as students protesters demand
greater democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former
President Suharto, who was forced to quit following deadly riots in
May.
	   Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition
United Development Party, urged his followers not to hit back. More
than 100,000 party supporters filled a sports stadium in Jakarta
Sunday at the opening of a four-day convention.
	   Religious strife erupted recently in the eastern part of the
main island of Java, where more than 150 people, many of them
Islamic clerics, have been murdered, apparently by rival Muslim
groups. Many of the dead were accused of practicing black magic.

U.N. envoy calls for inquiry into oil damage in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A United Nations human rights envoy has
called for an independent inquiry into claims of widespread
environmental damage in Nigeria by international oil companies, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   U.N. Rapporteur Solil Sorabjee said a neutral agency appointed
by the Nigerian government may be able to help settle environmental
disputes between ethnic Ogoni activists and international firms
such as Shell Oil, the Lagos Guardian reported.
	   Ogonis have long demanded monetary compensation for spills and
other environmental damage in southern Nigeria, claims that Shell
and other companies have rebutted.
	   Sorabjee said he was perplexed by the fact that in many cases
the oil companies unilaterally decided whether to give
compensation, or how much.
	   ``This independent agency should assess the situation since the
activists say there is damage to the environment and Shell says
no,'' Sorabjee was quoted as saying.
	   Nigeria, the world's sixth largest oil producer, is plagued by
hundreds of offshore and underground pipeline spills every year.
Many are the result of sabotage aimed at securing compensation from
the companies while others are used by scavengers to collect the
spilled oil to use and resell.
	   An unknown number of spills are allegedly the result of neglect
by the Nigerian government, which owns many pipelines, or
international oil companies.
	   Sorabjee met over the weekend with Ogoni leaders and Shell
officials in the southern coastal city of Port Harcourt. Tensions
have run high for years between the two sides, culminating in the
execution of Ogoni human rights crusader Ken Saro-Wiwa in November
1995 on orders from the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Saro-Wiwa, who was outspoken in his criticism of Shell and other
multinational companies, was along with eight other people
summarily convicted by the junta of murder.
	   The tension has persisted in the Niger River delta region
despite Abacha's death in June and the appointment of his reformist
successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   In a change from Abacha's policy of snubbing calls for oil
sector reforms, Abubakar's government has promised to eliminate
corruption and waste, but has not said how it will deal with claims
of environmental damage. There was no government comment following
the U.N. envoy's call.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Hoechst and France's
Rhone-Poulenc are near agreement on merging their pharmaceutical
and agrochemical units to create one of the world's largest
life-sciences firms.
	   The two companies have scheduled a press conference Tuesday in
Strasbourg, France to discuss details of the agreement, a Hoechst
spokesman said Monday. With annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion,
the new company will be tied for No. 1 ranking with Switzerland's
Novartis AG in the life-sciences sector, according to analysts.
	   Press reports quoting sources close to the deal say Hoechst
Chairman Juergen Dormann will be chairman of the new company's
management board, while Rhone-Poulenc Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou
will be vice-chairman.
	   The merged group will be called Avantis, the French daily
newspaper La Tribune reported Monday, and will be based in
Strasbourg, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
	   The German newspaper reported that the deal is in advance of an
entire merger between the two firms expected in two years. Analysts
have warned against a full merger until the heavily indebted firms
reduce costs.
	   Unions in France and Germany have been critical of the merger,
fearing layoffs. Hoechst employs 118,000 workers and Rhone-Poulenc,
68,000.

	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Jiddah-based Islamic Development
Bank has agreed to finance Indonesian imports of food and medicine
worth dlrs 280 million, the bank said in a statement Monday.
	   It said the trade financing agreement was signed Sunday by the
bank's chief executive, Ahmed Ali, and Indonesia's ambassador to
Saudi Arabia, Zarkowi Soejoeti.
	   The agreement is part of a dlrs 500 million aid package recently
approved by the bank for Indonesia.
	   The bank is the financial arm of the 52-member Organization of
the Islamic Conference, the umbrella group for Muslim countries.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Egypt will inaugurate the
linkage of their electric power networks on Dec. 10 at a meeting
here of the joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, a government
official said Monday.
	   Suhair Amawi, head of economic cooperation in the Ministry of
Industry and Trade, said the two countries also will sign an
agreement on free trade and discuss other programs to improve
economic cooperation.
	   Plans call for the elimination of all customs duties between the
two countries by the year 2005, Amawi said. A first cut of 25
percent will be made next year, he said.
	   Mohammed Azzam Khamis, head of the planning department at
Jordan's National Electric Power Co., said Jordan's share of the
dlrs 228.9 million electrical project was dlrs 80.3 million.
	   Egypt and Jordan expect eventually to link their power grids to
Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Turkey, Khamis said.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Chinese officials discussed improving trade
relations with Jordan during a two-day visit.
	   Mohammed Halaiqah, secretary-general of the Ministry of Industry
and Trade, said Monday that the 15-member Chinese delegation
discussed the investment climate in the country and prospects for
joint ventures in electronics, oil shale exploitation,
manufacturing and textiles.
	   The delegation was headed by Jin Hai Ping, president of the
Commission of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade of Anhui
Province.
	   Jordan's exports to China last year were valued at dlrs 19
million, and imports at dlrs 101 million. Exports in the first nine
months this year totaled dlrs 16 million, and imports dlrs 74.2
million.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Faleh al-Khayat, planning director at the
Oil Ministry, said Monday that crude exports have been flowing as
usual although there has been no new agreement for food
distribution under the fifth phase of the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program.
	   ``Iraq is simply honoring deals related to the past period,''
al-Khayat said.
	   The fourth, six-month phase of the oil-for-food program ended
Nov. 25.
	   The program, an exception from U.N. trade sanctions imposed
eight years ago, allows Iraq to export limited quantities of oil to
buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Iraq had authorization to sell up to dlrs 5.2 billion worth of
crude during the fourth phase, but low world oil prices and
production problems held its sales to an estimated dlrs 3.15
billion.
	   The U.N. Security Council approved a new, six-month phase at the
dlrs 5.2 billion level to begin Nov. 26, but it has not yet
approved a new food distribution plan. Iraq had asked for a
two-month extension of the previous phase to use up its quota.
	   Al-Khayat said Iraq's crude exports currently were averaging 1.7
to 1.8 million barrels per day.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A controversy that led Kuwait's Central Bank
governor, Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah, to submit his
resignation apparently has been resolved, Al-Qabas daily reported
Monday.
	   Sheik Salem reportedly had said he was quitting after ministers
suggested pumping liquidity into the Kuwait Stock Exchange by
allowing investment companies to offer special loans _ a move Sheik
Salem opposed.
	   Al-Qabas quoted Sheik Salem as saying he was satisfied with a
Sunday statement by the Cabinet affirming the ``independence of the
Central Bank in forming the credit and monetary policy.''
	   The governor did not say he withdrew his resignation, but said
the statement had ``set things right.''
	   He said the bank would conduct a ``comprehensive survey of the
market'' to determine if special loans for stock purchases are
needed.
	   The price index of the market has fallen in recent weeks to
two-year lows. The exchange, one of the most active in the Middle
East, lists 77 companies.

Report: Japanese construction firm to seek protection from
</HEADLINE>
creditors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A troubled mid-size Japanese construction company
with publicly traded stock will seek court protection from its
creditors, a local report said Monday.
	   The decision by Tokyo-based JDC Corp. to abandon a restructuring
effort came amid a prolonged earnings slump and crushing debt
burden stemming from failed investments in golf course and other
development projects, Kyodo News agency reported, citing unnamed
company sources.
	   JDC officials were unavailable for comment late Monday.
	   A private credit research firm estimates the civil engineering
company has debts totaling around 400 billion yen (dlrs 3.23
billion), Kyodo said.
	   That would make it the largest effective bankruptcy of a
Japanese general contractor since the collapse of Tokai Kogyo Co.,
which went bust in July last year with debts of 511 billion yen
(dlrs 4.13 billion).
	   JDC was the second most actively traded stock Monday on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Its share price fell 14.5 percent to 65 yen
(dlrs 0.52).
	   Many Japanese construction companies have suffered losses after
investing heavily in property development before the collapse of a
speculative land price bubble earlier this decade.
	   Japan's weak economy has also hurt the industry by reducing
demand for housing and other construction projects.

Norway increases quota for 1999 minke whale hunt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Commercial hunters may kill 671 minke whales
next year, up from 580 this year, the fisheries ministry said
Monday.
	   ``The quota includes 140 animals that were left over from the
1996 hunt'' when bad weather disrupted the season, Rannveig Boethun
of the fisheries ministry said.
	   The season was set for May through August. The whale meat is
restricted for sale to Norway's domestic market.
	   Norway resumed the controversial hunts in 1993 after a grudging
six-year break. The government gradually increased quotas from 296
that year. Next year's higher quota remains far below the roughly
1,800 whales killed annually in the 1950s and 1960s.
	   The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling
in 1986 because some types of whales were endangered. However,
Norway is not bound by the ban because commission rules allow
members to reject its decisions.
	   Nevertheless, Norway's defiance of the ban has left it facing
protests and boycott threats. Anti-whaling activists have sabotaged
Norwegian whaling boats and confronted them at sea in hopes of
disrupting the hunts.
	   Norway says the estimated population of 112,000 minke whales off
its coast is enough to sustain a limited hunt. Minke are the
smallest of the baleen whales, growing to about nine meters (30
feet).
	   In keeping with tradition, the quotas were announced at a
meeting of the Norwegian Whale Hunters Association late Friday in
northern Norway.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Despite years of claims it has ended all programs
to build weapons of mass destruction, Iraq made a bid to acquire
prohibited missile technology last May, CNN reported.
	   In its program NewsStand, produced with Time magazine, CNN said
Sunday evening that Iraqi missile experts, escorted by Iraqi secret
police, went to the Romanian capital Bucharest to negotiate the
purchase of guidance equipment for long-range missiles.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its long-range missiles and
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons under resolutions by the
U.N. Security Council adopted after the 1991 Gulf War that ended
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
	   The CNN report quoted unidentified sources and Scott Ritter, an
American ex-Marine who resigned as a U.N. arms inspector in August
who complained the U.S. government was undermining the search for
Iraq's forbidden weapons.
	   Iraq has insisted since the early 1990s that it has destroyed
all its prohibited weapons. Tough U.N. trade sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that its weaponry has been destroyed.
	   According to the program's transcript, the Iraqi purchase in
Bucharest was blocked because spy agencies from the United States
and Romania uncovered the potential deal and monitored the Iraqis'
two-week visit.

Shell, Texaco call off plan for European fuel alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Talks between oil companies Shell and Texaco over
a possible alliance in their European refining and retail
operations have been called off, the companies said Monday.
	   The companies had signed a non-binding memorandum of
understanding in September to try to negotiate a possible joint
venture aimed at saving dlrs 200 million a year. Talks began last
year, the companies said.
	   ``Although a joint review by teams from both companies had
confirmed the synergy benefits originally envisaged, we have
concluded that the proposed venture would not maximize shareholder
value for both companies,'' said Paul Skinner, president of Shell
Europe Oil Products.
	   Shell would not elaborate on why talks were terminated, saying
only that while detailed negotiations revealed the magnitude of
savings expected in September would be achievable, they also
highlighted downsides that led to no deal being forged.
	   Shell said the breakdown in talks would not affect the existing
joint venture among Shell, Texaco and Saudi Aramco in the United
States.

Angola's former rebels seize northern town, clash with gov't
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Troops of the former rebel group UNITA
have overrun the northern Angolan town of Caculama and fought
government forces in northwestern Uige province, news reports said
Monday.
	   The former rebels' offensive on Caculama, in northern Malanje
province, took place Thursday, unnamed church sources told Luanda's
Radio Eclesia.
	   Another church source, Father Miguel Botachim, told the radio
that UNITA and government forces were clashing in neighboring Uige
province.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports.
	   They come amid signs of increasing hostility between the former
foes, who signed a 1994 peace accord to end a two-decade civil war
that broke out when Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   The government has threatened to push UNITA out of the areas the
former rebels still hold, and has severed all contact with UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ accuses the government of human rights abuses against UNITA
supporters in areas already handed over.
	   Botachim also told Radio Eclesia that nine church workers _ six
Italians, two Angolans and a Portuguese priest _ who were thought
to be missing were in Uige province.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ He called himself the ``Serb
Adolf,'' and his crimes were as chilling as his nickname.
	   In a trial that opened Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, U.N. prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge
panel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most
serious offense.
	   The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in
October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing
many observers by reversing his earlier declarations of innocence.
	   Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war
crimes and crimes against humanity _ and the likelihood of a
maximum life sentence _ Jelisic has denied that the killing spree
constituted genocide.
	   His trial opened with a court official reading brief excerpts
from a psychological report on Jelisic in which psychologists ruled
that he was mentally fit to stand trial. They added, however, that
he suffered ``a borderline personality disorder with antisocial and
narcissistic tendencies.''
	   Jelisic, wearing a striped sweater and black jeans, brought a
laptop computer into court with him. He listened calmly as the
psychological report was read.

Norway's national oil fund suffers 3rd quarter setback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A slump in global financial markets stung
Norway's national oil fund with a 3.6 percent loss on investment in
the third quarter of 1998, the state Bank of Norway announced
Monday.
	   Norway, a country of 4.4 million that is world's second largest
oil exporter, puts part of its national budget surplus in the
Government Petroleum Fund as a cushion against the day offshore oil
production dwindles. The fund now is worth 140 billion kroner (dlrs
18.7 billion).
	   This year, parliament allowed the state bank, which manages the
fund, to invest 30 to 50 percent in foreign stocks rather than in
safer but lower-yielding bonds.
	   A news release said the decline in the fund's return, measured
against a basket of currencies, was due mainly to a 15.6 percent
plunge in its share holdings during August and September turmoil on
world stock markets.
	   For the first nine months of this year, the total return on
investment was 2.1 percent, measured against the fund's currency
benchmarks. The return on bonds was 8.9 percent, while stocks
declined 3.8 percent.
	   Low oil prices, approaching dlrs 10 per barrel, also are
expected to reduce transfers to the fund this year. The government
had calculated national revenues based on an oil price of about
dlrs 15 per barrel.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Pepe Kalle, the Congolese musician who
dazzled fans with his energetic dancing despite his immense size,
died on Sunday, his family announced.
	   Born Kabasele Yampanya wa ba Mulanga, but better known to his
fans as Pepe Kalle, he had complained of malaria three days before
his death. The immediate cause of death was not known.
	   Kalle, 49, was one of Congo's most famous musicians, having led
his group ``Babula Empire'' for over 27 years.
	   A prolific song writer and singer, he composed more than 300
songs in his career and had completed work on a new album entitled
``Cocktail'' just weeks before his death.
	   Kalle weighed 312 pounds (142 kilos) and was affectionately
called ``The elephant of Congolese music'' because of his size, yet
was an amazingly lithe dancer.
	   He helped popularize ``Zairian Soukouss'' the catchy Congo music
characterized by its high-pitched rapid-fire guitar sound.
	   ``His is an irreplaceable loss,'' declared Tabu Ley Rocherau, a
longtime colleague an fellow Congolese musician.
	   Aside from his musical career, Kalle also starred in a number of
African films.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Customs, immigration and police officials
from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania began a 12-day training session
Monday aimed at stopping illegal drug trafficking through East
Africa's international airports.
	   Koli Kouame, U.N. Drugs Control Program regional representative,
said participants are to learn how to spot suspicious passengers
and air tickets, and to examine passports.
	   ``I am sure you will be surprised by the amount of information
which can be gleaned from a simple air ticket,'' Kouame said.
	   UNCDP has sponsored the program held at the Criminal
Investigations Department school in Nairobi.
	   Peter Kimundi, commandant of Kenya's criminal investigations
school, said drug trafficking in the region was rising, but he
offered no statistics.
	   But Pet Miya, a deputy inspector for South Africa's narcotics
units who will help teach the session, said drug trafficking was
getting more complicated to detect.
	   ``Traffickers have now resorted to swallowing condoms of drugs
or diluting the drug with alcohol and then retracting using
ammonia,'' said Miya.
	   -----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Testimony via satellite
television from American singer Paul Simon would not be allowed in
the fraud trial of anti-apartheid activist Allan Boesak, The Cape
High Court ruled on Monday.
	   Simon, who donated 600,000 rand (dlrs 180,000 at the time) to
Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice Charity, had agreed to
testify for the prosecution but only via television because of his
busy schedule.
	   Judge John Foxcroft said televised testimony would deny Boesak a
fair trial and would seriously hamper effective cross-examination
by his defense lawyer.
	   Boesak has denied he was involved in stealing from the now
defunct charity organization.
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak, 52, has paid back some money and an investigation
by the President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress cleared
him of any criminal wrongdoing.
	   ------
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ A former prime minister of Swaziland,
Obed Dlamini, has been elected president of an illegal political
opposition party, the South African Press Association reported
Monday.
	   Dlamini failed to be reelected to Parliament at the end of his
term as prime minister in 1993.
	   He became an active member of the Nqwane National Liberatory
Congress (NNLC) in March, after the death of NNLC president and
founding member Ambrose Zwane.
	   All political parties were banned in 1973, when King Sobhuza II
dissolved the multiparty constitution.
	   The NNLC and other political opposition movements boycotted the
recent non-party general elections.
	   -----
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ Botswana is gearing up for its first
national television broadcasting to begin next October, it was
announced Monday at the start of construction of a broadcast
center.
	   Botswana Vice President Seretse Khama dedicated the foundation
stone.
	   Project director Kevin Hunt said initial programming would be
five hours during week nights, with extra slots on weekends.
	   ``We are on schedule. We expect to produce two of the five hours
locally and import material for the rest. Local program content
will emphasize news and current events,'' Hunt said.
	   Engineers and production staff will be trained at a television
complex owned by South Africa's former homeland, Bophutatswana,
about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the capital.
	   Gaborone Television currently broadcasts mainly South African
programming to a 45 kilometer (28 miles) radius of the city.

Juve official: team nervous about trip to Istanbul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with player quote, report that players want to change
travel plans, other Italian group canceling trip. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A Juventus official confirmed Monday the
Italian club will show for its politically tinged Champions League
match against Turkey's Galatasaray, but said the players are
worried as they prepare to head to Istanbul.
	   ``We are ready to go, but we will not be going calmly,''
Juventus general director Luiciano Moggi said. ``We still want
guarantees of security. We want to know what the security measures
are, not just that there are measures.''
	   Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader who was
arrested in Rome three weeks ago has prompted anti-Italian
demonstrations in Turkey.
	   With tensions high, European soccer's governing body UEFA
postponed by one week the Champions League match, which was
originally slated for last Wednesday.
	   Several Juventus players, including French World Cup hero
Zinedine Zidane, had threatened to refuse to play in Istanbul.
	   ``We were kind of forced to go to play. We're very worried,''
Juventus 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi said. ``UEFA and the Italian and
Turkish governments know that they have taken on a big
responsibility.''
	   Moggi and Peruzzi spoke to reporters after club officials and
players met for an hour following team practice.
	   The team is scheduled to fly to Istanbul Tuesday, though the
Italian news agency ANSA reported that the players have asked that
the squad fly in the day of the game and leave immediately after.
	   While Juve is headed to Istanbul, an Italian delegation due to
take part there in an annual international meeting to promote peace
canceled its trip citing security concerns, Turkey's Anatolia news
agency reported.

Ukraine's parliament to reduce projected budget deficit for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament is revising the
government's 1999 budget draft to make it nearly deficit-free
before lawmakers start to debate the document this week, a lawmaker
said Monday.
	   Parliament's budget committee is finalizing budget indicators
and the deficit figure will be released when lawmakers debate the
draft Wednesday, said deputy head of the committee, Pavlo
Kuznetsov.
	   The original 1999 budget draft that the Cabinet presented to
parliament on Nov. 17 provided for 23.1 billion hryvna (dlrs 6.74
billion) in revenues, with a deficit of 700 million hryvna (dlrs
204 million), or 0.6 percent of gross domestic product.
	   It also projected that the economy would grow by 1 percent next
year, the first growth since Ukraine won independence with the 1991
Soviet collapse.
	   Kuznetsov did not say how much lawmakers were changing the
revenue and expenditure figures in the government's budget
proposal.
	   Earlier, committee members were demanding that revenues be
raised nearly 100 percent by about 20 billion hryvna (dlrs 5.84
billion), and the additional funds be used for paying wage and
pension arrears.
	   Kuznetsov said the legislators found sources for raising extra
revenues and for ``significantly'' cutting expenditures, the
independent UNIAN news agency reported.
	   In particular, parliament decided to cut financing for the
government and the presidential administration, as well as for
several scientific and educational programs, Kuznetsov said.
	   He said the revised budget draft provides for full payment of
overdue wages and pensions and partial compensation to citizens who
lost their state bank savings with the collapse of the Soviet
Union.

Ethnic party files petition against military courts in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An ethnic party petitioned Pakistan's
supreme court Monday to challenge the establishment of military
courts in the vi olent southern port city of Karachi.
	   The government ordered the establishment of military courts on
Nov. 20 to try those behind violence that has killed more than
1,000 people this year. The move was bitterly opposed by the human
rights groups and opposition parties.
	   ``The constitution does not countenance the establishment of any
court, which is not subordinate to the superior courts,'' Sheikh
Liaquat Hussain, parliamentary leader of the ethnic Muttahida Qami
Movement (MQM), said in the court petition.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government suspended civil rights
in the southern Sindh province and called in the army to curb
political violence in its capital, Karachi.
	   There, the MQM is locked in a bloody feud with its small
splinter faction called the MQM Haqiqi group that has killed
hundreds of militants on each side.
	   The MQM, which represents migrants from India at independence
from Britain in 1947 and their descents, says the decision is
directed against its activists.
	   ``Establishing military courts is beyond the legislative
competence of the federal government,'' Akram Sheikh, a lawyer
representing the MQM told The Associated Press.
	   The court has not set a date for the hearing.
	   Sharif said the military courts were necessary to quell violence
and provide speedy justice.
	   ``Terrorists threaten the witnesses, judges and their families
... and have paralyzed the justice system,'' Sharif said at the
time.
	   The MQM was a major coalition partner with Sharif's Pakistan
Muslim League in Sindh province. But the two parted ways after
Sharif blamed the MQM for most of the killings in Karachi,
including the murder of former Sindh governor Hakim Said.
	   The MQM denies the charge and accuses the government and
security agencies of ``state-sponsored terrorism.''

	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ The German and French foreign ministers
will sign an agreement Monday establishing the first joint
Germany-French university, the German Foreign Ministry said.
	   The university will be based in the German city of Saarbruecken,
near the French border. But classes will be held at affiliated
universities throughout Germany and France, and the university's
diploma will be recognized in both countries, the ministry said.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and his French
counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, were to sign an agreement on
establishing the university during the French-German summit, which
ends Tuesday.

Swiss newcomer to end mobile phone monopoly at Christmas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss-U.S. grouping Diax AG will
start its mobile telephone service Dec. 24, ending partially
privatized Swisscom's monopoly in the market, the group said
Monday.
	   Diax, a joint venture of SBC Communications Inc. of the United
States and Swiss electricity and insurance companies, said it will
invest more than 600 million Swiss francs (dlrs 430 million) in its
network.
	   The company is one of two consortia awarded concessions in April
to compete in the dlrs 1 billion domestic cellular phone market.
	   The second went to Orange Communications SA, a joint venture
between Britain's Orange and Germany's Viag AG.
	   The government-controlled Swisscom, formerly the
telecommunications arm of Switzerland's postal service, began
selling shares to the public in October.

Supreme court reduces life sentences of three British soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - The Supreme Court on Monday reduced to 25
years life sentences of three British soldiers for killing a Danish
tour guide.
	   The three soldiers were jailed for life without remission in
March 1996 for the abduction and manslaughter of 23-year old Louise
Jensen.
	   Justin Fowler, 30, from Falmouth, Cornwall, Alan Ford, 30, of
Birmingham and Geoff Pernell, 27, from Oldbury, West Midlands
abducted Jensen, raped and beat her to death with successive blows
from a shovel and then half buried her naked in a shallow grave
near the tourist resort of Ayia Napa in the summer of 1994.
	   The three judges of the Supreme Court accepted the appeal by the
three soldiers for a reduction of sentence on the grounds that the
lower court ignored mitigating factors. These were listed as the
drunken state of the three men, their young age and clean criminal
record.
	   ``Like the lower court, we feel revulsion over the horrible,
barbaric, inhuman and violent manner of the execution of their
crime. The degrading way they treated their victim is an additional
incriminating element,'' said Justice George Pikis in reading the
verdict.
	   ``The sentence we impose cannot be anything but a very long term
of imprisonment, of such length as to reflect the seriousness of
the terrible crime the appellants committed,'' he added.
	   ``I think they should have been kept in prison for life, I am
very disappointed,'' said the victim's mother, Anette Jensen,
holding back tears. She and her husband had sat through the entire
appeal hearing.
	   The three soldiers listened to the verdict impassively. They
were serving with the First Battalion the Royal Green Jackets
Regiment based at the British Sovereign Base of Dhekelia near Ayia
Napa at the time of the killing.
	   ``At least we won the appeal and had the life sentence reduced,
though we had been hoping for not more than 20 years,'' said Tassos
Katsikides, one of the soldiers' lawyers.
	   Katsikides and other legal sources said they expect that with
good behavior and routine presidential pardons the three soldiers
would serve no more more than 15 years of their 25-year sentence.

Chirac unveils long-awaited Jewish Museum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos PAR101-3 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ From ornate, 16th-century wedding bands to a
roomful of Marc Chagall paintings, 800 years of Jewish culture went
on permanent display Monday in a renovated 17th-century villa.
	   ``For many, this is a dream come true,'' President Jacques
Chirac said after inaugurating the Museum of Art and History of
Judaism, the most comprehensive such collection in France.
	   The museum, in the heart of the old Jewish district called the
Marais, owes its existence to French Holocaust survivors who in
1948 vowed publicly to preserve the artistic and cultural legacy
nearly obliterated by Hitler.
	   The project, plagued by infighting and uncertainty over what the
museum should include, took 50 years.
	   The 211 million-franc (dlrs 37 million) facility, financed by
the French government and city of Paris, opens to the public Dec.
6.
	   It features original documents relating to the Dreyfus Affair,
donated by the family of the falsely accused Jewish army captain.
One document is a well-preserved clip from L'Aurore newspaper in
which author Emile Zola made his famous ``J'accuse'' declaration,
charging the government with framing Dreyfus.
	   Also on display are 37 Nazi-looted paintings recovered in
Germany after the war, on permanent loan from the Pompidou Center.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin told Jewish leaders Saturday that
the gallery of recovered works ``proves France's commitment'' to
tracking down the paintings' original owners or their heirs.
	   Also on show are paintings by artists from the School of Paris -
immigrant Jews from Russia, Poland and Germany who thrived among
the likes of Picasso and Matisse. They include nine works by
Chagall.
	   The museum is user-friendly and also accommodating to foreign
visitors, with plenty of explanations in English as well as French.
	   Officials stress the new facility is not a Holocaust Museum _
France's Memorial to the Jewish Martyr is just a stone's throw
away.
	   Yet one of the most poignant exhibits _ a list of names on a
concrete wall of an air shaft _ captures the tragedy that befell
the 75,000 Jews deported from France to Nazi death camps between
1941-44. Only 2,500 survived.
	   The names recall the poor immigrants who lived on the premises
when it was the villa Saint-Aignan _ originally the home of an
adviser to Cardinal Richelieu, King Louis XIII's finance minister.
	   Over the years, the villa deteriorated. Gilded moldings, elegant
marble fireplaces and a monumental central staircase were ripped
out, and floors added to accommodate more residents.
	   By the mid-1800s it was cheap housing for poor immigrant
families pushed out of other neighborhoods by Baron Haussmann's
urban renewal.
	   On July 16, 1942, 13 Jewish families living in the Saint-Aignan
villa were arrested and deported to Nazi death camps. None
survived.

Volvo cuts 5,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish automaker AB Volvo announced
Monday plans to reduce its worldwide workforce by 5,300.
	   Most of the job cuts are expected to be completed by mid-1999
and should reduce costs by three billion kronor (dlrs 375 million),
Volvo said in a statement.
	   Of the total, 3,100 are administrative employees and 2,200
production workers. By region, 2,600 are employed in Sweden and
2,700 abroad.
	   In addition, over 700 consultant positions will be lost.
	   ``To date, product renewal and the global growth strategy have
been implemented successfully and at a rapid pace, but there is
still much work to do in order for us to be able to attain our
profitability goal. Consequently, efforts are now being turned
toward improving the group's internal efficiency,'' said Leif
Johansson, president and chief executive officer of Volvo.
	   ``We must now take actions to ensure Volvo's long-term
competitiveness,'' he said.
	   Volvo employed 72,900 workers at the end of 1997.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A criminal court on Monday sentenced to
death a 19-year-old Jordanian convicted of murdering 11 members of
his family and a friend who had all teased him about failing an
exam.
	   Judge Mohammed Ajamieh rejected a plea of mercy from Saeed
Qashash, who sat passively in the courtroom. As is customary, the
sentence was announced the same day as the verdict, guilty on 12
counts of premeditated murder.
	   Qashash reportedly confessed to police that he shot his father,
mother, two brothers, four sisters and the husband and two children
of one sister, as well as a 19-year-old schoolmate, all last June
10.
	   According to the charges, the defendant who had failed his
secondary school exam lured the victims one by one to a basement
and shot each of them while they had their backs to him. He then
sealed the basement with bricks and cement.

Angola's former rebels seize northern town, clash with government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Troops of the former rebel group UNITA
have overrun a northern Angolan town and fought government forces
in a northwestern province, news reports said Monday.
	   The former rebels' offensive on the town of Caculama, in
northern Malanje province, took place Thursday, unnamed church
sources told Luanda's Radio Eclesia.
	   Another church source, Father Miguel Botachim, told the radio
that UNITA and government forces were clashing in neighboring Uige
province.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports.
	   They come amid signs of increasing hostility between the former
foes, who signed a 1994 peace accord to end a two-decade civil war
that broke out when Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   The government has threatened to push UNITA out of the areas the
former rebels still hold, and has severed all contact with UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ accuses the government of human rights abuses against UNITA
supporters in areas already handed over.
	   Botachim also told Radio Eclesia that nine church workers _ six
Italians, two Angolans and a Portuguese priest _ who were thought
to be missing were in Uige province.

Carlsberg pretax profit up 26 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The Danish brewery group Carlsberg on
Monday reported a 26-percent rise in pretax profit to 2.2 billion
Danish kroner (dlrs 247 million).
	   Sales rose 51 percent to 29.3 billion (dlrs 4.6 billion), but
net income for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 dropped 78 million
(dlrs 12.2 million) to 423 million kroner (dlrs 66 million).
	   The sharp jump in turnover was due to Carlsberg's purchase of
Finnish brewer Sinebrychoff. Also, its British operations,
Carlsberg-Tetley Brewing Ltd., now are fully consolidated in the
income statement versus only 50 percent consolidation last year.
	   The group ranks among the top ten brewing companies in the
world.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ He called himself the ``Serb
Adolf,'' and his crimes were as chilling as his nickname.
	   In a trial that opened Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, U.N. prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge
panel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most
serious offense.
	   The 30-year-old Bosnian Serb, a former mechanic, confessed in
October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing
many observers by reversing his earlier declarations of innocence.
	   Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war
crimes and crimes against humanity _ and the likelihood of a
maximum life sentence _ Jelisic has denied that the killing spree
constituted genocide.
	   His trial opened with a court official reading brief excerpts
from a psychological report on Jelisic in which psychologists ruled
that he was mentally fit to stand trial. They added, however, that
he suffered ``a borderline personality disorder with antisocial and
narcissistic tendencies.''
	   Jelisic, wearing a striped sweater and black jeans, brought a
laptop computer into court with him. He listened calmly as the
psychological report was read.

Belarusian ex-agriculture official tried on corruption charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIROVSK, Belarus (AP) _ A former agricultural official who had
publicly clashed with Belarus' authoritarian president went on
trial Monday on charges of corruption and illegal weapons
possession.
	   Vasily Starovoitov, former head of the Rassvet collective farm,
was arrested in November 1997 along with former Agriculture
Minister Vasily Leonov.
	   Starovoitov, 75, has suffered two mini-strokes in pre-trial
detention, where he has remained since the arrest despite lawyers'
pleas for his release.
	   His trial opened Monday in Kirovsk, a town 150 kilometers east
of the capital, Minsk. He is charged with 12 counts of
embezzlement, bribery, illegal weapons possession and other
offenses.
	   Defense lawyer Garry Pogonyailo said the court appeared to be
favoring the prosecution. Courts in this former Soviet republic are
generally loyal to _ and carefully monitored by _ President
Alexander Lukashenko's government.
	   ``The beginning of the trial shows that the court has a
clear-cut program that coincides with the indictment,'' Pogonyailo
said. ``The trial is likely to be a quick one, and a verdict will
be passed promptly.''
	   If convicted, he faces from 7 to 12 years in prison.
	   Starovoitov, a World War II veteran, has been awarded some of
the Soviet Union's highest honors _ two medals of the Great
Patriotic War and three orders of Lenin. He was twice named Hero of
Socialist Labor.
	   Starovoitov pled ``partially'' guilty to the weapons charge, and
innocent to all the rest.
	   Before his arrest, Starovoitov had clashed publicly with
Lukashenko, who headed a collective farm in Soviet times.
	   Lukashenko, who has shown little tolerance to dissent since
becoming president, has denied that the arrest was politically
motivated and stated he had evidence implicating Starovoitov in
corruption. But none has been released.

Mass grave with more than 25 bodies unearthed in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The human rights arm of an Iraqi opposition
group said Monday that a farmer had unearthed a mass grave
containing remains of more than 25 bodies in eastern Iraq.
	   The Center for Human Rights, affiliated with a party opposed to
President Saddam Hussein's rule, said the mass grave was discovered
Oct. 15 in the Diyala province, 60 kilometers (40 miles) northeast
of Baghdad.
	   The group, affiliated with the London-based Iraqi Communist
Party said that Jubeir Abdullah Alaywi was arrested shortly after
finding the grave while digging near his farm. It said his family
was unaware of his whereabouts.
	   The group did not say who was behind the killings, but blamed
Saddam's regime for creating a climate of terror.
	   ``We once again call on the U.N. human rights organizations to
take urgent steps to put an immediate halt to the continuing mass
terror,'' the group said in a statement faxed to The Associated
Press in Cairo.
	   The statement also said that four Iraqi political prisoners,
including two officers, were executed in Nov. 12 in the Badoush
prison in Mosul, 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Baghdad. It
said the officers executed were Maj. Mehdi Saleh Rakan and Capt.
Omar Taha Salem.
	   Iraq has been systematically executing political prisoners, some
of whom have been in detention since the abortive uprising of the
Shiite Muslim southern towns after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   In April, the U.N. human rights commissioner for Iraq, former
Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, said Iraq may have
executed as many as 1,500 people last year.

Head of Kosovo verifiers says mission in place around Jan. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief of an international team
of peace verifiers said Monday his mission will be ready to operate
in troubled Kosovo province by around Jan. 1.
	   William Walker, head of the verifiers, spoke after meeting with
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova amid continuing diplomatic
efforts to arrange a political settlement for the future of the
secessionist Albanian-majority province of Serbia.
	   Under the terms of an Oct. 12 U.S.-brokered peace deal, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to allow as many as 2,000
unarmed monitors into Kosovo. They are charged with keeping track
of the status of Milosevic's promises, including a military
withdrawal and working toward a political settlement.
	   But the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is overseeing the verification force, has found it difficult
to move swiftly in getting its largest-ever operation off the
ground.
	   International officials have voiced concern that further delays
could jeopardize Kosovo's fragile peace.
	   ``Bringing 2,000 people in from 54 countries is not an easy
function,'' Walker told reporters in the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   ``We will be up and operational in a very robust fashion within
the next few weeks,'' he said.
	   A political settlement must come before the OSCE can proceed
with another of its tasks, organizing local elections in Kosovo, he
said.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between Serb
authorities and the ethnic Albanians who form more than 90 percent
of Kosovo's population, is expected back in the province this week
with revisions to a U.S. draft settlement. He said last week that
it's urgent an agreement be reached by spring, when many fear
hostilities will break out again.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 uprooted
from their homes during a nearly eight-month crackdown by Serb
forces against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Sporadic violence has continued since the agreement, but the
cease-fire has generally held.

Projection for 2025: Palestinian population of 7.4 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinian population in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip is expected to nearly triple in the next
generation, from 2.6 million today to 7.41 million in 2025,
according to census projections released Monday.
	   The estimate is conservative, based on a 50 percent drop in the
birth rate and the assumption that only half a million Palestinian
exiles will return from abroad, said Hassan Abu Libdeh, the head of
the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics.
	   Demographics have always been an important element of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The latest population figures will
likely affect the negotiations between the two sides on a permanent
peace agreement that are now getting under way. On the agenda are
issues such as final borders, the future of Palestinian refugees
and the status of disputed Jerusalem.
	   The population projection was released during a news conference
Monday on the final and official results of the first Palestinian
census conducted last year in the West Bank, Gaza and traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem.
	   According to the estimates, a little over 4.4 million
Palestinians will live in the West Bank in 2025 and slightly more
than 2.9 million in the Gaza Strip.
	   Today, 1.6 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and 1.02
million in Gaza, according to the figures of the first Palestinian
census. In addition, there are an estimated 210,000 Palestinians in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The average family size in the Palestinian territories is 6.4.

Palestinian police arrest militant suspected of ordering car bomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence agents have
arrested a member of the Islamic Jihad group on suspicion that he
ordered a November car bombing in a Jerusalem market, an Islamic
Jihad leader said Monday.
	   The suspected mastermind, Iyad Hardan, 22, was arrested last
week during a raid on a relative's home in the West Bank town of
Jenin, said the Islamic Jihad leader, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Palestinian officials would not comment on the arrest.
	   Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the Nov. 6 bombing
in Jerusalem's outdoor Mahane Yehuda market. The attack killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israeli soldiers.
	   Israel radio said Monday that Palestinian police also arrested
two members of the Islamic militant group Hamas who were on a list
of suspected militants sought by Israel.
	   Security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians was a
key Israeli demand in the Wye River land-for-security agreement.
The Palestinian Authority agreed to take tougher measures against
the militants.

Tiger Woods meets Mandela before Sun City golf

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Tiger Woods arrived in South
Africa Monday for the Million Dollar Challenge at Sun City, and his
first stop was the house of President Nelson Mandela.
	   ``It's a great honor not only to me but also to South Africa
that we have been visited by such a prominent sportsman,'' Mandela
said as the two posed for pictures at the president's residence
here.
	   The participation of the 22-year-old star in the Sun City event
has aroused great interest in South Africa, where golf has a strong
following.
	   Woods said England's Lee Westwood, giving recent victories on
the tour, was the man to beat in the 12-man field.
	   ``The only reason I came down here was to win,'' Woods said.
	   He left holding a copy of Mandela's biography, ``Long Walk to
Freedom.''
	   The Million Dollar Challenge runs from Thursday through Sunday.
The field includes David Duval, Tom Watson, Mark O'Meara and local
favorite Ernie Els.

Qatar to hold municipal elections in March
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar will hold its first elections on March
8, according to a decree issued Monday by the emir, Sheik Hamad bin
Khalifa Al Thani.
	   The decree was reported by the official Qatar News Agency.
	   The Interior Ministry had said earlier that the municipal
elections would be held in February. The news agency did not say
why the date was pushed back.
	   The elections will be for a 29-member Municipal Council, which
Sheik Hamad has said will be the first step to an elected
legislature early in the next century.
	   Qatar now has an advisory council appointed by the emir, but it
lacks legislative powers.
	   Even the new municipal council will be advisory, and its
resolutions will be non-binding.
	   In the conservative Gulf, only Kuwait has an elected Parliament,
though women there are not eligible to vote or run for office.
	   In Qatar, both men and women will be allowed to vote and to run
for a council seat.
	   Still, only about 20,000 of Qatar's 150,000 citizens will be
eligible to cast ballots. The law excludes Qataris who are members
of the army and police forces and those who have been citizens for
less than 15 years.
	   Qatar's total population is about 600,000, including some
450,000 foreigners, most of them laborers from the Indian
subcontinent.
	   Qatar, a small emirate on the eastern side of the Arabian
Peninsula, has not allowed popular participation in decision-making
since its independence from Britain in 1971. Before coming under
British occupation, the country was a largely populated by tribes
and nomads.
	   Sheik Hamad, who seized power from his father in a bloodless
palace coup in 1995, has been taking steps to liberalize this
energy-rich country.
	   In the last three years, he has introduced a provisional
constitution and lifted press censorship.

French banks support government initiatives for Holocaust victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French banking community said Monday it
strongly supported new government initiatives to investigate
restitution claims from heirs and descendants of Jews whose
property was seized during World War II.
	   The Association of French Banks said in a statement the measures
announced Saturday by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin represented a
``crucial and very positive development in identifying stolen or
dormant assets and returning them to their original owners or their
successors.''
	   French banks are under growing pressure after being sued last
year by a group of Holocaust survivors living in the United States
seeking to recover their families' assets.
	   Jospin told Jewish leaders that France will create a centralized
body to accelerate the investigation of individual restitution
claims from heirs and descendants.
	   He said the government would put an additional 10 million francs
(dlrs 1.75 million) to boost staff working on examining the claims,
and that the probe would be completed by the end of 1999.
	   The bankers' association said it had long sought such a
framework, and emphasized their commitment to bringing to light all
facts ''relating to bank assets of the victims of the Occupation.''
	   Untold millions of dollars worth of assets are thought to be in
the possession of French banks, state-controlled deposit agencies
and insurance companies.
	   The association also said it had submitted studies of their
archives -- including dormant accounts and unclaimed safe deposit
boxes -- to the government-appointed Matteoli commission of experts
studying the widespread, systematic looting of Jewish property
during the war.
	   The association also said the commissions' results should be
made public.

HIV, AIDS cases rise dramatically in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The number of HIV infections registered in
Ukraine is continuing to soar, reaching 22,494 to date _ up from
18,500 in mid-1997, officials said Monday.
	   Of those who have tested positive for HIV since the early 1990s,
649 people including 50 children have developed full-blown AIDS and
279 of them have died, including 24 children, said Deputy Health
Minister Raisa Bohatyrova.
	   She said the number of HIV cases registered in Ukraine, a nation
of 50 million people, is higher than that in all other former
Soviet republics together, including Russia.
	   Eighty percent of HIV cases involved intravenous drug users. The
impoverished eastern coal-mining region of Donetsk led with 5,007
cases, followed by the southern Dnipropetrovsk and Odessa regions,
health officials said.
	   Bohatyrova said the country's health system needed up to 15
million hryvna (dlrs 4.3 million) a year to treat AIDS victims,
while the cash-poor government has been allocating one-tenth of the
required amount.

Projection for 2025: Palestinian population of 7.4 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinian &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Palestinian population in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip is expected to nearly triple in the next
generation, from 2.6 million today to 7.41 million in 2025,
according to census projections released Monday.
	   The estimate is conservative, based on a 50 percent drop in the
birth rate and the assumption that only half a million Palestinian
exiles will return from abroad, said Hassan Abu Libdeh, the head of
the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics.
	   Demographics have always been an important element of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The latest population figures will
likely affect the negotiations between the two sides on a permanent
peace agreement that are now getting under way. On the agenda are
issues such as final borders, the future of Palestinian refugees
and the status of disputed Jerusalem.
	   The population projection was released Monday during a news
conference on the final and official results of the first
Palestinian census conducted last year in the West Bank, Gaza and
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   According to the estimates, a little over 4.4 million
Palestinians will live in the West Bank in 2025 and slightly more
than 2.9 million in the Gaza Strip.
	   Today, 1.6 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and 1.02
million in Gaza, according to the figures of the first Palestinian
census. In addition, there are an estimated 210,000 Palestinians in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The average family size in the Palestinian territories is 6.4.

Head of Kosovo verifiers says mission in place around Jan. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A mission of international peace
verifiers will be ready to operate in troubled Kosovo province by
around Jan. 1, the team chief said Monday.
	   William Walker, head of the verifiers, spoke after meeting with
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova amid continuing diplomatic
efforts to arrange a political settlement for the future of the
secessionist Albanian-majority province of Serbia.
	   Under the terms of an Oct. 12 U.S.-brokered peace deal, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to let as many as 2,000 unarmed
monitors into Kosovo. They are charged with keeping track of the
status of Milosevic's promises, including a military withdrawal and
working toward a political settlement.
	   But the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which is overseeing the verification force, has found it difficult
to move swiftly in getting its largest-ever operation off the
ground.
	   International officials have voiced concern that further delays
could jeopardize Kosovo's fragile peace.
	   ``Bringing 2,000 people in from 54 countries is not an easy
function,'' Walker told reporters in the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   ``We will be up and operational in a very robust fashion within
the next few weeks,'' he said.
	   A political settlement must come before the OSCE can proceed
with another of its tasks, organizing local elections in Kosovo, he
said.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between Serb
authorities and the ethnic Albanians who form more than 90 percent
of Kosovo's population, is expected back in the province this week
with revisions to a U.S. draft settlement. He said last week that
it's urgent an agreement be reached by spring, when many fear
hostilities will break out again.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 uprooted
from their homes during a nearly eight-month crackdown by Serb
forces against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Sporadic violence has continued since the agreement, but the
cease-fire has generally held.

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence agents have
arrested a member of the Islamic Jihad group on suspicion that he
ordered a November car bombing in a Jerusalem market, an Islamic
Jihad leader said Monday.
	   The suspected mastermind, Iyad Hardan, 22, was arrested last
week during a raid of the home of a relative in the West Bank town
of Jenin, said the Islamic Jihad leader who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Palestinian officials would not comment on the arrest.
	   Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the Nov. 6 bombing
in Jerusalem's outdoor Mahane Yehuda market. The attack killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israeli shoppers.
	   Israel radio said Monday that Palestinian police also arrested
two members of the Islamic militant group Hamas who were on a list
of suspected militants sought by Israel.
	   Security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians was a
key Israeli demand in the Wye River land-for-security agreement.
The Palestinian Authority agreed to take tougher measures against
the militants.

Iran: Omani military officials to take part as observers in naval
</HEADLINE>
maneuvers

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Military officials from Oman will take part
as observers in this week's Iranian naval exercises, the head of
Iran's navy said Monday.
	   Some 50,000 troops are to take part in the five-day war games
which are due to start Thursday, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   Qatar's participation in the exercises would boost ``cooperation
among the Islamic countries of the region with an aim to create
mutual understanding among them,'' said Rear-Adm. Ali Akbar
Ahmadian.
	   He said the maneuvers, code-named Unity 77, will take place in
an area extending from the central Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and
into the Gulf of Oman.
	   Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises
with Gulf states which are allies of the United States. But so far,
no Gulf country has agreed to take part because of Tehran's
insistence that U.S. warships leave the region.
	   IRNA quoted Isa Galverdi, a commander of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps, as saying that the guards as well as
the army and air force will participate in the exercises.
	   ``In these exercises, 160 naval vessels and 120 aircraft will
take part, and the latter will conduct 350 sorties,'' Galverdi
said.
	   He said the war games will involve missile-launching units of
the Revolutionary Guards and mock ``electronic warfare will be
carried out over a wide area.''
	   Among the maneuvers' goals will be assessing Iran's defense
against chemical, biological and nuclear attacks, IRNA said.
	   Iran concluded military exercises involving some 200,000 troops
on its border with Afghanistan earlier this month after
Afghanistan's Taliban militia killed eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

German experts arrive in Yemen for bombing investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three German experts arrived here Monday to
try to determine whether a car bomb that exploded near the German
Embassy last week had targeted the compound.
	   A German Embassy official told The Associated Press that the
experts would work with Yemeni investigators. He said preliminary
findings did not indicate that the embassy was the target. The
diplomat spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Nov. 24 car bomb killed two policemen and a young boy.
	   The Yemen Interior Ministry said its preliminary investigation
indicated that the target was Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh, a tribal
chief whose house is next to the embassy.
	   The sheik has accused Saudi Arabia of being behind the bombing,
charging that he was targeted because he sided with Yemen in a
border dispute. He is the tribal leader of Waella, a disputed area
on the border.
	   There has been no response from Saudi Arabia to the allegation.
	   Police have said they are holding three people in connection
with the incident.

Illegal immigrants launch hunger strike to spotlight their plight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ About 80 illegal immigrants
launched a hunger strike Monday in a last-ditch attempt to
spotlight their plight and pressure Dutch officials to grant them
residency permits.
	   Protesters, camping out in a Catholic church, said they would
continue their hunger strike until the government comes up with a
solution.
	   ``They've tried everything else, petitions and demonstrations,''
said their spokeswoman Marijke Bijl. ``No one in the government
dares to take the responsibility.''
	   She said the number of hunger strike participants was expected
to swell to 100.
	   In 1997, the government scrapped a five-year policy of amnesty
that had let illegal immigrants stay if they could prove they
worked legally and paid taxes for six consecutive years.
	   Those protesting Monday missed their opportunity, and in any
case, many of them could not prove they have worked for six years,
said Justice Ministry spokesman Victor Holtus.
	   Clemency was unlikely, he added.
	   ``We're very sorry for them, but they don't qualify,'' he said.
	   Bijl conceded that protesters, mostly Turkish and and Moroccan
nationals, have held erratic and seasonal agricultural jobs and
could not meet the government's burden of proof.
	   In recent years, the Netherlands' immigration and asylum
policies have been repeatedly plagued by controversies.
	   Many dilemmas have sprung up as the number of asylum
applications surges and long-term illegal immigrants clamor for
permission to stay in the country.

Canadian Catholic Brother killed in Haiti
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A Canadian man who ran a Roman
Catholic school in a Haitian town was hacked to death with a
machete, a bishop said Monday. There were no immediate arrests.
	   Brother Bernardin Hudon, 62, was killed Friday night at his home
in La Vallee, 45 miles (70 kilometers) southwest of Port-au-Prince,
said Monsignor Guire Poulard, bishop of Jacmel.
	   Hudon, who was from the Canadian province of Quebec, headed a
Brothers of Christian Education religious school in La Vallee. His
Canadian hometown wasn't immediately known.
	   Police investigating the slaying said they had no immediate
suspects or motive.
	   Haiti's inexperienced police force, which is being tutored by
U.N. civilian advisers, is trying to cope with a recent surge of
violence in the capital, Port-au-Prince.

Sports minister declares soccer constitution, authorities illegal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In a continuing war between the government
and national soccer authorities, the sports minister on Monday
accused the federation's board of illegally changing its
constitution and of mismanagement of dlrs 294,000 in equipment.
	   Jacek Debski said the soccer authorities broke their own
regulations during 1995 and 1997 congresses by allowing
unauthorized delegates to take part and vote. He argues that the
amendments made at those meetings and the 1995 election of
federation's authorities were against the law.
	   The Polish Soccer Union has 14 days to appeal to the Sports
Ministry. If the decision is upheld, Debski will be able to suspend
the soccer authorities and will ask a court to appoint a curator, a
state official to run the association.
	   At a news conference, Debski also said his controllers revealed
acts of a ``criminal nature'' during an audit he ordered at the
federation earlier this year over suspected mismanagement and
corruption.
	   He said that equipment worth over 1 million zlotys (dlrs
294,000) bought from Nike in 1997 was missing from the federation's
warehouse. Documents for earlier years had been burned, according
to Debski.
	   He promised to inform prosecutors investigating soccer union's
alleged mismanagement.
	   Debski's war against the federation began in May, when soccer
authorities refused to allow government controllers look into the
federation's books. The federation leaders claimed they were
independent of the government review.
	   Debski then suspended the entire federation leadership,
including its president Marian Dziurowicz. He reinstated them on
Aug. 8 to avoid a FIFA suspension of Polish teams from
international competition, but only after the federation agreed to
let state controllers examine its books and records.
	   Poland's national team has failed to qualify for the World Cup
since 1982. Debski blames soccer officials for the general decline
of the sports.

Pope pushes for better relations with Orthodox
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II pushed Monday for better
relations with Orthodox Christians, declaring the need for
Catholics and Orthodox to overcome their differences.
	   The pope sent a message to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I,
spiritual leader of the world's 300 million Christian Orthodox, for
the feast day of St. Andrew, who founded the church in
Constantinople.
	   A Vatican delegation is also visiting Istanbul, the seat of the
patriarch, for the occasion. It is led by American Cardinal William
H. Keeler, who has worked to strengthen ties between the two
churches.
	   Relations have been strained in recent years in Russia and other
Orthodox strongholds, where Roman Catholic clergy have been accused
of proselytism.

	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence agents have
arrested a member of the Islamic Jihad group on suspicion that he
ordered a November car bombing in a Jerusalem market, an Islamic
Jihad leader said Monday.
	   The suspected mastermind, Iyad Hardan, 22, was arrested last
week during a raid on a relative's home in the West Bank town of
Jenin, said the Islamic Jihad leader who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Palestinian officials would not comment on the arrest.
	   Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the Nov. 6 bombing
in Jerusalem's outdoor Mahane Yehuda market. The attack killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israeli shoppers.

anti-democratic parties &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A wide front of political parties
reached agreement Monday to back a bill that aims to cut subsidies
to anti-democratic parties, following weeks of haggling over how to
deny public funds to the extreme right-wing Vlaams Blok.
	   The parliamentary leaders of the center-right coalition, the
green parties and the francophone Conservatives opposition parties
agreed on a proposal to let an administrative court, which includes
the chairmen of Belgium's two highest courts, decide whether
parties meet democratic standards worthy of public support.
	   After the parties reached a consensus, the proposal goes to a
parliamentary commission for further assessment before the House of
Representatives can vote on it.
	   The agreement came after changes to an initial project, which
some parties considered far too general to survive a court
challenge.
	   The Vlaams Blok has made major advances in Dutch-speaking
Flanders during the 1990s. It won 12.2 percent of the Flemish vote
in 1995 with an anti-immigrant, Flemish nationalist program and is
a hot issue of debate again ahead of next June's elections.

Four killed in gunbattle on main Kashmir highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ A 10-hour gun battle raged near the only
highway linking the Kashmir Valley with the rest of India Monday.
Police said three separatist guerrillas and an army soldier were
killed in the battle.
	   In two other incidents Monday, a total of six more militants and
another soldier were killed, police said.
	   Clashes between guerrillas and police or army troops are a daily
occurrence in Kashmir, but the battle along the highway was unusual
for its location and duration.
	   Gunfire rattled across the road near Banihal, a town 190
kilometers (120 miles) north of Jammu, the winter capital of the
Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir. The road is the overland link with
Srinagar, the state's summer capital and the center of the
separatist insurrection that began in 1989.
	   ``It was a fierce gun battle. Mortars were used, and the house
in which the militants were hiding was gutted in the exchange of
fire,'' said Kuldeep Khuda, the inspector general of police.
	   The separatists seek to splinter the Muslim-majority area away
from India, which is predominantly Hindu, and demand the choice of
independence or union with officially Islamic Pakistan. More than
15,000 people have been killed in the last nine years.

Portugal and Spain reach agreement on common water supplies

<TEXT>
	   ALBUFEIRA, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal and Spain on Monday reached
an agreement over shared water resources on the Iberian peninsula,
wrapping up a two-day summit that both premiers called historic.
	   ``It is an ambitious, modern, wide-ranging and efficient
agreement,'' Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said at the
end of the summit in Albufeira, about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
south of Lisbon.
	   Both governments worked out a shared management plan to monitor
water volume in the rivers which supply both countries.
	   Spanish Premier Jose Maria Aznar said the agreement reflected
``an exceptional moment'' of relations between the two Iberian
countries.
	   Water supply on the southwest European peninsula was one of the
few sticking points between the two countries, which have strong
trade links and close political ties.
	   Spanish plans to develop hydroelectric projects on its side of
the border have been a constant threat to Portugal's supply, which
comes mainly from rivers with sources in the neighboring country.
	   Both governments also reiterated their decision jointly to
campaign for continued development funds provided by wealthier
European Union nations.
	   Cabinet Members also agreed to build new road and railway links
between the two countries.
	   The Albufeira summit also produced a plan to increase
cooperation between police at the border, in order to curb illegal
immigration and drug trafficking.

EU group lists 85 ``potentially harmful'' corporate tax havens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union experts tracking
corporate tax havens have identified 85 measures used by EU member
nations that may violate the Union's new code of conduct on
business taxation.
	   In an interim report to be presented at an EU finance ministers
meeting here Tuesday, the Code of Conduct Group lists the
``potentially harmful'' tax breaks that span all 15 of the EU
member nations except Austria.
	   France and Britain tie for the highest number of questionable
items at 10 apiece, while the Netherlands and Portugal each have
nine, followed by eight for Spain.
	   Tiny Luxembourg, known for its friendly approach to foreign
investment, racks up six potential code of conduct violations, the
same for Greece.
	   The Code of Conducts Group's opinions aren't legally binding,
but EU member states have made a political pledge to honor the
code, which seeks above all to prevent nations poaching investment
from their neighbors by offering favorable tax rates to foreign
companies.
	   The group is made up of senior treasury officials from the EU
nations and headed by Dawn Primarolo, financial secretary to
Britain's Treasury. It aims to pass final judgments on questionable
measures by November 1999.
	   Notable items on the initial roster include a three different
tax breaks for companies doing business in the British territory of
Gibraltar; special regimes for company ``coordination centers'' and
``distribution centers'' in Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg; and the
International Financial Services Center In Dublin, Ireland.
	   The tax code of conduct is one of a number of contentious tax
issues currently under debate at the EU, including plans to
introduce a minimum 20 percent savings tax and an energy tax on oil
and coal.
	   Diplomats are seeking to play down reports of a rift in EU ranks
over suggestions that the new Germany government is seeking to
introduce harmonized corporate tax rates across the bloc.
	   The tax break report stresses that inclusion on the list does
not assume a measure will be judged definitely unfair.
	   Ireland's successful luring of foreign investment through tax
breaks in specific centers has drawn stiff criticism from its EU
partners, notably France and Germany.
	   The group's report notes that participating companies in
Dublin's Financial Services Center benefit from a 10 percent
corporate income tax rate, compared to the standard 32 percent
Irish levy.

Pilgrims travel to northern Cyprus, protesters blocked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Nearly 1,300 Greek Cypriot pilgrims were
allowed to cross into northern Cyprus on Monday to pray at the
Monastery of St. Andrew on the saint's feast day.
	   But scores of other people _ including a delegation of Greek and
Greek Cypriot lawyers _ were not allowed to pass the U.N.
checkpoint because they refused to ask for permission from the
Turkish Cypriot regime in the north, as the pilgrims had done.
	   The island has been divided since Turkish troops invaded the
north in 1975 to protect the Turkish Cypriot community after a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized
only by Ankara, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Greek Cypriots are not allowed to travel to the north except on
a few religious holidays, and then only after their applications
are vetted.
	   Among those not allowed to cross at the U.N. checkpoint on the
dividing line was a group of a dozen elderly Greek Cypriot women.
	   Most wore widows black and carried photographs of loved ones
missing since the invasion. U.N. troops blocked their advance into
the buffer zone.
	   The women said they wanted to be allowed to return to their
homes in the north and to visit the monastery to pray to St. Andrew
for help in tracing their missing relatives.
	   George Ignatiades, the chairman of the Bar Association of North
Greece, said the U.N. troops stopped the lawyers from crossing the
buffer zone.
	   ``They told us the Turkish side had informed them we would not
be allowed to proceed further,'' he said.
	   Ignatiades and the women said they would submit separate
complaints to the European Court of Human Rights for being denied
entry to the north.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank,
announced Monday that it will acquire Bankers Trust Corp. in a 10.1
billion deal that will create the world's largest financial
institution.
	   The deal is part of Deutsche Bank's strategy to expand in the
United States, and to ensure the merger's success Deutsche Bank has
dedicated dlrs 400 million to retain top staff from both banks for
an unspecified period.
	   The acquisition of Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest bank in the
United States, is the largest ever takeover of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank, creating an institution with assets
of more than dlrs 800 billion. That surpasses UBS AG of
Switzerland, currently the largest bank, and the recently formed
Citigroup Inc.
	   The boards of both banks approved the offer Sunday, and the
merger is to be completed by May.
	   Top executives and bankers will be offered either lump payments
or raises to discourage them from defecting, a common result of
mergers, Deutsche Bank spokesman Ronald Weichert said.
	   Weichert dismissed as ``illusory, unrealistic and wrong''
reports that top employees would get dlrs 10 million each, but
declined to provide a figure on the size of individual payments.
	   The merger should result in cost synergies, or areas where
duplication of services will allow cuts, of about 1.7 billion marks
(dlrs 1 billion) by the year 2001.
	   Deutsche Bank Chairman Rolf Breuer warned of job losses _ 5,500
positions _ at a news conference in Frankfurt. The cuts will be
mainly in London and New York, and will affect employees from both
banks.
	   Deutsche Bank said the deal would be financed partly with a 4
billion mark (dlrs 2.35 billion) capital increase, and a one-time
1.7 billion mark (dlrs 1 billion) restructuring charge for
personnel. The dlrs 400 million retention payments were part of the
overall cost of the deal, Weichert said.
	   The restructuring charge will affect Deutsche Bank's earnings,
but Breuer did not say in which quarter the charge would be made.
	   Deutsche Bank acknowledged that the deal was worth more than
Bankers Trust's assets, and said that it would make annual goodwill
payments of 630 million marks (dlrs 370 million) over 15 years.
	   The merger is part of Deutsche Bank's strategy to extend
operations into North America. But responding to analyst and market
concerns that the bank would lose focus on Europe, Deutsche Bank
said that it plans to expand its European asset management and
custody business.
	   Both Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are in the midst of
individual restructuring efforts aimed at cutting costs. Deutsche
Bank announced early this year a 2.5 billion mark (dlrs 1.5
billion) restructuring, while Bankers Trust announced a dlrs 300
million restructuring effort at the end of the third quarter.
	   Frank Newman, head of Bankers Trust, and Josef Ackermann,
Deutsche Bank board member, will co-lead the new bank's global
corporate and investment activities.
	   The merger must obtain approval of both New York state and U.S.
federal banking regulators.

Minor accident contaminates 30 and authorities cry `foul-up'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 30 workers at a French nuclear reactor were
slightly contaminated during an accident last week that authorities
said Monday should have prompted an immediate evacuation.
	   The approximately 80 workers present at the Golfech nuclear
plant in the Tarn-et-Garonne region were evacuated more than three
hours after the accident on Friday.
	   The accident was classed as ``zero'' on an international scale
that measures the seriousness of nuclear accidents.
	   But Andre-Claude Lacoste, head of the Direction for Security of
Nuclear Installations, ordered an investigation, the television
news channel LCI reported.
	   According to authorities, traces of Cobalt 60 were measured at
2,000 becquerels on one person. The figure corresponds to .4
percent of the annual limit acceptable for workers, according to
Lacoste's organization and the Office for Protection Against
Ionizing Rays.
	   Contamination measured on two other people amounted to several
hundred becquerels, while 30 others had ``inferior but measurable
levels'' of contamination.
	   ``After such an incident, evacuation should have been
immediate,'' Lacoste was reported as saying by Le Monde newspaper.
	   An alarm went off at 1:15 p.m. and workers were evacuated at
4:30 p.m., the officials said.
	   The accident occurred during an operation on the cover of the
main container of reactor No. 2, closed for maintenance since Nov.
14.
	   Some 80 percent of France's electricity is generated by nuclear
reactors.

Autopsy determines Chrysler executive died of heart attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ An autopsy
determined that Chrysler Canada President William Glaub died last
week of a heart attack, a U.S. Virgin Islands medical examiner said
Monday.
	   Glaub, 49, died Thursday while on vacation in St. Thomas. There
had been conflicting reports on how he died, with police saying he
may have drowned and others saying it was a heart attack.
	   ``There was nothing to indicate a drowning,'' said Francisco
Landron, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy Monday.
	   Glaub was named president and chief executive of Canada's
third-largest carmaker in April after his predecessor, Yves Landry,
died March 15 of a heart attack.
	   The Chicago-born Glaub joined Chrysler Corp. in 1971 and held a
number of executive posts with the U.S. company. He went to the
Canadian company in Windsor, Ontario, from Rochester Hills,
Michigan.

Club admits manager kept in dark in Ferguson transfer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Walter Smith's future as manager of
Everton remained uncertain Monday as the fallout continued over the
sale of striker Duncan Ferguson to Newcastle.
	   With British newspapers reporting that Smith was poised to
resign, club chairman Peter Johnson issued a statement expressing
regret that the manager had been kept in the dark about Ferguson's
transfer.
	   Smith wasn't informed about the 8-million-pound (dlrs 12.8
million) deal until after it was completed last Monday night.
	   ``A substantial offer for Ferguson was received from Newcastle
which was discussed with that club's representatives immediately
before and during the course of last Monday's game'' between the
two sides, the statement said. ``Their discussions resulted in an
agreement being reached at the time.
	   ``Unfortunately, details of these discussions were not passed to
Walter Smith during the course of the game and it is regretted that
he learned of the final agreement reached regarding Duncan Ferguson
in the manner he did subsequent to the conclusion of the match.''
	   Johnson, who is believed to be trying to find a buyer for his 60
percent stake in the club, stopped short of apologizing to Smith.
It wasn't clear whether the wording would be enough to placate the
manager.
	   Ferguson, a Scottish striker, was Everton's most talented and
popular player. He scored two goals in his debut for Newcastle in
the Magpies' 3-1 win Saturday over Wimbledon.
	   Former Everton manager Mike Walker jumped to Smith's defense,
saying his treatment by the club had been ``diabolical'' and a
``disgrace.''
	   ``It undermines the confidence of people who don't know what is
coming next,'' he said. ``Are they buying someone, are they selling
someone?
	   ``If at the end of the day you know you need some financial
stability, at least talk it through with the manager first, he may
not agree with you but at least he knows what's happening and he
has to make a decision.
	   ``If he doesn't like it, well resign, whatever he wants to do.
But just to sell someone off the cuff, well that's diabolical.''

EU agriculture chief tells farmers they have no choice but accept
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler told European farmers Monday if they want to preserve
their sector they must accept the drastic reforms in farm spending
he has put forward.
	   He said it was imperative for EU farmers to stop adding to
stocks of surplus food that subsidies have made so costly it cannot
be sold on world markets, said Fischler.
	   ``If we want agriculture in Europe to have a future we must make
sure it can be more competitive,'' he told the association of EU
farmers, the most powerful lobby in Brussels and one resisting the
changes Fischler is seeking.
	   Yet Fischler said those reforms, he said, would prevent the EU
farm sector from becoming the sort of heartless industry seen in
the United States ``which is concerned only with producing as
cheaply as possible per hectare or per livestock unit.''
	   His proposal for deep cuts in subsidies as of 2000, compensated
by direct aid to regions in decline and farmers are to keep costs
down as the EU prepares to take in a dozen newcomers in the decade
ahead.
	   Also, reform of EU farm spending _ which eats up half the EU's
1998 budget of dlrs 100 billion _ is to give the EU a reasonable
negotiating stance in agricultural talks in the World Trade
Organization next year.
	   The European Commission has proposed a 30 percent reduction for
beef subsidies, 20 percent for cereals and 15 percent for dairy
products.
	   Those cuts would be compensated by direct income support for
farmers.
	   The aim is to sever the link between subsidies and output that
long saddled the EU with food surpluses and soured trade ties with
Washington.
	   Fischler urged farmers to show ``Europe's agricultural sector is
indeed capable of carrying out these reforms.''
	   If not, he predicted the EU would have to take 20 percent of
cereal lands out of production, impose mass culls to curb beef
production and set ever stricter milk quotas _ along with fines for
quota violators.
	   Fischler unveiled his proposals last March. EU farmers and
several EU governments have given them an icy welcome.
	   Germany, which assumes the EU's rotating presidency in January,
has said it wants to conclude the farm reform negotiations by next
March to help smooth the entry of new EU members in the years
ahead.
	   The problem with surplus food stocks in Europe is that subsidies
have made the food so pricey it cannot be sold on the world market
where prices are lower. Traditionally, the EU then paid food
exporters the difference between the EU and world prices but those
``export subsidies'' have long been a source of dispute with
Washington which sees them as an unfair trade practice.

World Bank to give dlrs 200 million credit to Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ The World Bank announced Monday the
approval of a dlrs 200 million credit to Bangladesh to finance
recovery projects after three months of flooding devastated the
economy this summer.
	   The credit will come from the International Development
Association with a 40-year maturity, including a 10-year grace
period, and is expected to be disbursed by the end of the year.
	   The funds will provide help to farmers, finance food grain
imports, and help manufacturers whose supplies of raw materials
were damaged by floods that hit two-thirds of Bangladesh. It also
will pay to import construction materials to rebuild the damaged
infrastructure.
	   ``The way this project was put together is a good example of how
the new Bank is working to be more client responsive,'' said
Shekhar Shah, the World Bank team leader.

Interior Minister says seized arms possibly aimed for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying weapons destined for Kosovo, ten
people suspected, EDITS throughout to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A large stockpile of weapons seized by
Croatian police was destined for the troubled province of Kosovo,
police said Monday.
	   Marijan Tomurad, chief of police in Sibenik, was quoted by
state-run HINA news agency saying the weapons were destined for the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence of the
southern Serb province of Kosovo in neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   Tomurad said police uncovered the stockpile, worth up to one
million dollars, on Saturday. Several hundred mortars, rocket
launchers, anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, sniper rifles,
hand grenades, ammunition and more than a ton (about 2,200 pounds)
of explosives had been stashed in warehouses across southern port
town of Sibenik.
	   The arms were to be shipped from Sibenik to Durres port in
Albania, Tomurad said. Albania's mountainous border with Kosovo has
been known as a weapons smuggling route since fighting broke out in
the province seven months ago.
	   Five suspects, including four Bosnians and a Croatian national,
were arrested and will be charged with arms smuggling, illegal
possession of weapons and breaching customs, Penic said. Five other
suspects remain at large, one of them has been identified as a
27-year-old Kosovo Albanian. No further information on the suspects
was available.
	   Sibenik police said the weapons were smuggled into Croatia from
central Bosnia, hidden under packages of timber in trucks.
	   Croatian Interior Minister Ivan Penic said earlier the weapons
were linked to an organized crime ring. It was the largest weapons
smuggling operation discovered in Croatia, he said.

Illegal immigrants launch hunger strike to spotlight their plight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ About 80 illegal immigrants
launched a hunger strike Monday in a last-ditch attempt to pressure
Dutch officials to grant them residency permits.
	   Protesters, camping out in a Roman Catholic church, said they
would continue their hunger strike until the government comes up
with a solution.
	   ``They've tried everything else, petitions and demonstrations,''
said their spokeswoman Marijke Bijl. ``No one in the government
dares to take the responsibility.''
	   She said the number of hunger strike participants was expected
to swell to 100.
	   In 1997, the government scrapped a five-year amnesty policy that
had let illegal immigrants stay if they could prove they had worked
legally and paid taxes for six consecutive years.
	   Those protesting Monday missed their opportunity, and in any
case, many of them could not prove they have worked for the
required time, said Justice Ministry spokesman Victor Holtus.
	   Clemency was unlikely, he added.
	   ``We're very sorry for them, but they don't qualify,'' he said.
	   Bijl conceded that protesters, mostly Turkish and and Moroccan
citizens, have held erratic and seasonal agricultural jobs and
could not meet the government's burden of proof.
	   In recent years, the Netherlands' immigration and asylum
policies have been repeatedly plagued by controversies.
	   Many dilemmas have sprung up as the number of asylum
applications surges and long-term illegal immigrants clamor for
permission to stay in the country.

U.N. genocide trial opens for confessed Bosnian Serb killer

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ To his Muslim prisoners, Bosnian
Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of genocide'' who once bragged
that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee.''
	   Launching Jelisic's genocide trial Monday at the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the 30-year-old
mechanic used the nickname Adolf ``with a perverse pride in the
genocidal symbolism it represented.''
	   Jelisic pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and
Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko,
northern Bosnia, in May 1992.
	   By trying him for genocide, prosecutors will be able to call
evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the
involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give
survivors of his killing spree chance to tell their story in court.
	   Bowers told a three-judge tribunal panel that Jelisic admitted
in interviews with investigators to far more killings than the
dozen to which he has pleaded guilty.
	   Jelisic will be convicted of those murders and sentenced at the
end of his trial, which is expected to last well into 1999. He
faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   ``We will never be able to fix the exact number'' of victims,
Bowers said. ``But if we are to believe even a small percentage of
the totals which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victims certainly
number well over 100.''
	   As the trial began, judges were read excerpts of a psychological
report which stated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial
but suffered a ``borderline personality disorder.''
	   Wearing a striped sweater and black jeans, Jelisic brought a
laptop computer into court and took notes. When he wasn't writing,
Jelisic sat slightly slumped in his chair, his head still, looking
impassively around the courtroom.
	   Jelisic's campaign of murder stands out _ even at a tribunal set
up to deal exclusively with atrocities _ for its cold-bloodedness.
	   ``Once Goran Jelisic even declined assistance from a guard,
noting that he was still in `good form' even though he had killed
over 60 people,'' Bowers told judges, citing statements made by
witnesses due to testify later in the trial.
	   ``To victims in Brcko, the face of genocide was the face of
Goran Jelisic,'' he said.
	   Bowers told the judges that Jelisic, who held no official rank,
was released by Bosnian Serb authorities from jail, where he was
serving three years for fraud, and sent to Brcko to murder Muslims.
	   He told investigators that on his arrival in the town, which was
of strategic importance to Bosnian Serbs, he was given a list of
Muslim targets and ordered to kill as many as possible.
	   Jelisic, Bowers said, seemed to relish the task.
	   ``Witness testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic was
not a reluctant tool of the genocide who was being compelled by
Serb authorities to act against his will,'' the U.S. prosecutor
said.
	   ``Quite to the contrary, the testimony will firmly establish
that Goran Jelisic was an efficient and enthusiastic participant in
the genocide.''
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has convicted three Muslims, two
Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder,
rape and torture, but it has yet to register a genocide conviction.
	   An earlier genocide trial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian
Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a ruptured artery in his tribunal
cell.

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ Here at the scruffy Soweto Golf
Club, where shacks face the fairways and branches mark the holes
instead of flags, they are waiting for Tiger.
	   Tiger Woods arrived Monday in South Africa for the first time,
to play at the Million Dollar Open at Sun City Thursday through
Sunday.
	   The prospect of a part-black golf hero in the former land of
apartheid has excited the barefoot caddies, the would-be pros and
members of the black middle class who play here.
	   ``To have a mega-star coming here is an honor to South Africans.

not only whites who can prosper,'' he said.
	   Woods' arrival, like the current first-ever tour by the black
athletes of the West Indies team and the recent appointment of a
black man to head the rugby league, is a small morale boost for the
majority of this country's people, who still live in an economic
apartheid after the fall of white minority rule in 1994.

sports -- golf, rugby and cricket -- are mainly white, and attract
mostly white fans. Soccer is the sport of the majority.

in this wide-open country of sunny weather, even when they were

	   The club president, Mike Nompula, is striving to promote golf
among the youngsters of Soweto. There's always a group hanging
around the clubhouse, though Nompula chases them off during the day
when they should be in school. They can play afterwards, using
donated clubs. Dues are a paltry 150 rand (dlrs 25) a year.

week to play.

the fancier clubs in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Soweto has
about 200 members, a fifth of the number in the club's hey-day in
the mid-1980s.
	   Reality is never far away. One recent day, a man was gathering
wild spinach next to a fairway. Wild dogs wander on the course.
Residents regularly steal the flagpoles for curtain rods. The
course itself is pockmarked with barren patches. Clumps of
overgrown trees and underbrush crowd the fairways.
	   Nompula, 61, who as a boy used a wooden plank to flatten out
``greens'' in the sand of empty lots, is hoping for a visit from
Woods. ``Everyone is talking about Tiger. Now let him come here,''
he said.
	   The prospect is unlikely. After meeting with President Nelson
Mandela Monday, Woods said he wouldn't be able to make a stop
because he had to leave Sunday night, immediately after the
tournament is over.
	   But Soweto, the vast black township south of Johannesburg, will
be watching him play.
	   Nompula plans to set up a television set for people to watch the
tournament in the clubhouse -- a barren room with pink linoleum and
a few lavender-colored vinyl couches.
	   ``He's the one great black golfer we have seen. He has made
it,'' Nompula said.

	   SOWETO, South Africa (AP) _ Here at the scruffy Soweto Golf
Club, where shacks face the fairways and branches mark the holes
instead of flags, they are waiting for Tiger.
	   Tiger Woods arrived Monday in South Africa for the first time,
to play at the Million Dollar Open at Sun City Thursday through
Sunday.
	   The prospect of a part-black golf hero in the former land of
apartheid has excited the barefoot caddies, the would-be pros and
members of the black middle class who play here.
	   ``To have a mega-star coming here is an honor to South Africans.
The young people are taking him as a hero,'' said Thomas Coplan,
47, a retired paramedic as he cleaned his clubs.
	   ``We never thought there could be a black person on top of this
game, because this game was made for whites. Now we realize it's
not only whites who can prosper,'' he said.
	   Woods' arrival, like the current first-ever tour by the black

Mourners for slain dissident call for release of political

prisoners
 &UR; Eds: Iran Nation Party is correct

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of Iranians mourning the stabbing
to death of a dissident and his wife took to the streets Monday
calling for the release of political prisoners.
	   Some 10,000 mourners who had gathered at the Fakhr Mosque in
central Tehran to pray for Dariush Foruhar and his wife, whose
murdered bodies were discovered in their home more than a week ago,
poured into the streets chanting pro-democracy slogans.
	   ``Release all political prisoners,'' the protesters demanded.
``Freedom, security _ that is what we want,'' the crowd chanted in
unison.
	   Iranian officials say there are no political prisoners in Iran,
but international human rights organizations accuse Iran of
arbitrary arrest and detention and unfair trials.
	   Police closed off the streets around the mosque and ordered the
crowd to disperse. The protest ended without violence.
	   President Mohammad Khatami has ordered an investigation into the
murders, and police say they have several suspects. But no
information has been made public.
	   Over the past year, vigilantes who oppose Khatami's liberal
reform program, have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and
even a reformist Cabinet minister.
	   Foruhar, 70, was the leader of the Iran Nation Party, a small
opposition group that is tolerated by the government.
	   He served as minister of labor and social affairs in the
provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy.
	   His wife, Parvaneh, was in her mid-50s.

Greeks worry that Cyprus missiles could shoot down EU goals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Surface-to-air missiles ordered by Cyprus
were intended as added security against possible Turkish foes.
	   Suddenly, however, it's Cyprus' main ally _ Greece _ that is
feeling very nervous about bringing new firepower to the divided
island.
	   Greek officials were rebuffed last week in their offer to place
the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in a less confrontational locale,
the Greek island of Crete.
	   Now they are growing edgy that a potential military showdown in
Cyprus over the missiles could knock Greece from its real battle:
conquering its fiscal troubles and joining the European Union
single currency club.
	   ``The last thing Greece wants is anything interfering with its
EU goals,'' said Constantine Karistinos, a researcher at the
Institute for International Relations, an Athens-based think tank.
	   Deciding the fate of the Russian-made missiles accomplished an
unusual feat in the politics of the region: separating rhetoric
from reality.
	   Greece has always been ready with strong words of support for
Greek Cypriots, who ordered the missiles in 1996 in response to
Turkey's purchase of long-range American artillery. Turkey has
warned it could use its powerful military to take out the proposed
missiles.
	   Turkey maintains about 30,000 troops in the northern third of
the Mediterranean island, divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded
following a short-lived coup by backers of union with Greece. Only
Turkey recognizes the breakaway northern republic.
	   Greece formed a defense pact with Cyprus in 1993 and inaugurated
a Greek-built military air base this year.
	   But back in Greece, Premier Costas Simitis was marshaling all
his forces for the single currency quest. Greece failed to meet the
fiscal guidelines on the first round and Simitis has made entry by
2001 his main focus.
	   His Socialist party has shown unprecedented resolve against
waves of labor protests and strikes. Market analysts and EU
officials have recently encouraged Simitis' efforts to tame
inflation and reduce state debt.
	   ``Now we're being trapped by the Cypriots,'' cried political
commentator Aris Tolios on Flash radio.
	   In financial terms, a costly military mobilization to support
Cyprus could set back Greece's austerity goals. There also could be
a high psychological cost for Greece, some experts say.
	   ``It could deflect the focus from the EU to Cyprus just when the
Greek government needs to fully concentrate on the single currency
drive,'' said Karistinos on Monday.
	   The United States and EU also have urged Cyprus to cancel or
delay the deployment. U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke will try to
restart Cyprus talks during a trip through the region in December.
	   Last week, the Simitis government unsuccessfully lobbied Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides to accept the Crete alternative for the
missiles _ which are still sitting in a Russian warehouse and are
now not expected to be delivered until early next year.
	   But Clerides apparently fears the political fallout from the
perception of backing down to Turkish demands.
	   ``We cannot lift up our arms and surrender whenever we face a
threat,'' said Cypriot Socialist leader Vassos Lyssarides, whose
party has two members in the cabinet.
	   In Greece, the Cypriot snub has put the flame on simmering ill
feelings. Many Greeks privately complain about what they consider a
lopsided alliance, especially considering Cyprus' galloping
economy. But such grumbling is rarely voiced publicly out of
respect for their mutual mistrust of Turkey.
	   The missile dispute may change the rules.
	   The Eleftheros Typos newspaper reported that Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos berated Cyprus' defense minister, Giannakis
Omirou, for comments about Greece's efforts to move the missiles to
Crete.
	   ``The ... missiles are turning into a wound for Greece,'' the
Vradini newspaper commented.

Quebec's pro-independence government bids for re-election

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with polls opening; organizers worried about TV show;
initial results expected soon after polls close at 0100GMT

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's pro-independence government sought
re-election Monday, hoping for a decisive victory that could
accelerate the drive for secession from Canada.
	   If the Parti Quebecois returned to power, Premier Lucien
Bouchard has pledged to hold a referendum on secession whenever he
judges conditions right for a separatist victory.
	   Most polls in the final stages of the campaign forecast a
comfortable victory for Bouchard's party, which entered the
election holding 74 of the provincial legislature's 125 seats.
	   His main opponent was Jean Charest of the anti-separatist Quebec
Liberal Party, which held 45 seats and needed to gain 18 to eke out
a slim legislative majority.
	   The weather in most of the province was overcast but dry as
21,365 polling stations opened at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT). Voting
was to end at 8 p.m. (0100 GMT Tuesday).
	   Party organizers were seeking to get their supporters to the
polls early enough so they could get home for the 7:30 p.m. start
of ``La Petite Vie,'' a hugely popular TV comedy that has been
drawing more than 3 million Quebec viewers every Monday.
	   About 5.2 million Quebeckers were eligible to vote. Turnout in
the province usually is high; it was 93.5 percent for a 1995
referendum on secession.
	   Charest insisted he still had a chance of victory. But he spent
the campaign's final days trying to solidify support in Liberal
districts, while Bouchard ventured into anti-separatist territory
in a bid for a landslide win.
	   Critics said Charest, who left federal politics in March to
enter the race, failed to convince the bulk of Quebec's
French-speaking majority that he was the best choice to defend
their interests.
	   A decisive separatist victory could intensify the push for a
referendum on secession, while a narrow win might prompt a more
cautious approach. A surprise loss to Charest's Liberals would
derail the separatist cause for years.
	   Twice before, separatists lost secession referendums, by a big
margin in 1980 and narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, not wanting a third defeat, plans to call another
referendum only when convinced the separatists would win. In the
meantime, he says he would press for more autonomy for all 10
provinces, particularly in regard to control over social programs.
	   He expressed hope that anti-separatist animosity in the rest of
Canada would subside after the election, even if his party won.
	   ``If I was the person who is described in English Canada I would
be the first to detest myself _ a dangerous man, negative,
ungrateful,'' he said.
	   ``Afterwards, things should become more normal, and we will be
able to resume a healthier dialogue.''
	   Charest said voters should be wary of Bouchard's promise to
cooperate with other provinces.
	   ``If someone chooses to vote for the Parti Quebecois they're
giving a mandate to the government of Quebec to enter into a new
period of confrontation and conflict with the rest of the
country,'' Charest said.
	   The final round of polls showed support for the Parti Quebecois
at about 47 percent and the Liberals at about 41 percent, with most
other voters backing a third party, Democratic Action, led by
28-year-old Mario Dumont, which favors greater autonomy for Quebec
but stops short of supporting outright secession.
	   But many Quebeckers support Bouchard even though they do not
favor secession. Several polls have suggested that two-thirds of
the voters do not want a referendum on independence during the next
government's five-year term in office.
	   Though the secession debate dominated coverage of the election
in the rest of Canada, many French-speaking Quebeckers saw the
campaign as a simple choice of a day-to-day government, with the
issue of another referendum to be settled at a later date.
	   ``The time wasn't right for deep existential debates,'' said the
Montreal daily Le Devoir in an editorial. ``Lucien Bouchard
understood that and reduced the election to its most essential
element, that of confidence.''
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
various countries.
	   Quebeckers favoring independence generally feel they have a
different culture from the rest of Canada and would like to call
their own shots and have their own national symbols. There are many
francophones who do not want independence, and there are a few
non-francophones who do.

U.N. genocide trial opens for confessed Bosnian Serb killer

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ To his Muslim targets, Bosnian
Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of genocide'' who once bragged
that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee.''
	   Opening a genocide trial Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the 30-year-old
mechanic used the nickname Adolf ``with a perverse pride in the
genocidal symbolism it represented.''
	   Jelisic pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and
Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko,
northern Bosnia, in May 1992.
	   By trying him for genocide, prosecutors will be able to call
evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the
involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give
survivors of his killing spree chance to tell their story in court.
	   Bowers told a three-judge tribunal panel that Jelisic admitted
in interviews with investigators to far more killings than the
dozen to which he has pleaded guilty.
	   Jelisic will be convicted of those murders and sentenced at the
end of his trial, which is expected to last well into 1999. He
faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   ``We will never be able to fix the exact number'' of victims,
Bowers said. ``But if we are to believe even a small percentage of
the totals which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victims certainly
number well over 100.''
	   As the trial began, judges were read excerpts of a psychological
report which stated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial
but suffered a ``borderline personality disorder.''
	   Wearing a striped sweater and black jeans, Jelisic brought a
laptop computer into court and took notes. When he wasn't writing,
Jelisic sat slightly slumped in his chair, his head still, looking
impassively around the courtroom.
	   Jelisic's campaign of murder stands out _ even at a tribunal set
up to deal exclusively with atrocities _ for its cold-bloodedness.
	   ``Once Goran Jelisic even declined assistance from a guard,
noting that he was still in `good form' even though he had killed
over 60 people,'' Bowers told judges, citing statements made by
witnesses due to testify later in the trial.
	   ``To victims in Brcko, the face of genocide was the face of
Goran Jelisic,'' he said.
	   Bowers told the judges that Jelisic, who held no official rank,
was released by Bosnian Serb authorities from jail, where he was
serving three years for fraud, and sent to Brcko to murder Muslims.
	   He told investigators that on his arrival in the town, which was
of strategic importance to Bosnian Serbs, he was given a list of
Muslim targets and ordered to kill as many as possible.
	   Jelisic, Bowers said, seemed to relish the task.
	   ``Witness testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic was
not a reluctant tool of the genocide who was being compelled by
Serb authorities to act against his will,'' the U.S. prosecutor
said.
	   ``Quite to the contrary, the testimony will firmly establish
that Goran Jelisic was an efficient and enthusiastic participant in
the genocide.''
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has convicted two Muslims, two
Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder,
rape and torture, but it has yet to register a genocide conviction.
	   An earlier genocide trial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian
Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a ruptured artery in his tribunal
cell.

Yeltsin stays in hospital, impeachment motion advances slowly

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A parliamentary commission seeking to impeach
Boris Yeltsin debated Monday whether the president, as
commander-in-chief, was responsible for the stunning decay of
Russia's once-mighty military.
	   The president himself remained in a government hospital for the
ninth straight day, receiving treatment for pneumonia _ the latest
in a string of illnesses.
	   Yeltsin received his chief-of-staff Valentin Yumashev in the
hospital, and the president's office said the 67-year-old Yeltsin
was ``getting better.'' But he was still expected to stay in the
hospital for several days.
	   Russian television showed brief footage of Yeltsin, dressed in a
white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pallid, listening
intently to his aide and nodding periodically. Like most footage of
Yeltsin released in recent weeks, Monday's tape didn't contain any
sound of the president speaking.
	   Meanwhile, a parliamentary impeachment panel debated charges
against Yeltsin but failed to reach a conclusion.
	   Several lawmakers accused Yeltsin of neglecting the armed
forces, but said it would be hard to prove it was a premeditated
action, and therefore an impeachable offense.
	   The panel set up last summer has already accused Yeltsin on
three offenses they say are grounds for impeachment: instigating
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, using force against
lawmakers holed up in parliament in 1993, and launching the botched
war in separatist Chechnya in 1994.
	   Several previous impeachment attempts have failed and this one
also appears to have little chance of forcing Yeltsin from office.
But the Communists and their hard-line allies have been able to use
the panel to keep up pressure on Yeltsin at a time when he has not
been able to effectively govern.
	   If a motion to impeach is put on the parliament's agenda, it
would need a two-thirds majority approval in each of the two
legislative chambers and an endorsement by both the Constitutional
and Supreme Courts.
	   Yeltsin's repeated illnesses and his infrequent appearances in
the Kremlin have raised concerns about his ability to lead the
country _ now mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991
Soviet collapse _ through the end of his term in mid-2000.
	   Russian media has begun openly speculating on what would happen
if Yeltsin does not last that long.
	   ``What will happen if Yeltsin dies?'' the popular daily
Moskovsky Komsomolets asked Monday in a headline to a front-page
analysis. It proceeded with gloomy predictions including a coup,
secession by Russia's regions, and election victory by Communists
and a return to the Soviet prison-camp system and an Iron Curtain.
	   The Russian Constitution says that if the president dies or is
incapacitated, the prime minister takes over for three months, at
which point a new election must be held. But many believe the
process would not be so smooth.
	   ``We would have few chances to preserve our form of existence.
Which way (the changes) would go is unclear, because that would
already be beyond the threshold, on the other side, past the edge
of the precipice _ and there is only pitch darkness there,''
Moskovsky Komsomolets said.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Millions of Syrians headed to the polls
Monday to elect a new 250-seat Parliament from among 7,350
candidates, though the majority of seats are reserved for the
ruling coalition.
	   ``There is an excellent turnout,'' said Kheir Eddin Nakhleh,
head of a polling station in Damascus. ``I hope that the candidates
will meet their promises made to the people.''
	   Results were not expected before Thursday.
	   The National Assembly, or parliament, has limited legislative
power, with effective control held by President Hafez Assad, who
came to power in a bloodless coup in 1970.
	   Two-thirds of the seats are allotted to the National Progressive
Front, a coalition of seven parties led by the Baath Party which
has ruled Syria since 1963.
	   The allotment of seats was the same in the previous four-year
term, which ended in September. The Baath gets 135 seats, and 32 go
to allied parties. Independents run for the remaining 83 seats.
	   Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam told reporters as he
cast his vote that taking part in the election ``is a national
duty.''

Wenger's comments gives Arsenal fans indigestion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Some Arsenal fans are starting to lose patience
with French manager Arsene Wenger.
	   Wenger, criticized for his lack of big-name signings in the
off-season, suggested after Sunday's 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough
that fans were spoiled by last year's league and F.A. Cup double.
	   ``Perhaps we gave the fans too much last season,'' he said. ``If
you eat caviar every day, sometimes it is difficult to come back to
sausages and mash.''
	   That didn't go down well Monday with fans angry over the club's
exit last week from the European Champions League and its
fourth-place position in the Premier League, four points behind
Aston Villa.
	   ``It is an insult and it shows he doesn't understand the
relationship between a manager and the fans,'' said Ian McPherson
of the Independent Arsenal Supporters' Association.
	   ``Even if he thinks that, he should never say it in public. He
should be saying Arsenal fans deserve the best and we are trying to
give it to them.''
	   ``People want some decent signings, not third-rate French
kids,'' he added.
	   McPherson said Arsenal should have bought Dion Dublin, who moved
recently from Coventry to Aston Villa.
	   ``The fans have been behind him (Wenger) because he won the
double, but now they are beginning to wonder about some of the
second-rate buys he has made _ there are a whole bunch of them at
the club.''
	   French striker Nicolas Anelka, who replaced the popular Ian
Wright up front after Wright moved to West Ham, has failed to win
the Gunners fans' complete support.
	   ``Wenger keeps going on about how great Nicolas Anelka is going
to be in three years, but we want to see something now,'' McPherson
said.

 &UR; Netanyahu threatens to hold up accord over Arafat statements
 &UR; Eds: AMs RECAST. UPDATES with details from Palestinian Cabinet
meeting, fresh comments; INCORPORATES material from
Palestinian-Militant; CHANGES Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians accused
each other of gravely violating the latest Mideast peace accord
Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning he could walk
away from agreements altogether.
	   Netanyahu said statements by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
his plans for independence next May were ``serious and
insufferable.''
	   Palestinian negotiators dismissed Netanyahu's threats and said
continued Jewish settlement activity with Israeli government
support, was destroying chances for peace.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council
said at the end of a special session of parliament Monday that the
council would ``confront settlement activity by all possible
means.''
	   ``We cannot continue to say that there is a peace process while
settlement expansion exists,'' Qureia told reporters. He suggested
the Palestinians would not participate in negotiations for a final
peace treaty unless Israel stops expanding Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast War and the Palestinians want for a future state.
	   Netanyahu opposes Palestinian statehood and has warned that he
would counter any statehood moves by annexing large chunks of West
Bank land still under his control.
	   As part of the land-for-peace agreement signed by Netanyahu and
Arafat in Washington in October, Israel has begun withdrawing
troops from 13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian security measures against terror groups.
	   Monday, the militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad announced
that one of its leaders, thought to have masterminded a car bombing
last month, had been arrested by Palestinian intelligence.
	   The Palestinians say the peace agreements do not prevent Arafat
from declaring statehood on May 4, 1999, the day the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
ends.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians are
paying no heed to Netanyahu's threats. ``Let him shout as much as
he pleases,'' Asfour said of the Israeli leader.
	   Sunday, Arafat said in Washington that ``I hope that this
(coming) year will be the year of the independent Palestinian
state.'' Such a move would lead to the ``collapse,'' of the peace
accords, Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
	   A dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners is also
plaguing relations between the sides.
	   As part of the accord, Israel agreed to free 750 Palestinian
prisoners. In the first stage, Israel released 250, most of them
criminals, prompting Palestinian complaints that the agreement was
breached. The Palestinians demand that Israel free Palestinians
jailed for political and militant activity.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the prisoner issue
had led to a crisis situation and he flew Monday to Washington to
raise the issue with U.S. administration officials.
	   Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult to
continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would not compromise. ``I do not free
murderers. I do not release people with blood on their hands,'' he
told Israel radio.
	   In another possible point of contention, Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon appointed low-level officials to negotiate an
additional Israeli troop pullback with the Palestinians.
	   However, Israel's Cabinet has already decided that it would hand
over no more than 1 percent of the West Bank in an upcoming troop
withdrawal.
	   The junior appointments are ``just another example of Israel's
lack of seriousness in implementing the agreement,'' said Asfour.

Randy Johnson agrees to contract with Arizona Diamondbacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Randy Johnson, the most accomplished pitcher
among this year's free agents in Major League Baseball, agreed
Monday to a dlrs 53 million, four-year contract with the nascent
Arizona Diamondbacks, The Associated Press has learned.
	   Johnson, a left-hander who causes so much fear among some
left-handed hitters that they take themselves out of games he
pitches, also had been considering offers from three other North
American teams, the Anaheim Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and Texas
Rangers.
	   While there was no immediate announcement of the deal, it was
confirmed to the AP by a source familiar with the negotiations who
spoke on the condition he not be identified.
	   The Diamondbacks, a new team which will be in its second year
next season, planned to announce the deal later Monday, the source
said.
	   By signing with Arizona, Johnson will be able to commute to half
his games each season. He lives in Glendale, a comfortable driving
distance from Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.
	   ``For us, it's obvious there are family issues, and he's pleased
to spend his life in the Valley for hopefully the rest of his
baseball life,'' Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, told radio station
KMVP in Phoenix. ``But also from the top, we have a commitment that
the Diamondbacks are going to do what it takes to get to the World
Series and we believe that.''
	   The average annual value of his new contract is dlrs 13.25
million, the second-highest in baseball behind the dlrs 13.33
million Mo Vaughn will get under the dlrs 80 million, six-year
contract he agreed to Wednesday with Anaheim.
	   Johnson, 35, was 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA and 116 strikeouts in 84
1-3 innings this year for the Houston Astros, who acquired him from
Seattle on July 31. Unhappy with the Mariners after they refused to
give him a contract extension after the 1997 season, Johnson had
asked for a trade.
	   When Seattle refused, he was grumpy all through spring training
and the first half of the season, going 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA before
Seattle dealt him just minutes before the trade deadline.
	   In all, he struck out 329 this season, leading the major
leagues.
	   Johnson has a 143-79 career record, striking out 2,329 in 1,978
1-3 innings.
	   He joins an Arizona team that hopes to improve drastically from
1998, when the Diamondbacks went 65-97 in their initial season,
finishing last in the NL West, 33 games behind the division-winning
San Diego Padres.

Lebanon's pilots say they will delay flights to press demands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Pilots of Lebanon's national airline said
Monday they will delay flight departures from Beirut airport for
three hours Tuesday to press demands for higher salaries and other
benefits, a union statement said.
	   The decision taken by the 170 pilots of the state-owned Middle
East Airlines will affect six departing flights between midnight
(2200GMT) Monday and midday (1000GMT) Tuesday.
	   However, incoming MEA flights as well as flights of foreign
airlines to and from Beirut International Airport will not be
affected.
	   The pilots are demanding among other things a salary increase of
2.5 percent that was awarded in 1996 but never paid and financial
compensation for overtime.
	   An MEA pilot earns an average of about dlrs 3,000 a month.
	   MEA, which employs about 3,400 people, is Lebanon's second
biggest employer after the public sector. It has a fleet of nine
aircraft. MEA incurred dlrs 100 million losses in the last few
years, continuing a slide begun during the 1975-90 civil war.
	   The government bought a 99 percent stake in the company after
debts owed to the Central Bank were converted into shares.

Britain honors Oscar Wilde with a London statue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A century after Oscar Wilde was disgraced and
jailed for a homosexual affair, Britain honored the eminent
playwright Monday with the unveiling of a statue in central London
_ depicting him with head in hands holding a cigarette.
	   ``I think it is wonderful, a wonderful monument for the people
of London and of England,'' said actor Stephen Fry, who played the
central character in the film ``Wilde.''
	   ``Showing him smoking is yet again a big finger shoved in the
face of society,'' Fry added.
	   The statue near Traflagar Square is the first significant
monument in the capital to Wilde, whose works, including ``The
Important Of Being Earnest,'' still draw huge audiences.
	   While hundreds of passersby stopped to listen, actors Dame Judi
Dench and Nigel Hawthorne read an extract from Wilde's ``A Woman Of
No Importance.''
	   Culture Secretary Chris Smith said Wilde ``challenged prejudice,
he took on the Establishment and its perceptions.''
	   ``It's due to Oscar Wilde in many ways that we today can
celebrate a society that generally appreciates diversity,'' added
Smith, one of two openly homosexual members of Prime Minister Tony
Blair's 22-strong Cabinet.
	   Wilde was sentenced to two years jail in 1895 for homosexual
practices revealed during a libel action against the Marquis of
Queensbury, who had objected to Wilde's association with his son,
Lord Alfred Douglas.
	   Wilde died in exile in France in 1900.
	   The statue by sculptor Maggi Hambling is titled ``A Conversation
With Oscar Wilde 1854-1900.'' It is inscribed with a Wilde
quotation, ``We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking
at the stars.''
	   Wilde's grandson, Merlin Holland, said he felt there was still
some ``discomfort'' in England about Wilde's homosexuality.
	   ``But I think we're reaching a point where I hope ... we will
regard him as a writer and his sexuality as his own affair,'' added
Holland.

U.S. commerce secretary starts trade talks in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ United States Secretary of
Commerce William Daley on Monday began his third trip to Africa
this year, telling reporters in Cape Town that intellectual
property rights was a major issue for trade with South Africa.
	   Daley and a 16-member trade delegation will also travel to
Nigeria, Kenya and the Ivory Coast, completing a trip originally
planned for September.
	   That trip was postponed because of destruction by the August
bombing of the U.S. embassy that destroyed much of Nairobi, Kenya.
	   Daley congratulated the South African government on its
``unwavering commitment to its macroeconomic strategy''.
	   After apartheid ended with the first all-race elections in 1994,
the African National Congress surprised economic analysts by
adopting free-market economic policies instead of a more
controlled, socialist approach to the market.
	   ``This visit is about the forging of productive partnerships
between U.S. and South African companies,'' Daley said in a
prepared statement.
	   Tax and tariff issues will also be on the agenda for talks
between Daley and his South African counterpart Alec Erwin.
	   The U.S. delegation includes senior executives from large
companies, including Coca Cola, Chevron, DuPont, Enron, Eastman
Kodak and Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company.
	   On a trip to South Africa earlier this year, Daley met with
South Africa's health minister to discuss controversial laws aimed
at reducing the price of prescription drugs in South Africa.
	   U.S. pharmaceutical officials have charged that the law violates
intellectual property rights by requiring doctors to write
prescriptions only for generic drugs _ medicines where patent
rights have expired.
	   Daley and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on Tuesday are to address
a high profile investment conference that will include European
Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Botswana President Festus Mogae
and Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob.
	   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was expected to attend but
cancelled.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton continues to champion Africa trade
legislation that would require the president to start free-trade
negotiations with African countries and increase funding to back
U.S. investments in the continent's 48 countries.
	   The bill passed the House of Representatives but died in the
Senate before Congress recessed in October. The bill will be
considered anew next year.
	   Despite its population of 800 million, Africa accounts for only
1 percent of U.S. trade worldwide. U.S.-South African trade now
stands at over dlrs 5.5 billion and the U.S. invested over dlrs 2
billion in South Africa in 1997, Daley said.

Celebrity album in aid of Omagh bomb victims goes on sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A star-studded album recorded to raise money for
victims of the Aug. 15 Omagh bombing, Northern Ireland's worst
terrorist attack, went on sale Monday in Britain.
	   The album, ``Across The Bridge Of Hope,'' features stars such as
U2, Van Morrison, Sinead O'Connor and Boyzone, and includes a
reading by actor Liam Neeson of a poem written by 12-year-old Shaun
McLaughlin, who was killed in the attack.
	   The boy's poem about peace in Northern Ireland inspired the
title of the album.
	   The car bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents killed
29 people and injured 370.
	   Another 2,000 people _ many of them suffering from mental trauma
_ have visited their doctors since the attack, say administrators
of the fund established to help survivors and dependents of those
killed.
	   The fund is expected to reach about 5 million pounds (dlrs 8.3
million). It has received 850,000 pounds (dlrs 1.4 million) so far,
and several groups have pledged more.

Venables cleared in transfer probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTSMOUTH, England (AP) _ Former England coach Terry Venables
was cleared of any wrongdoing Monday in the signing of three
Australian players at English first division side Portsmouth.
	   Police said they found no evidence of dishonesty or corrupt
behavior in the transfers that took place when Venables was in
charge at Portsmouth.
	   An investigation had been launched into the purchase of three
Australians _ reported to be Robert Enes, Hamilton Thorpe and Craig
Foster _ who had played under Venables when he was coach of the
Australian national team.
	   A police statement said, ``Hampshire Constabulary's fraud squad
has completed its evaluation of paperwork and information
concerning the transfer of three Australian players to Portsmouth
Football Club last season.
	   ``We have found no evidence of dishonest or corrupt practice of
any person involved in those transfers and that investigation is
now closed.''
	   Police, however, said they were continuing to investigate other
allegations of ``bad business practice'' by the new board of
directors at the club.
	   Venables bought Portsmouth in August, 1996. He moved to another
First Division club, Crystal Palace, this year.

Rubgy World Cup chief promises tough measures on doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the wake of suggestions of widespread drug use
in rugby union, the head of next year's World Cup on Monday
promised tough measures to combat doping.
	   ``The IRB (International Rugby Board) is due to review
procedures for drug testing early next year and rugby World Cup
will implement the procedures set down,'' said Paul Thorburn, head
of next fall's championship.
	   ``Rugby World Cup is conducting quite an in-depth doping control
program during the qualifying tournaments and the competition
itself.''
	   In the Sunday Times newspaper, former Wales and British Lions
star J.P.R. Williams said drug abuse was common in the sport.
	   ``It is fairly well recognized that certain players have been on
anabolic steroids and haven't been tested,'' Williams was quoted as
saying.
	   The newspaper, citing lax drug-testing, said 250,000 players
turned out last season for English club games and that only 65 drug
tests were given.
	   ``In all sports, there are some people who are prepared to take
the risk but we hope that rugby players will be sufficiently warned
off so as not to take drugs,'' Thorburn said.
	   ``But there's always going to be a problem, especially when
there's money involved in the sport.''
	   The World Cup will be held Oct. 1-Nov. 6 in England, Wales,
Scotland, Ireland and France.

 &UR; German, French leaders to discuss European defense industry &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder, Chirac arrival in Potsdam; Talks to
start 1645 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder welcomed
French President Jacques Chirac on Monday for two-day talks
designed to revitalize Germany's ties with its most important
European partner.
	   Military drills and strains of the French and German national
anthems greeted the two leaders on arrival in historic Potsdam, the
city outside Berlin where the Allies signed the treaty on the
occupation of Germany after World War II.
	   Schroeder and Chirac will try to revive momentum in
German-French relations after a slowdown under former German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, aides say. The two leaders went immediately
into one-on-one consultations.
	   Germany and France hold summits twice yearly, but this meeting
has special significance ahead of Jan. 1, when Europe launches its
single currency, the euro, and Germany takes over the rotating
six-month presidency of the European Union. Together, France and
Germany have been the engine behind the drive for European unity.
	   In general, talks among the heads of state and their ministers
are expected to center broadly around international financial
systems, restructuring of the European aerospace industry and
reform of the E.U.'s budget, member contributions and farm subsidy
system.
	   The summit is the first for Schroeder, who won September
elections for the center-left Social Democrats. Though both
countries are now governed by the left, Schroeder's victory has
actually sent them drifting apart on one issue: the role of nuclear
power.
	   The new German government wants to shut down the nation's 19
nuclear plants. Paris worries this would mean lost business for a
French nuclear fuel reprocessing plant whose biggest foreign
customer is Germany. With economics ministers from both countries
attending the summit, the issue seems likely to come up.
	   The leaders will seek common approaches to major EU projects,
including a slimming of its budget and administration to prepare
for new members from the former Soviet bloc. Schroeder has said
that Germany will bargain to lower its EU budget dues.
	   European efforts to merge national aerospace industries to
compete with U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also on the
agenda, German officials said.
	   Germany prefers a three-way merger of the European aerospace
industry, including France and Britain, but would move ahead with
Britain first if the French don't participate immediately.
	   The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced
talks on a two-way alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's
early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly
government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been
slow.
	   German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine and French Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn were to meet to discuss the agenda
for Tuesday's meeting of Ecofin, the body of finance ministers from
the 15 EU members. The two will travel late Monday to Brussels,
where the meeting is being held.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler told European farmers Monday if they want to preserve
their sector they must accept the drastic reforms in farm spending
he has put forward.
	   He said it was imperative for EU farmers to stop adding to
stocks of surplus food that subsidies have made so costly it cannot
be sold on world markets, said Fischler.
	   ``If we want agriculture in Europe to have a future we must make
sure it can be more competitive,'' he told the association of EU
farmers, the most powerful lobby in Brussels and one resisting the
changes Fischler is seeking.
	   Yet Fischler said those reforms would prevent the EU farm sector
from becoming the sort of heartless industry seen in the United
States ``which is concerned only with producing as cheaply as
possible per hectare or per livestock unit.''
	   His proposal for deep cuts in subsidies as of 2000, compensated
by direct aid to regions in decline and farmers are to keep costs
down as the EU prepares to take in a dozen newcomers in the decade
ahead.
	   Also, reform of EU farm spending _ which eats up half the EU's
1998 budget of dlrs 100 billion _ is to give the EU a reasonable
negotiating stance in agricultural talks in the World Trade
Organization next year.
	   The European Commission has proposed a 30 percent reduction for
beef subsidies, 20 percent for cereals and 15 percent for dairy
products.
	   Those cuts would be compensated by direct income support for
farmers.
	   The aim is to sever the link between subsidies and output that
long saddled the EU with food surpluses and soured trade ties with
Washington.
	   Fischler urged farmers to show ``Europe's agricultural sector is
indeed capable of carrying out these reforms.''
	   If not, he predicted the EU would have to take 20 percent of
cereal lands out of production, impose mass culls to curb beef
production and set ever stricter milk quotas, along with fines for
quota violators.
	   Fischler unveiled his proposals last March. EU farmers and
several EU governments have given them an icy welcome.
	   Germany, which assumes the EU's rotating presidency in January,
has said it wants to conclude the farm reform negotiations by next
March to help smooth the entry of new EU members in the years
ahead.
	   The problem with surplus food stocks in Europe is that subsidies
have made the food so pricey it cannot be sold on the world market
where prices are lower. Traditionally, the EU then paid food
exporters the difference between the EU and world prices but those
``export subsidies'' have long been a source of dispute with
Washington which sees them as an unfair trade practice.

Inter coach says Brazilian star to miss more games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo's status as a part-time player was
set in stone Monday by Internazionale of Milan coach Luigi Simoni,
who said the Brazilian striker will miss the club's next two
Italian League games.
	   Simoni told reporters that his star player, who has battled
nagging knee tendon injuries all season, is not up to the task of
handling Inter's strenuous schedule.
	   ``Right now, Ronaldo cannot deal with three games in a week, so
he has to be used in doses. We know how to do that,'' Simoni said.
``Maybe the Brazilian will be able to play two of the four games
that we have over the next week.''
	   To date, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year has appeared in
only nine of the club's 22 outings in league and cup play this
season.
	   The coach said Ronaldo likely will be used in Thursday's Italian
Cup quarterfinal at Lazio of Rome and in the Dec. 9 Champions
League game against Austria's Sturm Graz.
	   ``He will skip, though, the upcoming Serie A games with Vicenza
and Udinese,'' Simoni added.
	   The coach's comments followed Ronaldo's admission over the
weekend that he is not fully healed.
	   ``I have a chronic injury that prevents me from playing every
game. I'm not the player I was last season,'' the 22-year-old
striker told a private television station.
	   Ronaldo helped Inter beat Spain's Real Madrid 3-1 in Champions
League action Wednesday, but then sat out Sunday as his club
rallied to edge Salernitana 2-1 in Serie A play.

	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder welcomed
French President Jacques Chirac on Monday for two-day talks
designed to revitalize Germany's ties with its most important
European partner.
	   Military drills and strains of the French and German national
anthems greeted the two leaders on arrival in historic Potsdam, the
city outside Berlin where the Allies signed the treaty on the
occupation of Germany after World War II.
	   Schroeder and Chirac will try to revive momentum in
German-French relations after a slowdown under former German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, aides say. The two leaders went immediately
into one-on-one consultations.
	   Germany and France hold summits twice yearly, but this meeting
has special significance ahead of Jan. 1, when Europe launches its
single currency, the euro, and Germany takes over the rotating
six-month presidency of the European Union. Together, France and
Germany have been the engine behind the drive for European unity.
	   In general, talks among the heads of state and their ministers
are expected to center broadly around international financial
systems, restructuring of the European aerospace industry and
reform of the E.U.'s budget, member contributions and farm subsidy
system.
	   The summit is the first for Schroeder, who won September
elections for the center-left Social Democrats. Though both
countries are now governed by the left, Schroeder's victory has
actually sent them drifting apart on one issue: the role of nuclear
power.
	   The new German government wants to shut down the nation's 19
nuclear plants. Paris worries this would mean lost business for a
French nuclear fuel reprocessing plant whose biggest foreign
customer is Germany. With economics ministers from both countries
attending the summit, the issue seems likely to come up.
	   The leaders will seek common approaches to major EU projects,
including a slimming of its budget and administration to prepare
for new members from the former Soviet bloc. Schroeder has said
that Germany will bargain to lower its EU budget dues.
	   European efforts to merge national aerospace industries to
compete with U.S. giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also on the
agenda, German officials said.
	   Germany prefers a three-way merger of the European aerospace
industry, including France and Britain, but would move ahead with
Britain first if the French don't participate immediately.
	   The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced
talks on a two-way alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's
early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly
government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been
slow.
	   German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine and French Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn were to meet to discuss the agenda
for Tuesday's meeting of Ecofin, the body of finance ministers from
the 15 EU members. The two will travel late Monday to Brussels,
where the meeting is being held.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Despite years of claims it has ended all programs
to build weapons of mass destruction, Iraq made a bid to acquire
prohibited missile technology in May, CNN reported.
	   In its program NewsStand, produced with Time magazine, CNN said
Sunday that Iraqi missile experts, escorted by Iraqi secret police,
went to the Romanian capital, Bucharest, to negotiate the purchase
of guidance equipment for long-range missiles.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its long-range missiles and
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons under resolutions by the
U.N. Security Council adopted after the 1991 Gulf War that ended
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
	   The CNN report quoted unidentified sources and Scott Ritter, an
American ex-Marine who resigned as a U.N. arms inspector in August
who complained the U.S. government was undermining the search for
Iraq's forbidden weapons.
	   Iraq has insisted since the early 1990s that it has destroyed
all its prohibited weapons. Tough U.N. trade sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that its weaponry has been destroyed.
	   According to the program's transcript, the Iraqi purchase in
Bucharest was blocked because spy agencies from the United States
and two other countries, which were not identified, uncovered the
potential deal and monitored the Iraqis' two-week visit.
	   CNN implied that Romanian intelligence was involved and noted
that Israel had earlier been part of Operation Teacup, a
cooperative effort between the arms inspectors and intelligence
agencies which oversaw the covert activities in Bucharest.

Chairman resigns after dispute with manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Peter Johnson resigning

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Everton chairman Peter Johnson
resigned Monday following a dispute with his manager over the sale
of striker Duncan Ferguson to Newcastle.
	   Johnson lost the power struggle with manager Walter Smith, who
had threatened to quit because he was kept in the dark about
Ferguson's transfer.
	   ``After 11 years as chairman of a football club, four years at
Everton and seven at Tranmere, Peter Johnson has decided to stand
down,'' the Goodison Park club said in a statement.
	   The club said Sir Philip Carter and Bill Kenwright would take
over as chairman and vice-chairman, while Johnson would remain on
the board as a non-executive director.
	   Earlier Monday, Johnson issued a statement expressing regret
that Smith wasn't informed about Ferguson's 8-million-pound (dlrs
12.8 million) move until after the deal was completed a week ago.
	   ``A substantial offer for Ferguson was received from Newcastle
which was discussed with that club's representatives immediately
before and during the course of last Monday's game'' between the
two sides, the statement said. ``Their discussions resulted in an
agreement being reached at the time.
	   ``Unfortunately, details of these discussions were not passed to
Walter Smith during the course of the game and it is regretted that
he learned of the final agreement reached regarding Duncan Ferguson
in the manner he did subsequent to the conclusion of the match.''
	   Johnson, who was reported to be trying to find a buyer for his
60 percent stake in the club, stopped short of apologizing to
Smith. It wasn't clear whether the wording would be enough to
placate the manager.
	   Ferguson, a Scottish striker, was Everton's most talented and
popular player. He scored two goals in his debut for Newcastle in
the Magpies' 3-1 win Saturday over Wimbledon.
	   Former Everton manager Mike Walker jumped to Smith's defense,
saying his treatment by the club had been ``diabolical'' and a
``disgrace.''
	   ``It undermines the confidence of people who don't know what is
coming next,'' he said. ``Are they buying someone, are they selling
someone?
	   ``If at the end of the day you know you need some financial
stability, at least talk it through with the manager first, he may
not agree with you but at least he knows what's happening and he
has to make a decision.
	   ``If he doesn't like it, well resign, whatever he wants to do.
But just to sell someone off the cuff, well that's diabolical.''

Shell, Texaco call off plan for European fuel alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Talks between oil companies Shell and Texaco over
a possible alliance in their European refining and retail
operations have been called off, the companies said Monday.
	   The companies had signed a non-binding memorandum of
understanding in September to try to negotiate a possible joint
venture aimed at saving dlrs 200 million a year. Talks began last
year, the companies said.
	   ``Although a joint review by teams from both companies had
confirmed the synergy benefits originally envisaged, we have
concluded that the proposed venture would not maximize shareholder
value for both companies,'' said Paul Skinner, president of Shell
Europe Oil Products.
	   Shell would not elaborate on why talks were terminated, saying
only that while detailed negotiations revealed the magnitude of
savings expected in September would be achievable, they also
highlighted downsides that led to no deal being forged.
	   Shell said the breakdown in talks would not affect the existing
joint venture among Shell, Texaco and Saudi Aramco in the United
States.

Search for premier after Hariri reportedly will not seek job

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business
tycoon who launched Lebanon's multibillion dollar reconstruction
from the devastation of civil war, hinted Monday that he would bow
out as premier following a dispute with the new president.
	   Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new
government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by the
possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect
Lebanon's economic recovery.
	   However, Hariri's decision, which was leaked to the media, did
not slam the door on his participation in the government.
	   His Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
President Emile Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday.
	   Lahoud on Monday set the stage for choosing a new prime minister
when he scheduled a fresh round of consultations with Parliament
for Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to
form the next government after a previous round of consultations.
	   The offer came after the 128 legislators polled by the president
gave Hariri a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing
he had received in his previous three mandates since 1992.
	   Although Hariri did not say it outright, sources close to him
said he was not a candidate in the next round of selection.
	   The same sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Sunday that Hariri had turned down the offer because he did not
feel the president followed constitutional rules in the
consultation process.
	   But the dispute between the two leaders appears to be over who
will have the upper hand in governing the nation of 3.2 million. A
brief meeting on Monday apparently did not help resolve the
disagreements.
	   Lahoud, 62, is an army commander who wants to assert his
authority at the start of his six-year presidential term. Hariri,
53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country since he
became premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi.
	   Lahoud, who enjoys widespread popular backing after succeeding
in rebuilding an army fractured by civil war, pledged in a tough
inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
	   Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and
stabilizing the national currency. His globe-trotting travels to
drum up political and economic support were sometimes instrumental
in drawing international financial aid and investment.
	   But he was faulted for declining living standards at home and a
rise in corruption in government.
	   Central bank officials on Monday tried to calm fears about a run
on the Lebanese pound by announcing that the bank was ready to
intervene with its foreign currency reserves if necessary, the
state-run National News Agency reported. It added that the money
markets remained stable.

Smuggler killed by police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Police killed a colleague smuggling corn
and coffee from neighboring Montenegro, the state news agency ATA
reported Monday.
	   The shooting occurred Sunday near the northern town of Shkodra.
ATA said smugglers, including three police accomplices, resisted
arrest after special police units from Tirana, the capital, seized
three trucks with 60 tons of smuggled corn and coffee. The victim
was shot when the smugglers took a customs official hostage and
began shooting at the special police units.
	   Another smuggler, the dead policeman's brother, was wounded in
the shootout, said ATA.
	   The border city of Shkodra is a hotbed of smuggling. A former
industrial center under communism, many of its workforce is now
officially unemployed.
	   Albania's government, appointed last month, has promised to
crack down on widespread smuggling and frequently sends in special
units from Tirana, because local forces are considered corrupt.

	   LONDON (AP) _ If South Africa's rugby union team beats England
Saturday to set a world record of 18 consecutive victories, the
mark may stand forever, Springboks' coach Nick Mallett said Monday.
	   The world champions equaled New Zealand's record of 17 straight,
winning Saturday over Ireland 27-13.
	   ``I can't see a country going through 17 or 18 tests unbeaten in
the future,'' Mallett said. ``I did not expect to be 100 percent in
our Tri-Nations matches against New Zealand and Australia earlier
this year. We should always be as good as level with each other.
	   ``But already I am detecting an improvement in Northern
Hemisphere rugby after our games against Wales, Scotland and
Ireland,'' he added.
	   South Africa's toughest match on its Northern Hemisphere tour
should be England, which is unbeaten since 1994 by the so-called
``Home Nations'' of Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
	   ``England are clearly the best side on this grand slam
experience,'' Mallett said. ``The most recent evidence is that they
made a fine side like Australia look ordinary when they lost by a
late penalty.''
	   Australia beat England Saturday 12-11 on a penalty with three
minutes left in the match.
	   Mallett suggested England had fewer injuries than his side but
said there was no lack of incentive.
	   ``There is an inevitable fatigue factor for us after 11 months
of rugby,'' he said. ``England were able to rest some important,
experienced players during the summer and have realistically
focused on the test against Australia and us in these two weeks.''
	   ``However, there will be no danger of us being low on
motivation,'' he added. ``We set the goal of winning the grand slam
here, knowing that the short-term aim would bring us the
longer-term ambition of setting that record.''

Local Namibian elections expected to reflect national

dissatisfaction &QL;

	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Two-day-long regional elections began
Monday, amidst increasing disillusionment with the country's
political leadership over involvement in a foreign war and
governance issues.
	   Nearly 800,000 registered voters in this southwest African
Atlantic coast country of 1.7 million are to elect six
representatives from each of the country's 13 regions to the
National Council.
	   The ruling South West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, is
campaigning on the basis of continuity and political stability.
	   But the main opposition party, the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, hopes to garner votes from popular dissent against
SWAPO's recent amendment of the constitution to allow President Sam
Nujoma stand for a third term in office.
	   SWAPO currently controls two thirds of both houses of
Parliament.
	   The upper house has approved the amendment but the National
Council must still consider the matter.
	   Critics charge the amendment threatens to undermine democracy in
Namibia.
	   A strong protest vote ``is the only way to ensure that the
government does not further fiddle with the Namibian constitution,
and that our country doesn't get dumped in an irresponsible fashion
into foreign wars,'' said Katutire Kaura, president of the
Turnhalle Alliance, on Monday.
	   Namibia has sent an unknown number of troops to back Congolese
President Laurent Kabila in his four-month-long fight against
rebels in a conflict that has drawn at least five regional
countries into the fight.
	   The election this week was rescheduled from 1997, when the
government stopped municipal elections midstream after only 20
percent of the voters turned out in some of its strongest
constituencies.
	   A visit to polling stations in Windhoek on Monday showed a
similar lack of interest, despite the fact the day was declared a
national holiday to allow people time to vote.
	   ``We are very happy so far, things are going O.K.,'' said
Ananias Elago, deputy director of elections.
	   Another issue brewing at election time was a secessionist
movement in a small neck of land called the Caprivi strip that
borders with Botswana and Angola.
	   About 700 people have fled to Botswana, including some
supporters of secession and opposition leaders.
	   An unemployed mine worker interviewed at a polling station in
Windhoek was not enthusiastic about the vote.
	   ``Why must I vote? The opposition is too weak and their leaders
have run away to Botswana. SWAPO does not care about me ... Who
must I vote for?'' said Mike Gowaseb.
	   Presidential elections are to be held toward the end of 1999 _
Namibia's third general election since independence in 1990.

Western Sahara Monday to try to resolve a bitter dispute over the
vast desert territory claimed by Morocco and rebels demanding
independence.
	   Annan, who arrived Sunday in Algeria, went to Tindouf in
southwest Algeria to meet with Polisario Front rebels on Monday. No
details from the meetings were immediately available.
	   Earlier this month, Annan met Morocco's King Hassan II and Prime
Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi to discuss plans for a referendum

German lawyer for Nazi slave laborers calls for proper
</HEADLINE>
compensation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Joined by a former Nazi slave laborer, a
lawyer seeking individual compensation from companies that forced
concentration camp inmates into labor on Monday criticized the
government's plans for a fund.
	   Michael Witti said the proposed industry-led compensation was an
attempt to bypass the demands of former slave laborers represented
by Witti and lawyer Ed Fagan in a suit filed in New York.
	   He was joined at a news conference outside the Munich
headquarters of BMW, one of several companies that employed slave
labor during the Nazi era, by Jack Bressler, who survived Auschwitz
and Buchenwald.
	   ``They should pay us what belongs to us,'' Bressler said.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has promised the fund to
settle back-wage claims from World War II-era slave laborers, but
no details have yet been announced of how much would be paid and
how claims would be administered.
	   Among those who have signaled participation in the fund are the
heads of Allianz insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks,
Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF. It will be
headed by Schroeder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach.
	   Witti and Fagan want the German government to recognize their
right to settle claims individually or on a class-action basis,
pointing to settlements reached between Swiss banks and Holocaust
victims.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Syria President Hafez Assad is ready to meet
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, if Israel agrees to
resume peace talks from the point they were stopped nearly three
years ago, Israel army radio said Monday.
	   Netanyahu said he has not received any message from Syria, and
rejected what he called preconditions for resuming the talks.
	   Army radio quoted American sources, saying U.S. President Bill
Clinton initiated the contact, asking Assad whether he would be
prepared to move forward in talks with Israel.
	   Assad reportedly replied that he is ready to resume the talks
where they left off, and to meet Netanyahu. Up to now Assad has
refused to sit down with Israeli leaders.
	   Azmi Bishara, an Arab member of the Israeli parliament who is
welcome in Arab capitals, said in a telephone conversation from
Damascus to Israel's Channel 2 TV that Assad wants to return to the
negotiating table.
	   ``There is a readiness to return to negotiations when Israel
shows willingness to go back to its stance of withdrawal in
exchange for full peace with Syria,'' said Bishara, who met for
three hours Monday with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz also said Assad was making overtures
to Israel. In two separate meetings with U.S. visitors, one a
diplomat and one a businessman, Assad said that if Israel withdrew
from the Golan Heights, it would enjoy quiet on the borders with
Syria and Lebanon, Haaretz reported.
	   The issue of where the talks left off is the main disagreement
between Israel and Syria. The Syrians claim Israel's previous
government offered to return all of the Golan, a strategic plateau
Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange
for peace. But the proposal was never made officially.
	   Netanyahu's government says a proposal that was never made
officially does not count. Therefore, Netanyahu insists that the
talks must resume without conditions.
	   ``We are prepared to enter into renewed negotiations with Syria,
but we are not prepared to accept dictation of terms that in fact
empty the negotiations of all content,'' Netanyahu said in an
interview with Israel radio.
	   Netanyahu's government opposes giving up all of the Golan,
fearing Syria would gain strategic control over Israel's north and
over vital water sources.
	   Asked about messages from Assad, Netanyahu said: ``If he sent me
a message, I didn't get it.''
	   Bishara said he did not deliver a message to Damascus but would
be glad to bring a message back to Israel. However, he added, ``I
don't think the conditions are right now for exchanges of
messages.''
	   A leading legislator from Netanyahu's party, Meir Shetreet, said
he had heard reports about the possible resumption of negotiations
with Syria.
	   Shetreet said Israel faces a ``historic window of opportunity to
finish the negotiations with the Lebanese, the Syrians and perhaps
the Palestinians.'' But to take advantage of it, he said, Israel
needs a government that can made decisions.
	   Netanyahu's parliamentary majority has virtually disappeared
over the debate over the latest agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians. Shetreet and other members of parliament believe
Netanyahu should bring the main opposition party, the moderate
Labor, into a unity government.

French minister rules out soccer flotations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An upcoming sports law in France will prevent
soccer clubs from listing shares on the stock market, sports
minister Marie-George Buffet said in an interview published Monday.
	   Led by Marseille, Paris Saint-Germain and Strasbourg, French
soccer clubs _ who are finding it increasingly difficult to compete
with wealthier rivals in England, Germany, Italy, Spain _ have been
lobbying the government to lift the current ban on sports clubs
selling shares on the stock market.
	   But in an interview with French daily Le Monde, Buffet said that
the new law, due to be presented this year but delayed because of
the stock market issue, will maintain the current restriction.
	   ``The risks of a hostile takeover are too great,'' Buffet was
quoted as saying. ``It is also feared that stock market games will
influence sporting results, which no one wants.''
	   More than a dozen British soccer clubs trade shares on the
London stock exchange, and in Italy, Lazio became the first club to
seek a listing earlier this year.

Three more candidates register for Kazak elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazakstan's Communist Party leader, a teacher and
the country's customs chief have registered for presidential
elections in January, a news report said Monday.
	   President Nursultan Nazarbayev is the overwhelming favorite in
the race in this central Asian nation. Election officials have
already barred two prominent politicians from running.
	   Nazarbayev will face Communist Party leader Serkbolsyn Abdildin;
Engels Gabbasov, a teacher, writer and lawmaker; and Sany Kasymov,
head of Kazakstan's customs committee, the Interfax news agency
quoted election officials as saying Monday.
	   Two more candidates are being considered for the race.
	   Former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin was barred from
running after attending a meeting of an unregistered political
group, and Asylbek Amantai, leader of an opposition political
movement, was shut out of the campaign because he was jailed nine
months ago for organizing an illegal meeting.
	   Nazarbayev's critics say he will not allow opposition candidates
to mount full-fledged campaigns against him.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Hoechst and France's
Rhone-Poulenc are near agreement on a deal to form one of the
world's largest life-sciences firms by merging their pharmaceutical
and agrochemical units.
	   The partial merger is in advance of a complete merger expected
in two years, the Frankfurter Allegemeine newspaper reported
Monday. Analysts have warned against a full merger until the
heavily indebted firms reduce costs.
	   The companies have scheduled a press conference Tuesday in
Strasbourg, France, to discuss details of the agreement, a Hoechst
spokesman said.
	   With annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion, the new company
will be tied for No. 1 ranking with Switzerland's Novartis AG in
the life-sciences sector, according to analysts.
	   The Wall Street Journal reported in Monday's editions that no
money will change hands in the transaction, and the parent concerns
will retain their remaining industrial chemical operations. The
companies would each own 50 percent of the new firm.
	   The merged group will be called Avantis and will be based in
Strasbourg, according to French and German newspaper reports.
	   Hoechst Chairman Juergen Dormann will be chairman of the new
company's management board, while Rhone-Poulenc Chairman Jean-Rene
Fourtou will be vice-chairman, according to published reports
quoting sources close to the deal.
	   The new pharmaceuticals division will be run out of Frankfurt,
Paris and Lyon, France. The agrochemical division, to be based in
Lyon, will be headed by Rhone-Poulenc's Alain Goudard.
	   Unions in France and Germany have been critical of the merger,
fearing layoffs. Hoechst employs 118,000 workers and Rhone-Poulenc,
68,000.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ To his Muslim targets, Bosnian
Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of genocide'' who once bragged
that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee.''
	   Opening a genocide trial Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the 30-year-old
mechanic used the nickname Adolf ``with a perverse pride in the
genocidal symbolism it represented.''
	   Jelisic pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and
Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko,
northern Bosnia, in May 1992.
	   By trying him for genocide, prosecutors will be able to call
evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the
involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give
survivors of his killing spree chance to tell their story in court.
	   Bowers told a three-judge tribunal panel that Jelisic admitted
in interviews with investigators to far more killings than the
dozen to which he has pleaded guilty.
	   Jelisic will be convicted of those murders and sentenced at the
end of his trial, which is expected to last well into 1999. He
faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   ``We will never be able to fix the exact number'' of victims,
Bowers said. ``But if we are to believe even a small percentage of
the totals which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victims certainly
number well over 100.''
	   As the trial began, judges were read excerpts of a psychological
report which stated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial
but suffered a ``borderline personality disorder.''
	   Wearing a striped sweater and black jeans, Jelisic brought a
laptop computer into court and took notes. When he wasn't writing,
Jelisic sat slightly slumped in his chair, his head still, looking
impassively around the courtroom.
	   The first witness, a 37-year-old Muslim who testified on the
condition that he be identified only as Witness A, said he saw
Jelisic, helped by Serb guards, murder two men with single gun
shots to the head despite the victims' pleas for mercy.
	   ``It was my impression that they enjoyed it more when the victim
pleaded with them,'' Witness A said.
	   He watched as the victims were ordered to kneel over a drainage
grate before being shot by Jelisic. Witness A and another prisoner
then had to carry the corpses and throw them into a refrigerated
truck parked on the camp.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Syria President Hafez Assad is ready to meet
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, if Israel agrees to
resume peace talks from the point they were stopped nearly three
years ago, Israel army radio said Monday.
	   Netanyahu said he has not received any message from Syria, and
rejected what he called preconditions for resuming the talks.
	   Army radio quoted American sources, saying U.S. President Bill
Clinton initiated the contact, asking Assad whether he would be
prepared to move forward in talks with Israel.
	   Assad reportedly replied that he is ready to resume the talks
where they left off, and to meet Netanyahu. Up to now Assad has
refused to sit down with Israeli leaders.
	   Azmi Bishara, an Arab member of the Israeli parliament who is
welcome in Arab capitals, said in a telephone conversation from
Damascus to Israel's Channel 2 TV that Assad wants to return to the
negotiating table.
	   ``There is a readiness to return to negotiations when Israel
shows willingness to go back to its stance of withdrawal in
exchange for full peace with Syria,'' said Bishara, who met for
three hours Monday with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz also said Assad was making overtures
to Israel. In two separate meetings with U.S. visitors, one a
diplomat and one a businessman, Assad said that if Israel withdrew
from the Golan Heights, it would enjoy quiet on the borders with
Syria and Lebanon, Haaretz reported.
	   The issue of where the talks left off is the main disagreement
between Israel and Syria. The Syrians claim Israel's previous
government offered to return all of the Golan, a strategic plateau
Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange
for peace. But the proposal was never made officially.
	   Netanyahu's government says an unofficial proposal does not
count. Therefore, Netanyahu insists that the talks must resume
without conditions.
	   ``We are prepared to enter into renewed negotiations with Syria,
but we are not prepared to accept dictation of terms that in fact
empty the negotiations of all content,'' Netanyahu said in an
interview with Israel radio.
	   Netanyahu's government opposes giving up all of the Golan,
fearing Syria would gain strategic control over Israel's north and
over vital water sources.
	   Asked about messages from Assad, Netanyahu said: ``If he sent me
a message, I didn't get it.''
	   Netanyahu's parliamentary majority has virtually disappeared
amid the debate over the latest agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians. Shetreet and other members of parliament believe
Netanyahu should bring the main opposition party, the moderate
Labor, into a unity government.

	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence agents have
arrested a member of the Islamic Jihad group on suspicion that he
ordered a November car bombing in a Jerusalem market, an Islamic
Jihad leader said Monday.
	   The suspected mastermind, Iyad Hardan, 22, was arrested last
week during a raid of the home of a relative in the West Bank town
of Jenin, said the Islamic Jihad leader who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Palestinian officials would not comment on the arrest.
	   Israel radio quoted unnamed Israeli security officials praising
the Palestinian Authority for arresting Hardan, adding that the
Palestinians have stepped up security cooperation by providing
intelligence information and acting on information that Israel
provide.

Kosovo rebel spokesman says independence can be postponed
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo guerrillas are prepared to
postpone their goal of full independence for the province but want
other assurances before they accept a U.S. peace plan, a rebel
spokesman said Monday.
	   The comments by Adem Demaci, Pristina-based spokesman for the
Kosovo Liberation Army, come with the KLA taking an increasing role
in talks aimed at settling Kosovo's unresolved political status.
	   Since an Oct. 12 agreement brought a halt to full-scale fighting
in Kosovo, U.S.-led diplomatic efforts have focused on getting
ethnic Albanian separatists to drop their insistence on immediate
independence from Serbia.
	   While the rebels have not formally changed their position that
independence is nonnegotiable, they have through Demaci's recent
comments signaled a new willingness to compromise.
	   ``The KLA is ready to accept the resolution of the problem step
by step,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press.
	   ``The KLA doesn't give up our goal to be independent,'' he said.
``But we are ready to agree, to recognize these methods'' calling
for interim status _ if ethnic Albanians are guaranteed the right
of self-determination in the near future.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 uprooted
from their homes during a nearly eight-month crackdown by Serb
forces against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Sporadic violence has continued in the seven weeks since the
agreement.
	   International officials are worried the fragile peace will
collapse in new fighting if a political settlement isn't reached
soon.
	   Others have voiced concern about delays in getting the
international team of as many as 2,000 verifiers into the field
promptly to ensure that the peace process is working. But the head
of that team said Monday that the full group should be operating by
about Jan. 1.
	   ``Bringing 2,000 people in from 54 countries is not an easy
function,'' said U.S. diplomat William Walker, head of the
verification team being assembled by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
	   ``We will be up and operational in a very robust fashion within
the next few weeks,'' he said after meeting with ethnic Albanian
political leader Ibrahim Rugova in Pristina.
	   The verifiers are charged with keeping track of the status of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's promises on Kosovo,
including a military withdrawal and efforts toward a political
settlement.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between Serb
authorities and the ethnic Albanians who form more than 90 percent
of Kosovo's population, is expected back in the province this week
with revisions to a U.S. draft settlement.
	   Demaci said the rebels are preparing a formal response to Hill's
plan and have several objections, including its failure to
guarantee a referendum or on independence after about three years.
	   ``We must know the exact date Albanians will decide our
future,'' he said in his Pristina office. ``We want a permanent,
formal document, registered in the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Serbian officials oppose both the U.S. plan and the Albanians'
suggestion that Kosovo be granted separate status within
Yugoslavia. Deputy Premier Milovan Bojic blasted the Hill plan
Sunday as ``shortsighted and perfidious'' for providing ``an
indirect way to Kosovo's full secession from Serbia.''

Holocaust fund payments going slowly, government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swiss fund to help needy Holocaust
victims has paid out 38 million Swiss francs (dlrs 27 million) in
its first year of operation, the government said Monday.
	   Payments from the independent 275 million francs (dlrs 195
million) fund have been slowed by lack of agreement in some
countries on how to distribute the money as well as technical
problems and verification procedures.
	   In a written reply to a lawmaker's question, the government said
it ``regrets that the payments haven't progressed further'' but
stressed it can't influence the distribution of the money.
	   Some 88 percent of the fund, created last year, is intended to
aid destitute Jewish survivors of the Nazis, especially those in
east Europe who were denied Western assistance during decades of
communist rule.
	   The remainder is to help non-Jewish survivors, including
Gypsies, homosexuals and political opponents of the Nazis.
	   Swiss banks and industry contributed the money in the fund,
which is in addition to other efforts to aid victims or return
unclaimed bank assets.
	   Chaired by Swiss Jewish leader Rolf Bloch, it began
distributions last November in Riga, Latvia.
	   The money distributed so far was paid to more than 40,000
recipients. The fund has cleared payments of a further 50 million
francs (dlrs 35 million), mostly to Holocaust survivors in the
United States.
	   A distribution plan for Israel, where the fund expects to pay
out some 85 million francs (dlrs 60 million) under the coordination
of the World Jewish Restitution Organization, has yet to be
finalized, the government said.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank,
announced Monday that it will acquire Bankers Trust Corp. in a dlrs
10.1 billion deal that will create the world's largest financial
institution.
	   The deal is part of Deutsche Bank's strategy to expand in the
United States, and to ensure the merger's success Deutsche Bank has
dedicated dlrs 400 million to retain top staff from both banks for
an unspecified period.
	   The acquisition of Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest bank in the
United States, is the largest ever takeover of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank, creating an institution with assets
of more than dlrs 800 billion. That surpasses UBS AG of
Switzerland, currently the largest bank, and the recently formed
Citigroup Inc.
	   At the close of trading in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank shares were
down 2.25 marks (dlrs 1.32), or 2.1 percent, at 104.65 marks (dlrs
61.56). Investors were dissatisfied by a lack of details on how
Deutsche Bank will integrate Bankers Trust, analysts said.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians accused
each other Monday of gravely violating the latest Mideast peace
accord with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning he could walk
away from agreements altogether.
	   Netanyahu said statements by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
his plans for independence next May were ``serious and
insufferable.''
	   Palestinian negotiators dismissed Netanyahu's threats and said
continued Jewish settlement activity with Israeli government
support was destroying chances for peace.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council
said at the end of a special session of parliament Monday that the
council would ``confront settlement activity by all possible
means.''
	   ``We cannot continue to say that there is a peace process while
settlement expansion exists,'' Qureia said. He suggested the
Palestinians would not participate in negotiations for a final
peace treaty unless Israel stops expanding Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast War and the Palestinians want for a future state.
	   Netanyahu opposes Palestinian statehood and has warned that he
would counter any statehood moves by annexing large chunks of West
Bank land still under his control.
	   As part of the land-for-peace agreement signed by Netanyahu and
Arafat in Washington in October, Israel has begun withdrawing
troops from 13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian security measures against terror groups.
	   Monday, the militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad announced
that one of its leaders, thought to have masterminded a car bombing
last month, had been arrested by Palestinian intelligence.
	   The Palestinians say the peace agreements do not prevent Arafat
from declaring statehood on May 4, 1999, the day the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
ends.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the Palestinians are
paying no heed to Netanyahu's threats. ``Let him shout as much as
he pleases,'' Asfour said of the Israeli leader.
	   Sunday, Arafat said in Washington that ``I hope that this
(coming) year will be the year of the independent Palestinian
state.'' Such a move would lead to the ``collapse,'' of the peace
accords, Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
	   A dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners is also
plaguing relations between the sides.
	   As part of the accord, Israel agreed to free 750 Palestinian
prisoners. In the first stage, Israel released 250, most of them
criminals, prompting Palestinian complaints that the agreement was
breached. The Palestinians demand that Israel free Palestinians
jailed for political and militant activity.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the prisoner issue
had led to a crisis situation and he flew Monday to Washington to
raise the issue with U.S. administration officials.
	   Implementation of the peace accord would be difficult to
continue under the present circumstances, Erekat said.
	   However, Netanyahu said he would not compromise. ``I do not free
murderers. I do not release people with blood on their hands,'' he
told Israel radio.
	   In another possible point of contention, Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon appointed low-level officials to negotiate an
additional Israeli troop pullback with the Palestinians.
	   However, Israel's Cabinet has already decided that it would hand
over no more than 1 percent of the West Bank in an upcoming troop
withdrawal.
	   The junior appointments are ``just another example of Israel's
lack of seriousness in implementing the agreement,'' said Asfour.

Rail strike set to continue into fifth day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French rail workers voted Monday to extend their
strike, condemning travelers to a fifth day of widespread
disruptions.
	   Unions voted to continue the strike in 17 of 23 regions, sparing
the Paris area as well as Brittany and parts of northern and
eastern France. The state-run train authority, the SNCF, said
between 38 and 40 percent of workers would continue to strike on
Tuesday, compared to 57 percent at the start of the walkout Friday.
	   The Eurostar train to London will remain unaffected by the
walkout, along with the Thalys train from Paris to Brussels,
Amsterdam and Cologne.
	   Rail workers are protesting what they see as insufficient staff,
and are concerned about how the government will implement a plan to
cut the workweek from 39 to 35 hours.
	   Ticket inspectors are backing the walkout in greatest numbers,
complaining that a lack of employees has created a safety problem
for workers and travelers.
	   Didier Le Reste, head of rail workers for the Communist-backed
General Workers' Confederation, said Sunday that the strike
movement should not last too long, because it makes ``no one
happy.''

Report: Inter fires embattled coach Simoni
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Internazionale of Milan fired coach Luigi
Simoni on Monday, ending his stormy stay with the Italian League
club after one-plus seasons, the ANSA news agency reported.
	   Club officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Simoni appeared to have saved his job last week, when Inter beat
Spain's Real Madrid 3-1 to get the inside track on a Champions Cup
quarterfinal berth.
	   But the team played poorly in Serie A action Sunday, needing two
late goals to rally for a 2-1 home victory over promoted side
Salernitana.
	   Inter, which Simoni guided to the UEFA Cup title last season, is
tied for sixth place in the 18-team Italian League with a 5-2-4
record.

Russian government again delays on budget plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government canceled a budget debate
Monday, one day before a visit by the head of the International
Monetary Fund, which is demanding a sound budget as a condition for
giving more aid to the crisis-ridden country.
	   The budget discussion was first rescheduled for Thursday, then
postponed until next week. The government insisted the delay was
not connected with the visit by IMF chief Michel Camdessus, but
gave few other details.
	   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has warned that
Russia would suffer serious problems if it doesn't get more aid
from the IMF. But the IMF and Western governments say they won't
provide any cash until Russia adopts a realistic budget.
	   Since Russia defaulted on its treasury debts and devalued the
currency in August, the government has produced no comprehensive
plans to tackle the financial crisis.
	   It has, however, included IMF aid in next year's budget.
	   Alexander Pochinok, a senior economic policymaker, was quoted as
saying Sunday that a 1999 draft budget assumes that Russia will
receive the remaining dlrs 17.5 billion from a 22.6 billion IMF-led
bailout package reached in July _ an inclusion criticized by the
IMF mission that visited Moscow earlier this month.
	   The IMF froze the loan package in August after the crisis
erupted.
	   The IMF has assailed the government's 1999 budget revenue
forecast as too optimistic and criticized the government's plan to
lower some taxes and offer support to ailing industries.
	   The government backtracked slightly Monday, saying the
value-added tax would only be lowered from 20 percent to 15 percent
_ not to 14 percent as earlier planned.
	   The extra 1 percentage point would be used to finance the
flailing coal industry and agriculture, Zadornov said.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov told reporters Monday
that the government would need several days to finalize changes in
the budget's tax projections and therefore couldn't complete the
new draft this week. Maslyukov said the Cabinet would likely debate
the budget Dec. 10, the Interfax reported.
	   Russia's finance minister on Sunday repeated pleas for IMF
assistance.
	   ``Money is not the main thing we need from the IMF, although we
need that too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax
news agency. ``We above all expect understanding from the IMF, and
a program to relieve Russia's debt.'' Russia has dlrs 17.5 billion
in foreign debt coming due in 1999, and has warned that it cannot
make the payments without a rescheduling.
	   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Ministry said Monday that this year's
grain harvest of 51.5 million metric tons _ the worst in 45 years _
has left Russia's grain reserves 7 million tons short of this
year's demand of 79.6 million tons.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The London psychiatric hospital where Gen. Augusto
Pinochet is being held under police guard said Monday it wants him
to leave quickly, adding that the former Chilean dictator no longer
``requires specialist medical and nursing care.''
	   The statement by the Grovelands Priory, a private psychiatric
hospital in north London, appeared a new blow to any hopes
Pinochet, 83, had of fighting extradition to Spain on grounds he is
unfit to stand trial.
	   The Grovelands Priory, sounding openly impatient, noted that at
a bail hearing Nov. 17 lawyers had said Pinochet, who underwent
back surgery Oct. 9, was fit enough to appear in court. He is now
due to appear Dec. 11.
	   ``It is now the responsibility of Gen. Pinochet's advisers to
find alternative accommodation,'' said the hospital. ``The
management of Grovelands Priory has reminded his advisers of this
responsibility and it is hoped that Gen. Pinochet will find
alternative accommodation as soon as possible.''
	   Earlier, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza left
London for Madrid after four days of trying to persuade Britain's
Labor Party government not to extradite Pinochet to Spain to face
charges of murder, genocide and torture by secret police during his
1973-1990 rule. Insulza maintained Pinochet may be tried in Chile
if he is allowed to go home.
	   A London newspaper, The Mirror, quoted Pinochet's nephew as
saying that he would rather die than stand trial in Spain.
	   ``He would rather kill himself or be killed by his guards than
face the humiliation and indignity of being sent to face trial in
Spain,'' nephew Rafael Pinochet Savedra was quoted as saying.
	   The general's wife, Lucia, told the tabloid that Pinochet was
``very weak and depressed about his position.''
	   Pinochet has not been seen in public since his Oct. 16 arrest
while in his hospital bed on a warrant issued by a Spanish
magistrate.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, underwent surgery in the
London Clinic, a private hospital in London's West End _ which
became the object of chanting demonstrators after his arrest.
	   He was moved Nov. 17 to Grovelands Priory, some five miles (8
kms) from central London and set in parklands.
	   There was no immediate word on where Pinochet might go. News
reports have said he is planning a move to a nine-bedroom home on
the private Wentworth estate in Surrey, southwest of London.
	   A hospital source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Pinochet was originally admitted ``because there was a psychiatric
element of stress,'' but he had been passed fit and his family had
been ``sluggish'' about finding new accommodation.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police after Pinochet
overthrew a Marxist who had been elected.
	   Pinochet has immunity from prosecution in Chile. Critics say
that even if this were lifted he would appear before a military
court packed with his supporters.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to
permit extradition proceedings to begin.

Kosovo rebel spokesman says independence can be postponed

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with KLA spokesman's comments. CHANGES

 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo guerrillas are prepared to
postpone their goal of full independence for the province but want
other assurances before they accept a U.S. peace plan, a rebel
spokesman said Monday.
	   The comments by Adem Demaci, Pristina-based spokesman for the
Kosovo Liberation Army, come with the KLA taking an increasing role
in talks aimed at settling Kosovo's unresolved political status.
	   Since an Oct. 12 agreement brought a halt to full-scale fighting
in Kosovo, U.S.-led diplomatic efforts have focused on getting
ethnic Albanian separatists to drop their insistence on immediate
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   While the rebels have not formally changed their position that
independence is nonnegotiable, they have through Demaci's recent
comments signaled a new willingness to compromise.
	   ``The KLA is ready to accept the resolution of the problem step
by step,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press.
	   ``The KLA doesn't give up our goal to be independent,'' he said.
``But we are ready to agree, to recognize these methods'' calling
for interim status _ if ethnic Albanians are guaranteed the right
of self-determination in the near future.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 uprooted
from their homes during a nearly eight-month crackdown by Serb
forces against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Sporadic violence has continued in the seven weeks since the
agreement.
	   International officials are worried the fragile peace will
collapse in new fighting if a political settlement isn't reached
soon.
	   Others have voiced concern about delays in getting the
international team of as many as 2,000 verifiers into the field
promptly to ensure that the peace process is working. But the head
of that team said Monday that the full group should be operating by
about Jan. 1.
	   ``Bringing 2,000 people in from 54 countries is not an easy
function,'' said U.S. diplomat William Walker, head of the
verification team being assembled by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
	   ``We will be up and operational in a very robust fashion within
the next few weeks,'' he said after meeting with ethnic Albanian
political leader Ibrahim Rugova in Pristina.
	   The verifiers are charged with keeping track of the status of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's promises on Kosovo,
including a military withdrawal and efforts toward a political
settlement.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has been shuttling between Serb
authorities and the ethnic Albanians who form more than 90 percent
of Kosovo's population, is expected back in the province this week
with revisions to a U.S. draft settlement.
	   Demaci said the rebels are preparing a formal response to Hill's
plan and have several objections, including its failure to
guarantee a referendum or on independence after about three years.
	   ``We must know the exact date Albanians will decide our
future,'' he said in his Pristina office. ``We want a permanent,
formal document, registered in the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Serbian officials oppose both the U.S. plan and the Albanians'
suggestion that Kosovo be granted separate status within
Yugoslavia. Deputy Premier Milovan Bojic blasted the Hill plan
Sunday as ``shortsighted and perfidious'' for providing ``an
indirect way to Kosovo's full secession from Serbia.''

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Police mounted a massive security operation Monday
as the trial opened of an alleged godfather of the Russian mafia.
	   Sergei Mikhailov faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half years in
prison if found guilty of being a member of a criminal organization
and of breaking Swiss property laws in acquiring a villa near
Geneva.
	   A relaxed-looking Mikhailov appeared in a packed courtroom
Monday as proceedings opened with the judge throwing out a request
by his lawyers for a postponement of the trial.
	   The court rejected their claim that his case has been
compromised by media reports and the unprecedented security
measures.

year.

courthouse. Witnesses will receive special protection, in some
cases including provision of bullet-proof vests.

officer Nikolai Oporov, who has been given political exile in
Switzerland and is under heavy guard.
	   Also due to give evidence is Mikhailov's former lawyer, who is
himself waiting to be tried after being arrested leaving the prison

assassinated in the Netherlands in July 1997.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Police mounted a massive security operation Monday
as the trial opened of an alleged godfather of the Russian mafia.
	   Sergei Mikhailov faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half years in
prison if found guilty of being a member of a criminal organization
and of breaking Swiss property laws in acquiring a villa near
Geneva.
	   A relaxed-looking Mikhailov appeared in a packed courtroom
Monday as proceedings opened with the judge throwing out a request
by his lawyers for a postponement of the trial.
	   The court rejected their claim that his case has been
compromised by media reports and the unprecedented security
measures.
	   Defense attorneys lodged another appeal, claiming that the case
against Mikhailov is invalid under European human rights law.
	   That protest was also rejected late Monday, allowing the trial
to go ahead.
	   Mikhailov, 40, was arrested two years ago at Geneva airport. He
was originally accused of money laundering, but in the course of

Four killed in a movie theater stampede in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Four Ukrainian teen-agers were killed
Monday when spectators leaving a movie theater collided in a narrow
passage with schoolchildren rushing forward to find seats for the
movie ``Armageddon,'' news agencies reported.
	   At least 16 people were injured in the accident, which occurred
in the town of Chervonohrad in the western Lviv region, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The dead children, 3 boys and a girl, were aged between 11 and
14, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The American movie ``Armageddon'' has been one of the most
popular films in Ukraine for several months.
	   About 800 children from five schools in Chervonohrad were
watching the film when the accident happened, according to
Interfax.
	   Six children received serious injuries and required intensive
medical care, police said.
	   President Leonid Kuchma sent a telegram of condolences and
ordered local authorities to assist the families that lost their
children.
	   Kuchma also ordered the chief prosecutor's office and the
Interior Ministry to carefully investigate the accident.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Despite a rebuke at the polling booth,
India's governing Hindu nationalist party won a vote of renewed
support from its coalition allies Monday, averting the immediate
threat of a political crisis.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee won the boost he sought at a
90-minute meeting of the 19 parties in the coalition, which
affirmed their ``unequivocal commitment'' to his government.
	   For at least one group of opposition lawmakers, however, it was
clear what the BJP's poor showing in recent state elections means.
	   ``Resign! Resign! You have no moral right to govern,'' they
chanted in the federal Parliament, taunting Vajpayee and his
Bharatiya Janata Party colleagues as the house began its winter
session. The uproar forced parliament to adjourn for several hours.
	   As counting for Wednesday's polling was finished over the
weekend, it became clear that the BJP had lost power to the main
opposition Congress party in the key states of New Delhi and
Rajasthan and failed to oust Congress from Madhya Pradesh.
Elections were also held in the far northeastern state of Mizoram,
where a local party won in a field that did not include the BJP.
	   Although the results do not directly affect Vajpayee's
coalition, they are seen as a serious rebuff for the Hindu
nationalist party that came to national power eight months ago.
	   No single party has a simple majority in India's 545-member
lower house of Parliament. The BJP, the single largest group, came
to power with the help of independents and small regional groups,
all of whom have continually threatened to withdraw from the
government over local issues.
	   Several coalition members who have hinted at withdrawing support
_ forcing the federal government to collapse _ may now be thinking
even more seriously about backing Congress. If the BJP government
fell before its five-year term ended, Congress or another party
could be asked to form a new government, or early elections could
be called.
	   Skyrocketing prices of vegetables and other food became the
single biggest issue in the campaign, eclipsing the nuclear tests
in May that had briefly increased the popularity of the BJP.
	   Even Prime Minister Vajpayee conceded the failure of his
government to curb the rise in prices.
	   ``There have been some shortcomings,'' he told members of his
coalition during a post-election stocktaking.
	   The results have again turned the spotlight on Sonia Gandhi,
president of the Congress party and widow of former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi. After being chosen president of the party in March,
she began a program to revamp it, relying on trusted lieutenants to
campaign against the BJP.
	   Over the months, Gandhi has been urged by party workers to make
a bid to topple Vajpayee's government. She has repeatedly refused.

U.N. genocide trial opens for confessed Bosnian Serb killer
</HEADLINE>

witness, background. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ To his Muslim targets, Bosnian
Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of genocide'' who once bragged
that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee.''
	   Opening a genocide trial Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the 30-year-old
mechanic used the nickname Adolf ``with a perverse pride in the
genocidal symbolism it represented.''
	   Jelisic pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and
Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko,
northern Bosnia, in May 1992.
	   By trying him for genocide, prosecutors will be able to call
evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, including the
involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give
survivors of his killing spree chance to tell their story in court.
	   Bowers told a three-judge tribunal panel that Jelisic admitted
in interviews with investigators to far more killings than the
dozen to which he has pleaded guilty.
	   Jelisic will be convicted of those murders and sentenced at the
end of his trial, which is expected to last well into 1999. He
faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   ``We will never be able to fix the exact number'' of victims,
Bowers said. ``But if we are to believe even a small percentage of
the totals which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victims certainly
number well over 100.''
	   As the trial began, judges were read excerpts of a psychological
report which stated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial
but suffered a ``borderline personality disorder.''
	   Wearing a striped sweater and black jeans, Jelisic brought a
laptop computer into court and took notes. When he wasn't writing,
Jelisic sat slightly slumped in his chair, his head still, looking
impassively around the courtroom.
	   The first witness, a 37-year-old Muslim who testified on the
condition that he be identified only as Witness A, said he saw
Jelisic, helped by Serb guards, murder two men with single gun
shots to the head despite the victims' pleas for mercy.
	   ``It was my impression that they enjoyed it more when the victim
pleaded with them,'' Witness A said.
	   He watched as the victims were ordered to kneel over before
being shot by Jelisic. Witness A and another prisoner then had to
carry the corpses and throw them into a refrigerated truck parked
on the camp.
	   Jelisic's campaign of murder stands out _ even at a tribunal set
up to deal exclusively with atrocities _ for its cold-bloodedness.
	   ``Once Goran Jelisic even declined assistance from a guard,
noting that he was still in `good form' even though he had killed
over 60 people,'' Bowers told judges, citing statements made by
witnesses due to testify later in the trial.
	   ``To victims in Brcko, the face of genocide was the face of
Goran Jelisic,'' he said.
	   Bowers told the judges that Jelisic, who held no official rank,
was released by Bosnian Serb authorities from jail, where he was
serving three years for fraud, and sent to Brcko to murder Muslims.
	   He told investigators that on his arrival in the town, which was
of strategic importance to Bosnian Serbs, he was given a list of
Muslim targets and ordered to kill as many as possible.
	   Jelisic, Bowers said, seemed to relish the task.
	   ``Witness testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic was
not a reluctant tool of the genocide who was being compelled by
Serb authorities to act against his will,'' the U.S. prosecutor
said.
	   ``Quite to the contrary, the testimony will firmly establish
that Goran Jelisic was an efficient and enthusiastic participant in
the genocide.''
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has convicted two Muslims, two
Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder,
rape and torture, but it has yet to register a genocide conviction.
	   An earlier genocide trial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian
Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a ruptured artery in his tribunal
cell.

	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence agents have
arrested a member of the Islamic Jihad group on suspicion that he
ordered a November car bombing in a Jerusalem market, an Islamic
Jihad leader said Monday.
	   The suspected mastermind, Iyad Hardan, 22, was arrested last
week during a raid on a relative's home in the West Bank town of
Jenin, said the Islamic Jihad leader, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Palestinian officials would not comment on the arrest.
	   Israel radio quoted unnamed Israeli security officials praising
the Palestinian Authority for arresting Hardan, adding that the
Palestinians have stepped up security cooperation by providing
intelligence information and acting on information that Israel
provided.
	   Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility for the Nov. 6 bombing
in Jerusalem's outdoor Mahane Yehuda market. The attack killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israeli shoppers.
	   Israel radio said Monday that Palestinian police also arrested
two members of the Islamic militant group Hamas who were on a list
of suspected militants sought by Israel.
	   Security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians was a
key provision of the Wye River land-for-security agreement. The
Palestinian Authority agreed to take tougher measures against the
militants.

Swiss prosecutor in Salinas case arrives in Mexico City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Carla del Ponte, the Swiss attorney general
who headed an investigation into alleged money laundering by the
brother of a former Mexican president, flew to Mexico City on
Monday for a private visit.
	   Del Ponte was met at the Mexico City airport by Juan Manuel
Ponce Edmonson, director of Interpol in Mexico, the government news
agency Notimex reported.
	   Officially, the attorney general's office had no knowledge of
del Ponte's visit, a spokeswoman said. The Swiss Embassy refused to
confirm del Ponte's arrival.
	   The attorney general's previous visits to Mexico have been
related to the Swiss government's case against Raul Salinas de
Gortari, the elder brother of former President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
	   Swiss prosecutors last month ordered the seizure of dlrs 114
million in Raul Salinas' offshore accounts, saying they are
protection payments made by Mexican and Colombian drug
organizations.
	   Valentin Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's anti-drug
police, said investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and
Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas
at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments
through Mexico.
	   Salinas has denied any ties to drug smugglers, saying the
millions of dollars in his Swiss accounts were an investment fund
pooled by several wealthy friends.
	   Carlos Salinas, who left Mexico in disgrace a few months after
the end of his 1988-94 presidency, has denied any knowledge of his
brother's financial activities. He has not been charged with any
crime.

Munich court approves extradition of suspected Bin Laden
</HEADLINE>
accomplice &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A Munich court on Monday approved the
extradition to the United States of a suspected top aide of Osama
Bin Laden, the Saudi militant accused of masterminding the U.S.
embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya that killed 224 people.
	   The aide, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, has been held in Germany
since his arrest in Bavaria two months ago.
	   Salim, allegedly Bin Laden's finance chief, is charged in U.S.
District Court in New York with murder conspiracy and use of
weapons of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S.
citizens.
	   Three other alleged accomplices of Bin Laden are already jailed
in the United States.
	   Extradition of suspects to another country requires additional
approval by the Justice and Foreign ministries in Bonn. A Justice
Ministry spokesman declined to comment on the possible timing of
extradition.
	   Salim's lawyer, Leonhard Walischewski, said he planned to
challenge the court's decision.
	   The Munich court approved the extradition citing sources whose
``credibility should be tried by U.S. officials in a U.S. court.''
	   The Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that sources were an FBI
employee, a New York lawyer and a distant relative of Bin Laden's
known by the code name of CS-1, employed by U.S. secret services
for two years.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Internazionale of Milan fired coach Luigi
Simoni on Monday, ending his stormy stay with the Italian League
club after one-plus seasons and a UEFA Cup title, the ANSA news
agency reported.
	   The news came hours after Simoni was named Coach of the Year by
the Italian Soccer Federation, based on a vote by coaches in the
first and second divisions.
	   Club officials could not be reached for comment, but ANSA quoted
Simoni as saying, ``It's true, I have been fired. I did not expect
this at all. I am very disappointed.''
	   Simoni appeared to have saved his job last Wednesday, when Inter
beat Spain's Real Madrid 3-1 to get the inside track on a Champions
Cup quarterfinal berth.
	   But the team played poorly in Serie A action Sunday, needing two
late goals to rally for a 2-1 home victory over next-to-last
Salernitana.
	   Inter is tied for sixth place in the 18-team Italian League with
a 5-2-4 record. Club owner Massimo Moratti has shelled out millions
of dollars to sign such stars as Brazil's Ronaldo, Italy's Roberto
Baggio, Chile's Ivan Zamorano, France's Youri Djorkaeff and
Argentina's Diego Simeone, and said at the start of the season that
he would settle for nothing less than the franchise's first league
title since 1989.
	   After joining Inter from Napoli for last season, Simoni guided
the Milan club to the UEFA Cup trophy and a second-place finish in
Serie A.
	   Simoni was widely seen as a lame-duck coach, with current
Juventus of Turin coach Marcello Lippi reportedly headed to Inter
at the start of next season.
	   In the interim, speculation centers on Romanian coach Mircea
Lucescu filling in for the rest of this campaign. Lucescu has
previously coached Italian clubs Pisa, Brescia and Reggiana.

	   Inter is tied for sixth place in the 18-team Italian League with
a 5-2-4 record. Club owner Massimo Moratti has shelled out millions
of dollars to sign such stars as Brazil's Ronaldo, Italy's Roberto
Baggio, Chile's Ivan Zamorano, France's Youri Djorkaeff and
Argentina's Diego Simeone, and said at the start of the season that
he would settle for nothing less than the franchise's first league
title since 1989.
	   After joining Inter from Napoli for last season, Simoni guided
the Milan club to the UEFA Cup trophy and a second-place finish in
Serie A.
	   Simoni was widely seen as a lame-duck coach, with current
Juventus of Turin coach Marcello Lippi reportedly headed to Inter
at the start of next season.
	   In the interim, speculation centers on Romanian coach Mircea
Lucescu filling in for the rest of this campaign. Lucescu has
previously coached Italian clubs Pisa, Brescia and Reggiana.

EU group lists 85 `potentially harmful' corporate tax havens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union experts tracking
corporate tax havens have identified 85 measures used by EU member
nations that may violate the Union's new code of conduct on
business taxation.
	   In an interim report to be presented at an EU finance ministers
meeting here Tuesday, the Code of Conduct Group lists the
``potentially harmful'' tax breaks that span all 15 of the EU
member nations except Austria.
	   France and Britain tie for the highest number of questionable
items at 10 apiece, while the Netherlands and Portugal each have
nine, followed by eight for Spain.
	   Tiny Luxembourg, known for its friendly approach to foreign
investment, racks up six potential code of conduct violations, the
same for Greece.
	   The Code of Conducts Group's opinions aren't legally binding,
but EU member states have made a political pledge to honor the
code, which seeks above all to prevent nations poaching investment
from their neighbors by offering favorable tax rates to foreign
companies.
	   The group is made up of senior treasury officials from the EU
nations and headed by Dawn Primarolo, financial secretary to
Britain's Treasury. It aims to pass final judgments on questionable
measures by November 1999.
	   Notable items on the initial roster include a three different
tax breaks for companies doing business in the British territory of
Gibraltar; special regimes for company ``coordination centers'' and
``distribution centers'' in Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg; and the
International Financial Services Center in Dublin, Ireland.
	   The tax code of conduct is one of a number of contentious tax
issues currently under debate at the EU, including plans to
introduce a minimum 20 percent savings tax and an energy tax on oil
and coal.
	   Diplomats are seeking to play down reports of a rift in EU ranks
over suggestions that the new Germany government is seeking to
introduce harmonized corporate tax rates across the bloc.
	   The tax break report stresses that inclusion on the list does
not assume a measure will be judged definitely unfair.
	   Ireland's successful luring of foreign investment through tax
breaks in specific centers has drawn stiff criticism from its EU
partners, notably France and Germany.
	   The group's report notes that participating companies in
Dublin's Financial Services Center benefit from a 10 percent
corporate income tax rate, compared to the standard 32 percent
Irish levy.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Four Ukrainian schoolchildren were crushed
to death Monday when spectators leaving a movie theater collided in
a narrow passage with students rushing forward to find seats for
the movie ``Armageddon.''
	   At least 16 people were injured in the accident, which occurred
in the town of Chervonohrad in the western Lviv region, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The dead children, 3 boys and a girl, were aged between 11 and
14, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The American movie ``Armageddon'' has been one of the most
popular films in Ukraine for several months, and the theater was
the only one showing the film in Chervonohrad.
	   About 800 children from five schools in Chervonohrad came to the
two afternoon showings of the film _ the one that was ending when
the accident occurred and the one that was about to start,
according to Interfax.
	   Six children received serious injuries and required intensive
medical care, police said.
	   President Leonid Kuchma sent a telegram of condolences and
ordered local authorities to assist the families that lost their
children.
	   Kuchma also ordered the chief prosecutor's office and the
Interior Ministry to carefully investigate the accident.

Jewish historian resigns from Austrian commission investigating
</HEADLINE>
Nazi times

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Citing lack of time, an Israeli historian
has resigned from an independent commission examining Austria's
options for compensating victims of Nazi looting and unjust
post-World War II restitution laws, news reports said Monday.
	   The commission was set up by the government earlier this fall in
the face of threatened lawsuits by lawyers representing the
families of victims. The commission's overall purpose is to lay
ground rules for the compensation of survivors and victims'
families whose money, art and other valuables were looted by the
Nazis as well as the immediate postwar government.
	   Austria was annexed by the Nazis in March 1938, and for decades
after the war it cultivated an image of itself as the first victim
of Nazi aggression, despite the high percentage of Nazi atrocities
committed and ordered by Austrians.
	   Austria's first postwar government also effectively confiscated
hundreds of paintings from Jewish owners and their heirs, using a
1923 law preventing the export of artworks. The government allowed
some Jews to reclaim their works and take them out of the country,
but forced them to donate many others in exchange.
	   Reporting the resignation of Israeli historian Avraham Barkai,
the Austria Press Agency cited him as saying his decision was
personal, and based on the fact that he misjudged the amount of
time he would have to dedicate to commission work.

Boca Juniors win Argentina's championship; teams in Chile, Brazil
</HEADLINE>
still battling &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ It didn't even take Boca Juniors
coach Carlos Bianchi a full season to lead one of Argentina's most
popular soccer teams to the national championship.
	   When Bianchi came on board earlier this year, gone were Boca's
top players _ and two of the country's best _ Claudio Caniggia and
Diego Latorre. Another, Nolberto Solano, was transferred to
England's Newcastle.
	   Nonetheless, Bianchi, who coached Velez Sarsfield to last
season's top spot, led a balanced team headed by league top scorer
Martin Palermo to their first championship since 1992. Boca remains
undefeated so far this year.
	   Boca won the Apertura championship on Sunday with two games to
go in the season after second-place Gimnasia Esgrima de La Plata
tied Rosario Central 1-1. Nine points separated the two teams going
into Sunday's games.
	   Boca Juniors became the first champion to be crowned in South
America's top leagues with championships in Chile and Brazil to be
decided in the coming weeks.
	   The Boca celebrations began just after the start of the second
half of Boca's game against Independiente, which they eventually
tied 0-0, when fans caught wind of the news of the Gimansia tie.
From that point on, even a Boca loss would have given them the
championship.
	   Thousands of fans filled the streets around Boca's La Bombonera
stadium, chanting and dancing in zealous celebration as the
festivities ran late into the night.
	   But weekend play did little to clarify the race between Chile's
two contenders.
	   League leader Colo Colo and Universidad de Chile both won their
games and the point differential between the two teams still stands
at one point heading into the season's final two games.
	   Colo Colo knocked off Cobreloa 3-0 while Universidad de Chile
defeated La Serena by the same score.
	   Universidad's striker, Leonardo Rodriguez netted two goals and
again showed why he has been crucial to his team's ascent from once
being nearly 12 points back in the standings.
	   Meanwhile, Colo Colo has relied on a younger, revamped team that
has not shown a willingness to yield to the pressure of the
season's final push for the championship.
	   But scheduling may play a factor and give an edge to Universidad
who will play at home next week while Colo heads off to face a
tough Concepcion team. Universidad finishes off the season at home
with what should be an easy match against Huachipato.
	   Santos and Cruzeiro won their opening games in Sunday's
semifinal round of the first-division championship and took a huge
step toward reaching the Super Bowl of Brazilian soccer.
	   Santos, playing at home in Vila Belmiro, overcame a first-minute
goal to beat Corinthians 2-1.
	   Corinthians coach Wanderley Luxemburgo, who also is manager of
the Brazilian national team, took the field protected by the
plastic shields of police riot troopers. Local fans, still irate
that he left Santos to coach Corinthians, threw coins at Luxemburgo
and called him ``mercenary'' and less printable epithets.
	   Viola, for years the idol of Corinthians, this time was their
executioner. In the 82nd minute, he outleaped two Corinthians
defenders and headed in a loose ball in front of the net.
	   Viola now leads the league scoring race with 20 goals, nine
fewer than the record set by Edmundo last year.
	   Corinthians, which had the best regular-season record of the 24
clubs, now needs at least a win and a tie to reach the finals,
while Santos can qualify with two ties in the remaining games.
Although Santos has been a powerhouse ever since Pele's heyday in
the 1950s and '60s, the team has never won a national championship
since the tournament began in 1971.
	   In the other semifinal, Cruzeiro also grabbed the advantage from
Portuguesa with a 3-1 victory at home in Belo Horizonte. With more
than 100,000 people packing Mineirao stadium, Cruzeiro took a 1-0
lead on Marcelo Ramos tap-in of a rebound in the 13th minute.
	   In injury time, Portugesa centerforward Leandro set up Alex
Alves with a low cross, and the forward scored the game's loveliest
goal, a behind-the-back heel tap that rolled into the near corner
as Fabiano was caught leaping the wrong way.
	   Cruzeiro can qualify for the finals with a tie and even a loss
by a one-goal margin in its remaining games. Like Santos, Cruzeiro
-- a two-time winner of the Liberators Cup -- has never won the
national crown.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza arrived in Madrid Monday to press his case for having
former dictator Augusto Pinochet face justice in Chile instead of
Spain.
	   ``The political climate in Spain is not favorable to Sen.
Pinochet and that carries weight in the judicial process even
beyond the will of the judges to be impartial,'' Insulza told
reporters after meeting with Federico Trillo, speaker of the
Cortes, the lower house of Parliament.
	   Upon arrival at the airport from London, Insulza said he didn't
have ``any expectations'' from his two-day visit to Spain other
than to gain information.
	   Insulza spent four days in Britain trying to persuade Britain's
Labor Party government not to extradite Pinochet to Spain to face
charges of murder, torture and genocide during his 1973-1990 rule.
Insulza maintained Pinochet may be tried in Chile if he is allowed
to go home.
	   On Tuesday, he will meet with Foreign Minister Abel Matutes and
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   Aznar, speaking from Portugal, said Monday that his government
will maintain its position of not interfering with the judicial
process.
	   ``If the British government decides not to take into
consideration Gen. Pinochet's extradition, the Spanish government
will accept it, and if Britain extradites him, Spanish justice (the
judicial system) has to deal with the case,'' Aznar said.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide
whether to permit extradition proceedings to begin.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A reputed Russian mafia leader went on trial
Monday in Switzerland, and the judge promptly rejected defense
arguments that the case had been compromised by media reports and
heavy security.
	   The trial is expected to last two weeks _ far longer than most
Swiss criminal cases. Some of the 90 witnesses were issued
bulletproof vests, and there was heavy security Monday inside and
outside the courthouse.
	   Prosecutors say the defendant, Sergei Mikhailov, heads the
Moscow-based Solntsevskaya crime organization and is linked to the
worldwide network of mafia godfather Vyacheslav Ivankov.
	   Mikhailov, 40, faces a maximum of 7 1/2 years in prison if
convicted of being a member of a criminal organization and of
breaking Swiss property laws in acquiring a villa near Geneva.
	   He denies the charges against him, saying he is an ordinary
businessman.
	   On Monday, Mikhailov appeared relaxed as proceedings opened with
the judge throwing out a request by his lawyers to postpone the
trial.
	   The court rejected their claim that his case has been
compromised by media reports and the tight security measures.
	   Defense attorneys also claimed that the case was invalid under
European human rights law. The court rejected the motion.
	   Mikhailov was arrested two years ago at Geneva airport. He was
originally accused of money laundering, but during the
investigation that charge was dropped because of problems of
gathering evidence in Russia.
	   Among the prosecution witnesses will be former Moscow police
officer Nikolai Oporov, who has been given political asylum in
Switzerland and is under heavy guard.
	   Also due to testify is Mikhailov's former lawyer, who is himself
awaiting trial. The attorney was arrested leaving the prison where
Mikhailov was being held with letters which had not passed through
the censor.
	   One witness prosecutors had hoped to call, Vadim Rozenbaum, was
assassinated in the Netherlands in 1997.

Deutsche Bank approves deal to acquire Bankers Trust for dlrs 10.1
</HEADLINE>
billion &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES analyst reax &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank,
announced Monday that it will acquire Bankers Trust Corp. in a dlrs
10.1 billion deal that will create the world's largest financial
institution.
	   The deal is part of Deutsche Bank's strategy to expand in the
United States, and to ensure the merger's success Deutsche Bank has
dedicated dlrs 400 million to retain top staff from both banks for
an unspecified period.
	   The acquisition of Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest bank in the
United States, is the largest takeover of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank, creating an institution with assets
of more than dlrs 800 billion. That surpasses UBS AG of
Switzerland, currently the largest bank, and the recently formed
Citigroup Inc.
	   The boards of both banks approved the offer Sunday, and the
merger is to be completed by May.
	   Top executives and bankers will be offered either lump payments
or raises to discourage them from defecting, a common result of
mergers, Deutsche Bank spokesman Ronald Weichert said.
	   Weichert dismissed as ``illusory, unrealistic and wrong''
reports that top employees would get dlrs 10 million each, but
declined to provide a figure on the size of individual payments.
	   The merger should result in cost synergies, or areas where
duplication of services will allow cuts, of about 1.7 billion marks
(dlrs 1 billion) by the year 2001.
	   Deutsche Bank Chairman Rolf Breuer warned of job losses _ 5,500
positions _ at a news conference in Frankfurt. The cuts will be
mainly in London and New York, and will affect employees from both
banks.
	   Deutsche Bank said the deal would be financed partly with a 4
billion mark (dlrs 2.35 billion) capital increase, and a one-time
1.7 billion mark (dlrs 1 billion) restructuring charge for
personnel. The dlrs 400 million retention payments were part of the
overall cost of the deal, Weichert said.
	   The restructuring charge will affect Deutsche Bank's earnings,
but Breuer did not say in which quarter the charge would be made.
	   Deutsche Bank shares were down 2.25 marks (dlrs 1.32), or 2.1
percent, at 104.65 marks (dlrs 61.56) at the close of trading in
Frankfurt, reflecting investor dissatisfaction with details of the
merger.
	   ``The earnings forecast is terribly optimistic,'' said Mark
Kehoe, analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. Other
analysts agreed, saying they were not clear how the bank arrived at
a projected 10-15 percent increase in earnings per share in 2001
for the combined group.
	   Analysts also said the projected job cuts sounded high
considering each bank's operations in the other's market. Deutsche
Bank has 2,000 employees in the United States, while Bankers Trust
has about 2,500 staff in London, they noted.
	   Some analysts said rough estimates show that only about 20-25
precent of the 5,500 job to be cut will stem from overlapping
businesses.
	   Deutsche Bank acknowledged that the deal was worth more than
Bankers Trust's assets, and said that it would make annual goodwill
payments of 630 million marks (dlrs 370 million) over 15 years.
	   The merger is part of Deutsche Bank's strategy to extend
operations into North America. But responding to analyst and market
concerns that the bank would lose focus on Europe, Deutsche Bank
said that it plans to expand its European asset management and
custody business.
	   Both Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are in the midst of
individual restructuring efforts aimed at cutting costs. Deutsche
Bank announced early this year a 2.5 billion mark (dlrs 1.5
billion) restructuring, while Bankers Trust announced a dlrs 300
million restructuring effort at the end of the third quarter.
	   The merger must obtain approval of both New York state and U.S.
federal banking regulators.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Opening a genocide trial Monday at
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, a U.N. prosecutor said a Bosnian
man who called himself the ``Serb Adolph'' was guilty of far more
than the dozen killings he has admitted.
	   Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic used the nickname Adolf ``with a
perverse pride in the genocidal symbolism it represented'' and once
bragged that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning
coffee,'' said U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers.
	   To his Muslim targets, the 30-year-old mechanic was ``the face
of genocide,'' Bowers said.
	   Jelisic pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and
Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko,
northern Bosnia, in May 1992.
	   Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war
crimes and crimes against humanity _ and the likelihood of a
maximum life sentence _ Jelisic has denied that the killing spree
constituted genocide.

Report: Inter fires embattled coach Simoni
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with club spokesman quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Internazionale of Milan fired coach Luigi
Simoni on Monday, ending his stormy stay with the Italian League
club after one-plus seasons and a UEFA Cup title, the ANSA news
agency reported.
	   The news came hours after Simoni was named Coach of the Year by
the Italian Soccer Federation, based on a vote by coaches in the
first and second divisions.
	   ``There will be an announcement (Tuesday). I can not confirm the
report, nor can I deny it,'' Inter spokesman Sandro Sabatini told
The Associated Press.
	   ANSA quoted Simoni as saying, ``It's true, I have been fired. I
did not expect this at all. I am very disappointed.''
	   Simoni appeared to have saved his job last Wednesday, when Inter
beat Spain's Real Madrid 3-1 to get the inside track on a Champions
Cup quarterfinal berth.
	   But the team played poorly in Serie A action Sunday, needing two
late goals to rally for a 2-1 home victory over next-to-last
Salernitana.
	   Inter is tied for sixth place in the 18-team Italian League with
a 5-2-4 record. Club owner Massimo Moratti has shelled out millions
of dollars to sign such stars as Brazil's Ronaldo, Italy's Roberto
Baggio, Chile's Ivan Zamorano, France's Youri Djorkaeff and
Argentina's Diego Simeone, and said at the start of the season that
he would settle for nothing less than the franchise's first league
title since 1989.
	   After joining Inter from Napoli for last season, Simoni guided
the Milan club to the UEFA Cup trophy and a second-place finish in
Serie A.
	   Simoni has come under fire for failing to instill a conhesive
style of play and was widely seen as a lame-duck coach, with
current Juventus of Turin coach Marcello Lippi _ whose contract
expires in June _ reportedly headed to Inter at the start of next
season.
	   In the interim, speculation centers on Romanian coach Mircea
Lucescu filling in for the rest of this campaign. Lucescu has
previously coached Italian clubs Pisa, Brescia and Reggiana.

Pilot errors apparently caused crash of Ukrainian passenger jet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Repeated pilot errors, bad preparation,
and an inadequate plane apparently were the main reasons for last
year's crash of a Ukrainian passenger jet that killed 74 people.
	   According a report released Monday by the Greek Transport
Ministry, an investigation into the Dec. 17, 1997 crash found that
the three-man crew was allegedly responsible for flying the jet
into a mountain range in northern Greece.
	   ``This is an important document for the avoidance of similar
accidents in the future,'' said Transport Minister Tassos Mandelis.
	   Mandelis said the report would be made available to prosecutors
looking into the accident, and the civil aviation authorities of
Russia and the Ukraine.
	   Flying from Odessa to the northern port city of Salonica at
night and in bad weather, the plane crashed into the snow-covered
Pieria mountains. The crash came while it was attempting a second
landing in Salonica. There were no survivors.
	   The Yak-42 and its crew was chartered by Aerosweet, a private
company, from the Ukrainian Lviv State Aviation Enterprise to
replace a Boeing 737 flying from Odessa Salonica. The 737 had
developed engine trouble after the first leg of a flight that
originated in Kiev.
	   According to the report, the Yak's main radio navigational
instrument was broken, the three pilots had never flown to Salonica
airport, and one of the crew members was an instructor who only
confused the situation in the cockpit.
	   ``The lack of a leadership personality in the cockpit,'' the
report said, resulted in a ``disorganized, confused and
dysfunctional cockpit crew.''
	   Further complicating the situation, the crew had the wrong map
in the cockpit. That map showed that Salonica airport had a ground
approach radar, which it does not.
	   A military radar site was available, but the crew never declared
an in-flight emergency. If an emergency had been declared, the
radar would have been made available.
	   But the report also added the crew apparently did not properly
use the navigational aids that were available at Salonica airport.
	   As a result, the cockpit crew became disoriented and missed its
first approach. According to the report, it followed faulty
procedures after that, flying west towards the mountain range
instead of back towards the airport.
	   ``The failure of the cockpit crew to declare a state of
emergency, when it lost its orientation following the procedures
for a failed landing, despite numerous alarming messages that
informed it about the situation,'' helped lead to the crash, the
report said.
	   The crew's last and fatal mistake, the report said, was to
apparently ignore a 30 second alarm that the plane was about to
crash into the ground, and pull the jet's nose up into a climb.
	   If the crew had done so, the jet ``would have probably flow over
the mountains.''

Search for premier after Hariri reportedly will not seek job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business
tycoon who launched Lebanon's multibillion dollar reconstruction
from the devastation of civil war, hinted Monday that he would bow
out as premier after a dispute with the new president.
	   Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new
government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by the
possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect
Lebanon's economic recovery.
	   However, Hariri's decision, which was leaked to the media, did
not slam the door on his participation in the government.
	   His Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
President Emile Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday.
	   Lahoud on Monday set the stage for choosing a new prime minister
when he scheduled a fresh round of consultations this week with
Parliament. In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri earlier declined to
form the next government.
	   The offer came after the 128 legislators polled by the president
gave Hariri a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing
he had received in his previous three mandates since 1992.
	   Although Hariri did not say it outright, sources close to him
said he was not a candidate in the next round of selection.
	   The two leaders appear to be in dispute over who will have the
upper hand in governing the nation of 3.2 million. A brief meeting
on Monday apparently did not help resolve the disagreements.
	   Lahoud, 62, is an army commander who wants to assert his
authority at the start of his six-year presidential term. Hariri,
53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country since he
became premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi.
	   Lahoud, who enjoys widespread popular backing after succeeding
in rebuilding an army fractured by civil war, pledged in a tough
inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
	   Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and
stabilizing the national currency. His globe-trotting travels to
drum up political and economic support were sometimes instrumental
in drawing international financial aid and investment.
	   But he was faulted for declining living standards at home and a
rise in corruption in government.

Mitchell returns to Belfast, denies fresh mediator's role
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Former U.S. Sen. George
Mitchell, the patient chairman of Northern Ireland's peace
negotiations, returned to Belfast on Monday to get the inside scoop
on why key parts of the 7-month-old agreement weren't working.
	   He met separately with Protestant politician David Trimble, the
would-be leader of a new compromise government for Northern
Ireland, and Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
whose militant Catholic supporters are demanding positions in that
government.
	   Trimble is refusing on the grounds that the Irish Republican
Army hasn't yet begun to destroy its secret weapons stockpiles.
April's accord didn't set this condition, but many Protestants
insist upon it as proof that the IRA _ 16 months into a truce _ has
really renounced violence.
	   Mitchell said he wasn't surprised by the current difficulties
besetting he accord he helped achieve.
	   ``I recognized there would be many difficulties ahead,'' he
said. ``The agreement, while a huge accomplishment, did not
guarantee peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. It just
makes them possible.''
	   Mitchell's former colleague in directing the Northern Ireland
negotiations, retired Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, is now
chairman of a commission supposed to oversee the gradual
disarmament of the IRA and outlawed pro-British paramilitary groups
by mid-2000, the deadline specified in the accord.
	   Accompanying Mitchell was Harri Holkeri, the former Finnish
prime minister who was the third international chairman of the
negotiations, which lasted from June 1996 to April 1998.
	   After meeting Mitchell, Adams said he had urged the former
Senate majority leader to renew his own direct role, specifically
to oversee a ``review'' of progress in enacting each section of the
accord.
	   But Mitchell _ speaking at a joint press conference with Trimble
_ emphasized he wasn't prepared to make another indefinite
commitment of time to Northern Ireland to mediate a way through the
current deadlock.
	   Local newspaper reports that he was acting this week as an
intermediary to President Clinton in advance of a fresh White House
diplomatic intervention were ``simply inaccurate,'' he said.
	   ``I think the last thing that these political leaders need is
for me to be preaching at them from the sidelines,'' Mitchell said.
	   Mitchell insisted his visit was incidental to his receiving an
honorary degree Sunday from University College Cork in Ireland's
southwest, and more business engagements in London on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   ``Whenever I'm in Ireland I make it a point to come back to
Northern Ireland, because I have many friends here and have a great
interest in what's occurring,'' he said.
	   Also Monday, Sinn Fein officials testified before a commission
empowered to recommend the reform of Northern Ireland's
predominantly Protestant police force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
	   Sinn Fein told the commission's chairman, former Hong Kong
Governor Chris Patten, that any future police force should be
disarmed, be cut from the current 13,000 members to 3,000, bar
members of Protestant fraternal orders, and be open to employ
former IRA members.
	   The accord specifies that Patten should publish recommendations
in mid-1999.

EU farm chief asks farmers to accept tough spending reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add dropped overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler told European farmers Monday if they want to preserve
their sector they must accept the drastic reforms in farm spending
he has put forward.
	   He said it was imperative for EU farmers to stop adding to
stocks of surplus food that subsidies have made so costly it cannot
be sold on world markets, said Fischler.
	   ``If we want agriculture in Europe to have a future we must make
sure it can be more competitive,'' he told the association of EU
farmers, the most powerful lobby in Brussels and one resisting the
changes Fischler is seeking.
	   Yet Fischler said those reforms would prevent the EU farm sector
from becoming the sort of heartless industry seen in the United
States ``which is concerned only with producing as cheaply as
possible per hectare or per livestock unit.''
	   His proposal for deep cuts in subsidies as of 2000, compensated
by direct aid to regions in decline and farmers are to keep costs
down as the EU prepares to take in a dozen newcomers in the decade
ahead.
	   Also, reform of EU farm spending _ which eats up half the EU's
1998 budget of dlrs 100 billion _ is to give the EU a reasonable
negotiating stance in agricultural talks in the World Trade
Organization next year.
	   The European Commission has proposed a 30 percent reduction for
beef subsidies, 20 percent for cereals and 15 percent for dairy
products.
	   Those cuts would be compensated by direct income support for
farmers.
	   The aim is to sever the link between subsidies and output that
long saddled the EU with food surpluses and soured trade ties with
Washington.
	   Fischler urged farmers to show ``Europe's agricultural sector is
indeed capable of carrying out these reforms.''
	   If not, he predicted the EU would have to take 20 percent of
cereal lands out of production, impose mass culls to curb beef
production and set ever stricter milk quotas, along with fines for
quota violators.
	   Fischler unveiled his proposals last March. EU farmers and
several EU governments have given them an icy welcome.
	   Germany, which assumes the EU's rotating presidency in January,
has said it wants to conclude the farm reform negotiations by next
March to help smooth the entry of new EU members in the years
ahead.
	   The problem with surplus food stocks in Europe is that subsidies
have made the food so pricey it cannot be sold on the world market
where prices are lower. Traditionally, the EU then paid food
exporters the difference between the EU and world prices but those
``export subsidies'' have long been a source of dispute with
Washington which sees them as an unfair trade practice.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of Iranians mourning the stabbing
to death of a dissident and his wife took to the streets Monday
demanding the release of political prisoners.
	   Some 10,000 mourners who had gathered at the Fakhr Mosque in
central Tehran to pray for Dariush Foruhar and his wife, whose
murdered bodies were discovered in their home more than a week ago,
poured into the streets chanting pro-democracy slogans.
	   ``Release all political prisoners,'' the protesters demanded.
``Freedom, security _ that is what we want,'' the crowd chanted in
unison.
	   Iranian officials say there are no political prisoners in Iran,
but international human rights organizations accuse Iran of
arbitrary arrest and detention and unfair trials.
	   Police closed off the streets around the mosque and ordered the
crowd to disperse. The protest ended without violence.
	   President Mohammad Khatami has ordered an investigation into the
murders, and police say they have several suspects. But no
information has been made public.
	   Over the past year, vigilantes who oppose Khatami's liberal
reform program, have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and
even a reformist Cabinet minister.
	   Foruhar, 70, was the leader of the Iran Nation Party, a small
opposition group that is tolerated by the government.
	   He served as minister of labor and social affairs in the
provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy.
	   His wife, Parvaneh, was in her mid-50s.

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec voters, courted more persistently than
voters almost anywhere, chose a provincial government Monday in an
election that could move Canada a big step closer to another
traumatic showdown over secession.
	   The separatist Parti Quebecois, under the charismatic leadership
of Premier Lucien Bouchard, was widely favored to return to power.
If victorious, Bouchard planned to call another referendum on
independence whenever he felt conditions were right for a
separatist triumph.
	   Bouchard's main rival was Jean Charest, leader of the
anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party, who tried to convince voters
that the province could prosper only if the decades-old threat of
secession was abandoned.
	   Charest, 40, became an early favorite when he quit federal
politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking
Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.
	   But despite his family roots in Quebec, he was widely perceived
by the province's French-speaking majority as more of an outsider
than Bouchard, and less likely to do battle for the province in any
confrontations with the federal government.
	   Bouchard, 59, has maintained high popularity ratings despite
overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a
drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among francophones, he has never
lost the mythic aura he gained when, after losing a leg and almost
dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994, he came back to lead the
separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.
	   The Parti Quebecois went into this election holding 74 of the
legislature's 125 seats, while the Liberals had 45 and needed a
gain of 18 for a majority.
	   There were 5.2 million eligible voters, and turnout was expected
to be 80 or 90 percent even though this was the fourth
province-wide vote in the past five years. Weather in the populous
Montreal area was overcast and warm; there was snow in some
northern regions.
	   Party organizers were seeking to get their supporters to the
polls early enough so they could get home for the 7:30 p.m. start
of ``La Petite Vie,'' a hugely popular TV comedy that has been
drawing more than 3 million Quebec viewers every Monday.
	   The final round of polls showed support for the Parti Quebecois
at about 47 percent and the Liberals at about 41 percent, with most
other voters backing Democratic Action, led by 28-year-old Mario
Dumont, who favors greater autonomy for Quebec but stops short of
advocating outright secession.
	   If the separatists won decisively, with perhaps 80 seats and 50
percent of the popular vote, there could be pressure from Parti
Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum quickly. A
narrow separatist win would likely prompt a more cautious approach,
while a loss to Charest would sidetrack the separatist cause for
years.
	   Twice before, separatists lost secession referendums, by a big
margin in 1980 and narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, anxious to avoid a third defeat, said he would call
another referendum only when convinced the separatists would win.
In the meantime, he says he would seek more autonomy for all 10
provinces, particularly in regard to control over social programs.
	   Many Quebeckers support Bouchard even though they oppose
secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of voters would
support independence now, and about two-thirds do not want a
referendum on secession in the next few years.
	   Wooing these voters, Bouchard tried to portray the election as
the choice of the most competent leadership, with the thorny
question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

Gov't reshuffle set for early December, Workers Party leader says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia will resign
in early December, a leader of the leftist Workers Party said
Monday.
	   Louisa Hanoune, speaking at a news conference, said President
Liamine Zeroual had told her in a meeting Sunday that Ouyahia and
several other government ministers would be stepping down ``around
Dec. 10.''
	   Previously, the government had said Ouyahia's government would
``very probably'' resign after presenting Parliament with the
annual report of its work sometime in December.
	   Zeroual said that in addition to Ouyahia, Communications
Minister Hamraoui Habib Chawki, interim Justice Minister Hamed Nouj
and Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mansour would be resigning,
according to Hanoune.
	   Zeroual did not reveal who would replace the ministers, Hanoune
said, but noted only that the successors would be ``non-partisan.''
	   Zeroual met with Hanoune to discuss presidential elections,
which are now set for April.
	   In September, the Algerian President announced that he would cut
short his five-year term which normally ends in the year 2000.
	   Ouyahia, prime minister since January 1996, has not denied
rumors over his own reported plans to run for the presidency.
	   Names of numerous potential candidates have circulated
unofficially. In the past, it has been the army that determines the
nation's president, drawn from military ranks. Zeroual is a retired
general.

British backpacker held for a month in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British backpacker who strayed across the North
Korean border was seized at gunpoint and held captive for a month,
the Foreign Office confirmed Monday.
	   Joel Emond, 18, said he was vacationing in China in September
when he strayed across the unmarked North Korean border near the
extinct Changbai volcano. Accused of being a spy, he was arrested
at gunpoint and held at a military base, he said.
	   He was finally released Oct. 29.
	   ``The people seemed very friendly, but suddenly I was surrounded
by North Korean soldiers who marched me off,'' Emond said from his
home in Bristol, west of London. ``They seemed to think initially
that I was a spy. I was held in solitary confinement and that,
coupled with the contaminated food I was given, was a pretty nasty
combination.''
	   Emond, who was traveling alone in northeast China, was finally
released after North Korean authorities contacted the United
Nations in New York.
	   ``We can confirm that the North Korean authorities arrested Joel
on Sept. 28 for entering North Korea illegally,'' said a Foreign
Office spokesman, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
``He was on holiday when he inadvertently strayed across the North
Korean border.''
	   ``We were told on Oct. 7 and thanks to cooperative efforts in
the United Kingdom, New York and the Chinese authorities, Joel was
repatriated to China on Oct. 29,'' the spokesman said. ``We are
pleased there has been a satisfactory conclusion to this
incident.''

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec voters, courted more persistently than
voters almost anywhere, chose a provincial government Monday in an
election that could move Canada a big step closer to another
traumatic showdown over secession.
	   The separatist Parti Quebecois, under the charismatic leadership
of Premier Lucien Bouchard, was widely favored to return to power.
If victorious, Bouchard planned to call another referendum on
independence whenever he felt conditions were right for a
separatist triumph.
	   Bouchard's main rival was Jean Charest, leader of the
anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party, who tried to convince voters
that the province could prosper only if the decades-old threat of
secession was abandoned.
	   Charest, 40, became an early favorite when he quit federal
politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking
Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.
	   But despite his family roots in Quebec, he was widely perceived
by the province's French-speaking majority as more of an outsider
than Bouchard, and less likely to do battle for the province in any
confrontations with the federal government.
	   Bouchard, 59, has maintained high popularity ratings despite
overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a
drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among francophones, he has never
lost the mythic aura he gained when, after losing a leg and almost
dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994, he came back to lead the
separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.
	   The Parti Quebecois went into this election holding 74 of the
legislature's 125 seats, while the Liberals had 45 and needed a
gain of 18 for a majority.
	   There were 5.2 million eligible voters, and turnout was expected
to be 80 or 90 percent even though this was the fourth
province-wide vote in the past five years. Weather in the populous
Montreal area was overcast and warm; there was snow in some
northern regions.
	   Party organizers were seeking to get their supporters to the
polls early enough so they could get home for the 7:30 p.m. start
of ``La Petite Vie,'' a hugely popular TV comedy that has been
drawing more than 3 million Quebec viewers every Monday.
	   The final round of polls showed support for the Parti Quebecois
at about 47 percent and the Liberals at about 41 percent, with most
other voters backing Democratic Action, led by 28-year-old Mario
Dumont, who favors greater autonomy for Quebec but stops short of
advocating outright secession.
	   If the separatists won decisively, with perhaps 80 seats and 50
percent of the popular vote, there could be pressure from Parti
Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum quickly. A
narrow separatist win would likely prompt a more cautious approach,
while a loss to Charest would sidetrack the separatist cause for
years.
	   Twice before, separatists lost secession referendums, by a big
margin in 1980 and narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, anxious to avoid a third defeat, said he would call
another referendum only when convinced the separatists would win.
In the meantime, he says he would seek more autonomy for all 10
provinces, particularly in regard to control over social programs.
	   Many Quebeckers support Bouchard even though they oppose
secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of voters would
support independence now, and about two-thirds do not want a
referendum on secession in the next few years.
	   Wooing these voters, Bouchard tried to portray the election as
the choice of the most competent leadership, with the thorny
question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

Russian government again delays on budget plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with quote from analyst; Recasts 4th

 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government canceled a budget debate
Monday, one day before a visit by the head of the International
Monetary Fund, which is demanding a sound budget as a condition for
giving more aid to the crisis-ridden country.
	   The budget discussion was first rescheduled for Thursday, then
postponed until next week. The government insisted the delay was
not connected with the visit by IMF chief Michel Camdessus, but
gave few other details.
	   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has warned that
Russia would suffer serious problems if it doesn't get more aid
from the IMF. But the IMF and Western governments say they won't
provide any cash until Russia adopts a realistic budget.
	   Russia's shaky markets, aggravated by the Asian crisis,
collapsed in August after the government defaulted on treasury
debts and devalued the currency. Since then, the government has
produced no comprehensive plans to tackle the crisis.
	   It has, however, included IMF aid in next year's budget.
	   Alexander Pochinok, a senior economic policymaker, was quoted as
saying Sunday that a 1999 draft budget assumes that Russia will
receive the remaining dlrs 17.5 billion from a 22.6 billion IMF-led
bailout package reached in July _ an inclusion criticized by the
IMF mission that visited Moscow earlier this month.
	   The IMF froze the loan package in August after the crisis
erupted.
	   But the IMF, under increasing criticism for its policies amid
economic troubles worldwide, is also eager to ensure that Russia's
pays off its debts to foreign creditors, including the IMF.
	   ``For the (IMF) at this point it's very embarrassing to have
Russia not pay,'' Parvoleta Shtereva, an analyst with the Moscow
brokerage MFK Renaissance.
	   The IMF has assailed the government's 1999 budget revenue
forecast as oo optimistic and criticized the government's plan to
lower some taxes and offer support to ailing industries.
	   The government backtracked slightly Monday, saying the
value-added tax would only be lowered from 20 percent to 15 percent
_ not to 14 percent as earlier planned.
	   The extra 1 percentage point would be used to finance the
flailing coal industry and agriculture, Zadornov said.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov told reporters Monday
that the government would need several days to finalize changes in
the budget's tax projections and therefore couldn't complete the
new draft this week. Maslyukov said the Cabinet would likely debate
the budget Dec. 10, the Interfax reported.
	   Russia's finance minister on Sunday repeated pleas for IMF
assistance.
	   ``Money is not the main thing we need from the IMF, although we
need that too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax
news agency. ``We above all expect understanding from the IMF, and
a program to relieve Russia's debt.'' Russia has dlrs 17.5 billion
in foreign debt coming due in 1999, and has warned that it cannot
make the payments without a rescheduling.

 &UR; Italian man confesses on-camera killing family, missing since 1989
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian man confessed on-camera to killing his
entire family in 1989, calmly telling interviewers that ``it was an
act of complete madness.''
	   In an interview broadcast on state TV Monday night, Ferdinando
Carretta, 36, said he shot his father, mother and brother to death
at the family apartment in the northern city of Parma.
	   The family _ including Ferdinando _ vanished, apparently while
on a camping trip. Their fate was one of Italy's most enduring
mysteries until now.
	   Ferdinando surfaced by accident in London when police stopped
him on a routine traffic violation. A computer check showed he was
listed as a missing person and Italian authorities were notified.
	   On Sunday, he returned to Italy and was arrested at the airport
on a warrant for triple homicide. Shortly afterward, he confessed
to police.
	   ``He couldn't wait to confess,'' an investigating magistrate,
Vittorio Zanichelli, told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   It was not his first confession, as things turned out.
	   A few days before his return, Carretta was interviewed in London
by an Italian TV program about missing persons. The show's director
accompanied him back to Italy.
	   Parts of the interview were aired on the news Monday night.
	   ``I shot my parents and my brother,'' he said. ``It was an act
of madness, an act of complete madness.''
	   Carretta told police he'd taken the bodies to a garbage dump on
the banks of a river outside Parma. On Monday, he went with
investigators to the huge dump, but apparently couldn't identify
the spot where'd he left the bodies.
	   The ANSA news agency said investigators planned to bring in
technical experts to advise them on how to proceed with the search.
	   State television said Carretta will undergo a psychiatric
examination on Tuesday.
	   Giuseppe Carretta, 53, his wife Marta Chezzi, 49, and younger
son Nicola, 23, were last seen the night of Aug. 4, 1989, preparing
to leave on vacation in their camper. The camper was found, empty
and abandoned on Nov. 19, 1989, in Milan.
	   Their strange disappearance fueled elaborate speculation,
including a rumor that Giuseppe Carretta, an accountant, has
embezzled a fortune and had fled to the Caribbean or South America.
But no trace of the family was found.
	   Suspicion also focused on Ferdinando, who bought a pistol just
before the family disappeared. But he, too, remained missing and
the investigation was eventually closed.
	   Italian newspapers said Carretta lived modestly in one-room
apartment in a blue-collar neighborhood of London under his own
name and worked as a messenger for an express delivery service.
	   The TV director, Pino Rinaldi, told the newspaper Corriere della
Sera that police had violated their agreement with him on how to
handle Carretta's return.
	   He said police had agreed to treat him gently, in light of his
``psychological fragility.'' Instead, he said police made a ``big
show'' of the arrest at the Rome airport.

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A Juventus official confirmed Monday the
Italian club will show for its politically tinged Champions League
match against Turkey's Galatasaray, but said the players are
worried as they prepare to head to Istanbul.
	   ``We are ready to go, but we will not be going calmly,''
Juventus general director Luciano Moggi said. ``We still want
guarantees of security. We want to know what the security measures
are, not just that there are measures.''
	   In a concession to the players' misgivings, the club switched
its travel plans and will fly to Istanbul the day of the game,
Wednesday, and depart immediately after the match, the ANSA news
agency reported.
	   Juventus had planned to head to Istanbul on Tuesday.
	   Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader who was
arrested in Rome three weeks ago has prompted anti-Italian
demonstrations in Turkey.
	   With tensions high, European soccer's governing body UEFA
postponed by one week the Champions League match, which was
originally slated for last Wednesday.
	   Several Juventus players, including French World Cup hero
Zinedine Zidane, had threatened to refuse to play in Istanbul.
	   ``We were kind of forced to go to play. We're very worried,''
Juventus 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi said. ``UEFA and the Italian and
Turkish governments know that they have taken on a big
responsibility.''
	   Moggi and Peruzzi spoke to reporters after club officials and
players met for an hour following team practice.
	   While Juve is headed to Istanbul, an Italian delegation due to
take part there in an annual international meeting to promote peace
canceled its trip citing security concerns, Turkey's Anatolia news
agency reported.

A century after jail for homosexuality, Wilde honored with London

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Oscar Wilde, the Irish poet, playwright,
storyteller and wit whose work still captivates millions, was given
his first statute in London on Monday _ a century after he was
disgraced and jailed for homosexuality in a great Victorian
scandal.
	   He is modeled in his favorite pose, talking and with a cigarette
in his upraised right hand.
	   ``A cigarette in Wilde's day was a symbol of a young man's
decadence and modernity and is now a symbol of political
incorrectness,'' said actor Stephen Fry, who played the lead role
in the film ``Wilde.''
	   ``Showing him smoking is yet again a big finger shoved in the
face of society,'' Fry added.
	   The striking memorial near Traflagar Square is a one-and-a-half
times life-size bronze head of Wilde rising from a nine-foot (2.7
meter) coffin-shaped block of black marble, and titled ``A
Conversation with Oscar Wilde 1854-1900.''
	   The block ``makes a seat on which passersby can complete the
work by sitting to have a chat,'' said sculptor Maggi Hambling,
interviewed at the unveiling ceremony next to the railings of a
historic church, St. Martin-in-the-Fields.
	   Passersby heard actors Dame Judi Dench and Nigel Hawthorne read
an extract from Wilde's ``A Woman Of No Importance,'' and afterward
they swarmed round the memorial, stroking the head and taking
snapshots.
	   ``All of us are in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the
stars,'' is inscribed on the marble block, a line from Wilde's
play, ``Lady Windermere's Fan.'' Other well-known works include
``The Importance Of Being Earnest'' (1899) and ``An Ideal Husband''
(1895).
	   A committee of 19 writers, actors, academics, philanthropists
and journalists, including Seamus Heaney, the Nobel Literature
Prize Irish poet, raised 150,000 pounds (dlrs 249,000) to pay for
the statue.
	   It was unveiled on the anniversary of Wilde's death at age 46 in
Paris in self-exile and poverty. He had been sentenced to two
years' jail in 1895 for homosexual practices revealed during his
abortive libel action against the Marquis of Queensberry.
	   The marquis had objected to Wilde's association with his son,
Lord Alfred Douglas. Wilde was released on May 18, 1897.
	   ``The fight that he waged for diversity in our society _ the
right to be different _ I think we have made substantial strides
towards winning and it is partly because of him,'' said Culture
Secretary Chris Smith, one of two openly homosexual members of the
Labor Party government's 22-strong Cabinet.
	   Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland said he felt Wilde wasn't
completely accepted yet in England because of his homosexuality,
adding ``but I think he soon will be.''
	   Among Wilde's best-remembered sayings were, ``I have nothing to
declare but my genius,'' when arriving at the New York customs
house.
	   And: ``America has been discovered before, but it has always
been hushed up.''

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's top brass and civilian leaders
agreed Monday to keep pressing Italy for the return of a Kurdish
rebel leader so he can stand trial in Turkey, reports said.
	   Turkey has been angered by a decision by Germany and Italy to
push for an international tribunal to try Abdullah Ocalan, leader
of Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984.
	   Ocalan was detained in Rome on Nov. 12. Ankara wants him
extradited, but Italy is reluctant to hand him to Turkey where he
faces the death penalty. Ocalan is also wanted in Germany, but
German officials say they will not seek his extradition.
	   In a statement released after more than six hours of
discussions, the National Security Council said it ``reviewed all
developments'' since Ocalan's detention and agreed to continue with
the struggle against terrorism in a ``determined and uninterrupted
manner.''
	   The all powerful military has said little since the crisis
erupted with Ocalan's arrest. Private NTV television said however
the top brass voiced determination to push for Ocalan's return to
that he stands trial on charges of terrorism.
	   The Turkish embassy in Rome was expected to hand over Turkey's
official request for extradition to Italian authorities later
Monday.
	   After fighting for over a decade, Turkey's military claims it
has all but eradicated the PKK in the southeast. It repeatedly
called on civilian leaders to take over the battle against
separatism, by investing in the impoverished southeast.
	   But politicians have failed to attract investments, and the
region remains stricken by unemployment _ one of the factors that
is said to push Kurds toward joining the PKK.
	   Italy has further infuriated the Turks by calling for a
political dialogue on the Kurdish problem.
	   ``The Italian government has manipulated the problem in a very
wrong, bad and insulting way,'' President Suleyman Demirel said
Sunday.
	   Demirel accused the West of having double standards and of not
applying international agreements against terrorism to the Ocalan
case. Turkey holds Ocalan responsible of the deaths of tens of
thousands of people.
	   The council meeting follows a solemn ceremony at Ankara's main
mosque for the 16 soldiers killed on Friday when PKK rebels downed
a helicopter near the Turkish-Iraqi border.
	   Fighting continued in the southeast Monday and in northern Iraq,
where the Turkish army launched an offensive earlier this month
against the rebels, the Anatolia news agency reported.

Brazilian fanatics kill six in religious purification ritual
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Led by a self-styled preacher,
religious fanatics slaughtered three adults and three children they
believed were possessed by the devil in a remote Amazon region in
northwestern Brazil.
	   The ritual killings occurred Nov.14 in an isolated rubber tree
plantation on the margins of the Tauari River, 3,000 kilometers
(1,860 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo.
	   Police only confirmed the killings on Monday after listening to
an eyewitness account by a survivor, who swam and walked more than
100 kilometers (60 miles) to the nearest town in the northwestern
state of Acre.
	   Francisco Oliveira de Franca was badly beaten with wooden sticks
but managed to escape after pretending to be dead, said Silvano
Alves Rabelo, the deputy secretary of Acre's security bureau.
	   ``Three adults and three children, aged 3,5 and 13 were beaten
and hacked to death with knives and axes,'' Rabelo said. ``The
three children were killed by their own father after he killed his
wife.''
	   Preacher Francisco Bezerra de Morais claimed ``the victims had
to be purified because they had been possessed by the devil,''
Rabelo said.
	   He and five others who allegedly killed the victims are in jail
awaiting trial and could be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison,
Rabelo said.
	   The preacher claims he belongs to the United Pentecostal Church
of Brazil, which has denied any connection to him.
	   The fanaticism, he said ``was clearly provoked by ignorance,
illiteracy and isolation.''
	   The community where the killings took place is only accessible
by boat or through narrow jungle trails, and is completely
isolated, Rabelo said.

 &UR; Gov't reshuffle set for early December, Workers Party leader says

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia will resign
in early December, a leader of the leftist Workers Party said
Monday.
	   Louisa Hanoune, speaking at a news conference, said President
Liamine Zeroual had told her in a meeting Sunday that Ouyahia and
several other government ministers would be stepping down ``around
Dec. 10.''
	   Previously, the government had said Ouyahia's government would
``very probably'' resign after presenting Parliament with the
annual report of its work sometime in December.
	   Zeroual said that in addition to Ouyahia, Communications
Minister Hamraoui Habib Chawki, interim Justice Minister Hamed Nouj
and Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mansour would be resigning,
according to Hanoune.
	   Zeroual did not reveal who would replace the ministers, Hanoune
said, but noted only that the successors would be ``non-partisan.''
	   Zeroual met with Hanoune to discuss presidential elections,
which are now set for April.
	   In September, the Algerian President announced that he would cut
short his five-year term which normally ends in the year 2000.
	   Ouyahia, prime minister since January 1996, has not denied
rumors over his own reported plans to run for the presidency.
	   Names of numerous potential candidates have circulated
unofficially. In the past, it has been the army that determines the
nation's president, drawn from military ranks. Zeroual is a retired
general.

Caribbean Christians send letter to Chinese protesting arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ A group of Protestant Christian
leaders in the Caribbean sent a letter Monday to the Chinese
embassy in Barbados demanding that China ease its crackdown on
underground churches.
	   The Evangelical Association of the Caribbean called the arrest
of religious leaders in the central Henan and Anhui provinces
``inhuman barbarism.''
	   Human rights groups have accused the Chinese government of
arresting as many as 140 church members on Oct. 26 and Nov. 5, then
torturing them or charging family members fines for their release.
	   Independent Protestant churches are illegal in China, which
requires all denominations to register under an umbrella China
Christian Council.
	   ``We find it incomprehensible ... that in your country
Christians are still being subjected to the institutionalized
inhuman barbarism of torture and persecution that we have suffered
since the first century under the iron fist of Nero's Roman
Empire,'' the group wrote.
	   The letter was signed by the association's general secretary,
Gerry Seale.
	   Chinese officials had not yet received the letter Monday and
would not comment, said Yin Youqiao, director of administration and
consular affairs at the embassy.
	   The group asked Chinese officials to guarantee the safety of two
religious leaders, Li Quingrui and Cheng Meiying. Cheng was beaten
with a rope whip and a police baton, leaving her with serious head
injuries, according to New York-based Human Rights in China.

New government promises prosperity, close ties with the West
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonia's new center-right coalition
government took office Monday with promises of economic recovery,
better relations with neighboring countries and close ties to the
United States.
	   ``Our main aims in foreign policy are full membership in the
European Union and NATO, continued friendly relations with the
United States, close and friendly relations with neighbors,'' said
Premier Ljubco Georgijevski.
	   Georgijevski and his 27-member Cabinet took power after his
VRMO-DPMNE party, in coalition with the Democratic Alternative,
defeated the reformed communists who formed the previous government
in elections earlier this month.
	   The two parties won a majority 120 seats in the assembly but
nonetheless included an ethnic Albanian party in the government as
a sign of good will, calculated to lessen ethnic tensions.
	   With unrest continuing in neighboring Kosovo as a result of
hostilities between majority ethnic Albanians and Serbian
authorities, the Macedonian government is keen to show it is ready
to make concessions to Macedonia's ethnic Albanians, a quarter of
the country's 2.2 million people.
	   State television reported that a majority of the house approved
the new government late Monday, but gave no specific vote counts.
	   In addition to the post of premier, Georgijevski's party's has
13 ministers in government. The Democratic Alternative and the
ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity have eight and five
government ministers respectively.
	   The new government will likely back the decision of its
predecessor to permit deployment of a 1,000-NATO force meant for
emergency rescue of international monitors in Kosovo should they
run into trouble.

Hospital tells Pinochet to go, saying he no longer needs care
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 2nd graf, DELETES redundant word psychiatric; 11th graf,
CORRECTS date moved to Grovelands to Oct. 29 sted Nov. 17 &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The London psychiatric hospital where Gen. Augusto
Pinochet is being held under police guard said Monday it wants him
to leave quickly, adding that the former Chilean dictator no longer
``requires specialist medical and nursing care.''
	   The statement by the Grovelands Priory, a private hospital in
north London, appeared a new blow to any hopes Pinochet, 83, had of
fighting extradition to Spain on grounds he is unfit to stand
trial.
	   The Grovelands Priory, sounding openly impatient, noted that at
a bail hearing Nov. 17 lawyers had said Pinochet, who underwent
back surgery Oct. 9, was fit enough to appear in court. He is now
due to appear Dec. 11.
	   ``It is now the responsibility of Gen. Pinochet's advisers to
find alternative accommodation,'' said the hospital. ``The
management of Grovelands Priory has reminded his advisers of this
responsibility and it is hoped that Gen. Pinochet will find
alternative accommodation as soon as possible.''
	   Earlier, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza left
London for Madrid after four days of trying to persuade Britain's
Labor Party government not to extradite Pinochet to Spain to face
charges of murder, genocide and torture by secret police during his
1973-1990 rule. Insulza maintained Pinochet may be tried in Chile
if he is allowed to go home.
	   A London newspaper, The Mirror, quoted Pinochet's nephew as
saying that he would rather die than stand trial in Spain.
	   ``He would rather kill himself or be killed by his guards than
face the humiliation and indignity of being sent to face trial in
Spain,'' nephew Rafael Pinochet Savedra was quoted as saying.
	   The general's wife, Lucia, told the tabloid that Pinochet was
``very weak and depressed about his position.''
	   Pinochet has not been seen in public since his Oct. 16 arrest
while in his hospital bed on a warrant issued by a Spanish
magistrate.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, underwent surgery in the
London Clinic, a private hospital in London's West End _ which
became the object of chanting demonstrators after his arrest.
	   He was moved Oct. 29 to Grovelands Priory, some five miles (8
kms) from central London and set in parklands.
	   There was no immediate word on where Pinochet might go. News
reports have said he is planning a move to a nine-bedroom home on
the private Wentworth estate in Surrey, southwest of London.
	   A hospital source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Pinochet was originally admitted ``because there was a psychiatric
element of stress,'' but he had been passed fit and his family had
been ``sluggish'' about finding new accommodation.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police after Pinochet
overthrew a Marxist who had been elected.
	   Pinochet has immunity from prosecution in Chile. Critics say
that even if this were lifted he would appear before a military
court packed with his supporters.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to
permit extradition proceedings to begin.

Russian units hunt for three armed deserters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three armed servicemen fled their military unit in
Russia's restive North Ossetia region on Monday, news reports said.
	   Officers from the Interior Ministry, Russia's main intelligence
agency, the border guard service and the soldiers' army unit
launched a search for the missing men, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The men took three Kalashnikov assault rifles and ten filled
magazines. Security has been tightened at the train station and bus
station in Vladikavkaz, capital of North Ossetia, a region in the
Caucasus Mountains about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) south of
Moscow, ITAR-Tass said.
	   It was unclear what prompted the escape. Desertions and killings
are relatively frequent in Russia's army, where conditions are
miserable, food is scarce, and younger conscripts are subject to
brutal hazing by officers and older soldiers.
	   North Ossetia borders the breakaway region of Chechnya. A French
aid worker who headed the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
office in North Ossetia was seized by three masked gunmen in his
Vladikavkaz apartment earlier this year.

Holocaust fund payments going slowly, government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swiss fund to help needy Holocaust
victims has paid out 38 million Swiss francs (dlrs 27 million) in
its first year of operation, the government said Monday.
	   Payments from the independent 275 million francs (dlrs 195
million) fund have been slowed by lack of agreement in some
countries on how to distribute the money as well as technical
problems and verification procedures.
	   In a written reply to a lawmaker's question, the government said
it ``regrets that the payments haven't progressed further'' but
stressed it can't influence the distribution of the money.
	   Some 88 percent of the fund, created last year, is intended to
aid destitute Jewish survivors of the Nazis, especially those in
east Europe who were denied Western assistance during decades of
communist rule.
	   The remainder is to help non-Jewish survivors, including
Gypsies, homosexuals and political opponents of the Nazis.
	   Swiss banks and industry contributed the money in the fund,
which is in addition to other efforts to aid victims or return
unclaimed bank assets.
	   Chaired by Swiss Jewish leader Rolf Bloch, it began
distributions last November in Riga, Latvia.
	   The money distributed so far was paid to more than 40,000
recipients. The fund has cleared payments of a further 50 million
francs (dlrs 35 million), mostly to Holocaust survivors in the
United States.
	   A distribution plan for Israel, where the fund expects to pay
out some 85 million francs (dlrs 60 million) under the coordination
of the World Jewish Restitution Organization, has yet to be
finalized, the government said.

FOA, Y2K, GSM, ERASMUS, CEDEFOP, UNGASS? What's it all mean? 
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Trying to sort out the FAO, FOA and FQA? You
think UNGASS is what fuels United Nations debates?
	   Then you need the new list of abbreviations and acronyms ``as
seen in documents relevant to the Transatlantic Agenda,'' put out
by the Delegation of the European Commission in Washington.
	   It explains that FAO is the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations, while FOA is Friends of Albania, FQA is the
Fastener Quality Act and UNGASS is the U.N. General Assembly on
Sustainable Development.
	   To help make the world of abbreviations and acronyms more
understandable, the 15-nation European Union has compiled a list of
311, running from ABM or antiballistic missile to Y2K for the year
2000 computer problem.
	   Many are familiar abbreviations for U.S. government agencies
such as the FBI and CIA and a dozen U.N. organizations.
	   Some terms demonstrate an imaginative mind at work. ERASMUS, who
was a famed Dutch scholar, is the European Community Action Scheme
for the Mobility of University Students, EUREKA is the European
Technology Initiative, and SPRINT is Strategic Program for
Innovation and Technology Transfer.
	   But suppose there were a problem at CEDEFOP? The initiated know
that's the European Center for the Development of Vocational
Training. EC-US S-and-T CA is not a typographical error some but
the European Community-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation
Agreement.
	   Many cell phone users in Europe are familiar with GSM but
probably few know it's shorthand for a real mouthful: ``Pan
European landbased public digital mobile cellular communications in
the community.''
	   EURO CONTROL sounds Orwellian but is the more mundane European
Air Traffic Control Organization.
	   MANPADS is not sports gear but a man-portable air defense
system, and TIES are not neckwear but the Trans-Atlantic
Information Exchange Service.
	   The idea for the list came from Austria, which holds the current
rotating six month presidency of the European Union.
	   Ella Krucoff, the organization's spokeswoman in Washington, said
each nation that holds the presidency ``tries to do important
things and small things to improve the functioning of the EU.''
	   That's EU for European Union, which is also on the list, just in
case.

Quebeckers vote in provincial elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Canada-Quebec Election &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some facts about Quebec and Monday's provincial election:
	   THE PROVINCE _ Quebec is Canada's largest province in area, and,
with 7.4 million people, has one-fourth of its population. Nearly
half of all Quebeckers live in or near Montreal. If Quebec seceded,
the four Atlantic provinces would be cut off from the rest of
Canada.
	   THE ELECTION _ 5.2 million eligible voters were voting to fill
124 seats in the provincial legislature, based in Quebec City and
called the National Assembly. The 125th seat will be filled in two
weeks because of a candidate's recent death. The leader of majority
party becomes the province's premier for a term of up to five
years.
	   THE ECONOMY _ The new government will face serious economic
challenges. The jobless rate is 9.7 percent, compared to the
national rate of 8.1 percent. The tax burden, in several income
brackets, is the highest in North America, and the poverty rate is
the highest in Canada.

Swedish NHL stars rate Sundin and Lidstrom as best
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nicklas Lidstrom of Detroit Red Wings
and Mats Sundin of Toronto are Sweden*s top hockey players in the
National Hockey League according to their own peers.
	   The Reds' defenseman shared the title as No. 1 with Toronto's
captain, surprisingly beating Colorado*s Peter Forsberg when the
Swedish news agency TT published their poll of nine Swedish NHLers
Monday.
	   ``It's amazing that he didn't get the Norris Trophy last
season,'' Sundin said about Lidstrom who lost out to Rob Blake of
the Los Angeles Kings.
	   ``Blake has not been bad, but Lidstrom has been Detroit*s
dominating player during the two consecutive years they have won
the Stanley Cup,'' Sundin told TT.
	   Sundin and Lidstrom tied for first-place with 33 points with
Forsberg runner-up at 30. Fourth-placed New York Rangers'
defenseman Ulf Samuelsson scored 6 points, Ottawa Senators' Daniel
Alfredsson 4 and Calle Johansson of the Washington Capitals 2
points.
	   The top-three NHLers voted accordingly:
	   Lidstrom and Sundin tied for No. 1 in Forsberg's vote,
Alfredsson placed third.
	   Lidstrom had a hard choice between Sundin and Forsberg, but
selected the Leafs' captain.
	   ``They're exceptional and very hard to stop. They're among the
best in the NHL,'' Lidstrom said.
	   Sundin voted for Lidstrom, with Forsberg and Calle Johansson as
second and third.
	   Asked about his rivalry with Forsberg, Sundin replied:
	   ``It's fun. I like the competition. It's very inspiring when we
play on the national team.''
	   The following nine players were polled:
	   Peter Forsberg, Colorado; Lidstrom, Detroit; Sundin, Toronto;
Tomas Holmstrom, Detroit; Andreas Johansson, Ottawa; Fredrik Modin,
Toronto; Tommy Salo and Kenny Jonsson of the New York Islanders;
and Niklas Sundstrom, New York Rangers.

Russians to rescue TV crew trapped on Arctic island

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian rescue team will try Tuesday to reach a
three-man television crew that's stranded on a remote Arctic island
and is quickly running out of supplies.
	   If the weather allows, the Russians will send a helicopter to
evacuate the trio, which includes a Russian, a Japanese and an
Australian who were making a documentary on polar bears, the
Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   The crew arrived on Wrangel Island on Sept. 2 and intended to
leave Oct. 15, but was delayed by bad weather. The weather has also
kept the Emergency Situations Ministry from being able to carry out
a helicopter rescue.
	   The three have been holed up in a cabin on the island's
northeast coast, about 550 kilometers (350 miles) west of Alaska.
	   The crew's food supplies have been dwindling, and residents of a
village about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the hut have been
trying to drive a snow tractor to take emergency supplies to the
crew, but the effort has been slowed by bad weather.
	   The temperature has been around minus 30 Celsius (minus 22
Fahrenheit), with a strong wind. The crew has a diesel generator, a
computer, a cellular phone and access to e-mail, but was running
low on fuel, news reports said.
	   The Japanese crew member, Tatsuhiko Kobayashi, has developed
complications from a recent eye operation, Russia's ORT television
reported.
	   Emergency officials earlier offered to try to rescue the crew by
snow tractor, but the three reportedly turned down the offer
because they would have been forced to leave most of their
equipment behind, ORT said.
	   Kobayashi is an employee of NHK, the Japanese television
company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness. The name of
the Russian was not available.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Chile's foreign minister arrived in Madrid
on Monday to press his case for having former dictator Augusto
Pinochet face justice in Chile instead of Spain.
	   ``The political climate in Spain is not favorable to Sen.
Pinochet and that carries weight in the judicial process even
beyond the will of the judges to be impartial,'' Jose Miguel
Insulza told reporters after meeting with Federico Trillo, speaker
of the lower house of Parliament.
	   Upon arrival at the airport from London, Insulza said he didn't
have ``any expectations'' from his two-day visit to Spain other
than to gain information.
	   Insulza spent four days in Britain trying to persuade Britain's
Labor Party government not to extradite Pinochet to Spain to face
charges of murder, torture and genocide during his 1973-1990 rule.
Insulza maintained Pinochet may be tried in Chile if he is allowed
to go home.
	   On Tuesday, he meets with Foreign Minister Abel Matutes and
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   Aznar, speaking from Portugal, said Monday that his government
will maintain its position of not interfering with the judicial
process.
	   ``If the British government decides not to take into
consideration Gen. Pinochet's extradition, the Spanish government
will accept it. And if Britain extradites him, Spanish justice (the
judicial system) has to deal with the case,'' Aznar said.
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide
whether to permit extradition proceedings to begin.

Italian man confesses on-camera killing family, missing since 1989

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian man confessed on-camera to killing his
entire family in 1989, calmly telling interviewers that ``it was an
act of complete madness.''
	   In an interview broadcast on state TV Monday night, Ferdinando
Carretta, 36, said he shot his father, mother and brother to death
at the family apartment in the northern city of Parma.
	   The family _ including Ferdinando _ vanished, apparently while
on a camping trip. Their fate was one of Italy's most enduring
mysteries until now.
	   Ferdinando surfaced by accident in London when police stopped
him on a routine traffic violation. A computer check showed he was
listed as a missing person and Italian authorities were notified.
	   On Sunday, he returned to Italy and was arrested at the airport
on a warrant for triple homicide. Shortly afterward, he confessed
to police.
	   ``He couldn't wait to confess,'' an investigating magistrate,
Vittorio Zanichelli, told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   It was not his first confession, as things turned out.
	   A few days before his return, Carretta was interviewed in London
by an Italian TV program about missing persons. The show's director
accompanied him back to Italy.
	   Parts of the interview were aired on the news Monday night.
	   ``I shot my parents and my brother,'' he said. ``It was an act
of madness, an act of complete madness.''
	   ANSA said Carretta told his interviewers that he hated his
father and killed his mother and brother because they were
witnesses to his father's slaying.

Britain taps cyber character Lara Croft as scientific ambassador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ She's got big guns, and now she's got a title.
	   A British government official said Monday he wants Lara Croft _
the scantily clad, heavily armed heroine of the popular ``Tomb
Raider'' computer game _ to be an ``ambassador'' for the nation's
science and technology.
	   Science Minister Lord Sainsbury cited the British-created cyber
character as he chided people for harking back too much to
Britain's historical inventions.
	   Britain needed to show it was the home of people like Professor
Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge theoretical physicist who wrote ``A
Brief History of Time,'' and vacuum cleaner pioneer Dyson, and
discoveries including Dolly the cloned sheep and optical fibers,
Sainsbury said in a speech at the Social Market Foundation in
London.
	   ``I want Lara Croft to be an ambassador for British scientific
excellence,'' he said.
	   The Trade and Industry Department said Sainsbury was using the
Croft character as an example of modern British innovations for
which he wanted Britain to be known, in place of the traditional
``cream teas and steam engines'' picture.

 &UR; Israel rules out army withdrawal from Lebanon
 &UR; Eds: AMs RECAST. UPDATES with fresh comments; Corrects to Foreign
Affairs and Defense sted reverse; Changes Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli lawmakers, frustrated by
mounting troop casualties in Lebanon, lashed out at one another
Monday as the national debate over Israel's presence there widened.
	   Yossi Beilin, from the opposition Labor party who advocates a
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, said leaving troops there meant
``certain death,'' for young Israeli servicemen. He charged Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai with ``gambling with their
lives.''
	   Mordechai, a former army general, said Israel's occupation of
south Lebanon is ``dictated by reality,'' and ruled out removing
his soldiers despite the recent death toll in a guerrilla war
there.
	   ``I am gambling with the lives of Israeli soldiers, I fought my
whole life here,'' Mordechai said after the two men walked out of a
heated session of Israel's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee
devoted to discuss on Lebanon.
	   Israel has patrolled a small strip of land in south Lebanon
since 1985 in an effort to halt cross-border attacks by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas on Israel's northern
communities. Opposition to Israel's military presence has
intensified however since seven Israeli soldiers were killed there
in the last two weeks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that soldiers must
remain in their positions in order to protect Israeli border
villages from Hezbollah.
	   ``Our heart is with every mother and every person who has
suffered'' because of Israel's military presence in Lebanon, he
told Israel radio. But ``we have the responsibility to do the right
thing for the state of Israel, not for the next newscast,'' he
said.
	   Mordechai told reporters that keeping Israeli soldiers in
Israel's self-declared ``security zone'' is the only option, and
``this is the opinion of security officials after they examined all
the possibilities.''
	   Beilin stormed out of the committee session, slammed the door,
and called Mordechai ``a liar.''
	   ``It's nonsense,'' fumed Beilin, normally a soft-spoken academic
type with a doctorate in political science. ``There are many
(Israeli) generals who believe we must leave this area,'' he
declared, ``and I'm sure the minister knows it.''
	   Israel's security Cabinet met for four hours Sunday and heard
briefings from military commanders about the escalating clashes
between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   During the meeting, opponents of Israel's occupation in south
Lebanon demonstrated outside, chanting, ``Lebanon is a disaster.''
	   A front-page commentary in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot
predicted that the fuss over Lebanon would die down after a few
days without new Israeli casualties in Lebanon, as it has before.
	   Columnist Nahum Barnea said the special Cabinet debate on
Lebanon was convened not so much in hopes of finding answers, but
to appease the public. ``All eyes were not focused on the
blood-drenched strip of land in Lebanon, but rather on the public
opinion polls in Lebanon,'' Barnea wrote.
	   Lebanon's government, demanding an unconditional Israeli
pullout, says that if the Israelis leave, Hezbollah would have no
reason to strike. Hezbollah refuses to give Israel any assurances.
	   The Israelis have charged that Syria is behind the escalation of
Hezbollah attacks against Israeli forces, as a way of pressuring
Israel. Until recently, Israeli policy held that Israel could not
withdraw its forces from Lebanon in the absence of a peace
agreement involving Syria.
	   But the Syrians have made it clear that the price for such an
agreement is return of all of the Golan Heights, strategic
highlands overlooking Israel's north and captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's government rejects that.
	   Mordechai said that Israel is constantly looking for a political
solution to the Lebanon conflict, but none is attainable now.

Search for premier after Hariri reportedly will not seek job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hariri's telling CNN he's bowing out. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business
tycoon who launched Lebanon's multibillion dollar reconstruction
from the devastation of civil war, said Monday he was bowing out as
premier following a dispute with the new president.
	   He accused President Emile Lahoud of violating the constitution
and demanded that he acknowledge it before he could reconsider his
position.
	   Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new
government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by the
possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect
Lebanon's economic recovery.
	   ``I'm not a candidate,'' Hariri said in a live interview with
CNN. He demanded that Lahoud admit that he acted unconstitutionally
by allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize him to name a prime
minister instead of naming one themselves.
	   Such an action ``might put the country in danger,'' Hariri
warned.
	   Asked if there was a risk of renewed conflict in Lebanon over
the alleged tampering with the constitution, Hariri said: ``If the
president continues with this, I don't know what will happen.''
	   But the dispute between the two leaders appears to be over who
will have the upper hand in governing the nation of 3.2 million.
	   Lahoud, 62, is an army commander who wants to assert his
authority at the start of his six-year presidential term. Hariri,
53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country since he
became premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi.
	   A brief meeting on Monday between the two did not help resolve
the disagreements.
	   Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday.
	   Lahoud on Monday set the stage for choosing a new prime minister
when he scheduled a fresh round of consultations with Parliament
for Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to
form the next government after a previous round of consultations.
	   The offer came after the 128 legislators polled by the president
gave Hariri a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing
he had received in his previous three mandates since 1992.
	   Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and
stabilizing the national currency. His globe-trotting travels to
drum up political and economic support were sometimes instrumental
in drawing international financial aid and investment.
	   But he was faulted for declining living standards at home and a
rise in corruption in government.
	   Lahoud pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the
graft-riddled administration. The general enjoys widespread popular
backing after succeeding in rebuilding an army fractured by civil
war.
	   Central bank officials on Monday tried to calm fears about a run
on the Lebanese pound by announcing that the bank was ready to
intervene with its foreign currency reserves if necessary, the
state-run National News Agency reported. It added that the money
markets remained stable.

Coast Guard rescues man after his plane loses power and lands in

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man in waters off
Haiti after his twin engine aircraft lost power and crashed into
the ocean.
	   Emmanual G. Ducheine, a Haitian citizen, was rescued 25 miles
(40 kilometers) northwest of Isle de la Tortue, Haiti. Ducheine,
45, lives in Miami.
	   The Coast Guard was notified Sunday morning after Ducheine
called in a distress signal to another aircraft saying that he had
experienced simultaneous fuel pump failure in both engines.
	   Ducheine left from North Perry Airport in Pembroke Pines. He
planned to make stops in Great Inagua, Bahamas, and Cap-Haitien,
Haiti, according to records.
	   A C-130 airplane, an HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter and an HU-25
Falcon jet were involved in the search. The C-130 found Ducheine
floating in a life raft late Sunday afternoon.
	   Ducheine was then transported by helicopter to Grat Ingua,
Bahamas, where he was in good condition, said Petty Officer Gibran
Soto. The plane had not been recovered Monday afternoon.
	   ``They knew where he went down, which helped a lot,'' Soto said.

Russia's gas giant expecting dlrs 3 billion in losses this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom is likely to
post losses of 40 billion to 60 billion rubles (dlrs 2.7 billion to
3.3 billion) this year because of Russia's financial crisis, its
chairman said Monday.
	   Debts by gas customers, including thousands of state-run
facilities, have soared since Russia's troubles came to a head in
August. Cash collections by the world's largest gas company are as
low as ``around 20 percent,'' chairman Rem Vyakhirev told
journalists.
	   In September, the virtual collapse of the banking system brought
all payments to Gazprom to a halt.
	   The company, which is 40 percent owned by Russia's government,
has also been hit by a sharp drop in world oil prices.
	   Gazprom expects to produce 552 billion cubic meters (19.3
trillion cubic feet) of gas this year. Vyakhirev said its output
would likely start falling next year because of the mountain of
non-payments and the government's financial problems.

Supporters, protesters meet Pakistan's prime minister in Norway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Hundreds of Pakistanis and a handful of
human rights demonstrators awaited Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif in the Norwegian capital Monday during a brief stop over on
his way to meetings in Washington D.C.
	   Sharif was in Oslo on an informal visit to open transmissions of
Pakistani television programs to Europe via a Norwegian satellite.
The opening ceremony at the Oslo Concert House was broadcast to 42
countries in Asia and 18 European countries.
	   Pakistani residents of Norway who packed the concert hall,
repeatedly applauded the prime minister during his 45-minute, Urdu
language speech. Sharif touched on Pakistan's first nuclear tests
this year and the international sanctions that followed.
	   Pakistan and India, which have fought three wars in the past 50,
both tested nuclear devices in May, leading to fears of a nuclear
arms race in South Asia. The United States and other Western
countries imposed sanctions on Pakistan, which has been on the
verge of economic collapse.
	   In Oslo, demonstrators were more concerned with a 1985 law in
overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan that allows the death penalty for
anyone convicted of blasphemy against Islam. In May, Pakistani
Roman Catholic Bishop John Joseph, 65, killed himself to protest a
blasphemy death sentence imposed on a fellow Pakistani Christian,
which lead to widespread protests.
	   Outside the Oslo Concert Hall, about two dozen demonstrators
chanted ``No, No, Blasphemy Law'' when Sharif left the building.
The protesters, from Amnesty International, also carried banners
saying ``Blasphemy Trials: A way to judicial murder.''
	   Sharif was bound for Washington D.C. in hopes of convincing
president Clinton to lift sanctions against Pakistan. His stop in
Norway was the first by any Pakistani prime minister.

German, French leaders to discuss European defense industry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French
President Jacques Chirac agreed Monday on the importance of
creating jobs and strengthening the defense industry in Europe.
	   Chirac, however, expressed displeasure with Germany's
willingness to move ahead on an aerospace industry merger with
Britain without including France from the start, a French source
said on condition of anonymity.
	   Germany prefers a three-way merger including France and Britain
but would move ahead with Britain first if the French don't
participate immediately. Schroeder said last week that the ``door
would be held open'' for France to join later.
	   The leaders met on the first day of a two-day summit, aimed at
revitalizing Germany's ties with its most important European
partner, aides say, after a slowdown under former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
	   ``We have set out to bring a new dynamic to the German-French
relationship, and we will do that,'' Schroeder told Chirac at a
banquet.
	   Schroeder and Chirac addressed each other by their first names,
exchanging warm remarks as Schroeder presented Chirac with two
Japanese plates as a birthday present. Chirac turned 66 on Sunday.
	   Schroeder spoke of a new beginning in German-French relations
not only among politicians but among citizens, referring to plans
announced Monday for a joint German-French university.
	   In separate consultations, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
asked his French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, for support for a
German-Italian initiative to try Kurdish rebel Leader Abdullah
Ocalan before an international court, said ministry spokesman
Martin Erdmann.
	   Italy arrested Ocalan two weeks ago on a German warrant, but
Schroeder has ruled out bringing him here to trial for fear of
violence within Germany's large Kurdish population.
	   The summit got under way with military drills and strains of the
French and German national anthems that greeted Schroeder and
Chirac on arrival in historic Potsdam, the city outside Berlin
where the Allies signed the treaty on the occupation of Germany
after World War II. They immediately held a private meeting, where
they discussed unemployment and the aerospace merger.
	   The summit also is expected to discuss EU economic and jobs
policies, reform of the EU budget, world finance and the political
situations in Russia, Kosovo and the Middle East.
	   Germany and France hold summits twice yearly, but this meeting
has special significance ahead of Jan. 1, when Europe launches its
single currency, the euro, and Germany takes over the rotating
six-month presidency of the European Union. Together, France and
Germany have been the engine behind the drive for European unity.
	   The summit is the first for Schroeder, who won September
elections for the center-left Social Democrats. Though both
countries are now governed by the left, Schroeder's victory has
actually sent them drifting apart on one issue: the role of nuclear
power.
	   The new German government wants to shut down the nation's 19
nuclear plants. Paris worries this would mean lost business for a
French nuclear fuel reprocessing plant whose biggest foreign
customer is Germany. With economics ministers from both countries
attending the summit, the issue seems likely to come up.
	   Efforts for a European aerospace merger to compete with U.S.
giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin are a central theme. The big
European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace, British
Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March to seek a
merger.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced
talks on a two-way alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's
early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly
government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been
slow.

Court order suspends sale of Rio utility
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A last-minute court order blocked
the sale of Rio de Janeiro state's water utility on Monday, the Rio
Stock Exchange said.
	   A judge suspended the auction at the request of a labor union
that contended the state had not met all the legal requirements for
public hearings on the sale.
	   The auction of the utility, known as Cedae, has been postponed
several times this year. Opponents question the government's
motives to sell the company barely a month before Gov. Marcello
Alencar leaves office on Dec. 31. His successor, Anthony Garotinho,
opposes the sale.
	   Hundreds of riot police with horses and dogs stood guard at the
Stock Exchange in downtown Rio, but there were no incidents with
the protesters gathered outside.
	   An explosion occurred Monday in the company's downtown
headquarters, but police could not confirm that it was a bomb. The
blast blew out a door, but no one was hurt.
	   Two groups were signed up to bid for the company, which serves
10 million customers. The minimum bid price was set at 1 billion
reals, or dlrs 833 million.

Presidents of Djibouti, Congo fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Djibouti's President Hassan Gouled Aptidon
flew to Libya Monday for talks with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi,
Libyan radio reported.
	   Aptidon's arrival in Libya follows visits by the presidents of
Gambia and Congo and by Louis Farrakhan, head of the U.S. Nation of
Islam. All three flew into Libya, apparently breaking a U.N. flight
ban on the north African state.
	   A U.N. flight permission is required to fly to Libya and it was
not clear if any of the four men had obtained them.
	   Aptidon flew into Libya's coastal city of Sirte from Paris where
he attended a French-African summit, said the radio report which
was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Libya was not invited to the summit because of the 1992 U.N.
embargo.
	   The embargo was imposed to force Libya hand over for trial two
suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the flight ban on
Libya. Since then, several African leaders have defied the ban and
flown to Libya.
	   On Sunday, Congolese President Laurent Kabila arrived in Sirte
from Paris to brief Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on the Paris
summit, Libyan radio said.
	   Also Sunday, Gadhafi awarded Gambian President Yahya Jammeh the
Bravery medal for ignoring the sanctions.
	   Gadhafi praised the African leaders for what he called an
``honorable'' stand for breaking the sanctions. He chided Arab
leaders for not following suit.

 &UR; Gov't reshuffle set for early December, Workers Party leader says

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia will resign
in early December, a leader of the leftist Workers Party said
Monday.
	   Louisa Hanoune, speaking at a news conference, said President
Liamine Zeroual had told her in a meeting Sunday that Ouyahia and
several other government ministers would be stepping down ``around
Dec. 10.''
	   Previously, the government had said Ouyahia's government would
``very probably'' resign after presenting Parliament with the
annual report of its work sometime in December.
	   Zeroual said that in addition to Ouyahia, Communications
Minister Hamraoui Habib Chawki, interim Justice Minister Hamed Nouj
and Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mansour would be resigning,
according to Hanoune.
	   Zeroual did not reveal who would replace the ministers, Hanoune
said, but noted only that the successors would be ``non-partisan.''
	   Zeroual met with Hanoune to discuss presidential elections,
which are now set for April.
	   In September, the Algerian President announced that he would cut
short his five-year term which normally ends in the year 2000.
	   Ouyahia, prime minister since January 1996, has not denied
rumors over his own reported plans to run for the presidency.
	   Names of numerous potential candidates have circulated
unofficially. In the past, it has been the army that determines the
nation's president, drawn from military ranks. Zeroual is a retired
general.

Italian man confesses on-camera killing family, missing since 1989

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian man confessed on-camera to killing his
entire family in 1989, calmly telling interviewers that ``it was an
act of complete madness.''
	   In an interview broadcast on state TV Monday night, Ferdinando
Carretta, 36, said he shot his father, mother and brother to death
at the family apartment in the northern city of Parma.
	   The family _ including Ferdinando _ vanished, apparently while
on a camping trip. Their fate was one of Italy's most enduring
mysteries until now.
	   Ferdinando surfaced by accident in London when police stopped
him on a routine traffic violation. A computer check showed he was
listed as a missing person and Italian authorities were notified.
	   On Sunday, he returned to Italy and was arrested at the airport
on a warrant for triple homicide. Shortly afterward, he confessed
to police.
	   ``He couldn't wait to confess,'' an investigating magistrate,
Vittorio Zanichelli, told the Italian news agency ANSA.
	   It was not his first confession, as things turned out.
	   A few days before his return, Carretta was interviewed in London
by an Italian TV program about missing persons. The show's director
accompanied him back to Italy.
	   Parts of the interview were aired on the news Monday night.
	   ``I shot my parents and my brother,'' he said. ``It was an act
of madness, an act of complete madness.''
	   ANSA said Carretta told his interviewers that he hated his
father and killed his mother and brother because they were
witnesses to his father's slaying.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The United States is seeking the
extradition of some 30 Nigerians implicated in drug-related crimes

of the issues which have undermined relations between Nigeria and
the United States,'' Campbell said.
	   He did not name the Nigerians or specify the crimes for which
they are being sought.
	   Eze said the Nigerian Foreign Ministry was studying the
extradition request and planned to ``do something about it.''
However, he expressed Nigeria's dissatisfaction that it remained on
a list of ``decertified'' countries to which the U.S. has blocked
development aid because of their poor record in fighting drug
trafficking.
	   He said that if Nigeria became certified, it would ``surely
encourage us to do a lot more.''
	   Since taking power following the death of the late dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha in June, Nigerian military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar has promised sweeping reforms including elections and a
handover of power to a civilian government next year.
	   Nigeria and the U.S. do not have an extradition agreement
although officials from the two countries have recently discussed
plans to cooperate fighting drug trafficking.

Russia's gas giant expecting dlrs 3 billion in losses this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Gazprom posting profit last year. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's natural gas monopoly Gazprom is likely to
post losses of 40 billion to 60 billion rubles (dlrs 2.7 billion to
3.3 billion) this year because of Russia's financial crisis, its
chairman said Monday.
	   Debts by gas customers, including thousands of state-run
facilities, have soared since Russia's troubles came to a head in
August. Cash collections by the world's largest gas company are as
low as ``around 20 percent,'' chairman Rem Vyakhirev told
journalists.
	   In September, the virtual collapse of the banking system brought
all payments to Gazprom to a halt.
	   The company, which is 40 percent owned by Russia's government,
has also been hit by a sharp drop in world oil prices.
	   Gazprom is Russia's largest company and accounts for as much as
8 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   Gazprom expects to produce 552 billion cubic meters (19.3
trillion cubic feet) of gas this year. Vyakhirev said its output
would likely start falling next year because of the mountain of
non-payments and the government's financial problems.
	   In 1997, Gazprom posted a net profit of 38.7 billion rubles
(dlrs 6.4 billion at January's exchange rate), though the results
were based on Russian accounting standards, which differ
significantly from international standards.

 &UR; Israel rules out army withdrawal from Lebanon
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with fresh comments; Corrects to
Foreign Affairs and Defense sted reverse; Changes Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli lawmakers, frustrated by
mounting troop casualties in Lebanon, lashed out at one another
Monday as the national debate over Israel's presence there widened.
	   Yossi Beilin, from the opposition Labor party who advocates a
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, said leaving troops there meant
``certain death,'' for young Israeli servicemen. He charged Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai with ``gambling with their
lives.''
	   Mordechai, a former army general, said Israel's occupation of
south Lebanon is ``dictated by reality,'' and ruled out removing
his soldiers despite the increasing death toll in a guerrilla war
there.
	   ``I am gambling with the lives of Israeli soldiers, I fought my
whole life here,'' Mordechai said after the two men walked out of a
heated session of Israel's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committees
on Lebanon.
	   Israel has patrolled a small strip of land in south Lebanon
since 1985 in an effort to halt cross-border attacks by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas on Israel's northern
communities. Opposition to Israel's military presence has
intensified however since seven Israeli soldiers were killed there
in the last two weeks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that soldiers must
remain in their positions in order to protect Israeli border
villages from Hezbollah.
	   ``Our heart is with every mother and every person who has
suffered'' because of Israel's military presence in Lebanon, he
told Israel radio. But ``we have the responsibility to do the right
thing for the state of Israel, not for the next newscast,'' he
said.
	   Mordechai told reporters that keeping Israeli soldiers in
Israel's self-declared ``security zone'' is the only option, and
``this is the opinion of security officials after they examined all
the possibilities.''
	   Beilin stormed out of the committee session, slammed the door,
and called Mordechai ``a liar.''
	   ``It's nonsense,'' fumed Beilin, normally a soft-spoken academic
type with a doctorate in political science. ``There are many
(Israeli) generals who believe we must leave this area,'' he
declared, ``and I'm sure the minister knows it.''
	   Israel's security Cabinet met for four hours Sunday and heard
briefings from military commanders about the escalating clashes
between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   During the meeting, opponents of Israel's occupation in south
Lebanon demonstrated outside, chanting, ``Lebanon is a disaster.''
	   A front-page commentary in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot
predicted that the fuss over Lebanon would die down after a few
days without new Israeli casualties in Lebanon, as it has before.
	   Columnist Nahum Barnea said the special Cabinet debate on
Lebanon was convened not so much in hopes of finding answers, but
to appease the public. ``All eyes were not focused on the
blood-drenched strip of land in Lebanon, but rather on the public
opinion polls in Lebanon,'' Barnea wrote.
	   Lebanon's government, demanding an unconditional Israeli
pullout, says that if the Israelis leave, Hezbollah would have no
reason to strike. Hezbollah refuses to give Israel any assurances.
	   The Israelis have charged that Syria is behind the escalation of
Hezbollah attacks against Israeli forces, as a way of pressuring
Israel. Until recently, Israeli policy held that Israel could not
withdraw its forces from Lebanon in the absence of a peace
agreement involving Syria.
	   But the Syrians have made it clear that the price for such an
agreement is return of all of the Golan Heights, strategic
highlands overlooking Israel's north and captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu's government rejects that.
	   Mordechai said that Israel is constantly looking for a political
solution to the Lebanon conflict, but none is attainable now.

Shin Bet interrogator admits using physical pressure on prisoner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Confirming what human rights organizations and
Palestinian detainees have long contended, an Israeli security
interrogator has admitted in court testimony that he used physical
pressure to extract information from a Palestinian suspect.
	   Said Zoarub, accused of membership in Hamas and assisting in a
1995 suicide bombing, has since retracted the confession he gave to
the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, claiming it was
made under duress.
	   In a special Israeli military court hearing held Oct. 20 to
discuss the validity of the confession, the interrogator,
identified in court transcripts only as ``N,'' said he and others
tied, twisted and kept Zoarub hooded for several hours at a time.
	   On six separate occasions over three days in April 1997, Zoarub
was forced to stand, arms stretched above his head and handcuffed
to an anchor above him, for as long as three hours.
	   ``This method is intended to further the revelation of the
essential information which the subject does not wish to divulge,''
N said in his testimony. Transcripts of the hearing were made
available to The Associated Press Monday.
	   During the interrogations, Zoarub confessed to involvement in
Hamas activities. His trial is still in progress and it was unclear
how the court would rule regarding the validity of the confession.
	   At other points during the 21 days Zoarub spent at an unnamed
Shin Bet facility, N said Zoarub was seated on a low chair slanted
forward, with his hands tied behind his back. N said interrogators
would tighten ``the handcuffs as far as possible around the
defendant's wrists.'' He also said that investigators put a hood
over Zoarub, forced him to crouch on the ground for hour-long
stretches and blasted loud music at him.
	   Zoarub's attorney Leah Tsemel said in court that interrogators
hung Zoarub from the ceiling, deprived him of sleep, put a
foul-smelling hood over his head that cut off his air supply, and
pulled on the handcuffs hard enough to cut off blood circulation. N
denied the charges.
	   The government does not deny that the Shin Bet, whose operations
are largely secret, uses force to extract information, but court
records of its methods are rarely open to public view.
	   Israel's Supreme Court has ruled the Shin Bet may use ``moderate
physical force,'' in questioning Palestinians believed to have
information vital to preventing a terrorist attack.
	   However, human rights groups claim that the vague wording allows
for torture and has appealed to the Supreme Court and to the
Israeli Parliament to end widely reported mistreatment of
Palestinian detainees.

Defense enters plea bargain in case of attack on British tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A former paratrooper in the Israeli army
accused of killing a British tourist and wounding the victim's
girlfriend, entered a guilty plea to the murder charge Monday in a
bargain to reduce a second charge against him.
	   Daniel Okev, 45, is charged in the August 1997 shooting death of
Jeffrey Hunter, 22, and the wounding of Charlotte Gibb. Okev gave
the British couple a ride in southern Israel and later stopped at
an isolated spot in the desert and shot them.
	   Okev's lawyer, David Yiftach, offered the plea bargain Monday at
a session of the Beersheva District Court. Okev pleaded guilty to
murdering Hunter and the prosecution reduced the charge from
attempted murder of Gibb to severe attack, Yiftach said.
	   Okev claimed that he was suffering from flashbacks at the time
of the shootings and was severely traumatized by service in an army
special forces squad which hunted down and executed suspected
Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip in the early 1970s.
	   Yiftach said the military experience coupled with a brain
condition Okev probably developed after a car accident 15 years ago
could have been behind his actions.
	   ``The fact that he had a problem in his brain, together with the
fact that he was brought up to kill people in this special unit,
this is what the psychiatrists say brought him to do what he did,''
Yiftach said.
	   The judges are to decide Jan. 18 whether Okev would be eligible
for a reduced sentence because of his mental condition. He faces a
life sentence if found guilty for the murder.
	   Yiftach said he had wanted to bring Gibb for questioniung but
the young British woman wrote in a letter to the court that it
would be too traumatic for her to face Okev.

Army issues restraining orders against militant Jews
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army has issued restraining orders
against three Jewish settlers and three other Israeli militants,
forbidding them from entering Palestinian areas, the army spokesman
said Monday.
	   The settlers were banned from entering the Palestinian cities of
Nablus and Hebron and certain West Bank areas for periods of one to
three months. The others were banned from entering the West Bank
altogether for periods of three to six months.
	   The army central command issued the bans after holding
discussions with security and legal officials.
	   According to Israel's army radio, security officials are afraid
that militant settlers will try to block an upcoming Israeli troop
withdrawal by carrying out attacks against Palestinians.
	   Under the Wye Peace Accords signed in Washington in October,
Israel is to withdraw from a further five percent of the West Bank
by mid-December.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Glowing rocks spewed from Mexico's
Popocatepetl Volcano on Monday morning, showering neighboring towns
after an eruption that blew a plume of ash 2 1/2 miles (4 kms) into
the air.
	   The volcano, located only 50 miles (80 kms) southeast of Mexico
City, has been blasting steam and ash into the air several times a
day during the past week, living up to its name _ ``Smoking
Mountain'' in the Aztec language.
	   ``We are certainly concerned about the volcano's activity,''
said Leoncio Perez, mayor of Tetela del Volcan, a village on the
volcano's slopes. ``We are warning people, but we also don't want
to alarm them.''
	   Soldiers have increased patrols to keep climbers and hikers at
least 4 1/2 miles (7 kms) away from the volcano's crater.
	   The Mexico City government reportedly is setting up more than
100 shelters capable of housing 53,000 people in the event that
evacuations are ordered.
	   Even so, Joel Delgadillo, head of civil protection in Tetela del
Volcan, warned that the volcano's activity could foreshadow a major
eruption.
	   ``In the last week, we have witnessed some of the most intense
activity not just of the year, but of recent times,'' he told the
newspaper El Universal.
	   Meanwhile, similar bursts have been reported at the Colima
Volcano on the Pacific coast, although experts said simultaneous
activity at the two volcanos was coincidental.
	   Geologist Michael Sheridan of the University of Buffalo in New
York state said the volcano's resting period of 40 to 50 years
could be coming to an end.
	   ``Colima is going through its regular cycle, and it's
approaching its climactic phase, which is going to be very
violent,'' he said.
	   Sheridan said civil protection authorities have taken the proper
precautions near Colima in evacuating people and making the area
off-limits. But he warned that a mixture of ash and rainfall could
result in mudslides.
	   ``It could present a threat to other places that are considered
safe,'' he said.

Krupp shareholders vote overwhelmingly for merger with Thyssen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ESSEN, Germany (AP) _ Krupp shareholders Monday voted
overwhelmingly in support of a merger with the industrial group
Thyssen, clearing one of the last hurdles toward creating Europe's
biggest steel concern.
	   The vote _ 99.97 percent in favor _ was not a surprise. Thyssen
shareholders also are expected to approve the merger when they vote
Thursday and Friday.
	   As Europe's fifth-biggest industrial concern, the new Thyssen
Krupp AG would rank behind carmakers DaimlerChrysler and
Volkswagen, and electronics and communications giants Siemens and
Veba.
	   The companies predict their joint operations will post 70
billion marks (dlrs 40 billion), in sales for the 1998 fiscal year.
	   Krupp and Thyssen announced plans to merge last November, saying
it would save as much as 450 million marks (dlrs 250 million) in
costs and give the combined company a stronger position in world
markets. Krupp, based in Essen, had earlier dropped a hostile bid
for Thyssen after workers protested over potential job losses.
	   Together, the companies employ some 180,000 people.

Major Venezuela party withdraws support for former Miss Universe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A major political party withdrew its
support Monday for a former Miss Universe in favor of a businessman
in hopes of blocking an ex-coup leader's run for Venezuela's
presidency.
	   The center-right COPEI Party concluded the foundering candidacy
of Irene Saez was dividing the vote against former Lt. Col. Hugo
Chavez, increasing his chances of victory in nationwide voting next
Sunday.
	   Donald Ramirez, secretary general of COPEI, announced the party
would back Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer instead
of Saez.
	   ``The democratic vote should unite itself to guarantee peace and
freedom, and that guarantee at this moment is represented by the
independent candidacy of Henrique Salas Romer,'' Ramirez told
reporters after the party voted to back Salas.
	   Members of Venezuela's political establishment have been
scrambling for over a week to head off a presidential victory by
Chavez, who staged an unsuccessful coup attempt against the
government in 1992.
	   Over the weekend, Salas, 62, a former governor of the central
state of Carabobo, also received the backing of Venezuela's other
traditional party, center-left Democratic Action.
	   The leaders of both parties are asking their supporters to vote
for Salas so as not to divide the anti-Chavez vote.
	   Chavez's candidacy has polarized Venezuela between the poor who
view him as a hero and the wealthy establishment that believes he
will install a leftist dictatorship.
	   It was not clear if the support from COPEI and Democratic Action
would hurt or help Salas. Many Venezuelans blame the traditional
parties for squandering the country's vast oil wealth and for a
corrupt political culture that has contributed to sharply declining
living standards.
	   For her part, Saez has said she would respect COPEI's decision
but it was not immediately clear if she would quit the race.
	   In recent months, Saez has fallen from first place to fourth in
opinion polls, which show Chavez as the front-runner and Salas in
second place.

	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
on Monday promised to devote more help to assisting and training
Colombia's beleaguered armed forces.
	   In Cartagena for a three-day regional defense ministers
conference, Cohen said Washington would provide more training as
well as intelligence help, but gave no further details of a
cooperation accord to be signed Tuesday.
	   ``Essentially we are trying to help the Colombian military
restructure itself in a way that can deal with the forces of
narcotraffic and narcoterrorism and to promote greater stability
and peace in the region,'' Cohen told reporters after a breakfast
meeting with President Andres Pastrana.
	   The United States already provides more than dlrs 100 million a
year to fight drug trafficking in this country, which supplies 80
percent of the cocaine and much of the heroin sold in the United
States. Most of the aid now goes to the police, in part due to
concerns of the army's history of human rights abuses.
	   Leftist guerrillas, who fund their decades-old insurgency by
taxing cocaine production and protecting drug laboratories and
airstrips in areas they control, have been gaining strength versus
a poorly trained and equipped military, raising U.S. concerns about
Colombia's stability.
	   Colombia's Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said last week that
his country was discussing U.S. support for a planned 1,000-man
anti-narcotics battalion, to be composed of police and soldiers.
	   Pastrana said the U.S. aid symbolizes improved relations with
the United States, which revoked the visa of his predecessor,
Ernesto Samper, over charges he solicited campaign contributions
from the Cali drug cartel.
	   ``We are receiving a totally different treatment than what
existed during the last four years,'' Pastrana said.
	   The conference, which ends Wednesday, is the third meeting of
defense ministers from the United States, Canada, Latin America and
the Caribbean, excluding Cuba, since 1995. The two previous
meetings have focused on traditional military issues as well as
strengthening civilian rule and human rights in a region with a
long history of military coups.

The zebras are no favorites with Buffalo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ To the regret of the Buffalo Bills, the bottom
line on NFL officiating is this: One official's pass interference
is another's incomplete pass.
	   So while the Bills were still complaining Monday about the
interference call that gave New England one last chance to beat
them Sunday, the league office was putting a human face on it.
	   ``I think all the officials are honest people. Honest people can
make mistakes,'' said George Young, the National Football League's
senior vice president for football operations and a coach and
administrator for 30 years with the Colts, Dolphins and Giants. ``I
know. I've been on both sides of it.''
	   Don't tell that to the Bills, who lost in Foxboro following the
end zone call on Drew Bledsoe's desperation pass as time ran out.
The Patriots then scored the winning touchdown and an uncontested
2-point conversion.
	   The result dropped the Bills out of what would have been a
three-way tie for first in the AFC East.
	   The Bills, from owner Ralph Wilson on down, insist there was no
contact. And even if there was, it shouldn't have been called
because both teams were shoving.
	   ``I was supposed to be the jumper. I jumped,'' cornerback Thomas
Smith said. ``Everybody was jockeying for position back there.
There is no way you can call that. I've been playing football a
long time and I've never seen that.''
	   That was John Madden's position two weeks ago, when the
Cardinals appeared to be victimized after pass interference wasn't
called on the last play of their 35-28 loss to Dallas. Only that
pass was a short fade pattern from Jake Plummer to Rob Moore.
	   The Cardinals were as irate as the Bills were Sunday. But
Madden, who was calling the game, said, ``They never call that on
the last play.''
	   That defines the problem on a weekend when the officials were in
the spotlight again _ starting with the confusion on the coin flip
to start the overtime in the Pittsburgh-Detroit game on
Thanksgiving.
	   Some officials probably never call interference on the last play
of the game, reasoning that one object of a desperation pass is to
draw a foul. And league officials have never gotten a handle on how
to standardize pass interference calls.
	   Last season, a crew headed by Bill Carollo, in his first year as
a referee, allowed a lot of downfield bumping in a game in
Philadelphia. The next week, in Kansas City, the officials seemed
to be calling every bump.
	   No one will say, but the officials may have gotten a memo from
headquarters.
	   The league tries.
	   It sends NFL officials to NFL Europe each spring to gain more
experience.
	   And every official is graded on every play, with the grades
determining playoff assignments (although it would be an upset if
Jerry Markbreit, who is retiring after 23 seasons, is not the
referee in this season's Super Bowl.)
	   ``There's accountability for officials on every call,'' says
Young, who was co-chairman of the rule-making competition committee
before joining the league office.
	   That may be true. But it will be no consolation to the Bills (or
Steelers) if they fail to make the playoffs.
	    &UR; SPREAD DREAD: &LR;  Depending on who was making the line, the
Patriots were favored over the Bills by two to 3 1-2 points.
	   The final TD gave New England a 23-21 lead, but the officials
called the teams on the field for the extra point. Buffalo
declined, so the Patriots lined up against no one, and kicker Adam
Vinatieri ran in for two points to make the final 25-21.
	   The league doesn't know (nor does it acknowledge) how many
bettors were upset.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HISTORY CALLS: &LR;  John Elway threw three interceptions and
fumbled once. Terrell Davis was held to 74 yards on 24 carries.
	   And still Denver won 31-16 in San Diego, becoming just the
fourth NFL team to start 12-0. The others were the 1985 Bears, the
1972 Dolphins and the 1934 Bears.
	   The Bears of 13 years ago stopped right there _ they were beaten
38-24 in a Monday night game in Miami, where the Dolphins were
inspired by members of the 1972 team, the last one to finish a
season unbeaten.
	   Next Sunday, the Broncos are at home for the Chiefs, whom they
beat 30-7 at Arrowhead two weeks ago. Chiefs-Broncos is always an
intense game and it will be more intense this time because of the
wrangling on the late drive in Kansas City, when five
unsportsmanlike conduct penalties were called on the Chiefs.
	   Then Denver visits the Giants, who are going nowhere, followed
by what would be the game of the year, a meeting in Miami with the
Dolphins.
	   That will be just the second meeting between Elway and Dan
Marino, the two superstars of the quarterback class of 1983. Marino
won the first time, in Denver in 1985.
	   Another sidelight: Brian Griese, Denver's rookie third-string
quarterback is the son of Bob Griese, the quarterback for that
Miami team and now ABC's first-string college football analyst.
	   How strong are the emotions of those old Dolphins?
	   ``No question,'' Bob Griese said last week. ``I'll be with
Miami.''
	   Yes, but what if Brian were Denver's starter?
	    &UR; HOME, SWEET DOME: &LR;  If things go right for Atlanta, they won't
have to play outdoors again this season. Unless, of course, things
go very right and the Falcons end up in the Super Bowl, which will
be played outdoors in Miami.
	   Sunday's 21-10 win in St. Louis that clinched a playoff berth
was one of 11 games Atlanta will play in domes this season, eight
at home.
	   Its final four games are inside _ at Detroit and New Orleans, at
home to Indianapolis and Miami.
	   And if things stand as they are now, the Falcons will be the
NFC's second seed behind Minnesota, another dome team. They would
get a first-round bye, then play in the Georgia Dome in the second
round of the playoffs, presumably going to the Metrodome to play
the Vikings for the NFC championship.
	   But that's only if the seeds hold.
	   No dome team has ever been to a Super Bowl. The Vikings played
outdoors in Bloomington when they made their four trips in the
1970s.

Israel rules out army withdrawal from Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to Israel sted Lebanon in quote, graf 14 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli lawmakers, frustrated by
mounting troop casualties in Lebanon, lashed out at one another
Monday as the national debate over Israel's presence there widened.
	   Yossi Beilin, from the opposition Labor party who advocates a
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, said leaving troops there meant
``certain death,'' for young Israeli servicemen. He charged Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai with ``gambling with their
lives.''
	   Mordechai, a former army general, said Israel's occupation of
south Lebanon is ``dictated by reality,'' and ruled out removing
his soldiers despite the increasing death toll in a guerrilla war
there.
	   ``I am gambling with the lives of Israeli soldiers, I fought my
whole life here,'' Mordechai said after the two men walked out of a
heated session of Israel's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committees
on Lebanon.
	   Israel has patrolled a small strip of land in south Lebanon
since 1985 in an effort to halt cross-border attacks by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas on Israel's northern
communities. Opposition to Israel's military presence has
intensified however since seven Israeli soldiers were killed there
in the last two weeks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that soldiers must
remain in their positions in order to protect Israeli border
villages from Hezbollah.
	   ``Our heart is with every mother and every person who has
suffered'' because of Israel's military presence in Lebanon, he
told Israel radio. But ``we have the responsibility to do the right
thing for the state of Israel, not for the next newscast,'' he
said.
	   Mordechai told reporters that keeping Israeli soldiers in
Israel's self-declared ``security zone'' is the only option, and
``this is the opinion of security officials after they examined all
the possibilities.''
	   Beilin stormed out of the committee session, slammed the door,
and called Mordechai ``a liar.''
	   ``It's nonsense,'' fumed Beilin, normally a soft-spoken academic
type with a doctorate in political science. ``There are many
(Israeli) generals who believe we must leave this area,'' he
declared, ``and I'm sure the minister knows it.''
	   Israel's security Cabinet met for four hours Sunday and heard
briefings from military commanders about the escalating clashes
between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   During the meeting, opponents of Israel's occupation in south
Lebanon demonstrated outside, chanting, ``Lebanon is a disaster.''
	   A front-page commentary in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot
predicted that the fuss over Lebanon would die down after a few
days without new Israeli casualties in Lebanon, as it has before.
	   Columnist Nahum Barnea said the special Cabinet debate on
Lebanon was convened not so much in hopes of finding answers, but
to appease the public. ``All eyes were not focused on the
blood-drenched strip of land in Lebanon, but rather on the public
opinion polls in Israel,'' Barnea wrote.
 &UR; Lebanon's government, demanding, pick up 15th graf pvs.

Four-nation European Free Trade Association signs pact with PLO

 &UR; With US-Arafat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEUKERBAD, Switzerland (AP) _ The Palestine Liberation
Organization signed a free-trade agreement Monday with the
four-nation European Free Trade Association.
	   The accord, which is to enter into force next July 1, is to
improve commerce between the people living under the Palestinian
Authority and Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, the
only countries remaining in the association.
	   The agreement covers industrial goods, fish and agricultural
products and includes provisions to help fledgling Palestinian
industries. The accord is termed interim, with a promise that it
could become permanent after full implementation of the Oslo peace
process between the PLO and Israel.
	   EFTA already has free trade agreements with Israel, Morocco and
Turkey and is to open negotiations with Egypt on Tuesday in Geneva
for a similar accord. Swiss officials said progress was being made
for a trade pact with Canada that is to be signed next summer.
	   EFTA has shrunk in recent years as countries have defected to
the far larger and more powerful European Union.

Trinidad signs dlrs 42.9 million contract with Don King
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad has signed
a dlrs 42.9 million contract with promoter Don King for at least
three fights per year over four years, the boxer's father says.
	   The new contract comes less than a week after Trinidad lost a
legal battle to sever ties with King.
	   ``We renegotiated, and now King will be Tito's promoter while
Tito continues as champion,'' Felix Trinidad Sr. said Monday.
	   Trinidad is IBF welterweight champion. The Puerto Rican fighter
received a dlrs 300,000 advance upon signing the contract in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. last weekend, his father said.
	   Last week, the decision of a federal judge in New York forced
Trinidad to cancel a contract he had signed with Dino Duva of Main
Events, who had promised him a Jan. 9 bout with former lightweight
and welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker.
	   Under the new contract, King promised to arrange a fight in 1999
with either Whitaker or Vincent Pettway.
	   King had argued that a clause in the previous four-year contract
automatically renewed the contract with King as long as Trinidad
remained champion. Trinidad's father, who is also his manager,
claimed the clause only applied if Trinidad won a different
championship title. The judge agreed with King.
	   Trinidad is unbeaten in 33 fights with 29 knockouts, but he has
only fought twice in the last 16 months because of the dispute with
King.
	   In August 1997 Trinidad knocked out Australian Troy Waters in
the first round, and on April 2 he knocked out challenger Mahenge
Zulu of Zaire.
	   The new contract reopens the possibility of a match with Ike
Quartey of Ghana, whose fight with Trinidad was canceled because of
the lawsuit. Trinidad has also said he wants to fight Oscar De La
Hoya, the WBC welterweight champion.

Major Venezuela party withdraws support for former Miss Universe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in final two grafs decision by Democratic Action to expel
former candidate from party. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN GUTKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A major political party withdrew its
support Monday for a former Miss Universe in favor of a businessman
in hopes of blocking an ex-coup leader's run for Venezuela's
presidency.
	   The center-right COPEI Party concluded the foundering candidacy
of Irene Saez was dividing the vote against former Lt. Col. Hugo
Chavez, increasing his chances of victory in nationwide voting next
Sunday.
	   Donald Ramirez, secretary general of COPEI, announced the party
would back Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer instead
of Saez.
	   ``The democratic vote should unite itself to guarantee peace and
freedom, and that guarantee at this moment is represented by the
independent candidacy of Henrique Salas Romer,'' Ramirez told
reporters after the party voted to back Salas.
	   Members of Venezuela's political establishment have been
scrambling for over a week to head off a presidential victory by
Chavez, who staged an unsuccessful coup attempt against the
government in 1992.
	   Over the weekend, Salas, 62, a former governor of the central
state of Carabobo, also received the backing of Venezuela's other
traditional party, center-left Democratic Action.
	   The leaders of both parties are asking their supporters to vote
for Salas so as not to divide the anti-Chavez vote.
	   Chavez's candidacy has polarized Venezuela between the poor who
view him as a hero and the wealthy establishment that believes he
will install a leftist dictatorship.
	   It was not clear if the support from COPEI and Democratic Action
would hurt or help Salas. Many Venezuelans blame the traditional
parties for squandering the country's vast oil wealth and for a
corrupt political culture that has contributed to sharply declining
living standards.
	   For her part, Saez has said she would respect COPEI's decision
but it was not immediately clear if she would quit the race.
	   In recent months, Saez has fallen from first place to fourth in
opinion polls, which show Chavez as the front-runner and Salas in
second place.
	   Until Friday, Democratic Action's candidate had been Luis
Alfaro, a 77-year-old party stalwart who for decades had ruled the
organization with an iron hand.
	   He refused to accept the party's decision to dump him as its
candidate. So on Monday, Democratic Action's leadership voted to
expel him from the party.

Tutu urges world to tackle AIDS as it tackled apartheid
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ On the eve of World AIDS Day, Archbishop
Desmond Tutu of South Africa urged the world community Monday to
tackle the scourge of AIDS with the same commitment that it tackled
apartheid.
	   Tutu said governments should cut a small percentage of their
defense budgets so that they can spend more on affordable health
care, AIDS research and education.
	   ``We aren't doing enough to say to governments, for goodness
sake, why have so much money for death and so little for life,''
Tutu said at a seminar sponsored by the American Foundation for
AIDS Research.
	   Even though Africa has been hardest-hit by the HIV virus, he
said, AIDS knows no boundaries and is spreading to Asia and Eastern
Europe.
	   According to a new U.N. report, about 33.4 million people around
the world are infected with HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan
Africa, and nearly 6 million more people will be infected this
year.
	   ``These are people of flesh and blood,'' Tutu stressed.
``Imagine if it were your children, your son, your mother, your
wife, your husband. ... God has organized things in such a way that
whether we like it or not, we are family _ we belong in one
world.''
	   Dr. Mathilde Krim, professor of public health at Columbia
University and chairman of the board of the AIDS research
foundation, said there is an ethical obligation to take care of
AIDS sufferers, wherever they are.
	   ``And it is also in our best self interests because ... this
virus will continue to travel around the world whether we like it
or not. We cannot protect only our country from it. Nobody will be
safe until everybody is safe _ and that's the message,'' she said.
	   Among the participants at the seminar was Princess Chulabhorn of
Thailand, one of the Asian countries hardest-hit by AIDS.
	   Mead Over, senior economist at the World Bank who has researched
the economics of the AIDS epidemic, praised the Thai government's
efforts to tackle the disease. But he said: ``We still don't know
the solution to getting democratically elected governments to act
courageously in the case of this epidemic.''
	   Over said the World Bank is trying to come up with financial
incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop AIDS vaccines
even though most of the users would be in poor countries that
cannot spend much money on medicine.
	   The World Bank is considering offering countries hard-hit by
AIDS loans that would be contingent on the development of an HIV
vaccine, Over said.
	   Such a vaccine will be neither cheap nor _ at least initially _
a panacea, said Dean-designate Barry Bloom of the Harvard School of
Public Health.
	   It is ``singularly unlikely'' that the first, second or possibly
any generation of an AIDS vaccine will be 100 percent effective, he
said. ``If we could get one that was 50 percent effective ... we'd
be saving tens, hundreds of millions of lives.''

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Coach Louis Van Gaal's future at FC
Barcelona appeared shaky on Monday with news reports saying he has
been given until Christmas to solve the club's performance
problems.
	   But Barcelona vicepresident Joan Gaspart has been trying to
restore calm, publicly denying that Van Gaal has been issued an
ultimatum.
	   ``Today he continues, but nobody know what's going to happen in
the future,'' Gaspart was quoted as saying on Monday in the
national daily El Periodico de Barcelona.
	   The latest rumors, coming after months of mediocre play, were
triggered by the team's loss to Atletico de Madrid on Saturday.
	   When a successfully converted penalty by Vladimir Jugovic of
Atletico de Madrid rolled into the goal, the calls for Van Gaal's
head grew louder. His contract expires in June 1999.
	   ``Cornered'' said a headline in the city's main sports daily, El
Mundo Deportivo. The Barcelona-based national daily, El Periodico
de Barcelona, ran a story headlined ``Nunez, urges on Van Gaal,''
referring to Barcelona's chairman Josep Nunez's apparent message to
Van Gaal to sort out the club quickly.
	   Barcelona, which with Atletico de Madrid pays the highest
salaries in of Spanish clubs, started the year with irregular
performances and has not been top of the League since this year's
season started on Aug. 30. It is now placed fifth.
	   Van Gaal's highly disciplined style of coaching is seen as less
effective than that of a former coach Johan Cruyff, when stars such
as Michael Laudrup brought success to the club.
	   Van Gaal has clinched some success for Barcelona, guiding them
to the League championship last year and to the finals of the
Spanish King's Cup.

 &UR; Swedish NHL stars rate Sundin and Lidstrom as best

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nicklas Lidstrom of Detroit Red Wings
and Mats Sundin of Toronto are Sweden's top hockey players in the
National Hockey League according to their own peers.
	   The Reds' defenseman shared the title as No. 1 with Toronto's
captain, surprisingly beating Colorado's Peter Forsberg when the
Swedish news agency TT published their poll of nine Swedish NHLers
Monday.
	   ``It's amazing that he didn't get the Norris Trophy last
season,'' Sundin said about Lidstrom who lost out to Rob Blake of
the Los Angeles Kings.
	   ``Blake has not been bad, but Lidstrom has been Detroit's
dominating player during the two consecutive years they have won
the Stanley Cup,'' Sundin told TT.
	   Sundin and Lidstrom tied for first-place with 33 points with
Forsberg runner-up at 30. Fourth-placed New York Rangers'
defenseman Ulf Samuelsson scored 6 points, Ottawa Senators' Daniel
Alfredsson 4 and Calle Johansson of the Washington Capitals 2
points.
	   The top-three NHLers voted accordingly:
	   Lidstrom and Sundin tied for No. 1 in Forsberg's vote,
Alfredsson placed third.
	   Lidstrom had a hard choice between Sundin and Forsberg, but
selected the Leafs' captain.
	   ``They're exceptional and very hard to stop. They're among the
best in the NHL,'' Lidstrom said.
	   Sundin voted for Lidstrom, with Forsberg and Calle Johansson as
second and third.
	   Asked about his rivalry with Forsberg, Sundin replied:
	   ``It's fun. I like the competition. It's very inspiring when we
play on the national team.''
	   The following nine players were polled:
	   Peter Forsberg, Colorado; Lidstrom, Detroit; Sundin, Toronto;
Tomas Holmstrom, Detroit; Andreas Johansson, Ottawa; Fredrik Modin,
Toronto; Tommy Salo and Kenny Jonsson of the New York Islanders;
and Niklas Sundstrom, New York Rangers.

Brazil stocks drop 5.1 percent ending winning streak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazilian stocks closed sharply lower Monday
following a three-session winning streak, with traders blaming
profit-taking and losses on Wall Street.
	   The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index lost 5.1 percent in
light trading, while the smaller Rio de Janeiro exchange closed
down 4.8 percent.
	   ``The market had been wanting to take profits for about a week
now,'' one Sao Paulo trader said. ``We were looking for a pretext
to do it and the losses abroad today (Monday) gave us one.''
	   In spite of Monday's drop, the Bovespa showed a cumulative 23
percent gain in November. The Bovespa, however, has dropped around
16 percent since the beginning of the year.

Mexico kicks out clergymen delivering aid, detains Italian
</HEADLINE>
tourists &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Mexican authorities
announced Monday that they are kicking out five U.S. clergymen who
were delivering food to southern Mexico's poor Indians because they
traveled to a town not listed on their itinerary.
	   The clergymen, part of a 29-member delegation of the
Chicago-based Pastors for Peace group, were briefly detained
Saturday when they traveled to the village of El Bosque in the
southern state of Chiapas.
	   Andres Chao, spokesman for Mexico's immigration institute, said
the Americans were told to leave by Friday under new regulations
that went into effect in May. The regulations state that foreign
observers or humanitarian workers must list all places they intend
to visit in their visa application.
	   Lucius Walker, president of Pastors for Peace, said the five
were on their way to the town of Union y Progreso with a truckload
of food because they had heard people there were going hungry.
	   He said the dirt road was impassable, so the five took a detour
_ sending them into the village of Los Platanos, which they hadn't
listed on their visa applications. There, state police officers
detained them.
	   Chao said the pastors were detained for their own safety because
the area is near the zone of influence of Zapatista rebels, who
staged a brief uprising in January 1994. There has been little
fighting while peace talks with the government have stalled.
	   ``It's for their own safety,'' Chao said.
	   He said of the five Pastors for Peace members who were ordered
to leave Mexico, two left voluntarily on Monday. The other three
were ordered to leave by Friday. He said the action wasn't an
expulsion, since they would be allowed to return to Mexico.
	   In a separate action, police detained three Italian tourists in
northern Chiapas state and accused them of participating in Mexican
politics, which is illegal under a tourist visa.
	   Chao said a judge in the village of Yehitz accused the three of
``participating in political chats'' and ordered them arrested.
	   They were taken to the highlands city of San Cristobal de las
Casas where they were ordered to make a statement Tuesday night,
Chao said. He said migration officials would decide their fate
after that.
	   Jose Montero, a lawyer for the Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human
Rights Center, identified the tourists as Danielle Aronna, Jean
Piero Cofuno y Laura Macina. He didn't give their hometowns.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lennox Lewis is getting the fight he wants. And
Evander Holyfield says Lewis also will get something he's not
looking for.
	   ``Two things are going to happen,'' said Holyfield, who will
fight WBC champion Lewis for the undisputed heavyweight title March
13 in Madison Square Garden. ``I'm either going to knock him out
good or I'm going to knock him out bad.''
	   ``The fans are getting a fight they want to see,'' said Lewis,
the WBC champion from Britain. ``I've been waiting for this fight
for such a long time. It's basically overdue.''
	   Holyfield, the WBA-IBF champion, said, however, ``I never
thought it wouldn't happen.''
	   Promoter Don King and Seth Abraham, president and CEO of Time
Warner Sports, said at a news conference Monday that it took a year
to put together the match that will distributed on pay-per-view by
Time Warner's TVKO.
	   ``I predict to you we will sell the Garden out and we will have
2 million (pay-per-view buys),'' King crowed. A sellout would be
about 19,000 seats.
	   The Garden reportedly is paying a live site fee of dlrs 8.5
million.
	   ``I can't confirm that figure,'' said Dave Checketts, Garden
president and CEO. ``Is it substantial? Yes. I think we're going to
sell out at pretty substantial prices. I think we'll be fine. This
will put us in the fight game in a very big way.''
	   Ticket prices will range from dlrs 1,500 to dlrs 100. No
pay-per-view price has been announced, but it is expected to be
dlrs 49.95. One of the pay-per-view exhibitors, who keep half the
pay-per-view revenue, will be Cablevision, which is available in 3
million homes.
	   The biggest pay-per-view sale for a fight was 1.99 million for
the Holyfield-Mike Tyson rematch carried by SET. Tyson has been
involved in the four top pay-per-view bouts and seven of the top
10.
	   ``He's had his reasons for staying away from me, and they'll be
apparent in the fight,'' said 33-year-old Lewis (34-1, 27
knockouts). ``He definitely was ducking me.''
	   Holyfield (36-3, 26 knockouts) said circumstances prevented the
fight from not happening until now.
	   The 36-year-old champion said that after he was stopped in the
eighth round in third bout against Riddick Bowe, a non-title fight
in 1995, HBO asked him whom he would like to fight.
	   ``I said Lennox Lewis,'' he said. ``He didn't want to fight me
then.''
	   So Holyfield fought Bobby Czyz in the Garden on May 10, 1996,
and although he won in five rounds, he looked unimpressive.
Holyfield thinks his performance is what encouraged Tyson to defend
the WBA title against him. Holyfield's 11th-round victory led to
the rematch in which Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's
ears.
	   Holyfield said he then had a chance to win the IBF title and
avenge a defeat by Michael Moorer, which he did by stopping Moorer
in the eighth round Nov. 8, 1997.
	   He then had to fight Vaughn Beat in an IBF mandatory defense,
which he won on points Sept. 19. He still owes a WBA mandatory
defense against Henry Akinwande or the highest available contender,
which he would make on Showtime if he wins March 13.
	   Lewis made a WBC mandatory defense by outpointing Zeljko
Mavrovic of Croatia on Sept. 26.

Boudouani stops Norris to defend super welterweight title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Laurent Boudouani defended his WBA super
welterweight title on Monday, stopping an exhausted Terry Norris in
the final seconds of the ninth round.
	   It was the Frenchman's fourth successful defense of the title he
first won in 1996 by beating Julio Vasquez.
	   After a close start, Boudouani began to dominate and, by the
ninth, Norris was barely able to keep his feet after a succession
of thundering right hand blows from the champion.
	   Norris, desperate for a win to boost his flagging career after
two consecutive defeats, was lively and attacked from the bell.
	   But he landed few blows against an opponent showing first class
footwork.
	   Norris had his best chance at the end of the third, when he hurt
Boudouani with a powerful right hook, but the champion was saved
from further punishment by the bell.
	   But Norris, who had to lose 1.3 kg (three pounds) on the day
before the fight to make the weight limit, quickly tired.
	   In the fourth, the champion suddenly sprang into action with
several big punches to Norris' head.
	   And in a bruising sixth round, Boudouani again looked to have
done enough with a series of right hand blows, but Norris again
somehow stayed on his feet.
	   Both fighters weighed in at 69.8 kg (154 pounds).
	   In a distinguished career, 31-year-old Norris has fought no
fewer than 25 world title bouts, and beaten 16 world champions _
including the likes of Sugar Ray Leonard, John Mugabi and Don
Curry.
	   But his defeat, his third in succession, could mean the end of
his career.
	   The Frenchman is now 38-1-2.

Presidents of Djibouti, Congo fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: STANDS as 1st Ld-Writethru to some points to UPDATE with UN
officials saying none received permission for flight &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Djibouti's President Hassan Gouled Aptidon
flew to Libya on Monday for talks with Moammar Gadhafi in violation
of a U.N. flight ban, Libyan radio and U.N. officials said.
	   Aptidon's arrival in Libya follows visits by the presidents of
Gambia and Congo and by Louis Farrakhan, head of the U.S. Nation of
Islam.
	   A U.N. flight permission is required to fly to Libya. U.N.
officials said Monday in New York that none of the officials
obtained such permission.
	   Aptidon flew into Libya's coastal city of Sirte from Paris where
he attended a French-African summit, said the radio report which
was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Libya was not invited to the summit because of the 1992 U.N.
embargo.
	   The embargo was imposed to force Libya hand over for trial two
suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the flight ban on
Libya. Since then, several African leaders have defied the ban and
flown to Libya.
	   On Sunday, Congolese President Laurent Kabila arrived in Sirte
from Paris to brief Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on the Paris
summit, Libyan radio said.
	   Also Sunday, Gadhafi awarded Gambian President Yahya Jammeh the
Bravery medal for ignoring the sanctions.
	   Gadhafi praised the African leaders for what he called an
``honorable'' stand for breaking the sanctions. He chided Arab
leaders for not following suit.

Isiah Thomas says Hunter, Ewing might have to be replaced
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Isiah Thomas, who has been both an NBA owner and
union president, thinks the players might need to replace Billy
Hunter and Patrick Ewing at the bargaining table in order to get a
deal done.
	   ``Billy Hunter has that option, and it may be an option that he
and Patrick decide they want to explore,'' Thomas said Monday as
the lockout finished its fifth month. ``You've got to protect the
players, and you can't keep letting the players get hurt.''
	   Saying he expects the season to be canceled because of the
mistrust that has developed, Thomas said the players have three
choices.
	   ``They can not have a season, they can take a tough deal or they
can get some new blood at the table. It's a question of which
choice they will make,'' he said.
	   ``This is no knock on anyone, but the way I always ran the union
was if we brought in talent and that talent wasn't performing, we
had the opportunity to bring in someone else who would perform.''
	   Thomas played for the Detroit Pistons from 1981-94 and was
president of the union from 1990-94 before becoming vice president
and part-owner of the Toronto Raptors. He currently works as an
analyst for NBC on its NBA telecasts.
	   Having seen past negotiations from both sides of the table,
Thomas has a unique perspective on the current crisis. And it's so
bad, he says, that there will not be a season.
	   ``That's the way I read the cards,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``There has to be a level of trust and understanding,
and the people negotiating this deal do not trust one another and
therefore are not able to negotiate honestly.''
	   Monday, which was supposed to be the players' second payday,
also marked the 11th day since the last full negotiating session
was held. The sides are at odds over whether there will be
preconditions for a resumption of talks.
	   In the debate over whether the owners would really cancel the
entire season, Hunter has questioned whether the owners would be
``suicidal.''
	   Thomas says they would.
	   ``I've been in the room with these guys, and it's very, very
real. It's not a bluff. And the problem here is that both sides
have come to the table and thought the other was bluffing or
posturing instead of getting down to the nitty-gritty of a deal,''
Thomas said.
	   Now, however, he said ``there's a lack of trust at the table
that is not good.''
	   No players have called for Hunter, the union director, and
Ewing, the union president, to step aside, but Thomas said the
players will have to consider it.
	   ``That's an option the union has and should always have. It's OK
to be unified, but I prefer to have unity with money.
	   ``From my experiences, whenever you have a labor negotiation
impasse and you have bad blood at the table, then from a union's
perspective if your goal is to represent (all the players), it
might be like in a basketball game when you're down 12 in the third
quarter, and you've got to sub.
	   ``You've got to rebuild some trust between the sides.''
	   Hunter did not return a call seeking comment.

Patrik Jaerbyn solves course, Super-G field
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ Swedish World Cup veteran Patrik Jaerbyn,
surprised three days earlier by a tricky turn in a race on Aspen
Mountain, handled the course with no problems Monday to win a
super-G against a field packed with European skiers by
three-hundredths of a second.
	   Jaerbyn covered the 40-gate course on the first day of two U.S.
Ski Team Visa Super Series races in 1 minute, 15.77 seconds. Peter
Runggaldier, the 1995 World Cup super-G champion from Italy, was
second in the field of 120 racers with a time of 1:15.80.
	   ``This was just as hard a course as the World Cup race Friday,''
Jaerbyn said, ``but maybe I was better prepared this time. It was
such a good course, a good challenge.''
	   Two Americans broke into the top-10 finishers. Dane Spencer of
Boise, Idaho, was eighth and Sacha Gros of Vail, Colo., finished
10th.
	   The Super Series resumes Tuesday with another super-G, the
hybrid event mixing the speed of downhill with the turns of giant
slalom.

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials plunged 216 points Monday in
the first real barrage of profit-taking since the stock market
rebound began less than two months ago. Recording its first one-day
loss of more than 200 points since Oct. 1, the Dow Jones industrial
average sank 216.53 points _ or by 2.3 percent _ to 9,116.55.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank,
announced Monday that it will acquire Bankers Trust Corp. in a dlrs
10.1 billion deal that will create the world's largest financial
institution. The deal is part of Deutsche Bank's strategy to expand
in the United States, and to ensure the merger's success Deutsche
Bank has dedicated dlrs 400 million to retain top staff from both
banks for an unspecified period. The acquisition of Bankers Trust,
the eighth-largest bank in the United States, is the largest
takeover of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank,
creating an institution with assets of more than dlrs 800 billion.
That surpasses UBS AG of Switzerland, currently the largest bank.
(DEUTSCHE BANK-BANKERS TRUST)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Hoechst and France's
Rhone-Poulenc are near agreement on a deal to form one of the
world's largest life-sciences firms by merging their pharmaceutical
and agrochemical units. The partial merger is in advance of a
complete merger expected in two years, the Frankfurter Allegemeine
newspaper reported Monday. Analysts have warned against a full
merger until the heavily indebted firms reduce costs. The companies
have scheduled a press conference Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, to
discuss details of the agreement, a Hoechst spokesman said. With
annual sales of around dlrs 20 billion, the new company will be
tied for No. 1 ranking with Switzerland's Novartis AG in the
life-sciences sector, according to analysts. (GERMANY-HOECHST-RHONE

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government canceled a budget debate
Monday, one day before a visit by the head of the International
Monetary Fund, which is demanding a sound budget as a condition for
giving more aid to the crisis-ridden country. The budget discussion
was first rescheduled for Thursday, then postponed until next week.
The government insisted the delay was not connected with the visit
by IMF chief Michel Camdessus, but gave few other details. The
Cabinet of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has warned that Russia
would suffer serious problems if it doesn't get more aid from the
IMF. But the IMF and Western governments say they won't provide any
cash until Russia adopts a realistic budget. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Talks between oil companies Shell and Texaco over
a possible alliance in their European refining and retail
operations have been called off, the companies said Monday. The
companies had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding in
September to try to negotiate a possible joint venture aimed at
saving dlrs 200 million a year. Talks began last year, the
companies said. (BRITAIN-SHELL-TEXACO)
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Entergy Corp. is selling London Electricity,
a regional power distribution company in London, to France's
national electrical utility for dlrs 3.18 billion. The deal
announced Monday was the second major transaction involving
Entergy's overseas distribution companies in a week. Entergy agreed
to sell CitiPower, based in Melbourne, Australia, to U.S.-based AEP
Resources Inc. for dlrs 1.1 billion on Nov. 23. The sale of London
Electricity to Electricite de France is the latest step in a
restructuring plan under which New Orleans-based Entergy is
focusing on core power generating businesses in an attempt to
increase its profitability. (US-ENTERGY-LONDON ELECTRICITY)
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Britain's Vickers PLC concern on Monday
announced plans to take over the Norwegian maritime engineering
concern Ulstein Holding ASA, excluding its shipbuilding division,
for 304 million pounds (dlrs 502 million). On completion of the
deal, Ulstein's shipbuilding division will be split off and sold
back to its original Norwegian owners, the British engineering
company said. The agreement is subject to financing and the
approval of stockholders and regulatory agencies. Ulstein, which
employs 4,150 people in 17 countries, designs and produces such
marine equipment as propellers, steering mechanisms and
stabilizers. (NORWAY-VICKERS-ULSTEIN)

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton sought to push the
Mideast peace effort forward Monday, meeting with Yasser Arafat and
pledging to nearly double U.S. aid to the Palestinians. Overall,
more than dlrs 3 billion was promised to the Palestinians at an
international donors conference here. ``I am satisfied,'' Arafat
said in response to the announcement by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. She called the total ``a significant
achievement.'' The European Union pledged dlrs 2 billion in
assistance to Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza over five
years, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said at a
closing news conference. Albright, confirming an announcement
earlier by Clinton, said the United States intends to
``significantly increase'' its contribution by adding dlrs 400
million to the dlrs 500 million it had planned to donate over the
next five years. (US-MIDEAST)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The London hospital where Gen. Augusto Pinochet is
being held under police guard said Monday that the former Chilean
dictator no longer needs special medical care and should quickly
find another place to stay. The statement by the Grovelands Priory
appeared to be a new blow to any hopes the 83-year-old Pinochet had
of fighting extradition to Spain on grounds he is unfit for trial.
The private psychiatric hospital, sounding openly impatient, noted
at a Nov. 17 bail hearing that lawyers had said Pinochet, who
underwent back surgery Oct. 9, was fit enough to appear in court.
He is now due to appear Dec. 11. ``It is now the responsibility of
Gen. Pinochet's advisers to find alternative accommodation,'' the
hospital statement said. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec voters, courted more persistently than
voters almost anywhere, chose a provincial government Monday in an
election that could move Canada a big step closer to another
traumatic showdown over secession. The separatist Parti Quebecois,
under the charismatic leadership of Premier Lucien Bouchard, was
widely favored to return to power. If victorious, Bouchard planned
to call another referendum on independence whenever he felt
conditions were right for a separatist triumph. Bouchard's main
rival was Jean Charest, leader of the anti-separatist Quebec
Liberal Party, who tried to convince voters that the province could
prosper only if the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.
(CANADA-QUEBEC ELECTION)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli lawmakers lashed out at one
another Monday about Israel's presence in southern Lebanon, where
mounting troop casualties have stirred national debate. Yossi
Beilin, from the opposition Labor party who advocates a unilateral
withdrawal from Lebanon, said leaving troops there meant ``certain
death'' for young Israeli servicemen. He charged Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai with ``gambling with their lives.''
Mordechai, a former army general, said Israel's occupation of south
Lebanon is ``dictated by reality,'' and ruled out removing his
soldiers despite the recent death toll in a guerrilla war there.
Israel has patrolled a small strip of land in Lebanon since 1985 in
an effort to halt cross-border attacks by Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrillas on Israel's northern communities. Opposition to Israel's
military presence has intensified, however, since seven Israeli
soldiers were killed there in the last two weeks. (ISRAEL-LEBANON)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ On the eve of World AIDS Day, Archbishop
Desmond Tutu of South Africa urged the world community Monday to
tackle the scourge of AIDS with the same commitment that it tackled
apartheid. Tutu said governments should cut a small percentage of
their defense budgets so that they can spend more on affordable
health care, AIDS research and education. ``We aren't doing enough
to say to governments, for goodness sake, why have so much money
for death and so little for life,'' Tutu said at a seminar
sponsored by the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Even though
Africa has been hardest-hit by the HIV virus, he said, AIDS knows
no boundaries and is spreading to Asia and Eastern Europe.
According to a new U.N. report, about 33.4 million people around
the world are infected with HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan
Africa, and nearly 6 million more people will be infected this
year. (UN-AIDS)

 &UR; Eds: Items are on pop stars raising money for a bombing in Ireland,
Tom Hanks and Bill Clinton, a gift of two lions for Saddam Hussein,
and a horse that fell into a swimming pool, Michael Jackson. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sinead O'Connor and Van Morrison lent their voices
to a star-studded album released in Britain to raise money for
victims of the Aug. 15 bombing in Northern Ireland.
	   The album released Monday, ``Across The Bridge Of Hope,''
features stars U2 and Boyzone, and includes a reading by actor Liam
Neeson of a poem written by 12-year-old Shaun McLaughlin, who was
killed in the attack.
	   The boy's poem about peace in Northern Ireland inspired the
title of the album.
	   A car bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents killed 29
people and injured 370 in Omagh.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Actor Tom Hanks says he regrets giving U.S.
President Bill Clinton's legal defense fund dlrs 10,000 in light of
the president's admission that he had an inappropriate relationship
with White House staffer Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``We gave ten thousand bucks very early on,'' Hanks said in an
interview published in the Dec. 7-14 issue of the New Yorker
magazine.
	   ``In all honesty, in the light of events since, it would be
awfully hard to say now, 'Oh, here, let me help you out with this
problem,''' Hanks said.
	   The New Yorker writer at one point jokes that Hanks could have
offered to buy Clinton a house, and Hanks concludes by saying:
``But he ain't getting that house. I'll tell you that right now.''
	   Hanks, who has starred in such hits as ``Forrest Gump,''
``Apollo 13'' and ``Philadelphia,'' and his wife, actress Rita
Wilson, have stayed overnight at the White House three times in the
last five years, according to the magazine.
	   Yet Hanks stops short of calling Clinton a friend.
	   ``I'm friendly with him. But I don't think I've ever had a true
connective conversation with him,'' Hanks said. ``I just can't. I'm
still in the 'Jeepers creepers, he's talking to me' kind of
thing.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may have
caused controversy because of his dispute with the United Nations
over weapons inspections, but he still has a friend in Sudan, which
has sent him a gift of two African lions.
	   The London-based Al-Wassat weekly said in its Monday edition
that the beasts, apparently captured in Sudan, were sent by Sudan's
interior minister, Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohamed Hussein.
	   ``The two lions crossed the Jordanian territories into Iraq last
week,'' the magazine said. Sudanese officials in Jordan confirmed
the report.
	   It was unclear if the lions were intended as a personal gift for
Saddam or for Iraq's zoo, where many animals reportedly have
perished since the United Nations imposed trade sanctions against
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Sudan is among a handful of Arab countries that have supported
Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, which drove Iraq from Kuwait, and its
Islamic government maintains close relations with Baghdad.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   KENNESAW, Georgia (AP) _ You can lead a horse to water, but
don't let him wander onto the swimming-pool cover.
	   Ask Katrina Duncan, a house-sitter turned lifeguard after Ace, a
Tennessee walking horse, plunged through the plastic covering into
the deep end of a pool Saturday night in the U.S. state of Georgia.
	   Ms. Duncan had gone outside to feed the 1,200-pound (545
kilograms) horse but couldn't find him. She then saw the torn pool
cover.
	   After calling authorities, Ms. Duncan, 29, climbed into the
chilly pool, got hold of the horse's neck and led him to the
shallow end.
	   ``It took a few pulls to get him onto the steps, and he got
out,'' she said.
	   Ace seemed a bit sluggish but responded well when Ms. Duncan put
him in his stall and dried him off.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A spokesman for Michael Jackson dismissed a
British newspaper report that said the pop superstar was
considering sending his 21-month-old son to an expensive British
boarding school when he reaches high school age.
	   ``No one knows anything about this. They make this stuff up,''
spokesman Bob Jones said Monday.
	   The Sunday Telegraph said that Jackson had sent a representative
to inspect Stowe and inquire about booking a place for the boy,
Prince, at the boarding school in Buckinghamshire.
	   The school, about 50 miles (80 kms) northwest of London, charges
nearly dlrs 25,000 a year; it's most famous pupil is Virgin
Atlantic Airways boss Richard Branson.
	   The school has declined to comment on the report.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia, (AP)_ The United States and Australia on
Tuesday agreed to jointly promote electronic commerce throughout
the Asia-Pacific region.
	   This was a key point in a detailed agreement between Prime
Minister John Howard and U.S. President Bill Clinton, which
includes concessions on both sides.
	   The United States has agreed to relinquish what Australia has
seen as undue American influence in the key area of naming domains
on the Internet.
	   This influences who gets the biggest and best sites on the net.
	   Australia, in turn, has agreed to apply industry standards to
development on the Internet.
	   Early indications in Australia suggested that its conservative
government would attempt a more prescriptive approach, with
legislation designed to regulate pornography in particular.
	   The two countries also agreed that third countries should not
try to censor material on the Internet merely because it is written
in another country.
	   Although they were too polite to say so, this was directed at
countries like China, in which censorship is generally much tighter
than in the West.
	   Australia and the United States also agreed to work together to
develop secure payment systems on the Internet.

Speedway expected to announce Formula One race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE HERMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The Indianapolis Motor Speedway, once the
exclusive domain of the Indianapolis 500, is expected to add a
Formula One race in 2000.
	   Speedway president Tony George has scheduled a news conference
for Wednesday amid speculation the international race series would
return to the United States for the first time since 1991.
	   The Indy 500 was the only race at the Speedway until 1994, when
the Brickyard 400 was added as part of NASCAR's Winston Cup series.
This year, the International Race of Champions also made Indy part
of its season tour.
	   Spokesman Fred Nation would not confirm a deal had been
finalized, although two months ago he said George and Formula One
president Bernie Ecclestone had met three times this year to
discuss the possibility of bringing a race to the Speedway.
	   George first submitted a proposal to Ecclestone in March.
	   At another meeting with Ecclestone in June, George proposed a
multiyear commitment, reportedly calling for the Speedway to put up
$10 million to be the host for the race and spend another $15
million to build a road course in and around the existing 2{-mile
oval track.
	   Other cities believed to have made bids were San Francisco, Las
Vegas and Atlanta.
	   ``The difference with us and (the other cities) is that we have
everything in place to do a deal tomorrow,'' George said at that
time. ``No one else does.''
	   The only Formula One race in North America now is the Canadian
Grand Prix held in Montreal in June.
	   The last Formula One race in the United States was at Phoenix in
1991. The series competed at Watkins Glen during the 1960s and '70s
and was joined by a second U.S. Grand Prix in Long Beach, Calif.,
in the mid-'70s.
	   The Watkins Glen race was moved to the streets of downtown
Detroit in the 1980s, then because of escalating costs, Long Beach
and Detroit switched to Indy-car races and Formula One organized
less successful events in Las Vegas, Dallas and Phoenix.
	   A U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis would require major track
renovations that probably would begin after the 1999 Brickyard 400.
	   George earlier proposed using the track's existing first and
second turns and most of the front straightaway, although a new
section of track for a road course would have to be built in the
infield. Also, installing the necessary 24 pit-side garages would
require removing a portion of the grandstand behind the existing
pit road.

Search for premier after Hariri reportedly will not seek job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs with Hariri's telling CNN he's bowing out. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business
tycoon who launched Lebanon's multibillion dollar reconstruction
from the devastation of civil war, said Monday he was bowing out as
premier following a dispute with the new president.
	   Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new
government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by
Hariri's possible departure could also affect Lebanon's economic
recovery.
	   ``I'm not a candidate,'' Hariri said in a live interview with
CNN.
	   He demanded that President Emile Lahoud admit that he acted
unconstitutionally by allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize
him to name a prime minister instead of naming one themselves.
	   Such an action ``might put the country in danger,'' Hariri
warned.
	   Lahoud, 62, is an army commander who wants to assert his
authority at the start of his six-year presidential term. Hariri,
53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country since he
became premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi.
	   Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday.
	   Lahoud set the stage for choosing a new prime minister when he
scheduled a fresh round of consultations with Parliament for
Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to
form the next government after a previous round of consultations.
	   The offer came after the 128 legislators polled by the president
gave Hariri a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing
he had received in his previous three mandates since 1992.
	   Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and
stabilizing the national currency. But he was faulted for declining
living standards at home and a rise in corruption in government.
	   Lahoud pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the
graft-riddled administration. The general enjoys widespread popular
backing after succeeding in rebuilding an army fractured by civil
war.
	   Central bank officials on Monday tried to calm fears about a run
on the Lebanese pound by announcing that the bank was ready to
intervene with its foreign currency reserves if necessary, the
state-run National News Agency reported. It added that the money
markets remained stable.

Kabila says no guarantee of peace in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's President Laurent Kabila on
Monday cast further doubt on a cease-fire agreement announced in
Paris last week that has since been ignored by rebels headquartered
in eastern Congo.
	   There was no guarantee of peace in Africa's Great Lakes region
and conditions leading to a cessation of hostilities still had to
be hashed out, Kabila said in a broadcast by Congolese state radio
monitored by the BBC.
	   He did not say whether his forces were holding to a cease-fire
in the meantime.
	   The agreement had been reached by the leaders of Congo,
Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda following a meeting in Paris. Zimbabwe
is supporting Congo's government in the four-month war while Rwanda
and Uganda are backing Congolese rebels based in Congo's eastern
regions.
	   The rebels are fighting to oust Kabila, who they accuse of
corruption and ethnic favoritism.
	   Kabila said the ceasefire agreement was to be discussed again
next week by leaders meeting in Lusaka, Zambia. It was not clear if
rebels, who were excluded from the discussions in Paris, were
invited.
	   ``No cease-fire has been signed yet,'' Kabila said. ``It was
just an option forward to the cessation of hostilities, but
everything must be discussed.
	   ``The problem is to tie the cease-fire to the withdrawal of the
invading troops,'' Kabila said. He has accused Uganda and Rwanda,
which have sent troops and equipment to support Congolese rebels in
eastern Congo, of masterminding the rebellion.
	   Rwandan and Congolese rebel commanders in eastern Congo,
meanwhile, have paid little attention to the ceasefire. The rebels
were not invited to the talks in Paris and say that although they
have stopped fighting, they are preparing for further offensives.
	   Patrick Mazimhaka, a minister in the office of Rwanda's
president, told the BBC on Sunday that Rwandan troops would
continue backing the rebels.

Pinochet nephew denies published report on suicide suggestion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A nephew of Gen. Augusto Pinochet denied
a British newspaper report that quoted him as saying the embattled
former Chilean dictator had told his family that he would rather
die than stand trial in Spain on charges of genocide and torture.
	   ``They are telling lies. I have never had any contact whatsoever
with that paper. I have never talked to them'', the nephew, Rafael
Saavedra Pinochet, told radio Cooperativa of Santiago on Monday
about the report in the London daily The Mirror.
	   ``If they say I talked to them, let them produce a recording,''
he told the radio station in a telephone interview.
	   The radio did not say where Saavedra Pinochet was when the
interview was recorded.
	   ``How could I possible say something like that ... That report
is causing me family problems,'' Saavedra Pinochet added. ``You
see, that's how they work in London.''
	   He said he will demand a denial from the paper, ``within 48
hours.''
	   The London tabloid The Mirror quoted Pinochet' nephew as saying,
``he would rather kill himself or be killed by his guards than face
the humiliation and indignity of being sent to face trial in
Spain.''
	   Pinochet remains at a London psychiatric hospital under police
guard awaiting a final decision by British Interior Secretary Jack
Straw on the Spanish extradition request.
	   The Grovelands Priory hospital said Monday it wanted the
83-year-old former ruler to leave.

former Miss Universe and joined other groups supporting a
conservative businessman in a bid to prevent a former coup leader
from being elected Venezuela's next president.
	   The center-right COPEI party backed away Monday from Irene Saez
after concluding that her candidacy was only dividing the vote
against former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez and increasing his chances to
win Sunday's election.
	   Donald Ramirez, secretary general of COPEI, announced the party
would back businessman Henrique Salas Romer instead of Saez.
	   ``The democratic vote should unite itself to guarantee peace and
freedom, and that guarantee at this moment is represented by the
independent candidacy of Henrique Salas Romer,'' Ramirez said after
the party voted to back Salas.
	   Members of Venezuela's political establishment have been
scrambling for over a week to head off a presidential victory by
Chavez, who staged an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992.
	   Over the weekend, Salas, 62, a former governor of the central
state of Carabobo, also received the backing of Venezuela's other
traditional party, center-left Democratic Action.
	   Chavez's candidacy has polarized Venezuela between the poor who
view him as a hero and the wealthy establishment that believes he
will install a leftist dictatorship.
	   It was not clear if the support from COPEI and Democratic Action
would hurt or help Salas. Many Venezuelans blame the traditional
parties for squandering the country's vast oil wealth and for a
corrupt political culture that has contributed to sharply declining
living standards.
	   For her part, Saez has said she would respect COPEI's decision
but it was not immediately clear if she would quit the race.
	   In recent months, Saez has fallen from first place to fourth in
opinion polls, which show Chavez as the front-runner and Salas in
second place.
	   Until Friday, Democratic Action's candidate had been Luis
Alfaro, a 77-year-old party stalwart.
	   He refused to accept the party's decision to dump him, so on
Monday, Democratic Action's leadership voted to expel him from the
party.

Johnson agrees to dlrs 52.4 million contract with Diamondbacks

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Randy Johnson, the most accomplished pitcher
among this year's free agents, agreed today to a dlrs 52.4 million,
four-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.
	   The second-year expansion team won the intense fight for the big
left-hander for two main reasons: Johnson lives in nearby Paradise
Valley and he believes the Diamondbacks are making moves to become
a contender in a hurry.
	   Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo said Johnson would be
introduced at a news conference Wednesday.
	   ``I think there was always an interest in his part and a tug in
his heart relative to playing at home,'' Colangelo said. ``The big
question was how soon could we become competitive as compared to
all of these teams because of his fierce competitiveness and desire
to win.''
	   Arizona was Johnson's choice ahead of the Anaheim Angels, Los
Angeles Dodgers and Texas Rangers.
	   Colangelo said Johnson had bigger offers but chose to stay close
to home.
	   ``For us, it's obvious there are family issues, and he's pleased
to spend his life in the Valley for hopefully the rest of his
baseball life,'' Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, told radio station
KMVP in Phoenix. ``But also from the top, we have a commitment that
the Diamondbacks are going to do what it takes to get to the World
Series and we believe that.''
	   The average annual value of his new contract is dlrs 13.1
million, the second-highest in baseball behind the dlrs 13.33
million Mo Vaughn will get under the dlrs 80 million, six-year
contract he agreed to Wednesday with Anaheim.
	   Johnson's contract also contains a club option for a fifth year
with a buyout provision.
	   Johnson, 35, was 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA and 116 strikeouts in 84
1-3 innings this year for the Houston Astros, who acquired him from
Seattle on July 31. Unhappy with the Mariners after they refused to
give him a contract extension after the 1997 season, Johnson had
asked for a trade.
	   When Seattle refused, he was grumpy all through spring training
and the first half of the season, going 9-10 with a 4.33 ERA before
Seattle dealt him just minutes before the trade deadline.
	   Houston had hoped to re-sign him but dropped out of the bidding
Tuesday after becoming convinced it would take a four-year contract
to keep Johnson.
	   In all, he struck out 329 this season, leading the major
leagues.
	   Johnson has a 143-79 career record, striking out 2,329 in 1,978
1-3 innings.
	   He joins an Arizona team that hopes to improve drastically from
1998, when the Diamondbacks went 65-97 in their initial season,
finishing last in the NL West, 33 games behind the division-winning
San Diego Padres.
	   Since the end of the season, Arizona has signed Todd Stottlemyre
to a dlrs 32 million, four-year contract and Armando Reynoso to a
dlrs 5.5 million, two-year deal. The Diamondbacks have six proven
starters _ Johnson, Andy Benes, Stottlemyre, Reynoso, Omar Daal and
Brian Anderson.
	   The Diamondbacks have said the depth would give them the ability
to make a trade, possibly involving either Anderson and Daal, the
two young pitchers with the highest value.
	   Arizona also signed reliever Greg Swindell to a dlrs 5.7
million, two-year contract and first baseman Greg Colbrunn to a
dlrs 1.8 million, two-year deal.
	   ``I felt confident from the first day I met with Randy and his
agents,'' Colangelo said. ``And I felt in my heart of hearts that
this was the right place for him. I believe that many of the moves
that we made since that first meeting 29 days ago made the
difference. All of those moves were significant in his eyes, in
terms of a commitment to win.''

Gymnast obtains protective order against father
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAULINE ARRILLAGA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ A month after winning legal independence from her
parents, gymnast Dominique Moceanu obtained a protective order
against her father Monday, accusing him of stalking her and
threatening to harm her friends.
	   ``I am terrified of my father,'' the 17-year-old Olympic gold
medalist states in a court affidavit. ``I believe that all of my
father's actions are intended to result in physical harm, bodily
injury or assault to me or my friends.''
	   In the affidavit, Miss Moceanu states that a Houston police
sergeant informed her several weeks ago that her father was being
investigated for attempting to hire someone to kill her coach and a
male friend, Brian Huggins.
	   An attorney for Dumitru Moceanu confirmed Houston police had
investigated her client but said he was not arrested and no charges
were filed. There was no answer at Moceanu's home and a message
left at his gym was not returned.
	   Houston police spokesman Robert Hurst said the homicide division
conducted an investigation into threats made against ``certain
parties'' involved in Miss Moceanu's earlier efforts to become a
legal adult.
	   However, Hurst would not disclose who was under investigation or
who was threatened, saying, ``The investigation was inconclusive
and no charges and no arrests were made. The case has been
closed.''
	   The protective order bars Dumitru Moceanu from communicating
with his daughter except through her attorney, Ellen Yarrell. A
violation could lead to his arrest.
	   A hearing has been set for Dec. 9 to determine whether the order
will be made permanent.
	   Frustrated over unanswered questions about her earnings and
upset after her father threatened to have her Romanian coach
deported, Miss Moceanu ran away from home last month and sued her
parents to be certified as an adult. She also obtained a
restraining order against her mother and father, whom she accused
of squandering her earnings on risky investments and a $4 million
gym bearing her name.
	   Her parents initially opposed the lawsuit and insisted their
daughter's coach, Luminita Miscenco, and the 32-year-old Huggins
had improperly influenced her. But on Oct. 28, after her parents
agreed to drop their resistance to her lawsuit, Miss Moceanu was
declared a legal adult and a judge lifted the restraining order
against her parents.
	   At the hearing, Dumitru Moceanu broke into tears and had to be
asked three times if he agreed with the settlement before finally
muttering, ``Yes.'' But Miss Moceanu and her attorney contend
Dumitru Moceanu has done anything but allow his daughter to live
the life of an adult.
	   In her affidavit, Miss Moceanu said her father had hired a
private investigator to ``follow me everywhere.''
	   ``He (the investigator) has pictures of my friends and me at
numerous locations. He has documented my every move for my father
down to where I shop and what I wear each day,'' she said.
	   Miss Moceanu also alleged that her father, on more than one
occasion, waited outside her school and attempted to follow her.
	   ``So far, I have been able to evade him, but each attempt makes
me more and more fearful for my safety,'' she said.
	   Yarrell accused Dumitru Moceanu of tapping his daughter's phone
and fax machine, and ``essentially stalking her.''
	   ``She's very scared. He's kind of gone off the deep end,''
Yarrell said, adding that Miss Moceanu had gone into hiding.
	   Scardino admitted Dumitru Moceanu had followed his daughter at
times in the past but said his actions were out of concern for her.
	   ``She is still a 17-year-old daughter, whether she is legally an
adult or not. They see that and, no, they don't like that,'' she
said. ``It's hard for a parent to just let go. He's looking at a
little girl.''
	   However, Scardino added, ``If she thinks these are parents who
would actually harm her, she's got a problem.''

Cohen pledges more aid to fight drug traffickers, guerrillas

<TEXT>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
pledged greater U.S. efforts to help strengthen Colombia's
beleaguered armed forces.
	   In Cartagena for a three-day conference of the region's defense
ministers, Cohen said Monday that Washington would provide more
training and intelligence aid. The two countries planned to sign an
accord Tuesday establishing a group to work out the details.
	   ``Essentially we are trying to help the Colombian military
restructure itself in a way that can deal with the forces of
narco-traffic and narco-terrorism,'' Cohen told reporters after a
meeting with President Andres Pastrana.
	   Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official traveling with Cohen said two
or three sites were being considered for the relocation of the U.S.
military's anti-narcotics operations from Howard Air Base in
Panama. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would
not identify the possible sites but said they were in Central and
South America.
	   Washington must remove all its soldiers from Panama by Dec. 31,
1999, when it will turn over control of the Panama Canal to the
Panamanian government.
	   The United States already provides more than dlrs 100 million a
year to fight drug trafficking in Colombia, which supplies 80
percent of the cocaine and much of the heroin sold in the United
States. Most of the aid goes to the police, due partly to concerns
about the army's record of human rights abuses.
	   Leftist guerrillas, who fund their decades-old insurgency by
taxing cocaine production and protecting drug laboratories and
airstrips in areas they control, have been gaining strength against
a poorly trained and badly equipped military, raising U.S. concerns
about Colombia's stability.
	   Colombia's Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said last week that
his country was discussing American support for a planned 1,000-man
anti-narcotics battalion, to be composed of police and soldiers.
	   Pastrana said the U.S. aid symbolizes improved relations with
the United States, which revoked the visa of his predecessor,
Ernesto Samper, over charges that he solicited campaign
contributions from the Cali drug cartel.
	   ``We are receiving a totally different treatment than what
existed during the last four years,'' Pastrana said.
	   The conference, which ends Wednesday, is the third meeting of
defense ministers from the United States, Canada, Latin America and
the Caribbean, excluding Cuba, since 1995. The two previous
meetings focused largely on traditional military issues.

Japanese banks rush to restructure amid rising tide of red ink
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANAKOGANEI, Japan (AP) _ The nets are still strung across the
tennis courts and the grass is neatly trimmed on the soccer fields.
	   But the outdoor loudspeakers at this suburban Tokyo sports
facility built by the Long Term Bank of Japan Ltd. fell silent
months ago. The clock on the clubhouse, closed since March, is
frozen at 2:50 p.m.
	   For more than two decades, elite bank employees and their
families gathered here to hobnob. Then the LTCB, a pillar of the
Japanese financial establishment, collapsed.
	   Now in the process of nationalization, the bank is restructuring
and selling off everything it can to raise cash _ including its
avant-garde headquarters building in central Tokyo and numerous
recreational facilities.
	   After a long period of denial, Japan's banks are now coming to
terms with a mountain of uncollectable loans that has pushed many
to the brink of insolvency, hamstrung the economy and eroded
Japan's standing in the international community.
	   The moves they are taking are alarming:
	   _Over the next three years, Japan's nine largest banks plan to
slash about 18,600 jobs, or 15 percent of their total workforce,
and close around one-fifth of their domestic branch offices.
	   _By late November, 16 of the country's top banks _ including
most of the top nine _ had applied for as much as 5.78 trillion yen
(dlrs 47.2 billion) from a pool of public funds to bolster depleted
capital reserves. The money was earmarked as part of recently
passed legislation authorizing a total of 60 trillion yen (dlrs 490
billion) to stabilize the banking system.
	   _Sanwa Bank Ltd. announced plans to raise cash by selling off
its U.S. credit unit to Boston-based Fleet Financial Group Inc.
Daiwa Bank Ltd. and other second-tier lenders have announced plans
to withdraw from overseas altogether.
	   _Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., the country's largest bank, says
it will sell its prominent headquarters building in downtown Tokyo
and auction off a block of shares in its San Francisco-based unit,
UnionBank Cal Corp.
	   The slash and burn is all the more dramatic for the fact that
Japan's banks have long prided themselves on their global reach and
status as world class lenders.
	   But so bad is the situation with the banks that some analysts
criticize the industry's restructuring as half-baked and say the
government bailout simply puts terminally ill institutions on a
futile, and publicly financed, life support system.
	   ``The problem is that they are not changing the basic flaws,''
said Alicia Ogawa, a financial analyst in the Tokyo office of
Salomon Smith Barney.
	   ``I see really nothing changed,'' she said, ``except maybe that
the Japanese taxpayer is 60 trillion yen (dlrs 490 billion)
poorer.''
	   The cutbacks fail to address a key problem: too many banks
chasing after too few yen.
	   The solution, some experts say, is to let weak banks go bust and
encourage others to specialize in niche areas instead of offering
an unprofitable smorgasbord of services as they do now.
	   But Japan has been wary of prescribing such a harsh treatment,
fearing a renewed loss of confidence in its financial system and
mass layoffs.
	   The recent move to restructure comes only after a long period of
intransigence. Japanese bankers had hoped to wait out the recession
at home until land prices recovered. Many of the soured loans were
mortgaged by real estate before a collapse in property values
earlier this decade.
	   A steady deterioration in the Japanese economy forced the
industry's hand, however, leading most banks to turn to the lender
of last resort: the taxpayer.
	   Bankers are wary of making the government their largest
shareholder, but Tokyo has urged them to dip even deeper into the
public money set aside to ease a spreading credit crunch as banks
tighten lending to limit risk.
	   Accepting the money requires banks to streamline their
businesses by closing branches and selling off recreational
facilities in some cases.
	   It also opens the door to possible interference in day-to-day
managerial operations by politicians.
	   The government's top spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu
Nonaka, already has threatened punishment for banks that curtail
loans to small- and medium-sized firms, which could make it hard to
cut off credit to deadbeats.
	   Government involvement has raised concern among bankers, said
Walter Altherr, a banking industry analyst in the Tokyo office of
Jardine Fleming Securities Co.
	   But, he added, ``There's no such thing as a free lunch.''

Dollar lower in early trading, stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Tuesday
following an overnight weakness on Wall Street. Japanese stock
prices were mixed.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 122.76 yen in early trading, down 1.06
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 123.26 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 1.35 points,
or 0.009 percent, to 14,885.05 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Monday, the Nikkei closed down 185.69 points, or 1.23
percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 2.92 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,140.50 points.
The TOPIX closed down 14.85 points, or 1.28 percent, the day
before.
	   In currency dealings, the overnight fall in U.S. share prices
helped push the dollar lower. The Dow Jones industrial average
closed at 9,116.55 on Monday, down 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent.
	   Much of the Dow's plunge was based on profit-taking since the
stock market rebound started less than two months ago.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, market sentiments remained bearish
because of the fall on Wall Street as well as Japanese news reports
that Tokyo-based JDC Corp., a medium-sized general contractor, was
seeking court protection from creditors.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 1.090 percent early Tuesday, up from 1.040 percent on
Monday. Its price fell to 106.13 yen from 106.59 yen.

Chilean Defense Minister slams foreign interference in Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
case &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ Addressing a conference of military
leaders from across the Americas, Chile's defense minister slammed
efforts to force former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to stand
trial abroad for atrocities.
	   Without directly mentioning Pinochet or the countries seeking
his extradition, Defense Minister Jose Florencio objected Monday to
efforts to apply ``extra-territoriality'' in seeking to bring the
former Chilean ruler to justice, calling them ``a violation of
fundamental principles and norms of international coexistence.''
	   Pinochet, who came to power in a 1973 coup and presided over a
government responsible for widespread torture and disappearances of
leftist dissidents, was detained in London on Oct. 16 based on a
Spanish court's extradition request.
	   Britain's highest court of appeal backed the move last week,
ruling that the 83-year old Pinochet, who is shielded from
prosecution in Chile, could not claim immunity abroad as a former
head of state. The incident has strained traditionally friendly
relations between Chile and the two European nations.
	   Florencio, speaking at a meeting of hemisphere's defense
ministers, said the Pinochet case was agitating life in Chile, and
circulated a document urging delegates from 33 nations to reflect
on how their own countries could be affected.
	   Many of the Latin American nations present have recent histories
of military coups against elected regimes which were followed by
periods of violent repression.
	   In most, amnesty laws passed during the return to civilian rule
protect former military leaders from prosecution in their country's
courts for human rights violations during their reigns.

Industry pioneer struggles for survival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAN SEWELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ A computer industry pioneer is struggling to
avoid becoming one of its dinosaurs.
	   Hayes Corp., whose founder Dennis C. Hayes invented the
personal-computer modem 20 years ago, is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
for the second time in less than three years. Whether it will
survive may be decided within weeks.
	   ``We hope to be in position to have some definite information
over the next two weeks ... we expect many issues to be resolved,''
said Ron Howard, chairman and chief executive officer of the
company based in Norcross, Georgia.
	   Hayes management has been meeting with its creditors committee
in the aftermath of the Oct. 9 Chapter 11 filing in federal
bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware. Chapter 11 filings
provide temporary protection from creditors while the company
reorganizes and tries to negotiate lower debts and restructure its
operations.
	   However, the fact that Hayes is back in Chapter 11 increases the
odds against that.
	   ``That's bad news,'' said Jocelyn Evans, a Georgia State
University assistant professor of finance currently visiting Emory
University. She cited a working paper by professors at Binghamton
University and Virginia Commonwealth University that found that
more than half of companies studied that went into so-called
``Chapter 22'' ended up liquidated.
	   On Tuesday, Hayes idled two shifts of its manufacturing unit,
laying off 100 people. The company will halt a third shift in the
next few weeks, bringing total employment to fewer than 450 from a
peak of 1,200.
	   Howard, whose Maryland-based Access Beyond company merged with
Hayes last year, said the company is making a transition from ``the
old Hayes to the new Hayes.''
	   The company is focusing its future on digital technology and
other new technologies.
	   However, slow response to new, 56 kilobits-per-second modems and
the Asian economic crisis have hurt sales. The company, scheduled
to release third-quarter earnings this week, reported a net loss of
dlrs 17.6 million for the first six months of this year, after net
sales of dlrs 77.2 million, compared to dlrs 94.9 million for the
first half of 1997.
	   Dennis Hayes, who remains on the board of directors, was a
29-year-old engineer when he and a partner worked on his dining
room table to create the first home-use modems. His company began
in 1978, and soon, Hayes modems and ``Hayes-compatible'' became
part of the industry language.
	   However, after a decade of industry leadership, the company
began heading downhill along with Hayes' personal life. He went
through a costly divorce in 1988, and competitors cut deeply into
his company's market _ with U.S. Robotics taking over as industry
sales leader.
	   George Benston, a professor at Emory's Goizueta School of
Business, said boom-to-bust stories aren't unusual in the high-tech
industry, as start-up companies expand rapidly, then find the
products they are built upon overtaken.
	   ``It's a tough business,'' Benston said.
	   The company took shelter in Chapter 11 in 1994, and after Hayes
balked at takeover bids, emerged from bankruptcy reorganization in
1996.
	   Hayes remains as the largest individual shareholder, with about
38 percent of the shares, in a company that retains Hayes and
brands that include Accura, Optima, Century, Ultra, Smartcom and
Practice Peripherals.
	   And while whether those shares will have value in the future
remains in doubt, the company is offering a new product _ a
limited-edition, 56K 20th anniversary modem, signed by Dennis
Hayes.

Nearly 40 people injured in clashes between rival Korean monks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Nearly 40 people were injured, some
seriously, as rival Buddhist monks fought through the night Tuesday
for control of Chogye Temple in downtown Seoul.
	   Most of the injured were mainstream monks who tried to regain
control of the temple's administrative building, which has been
held by dissident monks for three weeks.
	   Police said one Buddhist layman was hospitalized with serious
head injuries suffered during the clashes, which began Monday
afternoon and continued until early Tuesday morning.
	   The temple, headquarters of South Korea's largest Buddhist
order, was turned into a battleground by hundreds of gray-robed
monks, throwing empty bottles and wielding clubs.
	   A small sanctuary hall was partially destroyed and a fire in the
temple's main sanctuary was quickly extinguished, police said. A
wooden door of the hall and part of its wall were burned, they
said.
	   With 8 million followers, Buddhism is the largest religion in
this nation of 44 million people. The Chogye order has often been
engulfed in leadership struggles.
	   The latest dispute was over an attempt by the order's head, Song
Wol-ju, to seek a third four-year term. Opponents seized his office
early this month, effectively blocking his re-election.
	   A rule stating that the order's chief monk cannot serve more
than two terms was enacted in 1994 in an attempt to prevent the
office from wielding too much power.
	   Song says the rule cannot be applied in his case, because his
first term in the early 1980s was interrupted by a dispute with the
then military government.
	   The head of the order controls an annual budget of 12 billion
won (dlrs 9.2 million), billions of won (millions of dollars) in
property and has the right to appoint 1,700 monks to various
duties.
	   The latest confrontation occurred as an estimated 2,000
mainstream monks from throughout the country attempted to regain
control of the temple and its administrative building.
	   About 800 rival monks holed up inside the building repelled the
attack by spraying fire extinguishers and water from hoses and
hurling rocks and furniture.
	   After the invading monks withdrew at dawn Tuesday, the temple
grounds were strewn with broken bottles, sticks, burned furniture
and garbage.
	   About 1,200 riot police stood by but did not intervene. Past
police interventions in religious disputes have embarrassed the
force.

AOL-Netscape deal could spawn new means of Internet access
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID E. KALISH &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If America Online chairman Steve Case delivers
on his promises, his company's merger with Netscape could lead to
brand new ways of navigating the Internet.
	   One of the most ambitious goals of America Online Inc.'s dlrs
4.2 billion takeover of Netscape Communications Corp. is to speed
creation of a slew of Net-surfing gadgets, including wireless
hand-held computers, smart phones with screens, even a flat panel
that sticks to your refrigerator door.
	   Similar promises for futuristic gizmos have been made before,
and so far few have become reality. But AOL is hoping that its
purchase of browser pioneer Netscape _ and an alliance with
computer maker Sun Microsystems Corp. _ may allow introduction of
the new products faster than competitors, especially the company
likely to become their biggest foe _ Microsoft.
	   AOL has given access to the Internet to millions of people, but
almost all through personal computers.
	   Now PC sales are slowing even though less than half of U.S.
homes own computers. That limits the ability of businesses like AOL
to sign up new subscribers and sell more advertising, which are its
biggest revenue sources.
	   Case's short-term goal is to dominate the main existing Internet
sites where people get information and buy goods and services. He
wants to do that, in part, by giving the 14 million subscribers of
AOL's proprietary online service easy links to Netscape's popular
Netcenter site, a portal to services and information geared toward
businesses. Together, Netscape's and AOL's sites reach a staggering
70 percent of all Americans who access the Internet, according to
NetRatings, a research firm.
	   But the deal's longer-term aspects are more tantalizing.
	   Today, Netscape's Navigator browser lets users of PCs view and
retrieve Internet information. Should Nov. 24's deal be completed,
AOL will work with Netscape's roughly 1,000 software programmers to
help tailor future versions of Internet software that work with all
sorts of electronics gear.
	   In addition, AOL wants to eventually customize what it transmits
to subscribers. Instead of receiving AOL's full range of news,
entertainment, chat rooms and other features, a subscriber could,
say, sign up only for personal investing advice and stock quotes.
	   The cost savings could be a big draw, said Tom Rhinelander, an
industry analyst with Forrester Research Inc., based in Boston.
Under one scenario, the service could cost, say, dlrs 25 a month,
including the equipment. That is not much more than today's typical
fee of dlrs 20-a-month for Internet access, minus the need to buy a
dlrs 700-dlrs 1,200 computer.
	   The possibilities may be limited only by the willingness of
consumer electronics makers to churn out futuristic products. AOL
hopes to prod companies like Sony and Philips to create all sorts
of equipment using AOL's content and Internet access, Netscape's
browser technology, and Sun Microsystems' flexible programming
language called Java.
	   ``We've put all the pieces of the puzzle together,'' said Barry
Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services.
	   Instead of sitting in front of a personal computer, a user could
punch the screen of a hand-held gadget en route to work. TV viewers
could click their way to news about a favorite sitcom star they're
presently watching.
	   Need a phone number? Punch some buttons on your screen phone.
Just touch a flat screen attached to your refrigerator door to
order some pizza.
	   Some simple devices could hit store shelves by the end of next
year, Rhinelander said.
	   What could possibly thwart this bold vision? Microsoft, of
course.
	   The software giant has developed its own operating system for
running the basic functions of consumer electronics equipment,
including TV sets.
	   Schuler said AOL is open to using Microsoft's operating system
if that's what consumer electronics makers want. But AOL's new
drive could set up the company for a future clash. Microsoft owns
Web TV, a fledgling service that enables people to access the
Internet using their TV sets.
	   Still, a big AOL strength is its experience creating Internet
programming, said Tim Bajarin, head of Creative Strategies Research
International, a San Jose, California-based consultancy.
	   America Online last year hired Brandon Tartikoff, onetime head
of NBC's entertainment division, to bolster its development of
online programs focusing on television, movies and other
diversions. While Tartikoff died just months later of Hodgkin's
Disease, Case hasn't given up those goals.
	   ``I believe what he truly wants AOL to become is a fifth (TV)
network,'' Bajarin said.

Bowe, awaiting sentencing, has assault charge set aside

<TEXT>
	   UPPER MARLBORO, Maryland (AP) _ Former heavyweight champion
Riddick Bowe, who is awaiting a probable jail sentence in North
Carolina for kidnapping his estranged wife and five children in
June, had an earlier assault charge involving his wife set aside.
	   Judge Hovey Johnson on Monday shelved the second-degree assault
charge from August 1997 on the conditions that Bowe have no violent
conduct with his wife and that he complete a 10-day psychiatric
evaluation and any accompanying treatments.
	   The state withheld the right to return the case to the active
docket any time within the next 12 months.
	   Other than a brief acknowledgment that he understood the
agreement, Bowe said nothing during his court appearance and
refused comment as he left the courtroom. His wife, Judy, who
watched the proceeding from the gallery, also declined comment, as
did Bowe's lawyer, Billy Martin.
	   In June, Bowe pleaded guilty to abducting his wife and children
from their home in Cornelius, N.C. He attempted to drive them to
his home in Fort Washington, Md., but Mrs. Bowe managed to phone
for help during a stop in Virginia.
	   Prosecutors said Bowe would serve 18 to 24 months in prison
under his plea agreement in the kidnapping case, but he has yet to
be sentenced. He was allowed to return to Maryland on the condition
he remain under house arrest with electronic monitoring.

Critics fear end of 'free and open' Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS ALLBRITTON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Cyberspace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The megamerger of America Online and Netscape is
prompting concerns from cyberspace watchdogs who say the values of
openness, generosity and diversity championed by early users of the
Internet are being overcome by corporate demands for higher market
share and profits.
	   The tension between the competing forces began some three years
ago when millions of new AOL users began flooding the Net, ending
the hegemony of the computer elite. But Tuesday's merger deal
signals a new stage in the growing corporate influence over the
Internet.
	   ``The battle between individual expression and freedom, and
corporation domination and greed on the Web just got a lot
uglier,'' said Jon Katz, media critic and columnist for the Freedom
Forum, an international organization that supports journalism and
free speech.
	   America Online Inc., which serves as the link to the Internet
for 14 million people, makes no apologies for its role in
commercializing the Internet, saying consumers want its expanding
level of services.
	   As for accusations that it acts as a censor, AOL notes that some
of its customers _ parents, for instance _ like some controls over
what their children can see.
	   ``People's frame of reference is our online service,'' said
Barry Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services. ``It's what
people associate with AOL.''
	   But he said the family-friendly standards imposed on that
service are not applied to its other brands, soon to include
Netscape.
	   The critics' virulence stems from the fact that the Internet has
moved so far beyond its roots.
	   The Net's founding fathers of scientists, researchers and
computer devotees created a digital culture of share and share
alike, free speech and alternative politics, said David Cassel,
editor of the AOLwatch newsletter and a harsh critic of the
company.
	   Netscape was part of that culture. In 1993, Marc Andreesen, a
programming hotshot at the University of Illinois at
Champagne-Urbana, invented Mosaic, the first graphical browser for
the Internet's World Wide Web. He gave it away online.
	   Programming code was freely shared on the Net. No longer did
someone have to own a broadcast station or a newspaper to reach a
mass audience. Creating a Web page was pretty simple and the new
medium promised a publishing revolution.
	   But that early freewheeling culture couldn't hold up as
companies increasingly saw the enormous information, commerce and
entertainment possibilities on the Net.
	   Netscape was pounded into financial losses by Microsoft Corp.,
which has been accused by the government of using its monopoly in
computer operating systems to achieve its own dominance over the
Internet.
	   AOL, started in 1985 as a proprietary online service with
custom-designed content, later became the easy on-ramp to the
Internet for millions of beginning users. This trend particularly
enraged computer veterans who had been using the Internet for
years.
	   Another familiar complaint against AOL is that is stifles free
speech. Cassel notes that AOL doesn't allow chat rooms to be
created with the word ``boy'' in its title, he said, presumably to
discourage the trade of child pornography. ``So Dallas Cowboys fans
are out of luck,'' said Cassel.
	   Barry Schuler, president AOL Interactive Services, said many of
AOLs users want a ``gated community'' with parental controls and a
family-friendly environment.
	   That isn't the case with its other products, Schuler said. AOL
has done little to control the content over its popular Internet
chat program, which more than 21 million people have downloaded.
	   ``There was a concern that we were going to 'AOLize' that
product, but here it is a few months later and it's completely
committed to delivering to its market,'' he said. ``And we're going
to do the same thing for Netscape.''
	   ``Look at Viacom,'' the cable TV network giant, he said. ``They
don't impose the standards of Nickelodeon on MTV.''
	   Schuler also promised that AOL was ``completely committed'' to
continue Netscape's policy of giving away both its popular Web
browser and the software code.
	   Katz says he isn't opposed to making profits on the Web. He
worries instead that corporate control will lead to homogeneity,
turning the Net into a bland wasteland much like commercial TV.
	   ``For the last few years we've had a stirring alternative, which
is the Internet,'' he said. ``But it's really time for individuals
on the Net, and people in general, to see this as an issue of
consuming urgency.''

Woman swept to sea by storm is safe but emotionally ravaged

<TEXT>
	   TRUJILLO, Honduras (AP) _ Laura Isabel Arriola de Guity survived
six days at sea on a makeshift raft after Hurricane Mitch swept her
from her village. She has been back on land for weeks but in many
ways she's still adrift _ ravaged emotionally after losing her
husband and three children.
	   Arriola's entire family died when the storm smashed into
northern Honduras on Oct. 28 so it's no wonder she's been plagued
by nightmares.
	   ``Sometimes I don't sleep well,'' the 36-year-old schoolteacher
said in a subdued tone of voice. ``I sleep only for a while and
it's difficult to fall asleep again.''
	   Three weeks after being released from a hospital, Arriola spoke
Sunday at a relative's house in the northern coastal city of
Trujillo, 20 miles from her former home. She has lived there since
leaving the hospital.
	   Her manner contrasted with the emotion and eloquence with which
she told her story in a hospital ward three weeks earlier.
	   Then, she described how the storm made the Aguan River and
Caribbean Sea merge into a single body of water, destroying the
house where she and her family had sought refuge. She told of
trying to hold on to her 4-year-old son as the current pushed her
into the sea, only to watch him be swept away.
	   She said she had spent six days adrift, floating on debris she
found in the sea, eating fruit and drinking milk from coconuts she
found bobbing in the water. On the sixth day she was rescued by a
British helicopter crew.
	   She spoke exuberantly then about how God had taken her in his
arms and saved her.
	   On Sunday, she appeared better physically: Her skin was no
longer dry and the sores on her feet had mostly healed.
	   But she also seemed tired and distant, giving brief answers to
questions about her recovery.
	   Of her daily life, she said she sometimes visits friends or
relatives and goes to church regularly. Arriola said she would
resume teaching only when her health had improved.
	   As for her immediate plans, Arriola said only that she would
like to see a doctor. She didn't specify why, but later mentioned
headaches, dizziness and difficulty walking. She also recognizes
she needs help for the emotional duress she suffered.
	   Arriola said she has received no medical attention or counseling
since leaving the hospital on Nov. 8. She would like to seek
treatment in the United States, where two of her brothers live.
	   But she and her brother Armando, who was visiting her from Los
Angeles, said the family doesn't have enough money to pay for
medical care either in Honduras or in the United States. Arriola
received calls and a little money from well-wishers after her story
received international media attention, but not enough for her
needs, they said.
	   ``She isn't well. She's depressed,'' Armando Arriola said. He
said he believed the United States was the best place for her to
receive the care she needs and that it would be good for her to get
away from Honduras to start rebuilding her life.
	   Both he and his sister said they hoped that publicizing her
story would result in offers of assistance. After Arriola's story
first appeared, The Associated Press received several inquiries
from people who wanted to help her, but communications have been
difficult with northern Honduras since the storm hit.
	   Laura Arriola said she wouldn't have a problem moving to a new
country and learning a new language.
	   ``For me, my great hope really is to get to the United States
and that a doctor takes care of me to improve my health,'' she
said.

SAfrican Cabinet minister seeks amnesty for black struggle

 &UR; Eds: Testimony expected to begin at 0730 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A Cabinet minister seeking
amnesty before a human rights panel could shed light on a painful
period of black-on-black violence that preceded elections in 1994.
	   Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe is applying for amnesty from
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for his role in organizing
and arming Self Defense Units that operated in KwaZulu-Natal
province after 1990, as South Africa was emerging from decades of
apartheid.
	   Radebe, the first Cabinet minister of the ruling African
National Congress to appear at a public amnesty hearing, was
originally scheduled to testify last week. The hearing was
postponed until Tuesday.
	   The Truth Commission, which is hearing testimony from victims of
apartheid-era political violence, in October released a report
assigning major blame for human rights violations to the National
Party, apartheid's architect.
	   But it also cited black anti-apartheid struggle groups for their
excesses.
	   The commission has the power to grant amnesty to those who
confess to specific crimes and can demonstrate a political motive _
a process expected to last well into next year as decisions are
made on over 7,000 amnesty applications.
	   The period before the first democratic elections, while
political groups were trying to negotiate an end to white minority
rule, saw a dramatic escalation in violence.
	   Much of it centered in KwaZulu-Natal, where over 5,000 people
died in clashes between Inkatha Freedom Party Zulu nationalists and
the Self Defense Units.
	   Radebe's amnesty hearing will be held in Durban, the major city
for the province located on the Indian Ocean.
	   A number of top ranking ANC government officials, including
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Justice Minister Dullah Omar,
applied for amnesty in a last-minute submission before the deadline
last year.
	   They were among 37 ANC officials who were granted blanket
amnesty by the committee last year.
	   The amnesty was withdrawn after a court challenge by the
National Party claiming the decision violated the requirement that
applicants name specific crimes.
	   The officials had claimed only broad political responsibility
for actions taken during the anti-apartheid struggle.
	   It is not clear when or if their amnesty applications will be
heard.
	   Radebe applied for amnesty separately from the 37 officials.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Attorney General Janet Reno postponed a
decision on whether an independent counsel should investigate a
former top White House aide who is accused of lying about aid for a
union that contributed to Democrats.
	   Reno obtained approval Monday from a special court for up to 60
more days to review the case of former White House deputy chief of
staff Harold Ickes.
	   The court found she had ``shown good cause for the requested
extension,'' but Reno's reasons were not made public. She asked the
court to seal the document explaining her need for more time,
according to people familiar with the case.
	   Department officials believed there were other steps they could
take during the extension that could resolve the question, one
official said, requesting anonymity. The official would not
describe the steps.
	   Reno met during the day with aides who were divided on how she
should handle the allegation that Ickes committed perjury before a
Senate committee about the administration's efforts on behalf of
the Teamsters Union in a 1995 strike against Diamond Walnut Co.
	   Ickes has denied any wrongdoing in the matter, which stems from
one question he was asked during the third day of a private
deposition he gave the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on
Sept. 22, 1997.
	   In 1995, Ickes met with Teamsters leaders about the Diamond
Walnut strike. An administration memo prepared for him noted that
the union had given dlrs 2.4 million for Democratic candidates in
1992 and suggested that the party should consider helping the
Teamsters on key issues, like the strike, if it wanted to continue
to receive that support.
	   Ickes was closely involved in managing President Clinton's 1996
re-election fund raising.
	   The Senate panel, which was investigating campaign finance
practices, asked: ``What did the administration do regarding the
Diamond Walnut strike?''
	   Ickes responded: ``Nothing that I know of.''
	   There were no follow-up questions on the subject.
	   According to a Teamsters memo obtained by the committee, Ickes
said he asked then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor if he
would urge Diamond Walnut to settle its dispute with the union.
	   Ickes has acknowledged asking Kantor to make a phone call.
Kantor subsequently called the company's chief. He has said the
call was not motivated by fund raising and that the administration
never acted to punish the company on behalf of the Teamsters.
Kantor said he merely asked the status of a possible settlement and
applied no pressure.
	   A company executive testified there was no explicit threat but
the call was viewed at Diamond Walnut as part of the Teamsters'
effort.
	   Ickes' lawyers have argued that the Senate's question was
ambiguous and that inquiries do not amount to executive action _
doing something _ to end the strike.
	   The Ickes case is the second of three independent counsel
decisions before Reno in recent days. Last week, she decided
against ordering an investigation of Vice President Al Gore, saying
there was ``clear and convincing'' evidence that Gore did not lie
to campaign finance investigators last year about how a Democratic
media fund was financed.
	   Reno must decide by Dec. 7 whether an outside prosecutor should
examine whether Clinton and his aides illegally funded political
issue advertisements in 1996.

Westwood upsets Australian golf officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Golf Union (AGU) says
England's Lee Westwood has added injury to insult after deciding
not to defend his Australian Open title, then sending back the
trophy damaged.
	   AGU officials say they learned indirectly that Westwood, who won
last year's Australian Open title in a playoff with Greg Norman at
Melbourne's Metropolitan club, would play in the Sun City Challenge
in South Africa this week. The Australian Open begins Thursday at
Royal Adelaide Golf Club.
	   The officials said Tuesday that the Stonehaven Cup was returned
to them by Westwood in two pieces. Although it is only a replica,
officials said they believe it was broken before it was packed for
shipment back to Australia.
	   The cup was broken at the base and had dents in the top when
officials opened its velvet-lined shipping box in Melbourne three
weeks ago. The 20,000 Australian dollar (12,800 US dlrs) trophy had
to be repaired by a Melbourne jeweler.
	   ``We're very disappointed and we've sent a fax asking for an
explanation to Westwood's manager (Chubby Chandler),'' AGU
executive director Colin Phillips told The Australian newspaper
Tuesday. ``We still haven't received a reply.'' (djp)

U.N. chief hopes sanctions not needed in Western Sahara conflict

<TEXT>
	   SMARA REFUGEE CAMP, Algeria (AP) _ U.N. chief Kofi Annan said he
hoped sanctions wouldn't be necessary should Morocco or the Western
Sahara Polisario rebels pull out of a peace process aimed at
resolving Africa's so-called last colonial conflict.
	   ``I hope we don't get to that point,'' Annan told some 50 mostly
European journalists as he paid a lightning visit Monday to the
Smara refugee camp in southern Algeria. ``We have powers of
persuasion but we can't apply force all over the world.''
	   The half-day visit came a week before a much-delayed U.N.
sponsored referendum was scheduled to have been held Dec. 7. At
stake is whether the Italy-sized Western Sahara territory should
remain in Morocco's hands or become an independent state.
	   The referendum, now slated for December, 1999, has been bogged
down over disagreements over who is eligible to vote. Since 1991,
some 150,000 people have been interviewed and an estimated 90,000
have been accepted. But Morocco insists a further 65,000 people
from three tribes should be added.
	   In Smara, Annan said he had got full agreement from Polisario
chief Mohammed Abdelaziz to new proposals on how to deal with the
issue of the 65,000 people but that Morocco wanted further
clarification.
	   Annan dismissed suggestions that the United Nations was treating
Morocco with kid gloves. The northwest African nation has been
accused of hindering the referendum project, allegedly because it
knows it may lose.
	   ``Peace cannot be imposed by force,'' Annan said. ``We are
trying to work with both parties to get the basis for a
settlement.''
	   Plans for a referendum began when the U.N. clinched a cease-fire
in 1991 between the some 15,000-strong Polisario rebels group
representing the Saharawis nomadic people and the Moroccan army
which took control of the mineral-rich territory as Spain withdrew
in 1976 after nearly 100 years of colonial rule.
	   The war forced some 150,000 thousand Saharawis to flee and seek
shelter in the Smara and three other camps set up in a bleak
wastelands of southwestern Algeria. Tens of thousands more _ a
precise number is not known _ still live under Moroccan rule in
Western Sahara.
	   On Monday, thousands of men, women and children left their tents
and mudshacks in the camps to line the sandy roadside and sing
welcome chants for Annan who flew down by helicopter from Algiers.
	   The Saharawis see Annan, and his appointment of James Baker III
as his special Western Sahara envoy, as their best chance of
bringing about an end to nearly a quarter of century in exile.
	   U.N. officials have been stationed in the region since 1991,
helping with the voter identification process, and Annan wants the
mission's wrapped up soon and successfully.
	   Earlier this month, he flew to Mauritanian and Morocco to
discuss developments. He was to meet more Algerian officials later
this week.

MONTREAL: victory again.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The victory was a personal triumph for Quebec's charismatic
premier, Lucien Bouchard. He plans to call another referendum on
independence whenever he feels conditions are right for a
separatist triumph.
	   Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest, who
tried to convince voters that the province would prosper only if
the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.
	   Charest, 40, became an early favorite when he quit federal
politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking
Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.
	   But despite his family roots in Quebec, he was widely perceived
by the province's French-speaking majority as more of an outsider
than Bouchard, and less likely to do battle for the province in any
confrontations with the federal government.
	   Bouchard, 59, has maintained high popularity ratings despite
overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a
drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among francophones, he has never
lost the mythic aura he gained when, after losing a leg and almost
dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994, he came back to lead the
separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.

MONTREAL: on secession.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Parti Quebecois went into this election holding 74 of the
legislature's seats, while the Liberals had 45 and needed a gain of
18 for a majority.
	   There were 5.2 million eligible voters, and turnout was expected
to be 80 or 90 percent even though this was the fourth
province-wide vote in the past five years.
	   In the final round of polls, support for the Parti Quebecois
hovered about 47 percent, while the Liberals received about 41
percent. Most other voters backed Democratic Action, led by
28-year-old Mario Dumont, who favors greater autonomy for Quebec
but stops short of advocating outright secession.
	   Still in question, as returns filtered in, was the margin of the
separatist victory. If they win decisively _ with perhaps 80 seats
and 50 percent of the popular vote _ there would be pressure from
Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum quickly. A
narrow separatist win would likely prompt a more cautious approach,
while a loss to Charest would sidetrack the separatist cause for
years.
	   The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before,
once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, anxious to avoid a third defeat, said he would call
another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would
win. In the meantime, he says he would seek more autonomy for all
10 provinces, particularly in regard to control over social
programs.
	   Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose
secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters
would support independence now, and about two-thirds do not want a
referendum on secession in the next few years.
	   To woo these voters, Bouchard tried to portray the election as
the choice of the most competent leadership, with the thorny
question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

Weapons inspectors note ``with satisfaction'' Iraqi cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler noted ``with satisfaction'' in a letter released Monday that
Iraq was ready to cooperate in resolving several outstanding
issues.
	   He said the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with
verifying the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
will deploy teams to help clear up questions about Iraq's chemical
weapons and missile programs.
	   In a letter to Butler released Friday, Iraq's Deputy Foreign
Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi asked that teams be sent to investigate
the fate of 155 millimeter shells filled with mustard gas, to
verify the disposal of R-400 aerial bombs equipped for chemical and
biological agents, and to look at pits where special warheads were
stored.
	   Butler noted in his reply to Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz that the Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, had asked Iraq
for permission to conduct those three missions at the beginning of
August. Nonetheless, he noted ``with satisfaction that the Iraqi
side is ready to cooperate with the Special Commission on several
specific issues.''
	   Iraq curtailed inspections on Aug. 5 and halted all cooperation
with UNSCOM on Oct. 31. Under threat of U.S. and British
airstrikes, Baghdad agreed to resume full cooperation with the
weapons inspectors on Nov. 14.
	   Butler said UNSCOM is ready to assist the Iraqis in
investigating the fate of the mustard gas shells and asked Aziz to
clarify what support his government needed from UNSCOM.
	   Al-Qaisi responded in a letter released Monday that Baghdad
needed survey and detection equipment, including ground penetrating
radar and chemical agent monitoring detectors. He said the
investigation should take seven to 10 days and expressed hope that
it ``will commence as soon as possible.''
	   Baghdad says it had about 13,500 artillery shells filled with
mustard gas prior to the 1991 Persian Gulf War. It says 12,792 were
destroyed under UNSCOM supervision in 1993-94, 132 shells were
destroyed during the war, and about 560 shells are missing.
	   Butler said experts will be sent to Iraq ``as soon as is
practically possible'' to verify the disposal of R-400 aerial
bombs.
	   ``We hope that this task will be completed in a very short
period,'' al-Qaisi said in his reply.
	   Butler said a missile monitoring group already in Baghdad will
look at pits at Fallujah Forest and a canal on the Tigris River
where special warheads were stored.
	   Al-Qaisi said Iraq was ready to start work with the UNSCOM team
immediately.
	   The Iraqi minister's latest response reflected Baghdad's
determination to comply quickly with inspectors' requests that it
deems legitimate in its quest for a declaration of Iraqi
disarmament, the key condition for lifting a debilitating economic
embargo.
	   But Iraq's letters last week also reflected continued defiance
on issues Baghdad feels it has already answered or are outside the
mandate of U.N. inspectors.
	   Butler must inform the Security Council whether Iraq has resumed
full cooperation with UNSCOM before the council can launch a
comprehensive review of Baghdad's compliance with council
resolutions. The Iraqi government is hoping the review will lead to
a quick lifting of sanctions _ but the United States insists there
is no link.
	   In his letter, Butler said the preparation and implementation of
the missions ``will take a certain amount of time.'' But he assured
Aziz that this would not hold up his report to the Security Council
on Iraq's cooperation.
	   ``I expect to be in a position to formulate a report in two or
three weeks time on whether or not Iraq has returned to full
cooperation,'' Butler said.
	   Al-Qaisi said in his reply that Butler had mentioned ``two or
three weeks'' on different dates _ and he asked which was the
starting date, noting that Iraq decided to resume cooperation with
UNSCOM on Nov. 14.

	   But in 1994, when the two parties virtually tied in popular
vote, the separatists won 77 of the legislature's 125 seats to 47
for the Liberals. Television networks and other analysts projected
that the separatists, whose support is far more evenly spread than
the Liberals, were headed for a solid victory again.
	   The victory was a personal triumph for Quebec's charismatic
premier, Lucien Bouchard. He plans to call another referendum on
independence whenever he feels conditions are right for a
separatist triumph.
	   Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest, who
tried to convince voters that the province would prosper only if
the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.
	   Charest, 40, became an early favorite when he quit federal
politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking
Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.
	   But despite his family roots in Quebec, he was widely perceived
by the province's French-speaking majority as more of an outsider
than Bouchard, and less likely to do battle for the province in any
confrontations with the federal government.
	   Bouchard, 59, has maintained high popularity ratings despite
overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a
drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among francophones, he has never
lost the mythic aura he gained when, after losing a leg and almost
dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994, he came back to lead the
separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.
	   The Parti Quebecois went into this election holding 74 of the
legislature's seats, while the Liberals had 45 and needed a gain of
18 for a majority.
	   There were 5.2 million eligible voters, and turnout was expected
to be 80 or 90 percent even though this was the fourth
province-wide vote in the past five years.
	   In the final round of polls, support for the Parti Quebecois
hovered about 47 percent, while the Liberals received about 41
percent. Most other voters backed Democratic Action, led by
28-year-old Mario Dumont, who favors greater autonomy for Quebec
but stops short of advocating outright secession.
	   Still in question, as returns filtered in, was the margin of the
separatist victory. If they win decisively _ with perhaps 80 seats
and 50 percent of the popular vote _ there would be pressure from
Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum quickly. A
narrow separatist win would likely prompt a more cautious approach,
while a loss to Charest would sidetrack the separatist cause for
years.
	   The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before,
once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, anxious to avoid a third defeat, said he would call
another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would
win. In the meantime, he says he would seek more autonomy for all
10 provinces, particularly in regard to control over social
programs.
	   Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose
secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters
would support independence now, and about two-thirds do not want a
referendum on secession in the next few years.
	   To woo these voters, Bouchard tried to portray the election as
the choice of the most competent leadership, with the thorny
question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

Angola sliding back toward war as peace accord frays

<TEXT>
	    &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angola appears headed back to the civil
war that has ravaged the southern African nation for most of its
nearly quarter-century of independence.
	   Bleak memories of two previous failed peace deals, in 1975 and
1991, in the former Portuguese colony are being revived by
increased clashes between government troops and the opposition
group UNITA.
	   Diplomats have been unable to get the two sides together to try
to patch up a 4-year peace accord. Since a deadly attack,
apparently by UNITA, on a Canadian-owned diamond mine this month,
the government seems convinced that only a military solution is
possible.
	   The conflict dates to the war against Portuguese colonial rule
that began in 1961 and ended with Angola's independence in 1975.
	   Civil war followed between rival nationalist groups that had
agreed to hold elections: Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA, and the Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, which took control of governmental
agencies.
	   The foes became Cold War proxies, with the United States and
South Africa backing UNITA and Cuba and the Soviet Union helping
the government.
	   With the end of the Cold War, the conflict became a fight fueled
by intense personal rivalries of the opposing leaders, entrenched
bitterness from years of war and greed.
	   For a time after the U.N.-mediated peace accord was signed in
1994, the outlook was relatively rosy.
	   The United Nations spent hundreds of millions of dollars
deploying more than 7,000 peacekeepers. The two sides began
demobilizing their armies and joined in a national unity government
18 months ago.
	   But relations have soured in the last six months.
	   UNITA has balked at surrendering control of its remaining
strongholds in the central highlands. It alleges
government-controlled police have abused UNITA supporters in areas
already handed over.
	   Savimbi sees himself as Angola's savior and begrudges the power
held by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
	   Dos Santos has presided over a corrupt hierarchy that has kept
the country's vast oil and diamond wealth in the hands of the
elite. His generals are pressuring him to crush Savimbi, and he
runs the risk of being toppled unless he goes along.
	   Alex Vines, who keeps track of Angolan events from the London
office of New York-based Human Rights Watch, calls it a ``war of
business interests.''
	   The rebels have targeted the diamond-rich northeast in recent
months, aiming to scare away foreign companies _ including
Brazilians, Russians, Israelis and Australians _ whose joint mining
ventures with local firms have enriched the government and its
supporters.
	   With world prices for oil, the country's main source of revenue,
falling, and its foreign debt ballooning, the diamond revenue is
crucial for the government.
	   Renewed fighting has chased an estimated 400,000 people from
their homes over the past four months. That brings the total
displaced people to 1 million, the government says, one-tenth of
the population.
	   The government has severed all ties with Savimbi, referring to
him as a common criminal who should be hunted down. It says it will
deal only with a breakaway group of UNITA dissidents.
	   The U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, is trying to keep the
peace, but events are spinning out of his control. U.N. sanctions
against UNITA for noncompliance with the peace accord, including a
travel ban and a freeze on its international bank accounts, have
had little effect.
	   The United Nations has pulled out of hotspots around the country
and only about 700 peacekeepers remain in Angola.
	   The government is stocking up on weapons, and unconfirmed
reports say the army is preparing to strike at UNITA's strongholds.
	   Meanwhile, 50 illegal flights a week are ferrying weapons to
remote dirt airstrips in UNITA-held areas, said a Portuguese
intelligence source, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Medium-size Japanese general contractor goes bankrupt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A medium-sized Japanese general contractor went
bankrupt Tuesday with debts totaling 406.7 billion yen (dlrs 3.33
billion) from failed golf course and other projects.
	   JDC Corp. filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court
Tuesday morning, company spokeswoman Yumiko Fukahori said.
	   It was the largest bankruptcy of a Japanese general contractor
since Tokai Kogyo Co. went bust in July last year after amassing
debts of 511 billion yen (dlrs 4.18 billion), according to Teikoku
Data Bank, a Tokyo think tank .
	   Trading in JDC shares, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
first section, was suspended Tuesday, following Japanese news
reports on the company's troubles, the exchange said.
	   JDC said its finances deteriorated when Japan's real-estate
business took a downturn in the early 1990s.
	   Delayed payments for its large-scale construction projects in
recent years also hurt the company.
	   JDC, founded in 1951 originally as a machinery leasing firm,
heavily invested in golf courses and other development projects
from the 1980s.
	   The company posted 294.2 billion yen (dlrs 2.41 billion) in
sales in the latest fiscal year ending in March, down 7.2 percent
from a year before. It employs 1,725 workers.
	   Many other Japanese construction companies that invested heavily
in property development suffered when the speculative land-price
bubble burst in the early 1990s.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency, said
Tuesday that more contractors may go bankrupt before the economy
can recover.
	   ``Under restructuring, companies will go in the red and people
will be let go. It is always darkest before the dawn,'' Sakaiya
told reporters.
	   Japan's prolonged recession has also hurt the industry by
reducing demand for housing and other construction projects.

Police detain dissidents in crackdown on illegal party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have detained five dissidents,
including veteran activist Xu Wenli, in an apparent crackdown on
efforts to set up an opposition party, a human rights group said
Tuesday.
	   Police took Xu away from his home in Beijing on Monday evening.
More than 20 police officers also searched his home and seized a
computer, a typewriter, a fax machine, an address book and more
than 1,000 pages of documents, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group said Xu's wife believed the detention
was related to the China Democracy Party, an opposition group
dissidents have been trying to set up since June.
	   Chinese authorities have refused to register the party, as
required by law, and have detained and questioned many of its
supporters, often for short periods.
	   While Xu was being detained in Beijing, police in southern China
also detained three other dissidents with links to the China
Democracy Party, the Information Center said.
	   Qin Yongmin, Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang were all taken away
on Monday evening, the group said.
	   Another party member, Lai Jinbiao, was detained Monday afternoon
in the eastern city of Hangzhou after he gave a public speech in a
park calling on the ruling Communist Party to carry out political
reforms, the Information Center said.

Shin Bet interrogator admits using physical pressure on prisoner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Confirming what human rights organizations and
Palestinian detainees have long contended, an Israeli security
interrogator has admitted in court testimony that he used physical
pressure to extract information from a Palestinian suspect.
	   Said Zoarub, accused of membership in Hamas and assisting in a
1995 suicide bombing, has since retracted the confession he gave to
the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, claiming it was
made under duress.
	   In a special Israeli military court hearing held Oct. 20 to
discuss the validity of the confession, the interrogator,
identified in court transcripts only as ``N,'' said he and others
tied, twisted and kept Zoarub hooded for several hours at a time.
	   On six separate occasions over three days in April 1997, Zoarub
was forced to stand, arms stretched above his head and handcuffed
to an anchor above him, for as long as three hours.
	   ``This method is intended to further the revelation of the
essential information which the subject does not wish to divulge,''
N said in his testimony. Transcripts of the hearing were made
available to The Associated Press on Monday.
	   During the interrogations, Zoarub confessed to involvement in
Hamas activities. His trial is still in progress and it was unclear
how the court would rule regarding the validity of the confession.
	   At other points during the 21 days Zoarub spent at an unnamed
Shin Bet facility, N said Zoarub was seated on a low chair slanted
forward, with his hands tied behind his back. N said interrogators
would tighten ``the handcuffs as far as possible around the
defendant's wrists.'' He also said that investigators put a hood
over Zoarub, forced him to crouch on the ground for hour-long
stretches and blasted loud music at him.
	   Zoarub's attorney Leah Tsemel said in court that interrogators
hung Zoarub from the ceiling, deprived him of sleep, put a
foul-smelling hood over his head that cut off his air supply, and
pulled on the handcuffs hard enough to cut off blood circulation. N
denied the charges.
	   The government does not deny that the Shin Bet, whose operations
are largely secret, uses force to extract information, but court
records of its methods are rarely open to public view.
	   Israel's Supreme Court has ruled the Shin Bet may use ``moderate
physical force,'' in questioning Palestinians believed to have
information vital to preventing a terrorist attack.
	   However, human rights groups claim that the vague wording allows
for torture and has appealed to the Supreme Court and to the
Israeli Parliament to end widely reported mistreatment of
Palestinian detainees.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The hospital where Gen. Augusto Pinochet has been
under police guard says he no longer needs medical care _ dealing a
blow to any plan by the former Chilean dictator to plead he is too
ill to stand trial on charges of genocide and torture.
	   Grovelands Priory, a private hospital in north London, issued a
statement Monday urging Pinochet's family to quickly find the
83-year-old general somewhere else to stay, saying he ``no longer
requires the specialist medical and nursing care.''
	   The hospital's decision to evict Pinochet may now make it
difficult for Home Secretary Jack Straw to cite ``compassionate
grounds'' based on ill and frail health if he decides Dec. 11 to
allow Pinochet to return home. Many legal experts said that was
Pinochet's best hope of being freed.
	   ``It is now the responsibility of Gen. Pinochet's advisers to
find alternative accommodation,'' Grovelands Priory hospital said.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in his hospital bed on a warrant
issued by a Spanish magistrate. The former dictator had undergone
surgery. On Oct. 29, he was moved to Grovelands Priory, some five
miles (eight kilometers) from central London.
	   There was no immediate word on where Pinochet might go. News
reports have said he is planning a move to a nine-bedroom home on
the private Wentworth estate in Surrey, southwest of London.
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza flew to Madrid on
Monday after four days of trying to persuade Britain not to
extradite Pinochet to Spain to face charges of murder, genocide and
torture by secret police during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Insulza maintained Pinochet may be tried in Chile if he is
allowed to go home.
	   In Madrid, the Chilean foreign minister said he didn't have
``any expectations'' from his two-day visit to Spain other than to
gain information.
	   However, Insulza told reporters: ``The political climate in
Spain is not favorable to Sen. Pinochet and that carries weight in
the judicial process even beyond the will of the judges to be
impartial.''
	   Neither endorsing nor condemning Spain's extradition request,
U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday the
international community should show ``significant respect'' to
Chile's efforts to deal with the legacy of Pinochet's regime.
	   The Clinton administration is divided between those who support
the extradition request and those who argue that it could threaten
Chile's fragile democracy. There is also concern it would set a
precedent that could make U.S. leaders targets of extradition
requests in foreign countries.
	   Speaking in Colombia, Chile's defense minister Monday criticized
efforts to force Pinochet to stand trial.
	   Without directly mentioning Pinochet or the countries seeking
his extradition, Defense Minister Jose Florencio objected to
efforts to apply ``extra-territoriality'' in seeking to bring the
former Chilean ruler to justice, calling them ``a violation of
fundamental principles and norms of international coexistence.''
	   A London newspaper, The Mirror, quoted Pinochet's wife, Lucia,
as saying he was ``very weak and depressed about his position.''
	   The paper also quoted his nephew, Rafael Saavedra Pinochet, as
saying that the general would rather kill himself than stand trial
in Spain.
	   But Saavedra later denied making the statement or ever talking
to the newspaper. In an interview Monday with radio Cooperativa of
Santiago, he demanded the paper retract the story.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of his secret police after Pinochet
overthrew a Marxist who had been elected.
	   Pinochet has immunity from prosecution in Chile. Critics say
that even if this were lifted he would appear before a military
court packed with his supporters.

Separatists win re-election easily in Quebec

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's pro-independence government was
re-elected easily Monday, an outcome that could move Canada closer
to another traumatic showdown over secession.
	   The victory was a personal triumph for Quebec's charismatic
premier, Lucien Bouchard. He plans to call another referendum on
independence whenever he feels conditions are right for a
separatist triumph.
	   With half of the 23,000 polling stations reporting, the
separatists had 45 percent of the popular vote, to 41 percent for
the Liberals and 12 percent for a third party, Democratic Action.
The separatists were on track to win about 78 of the legislature's
125 seats, and the Liberals about 46.
	   It was a slight improvement for the separatists over the last
election in 1994, when they won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals
while each receiving about 44 percent of the popular vote.
	   Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest, who
tried to convince voters that the province would prosper only if
the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.
	   Charest, 40, became an early favorite when he quit federal
politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking
Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.
	   But despite his family roots in Quebec, he was widely perceived
by the province's French-speaking majority as more of an outsider
than Bouchard, and less likely to do battle for the province in any
confrontations with the federal government.
	   Bouchard, 59, has maintained high popularity ratings despite
overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a
drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among Francophones, he has never
lost the mythic aura he gained when, after losing a leg and almost
dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994, he came back to lead the
separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.
	   Though Bouchard has served in the federal Cabinet and federal
Parliament, this was the first time he ever ran as a party leader
in Quebec. He was appointed premier without an election in 1996
after his predecessor, Jacques Parizeau, resigned following the
1995 referendum.
	   There were 5.2 million eligible voters Monday, and turnout was
more than 80 percent even though this was the fourth province-wide
vote in the past five years.
	   Analysts had suggested that a landslide separatist victory _
approaching 50 percent of the popular vote _ would lead to pressure
from Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum
quickly. Monday's results were considered more likely to prompt a
cautious approach from Bouchard, and perhaps a wait of a year or
two before considering a referendum.
	   The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before,
once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, anxious to avoid a third defeat, said he would call
another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would
win. In the meantime, he says he would seek more autonomy for all
10 provinces, particularly in regard to control over social
programs.
	   Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose
secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters
would support independence now, and about two-thirds do not want a
referendum on secession in the next few years.
	   To woo these voters, Bouchard tried to portray the election as
the choice of the most competent leadership, with the thorny
question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.
	   The Liberals' chances clearly were hurt by the relatively strong
showing of Democratic Action, whose leader, 28-year-old Mario
Dumont, retained his seat in the legislature. His party, which
appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for Quebec
but stops short of advocating outright secession.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Religious fanatics slaughtered three
adults and three children they believed were possessed by the devil
in a remote Amazon region in northwestern Brazil, according to a
survivor's account to police.
	   The ritual killings occurred Nov. 14 in an isolated rubber tree
plantation on the margins of the Tauari River, 1,860 miles (2,995
kilometers) northwest of Sao Paulo.
	   Police only confirmed the killings on Monday after listening to
an eyewitness account by a survivor, who swam and walked more than
60 miles (95 kilometers) to the nearest town in the northwestern
state of Acre.
	   Francisco Oliveira de Franca was badly beaten with wooden sticks
but managed to escape after pretending to be dead, said Silvano
Alves Rabelo, the deputy secretary of Acre's security bureau.
	   Preacher Francisco Bezerra de Morais claimed ``the victims had
to be purified because they had been possessed by the devil,''
Rabelo said.
	   The preacher and five others suspected in the killing were being
held and could face up to 30 years in prison, Rabelo said.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Mexico City priest was released after being
held captive, tortured and threatened for two days by kidnappers
who told him to stop his community work, the Archdiocese of Mexico
reported Monday.
	   Father Pedro Lascurain was kidnapped Friday afternoon in Mexico
City and released Sunday morning in southern Guerrero state, the
archdiocese said in a news release. No ransom was requested.
	   ``During his capture, the father was beaten and subjected to
psychological torture. He was locked in a cage and left without
food by his captors, who warned him to cease his pastoral and
social endeavors in the community,'' according to the archdiocese.
	   Lascurain had been working with young people in a downtown
Mexico City parish to get them to give up drugs, the newspaper El
Sol de Mexico reported.
	   Lascurain was kidnapped outside a downtown Mexico City church
office and threatened with death. He was allowed to make a phone
call to his superiors informing them of the kidnapping and the
threats, and was then drugged and lost consciousness.
	   When he was released Sunday, two women noticed his bad physical
condition and helped him return to Mexico City.
	   The archdiocese said it had filed a complaint with the Mexico
City attorney general's office. However, a spokeswoman for the
Mexico City attorney general said his office had no information on
the crime.

Strong earthquake kills at least six people in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Afraid that aftershocks might bring
down their damaged homes, about 7,000 people slept in tents or in
the open after a powerful earthquake struck two small, remote
islands in eastern Indonesia.
	   At least six people were killed and 153 people injured.
Volunteers and military personnel searched the sites of landslides
Monday in case people had been buried by Sunday's night
magnitude-6.5 quake.
	   Some houses slid into the sea. Local government officials said
more than 180 homes and buildings were damaged. Roads were cut and
bridges destroyed, hampering search and rescue efforts.
	   Local police Sgt. Hafid said three men and three women had been
confirmed dead on worst-hit Mangole Island. No deaths were reported
on neighboring Taliabu Island, despite widespread injuries and
damage.
	   Hundreds of people ran to the safety of a soccer field on
Mangole as two aftershocks followed.
	   Dozens of wooden houses slid into the sea and one of many
landslide destroyed Mangole's main docks.
	   Witnesses said large cracks scarred the streets of Mangole's
largest town, Dofa, and elsewhere on the island, which has a
population of about 38,000.
	   Officials feared the numbers of dead and injured could rise as
information came in from outlying villages.
	   Food and medicine were urgently needed, they said.
	   Neither island has a major hospital. A local government
official, Karim Wamona, said emergency flights were taking
seriously injured victims to neighboring islands for urgent
treatment.
	   He said the quake lasted only a few seconds.
	   ``But it was biggest anyone here had ever felt. This is the
worst damage this island has had from an earthquake,'' police Sgt.
Yopi Sariwating said by telephone from Mangole. Sariwating said.
	   Hafid said five people were killed when the roof of a plywood
factory collapsed.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted factory executives as
saying more workers might still be trapped in the wreckage.
	   A sixth victim died when the landslide buried the docks. At
least three loading vehicles had been swept into the sea.
	   The search for casualties was continuing on the island, 1,180
miles northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
	   Electricity supplies had been cut and telecommunications with
both islands were patchy.
	   Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said the quake
had a magnitude of 6.5.
	   It struck at 10:10 p.m. local time Sunday and was centered
beneath the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles south of the city of Manado
on the island of Sulawesi, the agency said.
	   Mangole and Taliabu are part of the Maluku archipelago, known in
colonial times as the Spice Islands.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of
North America across to Japan, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific
and New Zealand.

Finance minister supports tax cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister said Tuesday that he backs
tax cuts, such as those that promote housing, to help turn around
the ailing economy.
	   ``I know that our tax revenues are falling, but I think that if
policy tax cuts are meaningful, they should be implemented,''
Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters.
	   The government has already promised more than 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 49 billion) in tax cuts.
	   But it has rejected a proposal by some opposition legislators to
lower the sales tax. Raising the sales tax from 3 percent to 5
percent in April last year has been blamed for curtailed consumer
spending.
	   When asked about the recent remarks by some ministers that the
economy may be bottoming out, Miyazawa said it was too early to
tell.
	   ``I'm aware that some are saying that the Japanese economy is
bottoming out. But I don't have any hard evidence to show,'' he
said.

Dollar lower at midday, stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen at midday
Tuesday following an overnight decline on Wall Street. Japanese
stocks were mixed.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 122.86 yen at midday, down 0.96 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
123.26 yen overnight.
	   The dollar's weakness was largely because of the overnight fall
in U.S. stocks, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average
closed at 9,116.55 on Monday, down 216.53 points, or 2.3 percent.
	   The dollar regained some of its earlier losses on buying by
Japanese institutional investors.
	   Demand for the dollar grew because of changes in regulations
effective Tuesday allowing Japanese banks and life insurers to sell
mutual funds as part of Japan's deregulation measures, said Hajime
Sato, assistant general manager of treasury department at Daiwa
International Trust Bank.
	   Previously, only brokers were allowed to sell such assets.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, market sentiments remained bearish
because of the fall on Wall Street as well as Japanese news reports
that Tokyo-based JDC Corp., a medium-sized general contractor, was
seeking court protection from creditors.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.74
points, negligible in percentage terms, to end morning trading at
14,882.96. On Monday, the Nikkei closed down 185.69 points, or 1.23
percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 0.55 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,144.05 points.
The TOPIX closed down 14.85 points, or 1.28 percent, the day
before.
	   The Nikkei initially lost more than 100 points before
short-covering in the futures market helped erase most of the
losses.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 1.090 percent early Tuesday, up from 1.040 percent on
Monday. Its price fell to 106.13 yen from 106.59 yen.

Swiss prosecutor in Salinas case arrives in Mexico City

Swiss investigation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Swiss attorney general who headed an
investigation into alleged money laundering by the brother of a
former Mexican president flew to Mexico City on Monday to meet with
Mexico's attorney general.
	   Carla Del Ponte is to meet with Attorney General Jorge Madrazo
and is expected to share evidence obtained by Swiss authorities in
a nearly three-year probe of Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of
former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the attorney general's
office said in a statement.
	   The attorney general's office had earlier said through a
spokeswoman that it had no knowledge of del Ponte's visit.
	   Swiss prosecutors last month ordered the seizure of dlrs 114
million in Raul Salinas' offshore accounts, saying they are
protection payments made by Mexican and Colombian drug
organizations.
	   Mexico has also requested a share of any money the Swiss
confiscate from those accounts.
	   Valentin Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's anti-drug
police, said investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and
Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas
at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments
through Mexico.
	   Salinas has denied any ties to drug smugglers, saying the
millions of dollars in his Swiss accounts were an investment fund
pooled by several wealthy friends.
	   Carlos Salinas, who left Mexico in disgrace a few months after
the end of his 1988-94 presidency, has denied any knowledge of his
brother's financial activities. He has not been charged with any
crime.

Ex-detective sentenced to two years in prison in bribery
</HEADLINE>
conviction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former police detective was sentenced to two
years in prison Tuesday for receiving bribes from a major Japanese
brokerage in return for tipoffs.
	   The Tokyo District Court also ordered Takayoshi Hontao, 45, the
former detective, to pay 4.42 million yen (dlrs 36,000) in fines,
about the same amount he was convicted of accepting from Daiwa
Securities Co., a court spokesman said.
	   Hontao was arrested in January on charges of accepting cash,
travel coupons and expensive dinners from Daiwa over nearly four
years starting in April 1993, in exchange for leaking information
about a scandal investigation into the brokerage.
	   Ritsuro Uemura, presiding judge of the Tokyo District Court,
said Hontao's responsibility was ``grave'' in betraying the
people's trust in police, Kyodo News said.
	   Prosecutors say Hontao, who was in charge of investigating fraud
and embezzlement allegations against Daiwa, told Daiwa about
upcoming arrests and raids.
	   Hontao was dismissed by the Tokyo police department after his
arrest. Twenty other senior police officials were punished, with
pay cuts and reprimands, for failing to properly supervise Hontao.
	   Three days after his arrest, Hontao attempted suicide by cutting
his left wrist with a small knife inside the men's room of the
police department where he was being questioned.
	   Daiwa is among several Japanese financial institutions embroiled
in a bribery scandal centered around lavish entertainment for
Finance Ministry officials.

German, French leaders to wrap up summit

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wants to
press ahead with talks on an aerospace industry merger with
Britain, even if France, Germany's closest partner in Europe,
doesn't join in from the start.
	   Schroeder made the point Monday in talks with French President
Jacques Chirac, stressing the door would be left open to later
French participation, German sources said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Efforts for a European aerospace merger to compete with U.S.
giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin are a central theme of the
summit. The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced
talks on a two-way alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's
early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly
government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been
slow.
	   Defense ministers were discussing the topic further before the
end of the two-day French-German summit Tuesday.
	   Schroeder called Monday for ``a new beginning'' in German-French
relations, Europe's most important partnership and traditionally
the engine behind the drive for postwar European unity.
	   The summit, the first since Schroeder and the center-left Social
Democrats took power after winning September elections, was
designed to revive momentum after a lull during the last years of
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's reign, according to aides.
	   ``We have set out to bring a new dynamic to the German-French
relationship, and we will do that,'' Schroeder told Chirac at a
banquet.
	   Schroeder and Chirac addressed each other by their first names,
exchanging warm remarks as Schroeder presented Chirac with two
Japanese plates as a birthday present. Chirac turned 66 on Sunday.
	   Schroeder said relations should be strengthened not only among
politicians but among citizens. Both sides announced plans Monday
for a joint German-French university.
	   Separately, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer asked his French
counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, for support for a German-Italian
initiative to try Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan before an
international court, said ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann.
	   Italy arrested Ocalan two weeks ago on a German warrant, but
Schroeder has ruled out bringing him here to trial for fear of
violence within Germany's large Kurdish population.
	   Germany and France hold summits twice yearly, but this meeting
has special significance ahead of Jan. 1, when Europe launches its
single currency, the euro, and Germany takes over the rotating
six-month presidency of the European Union.

Guatemala hands down first sentences for civil war crimes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALFONSO ANZUETO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ In the first war-crimes convictions
following Guatemala's civil war, three former pro-government
fighters were sentenced to death for their role in a 1982 massacre
of Indian villagers.
	   A court in the central province of Baja Verapaz on Monday found
the three men guilty of executing three of the 130 civilians who
died March 13, 1982, in what has come to be known as the Massacre
of Rio Negro.
	   An estimated 150,000 people died in Guatemala's 36-year civil
war and thousands more were tortured or kidnapped. Peace accords
signed two years ago put a formal end to the civil war. A report
released earlier this year by a Catholic Church human rights office
blamed the army for nearly 80 percent of the killings.
	   The men were members of civilian defense patrols. The patrols
were organized by the army and collaborated closely with soldiers
in counter-insurgency campaigns against those suspected of
supporting leftist rebels fighting a guerrilla war against the
government.
	   Interviewed before the verdict was handed down, human rights
activists applauded the trial of the three men.
	   ``We are not seeking vengeance, but rather that this massacre
not go unpunished ... that is why we trust justice will be done,''
said Aura Elena Farfan, a representative of the Guatemalan
Association of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared.
	   The court, which revealed the conviction and sentence in the
same ruling, said that the three men _ Carlos Chen Gomez, Pedro
Gonzalez Gomez and Fermin Lajuj Xitumal _ acted with other patrol
members, but not with soldiers, in the Rio Negro Massacre, where
the victims included women and children.
	   Their sentences will automatically be appealed. Executions are
carried out by lethal injection in Guatemala.
	   Testimony against them included eyewitness accounts of the
killings of the Mayan Indian villagers by survivors who had
campaigned for years to bring the killers to justice.
	   The verdict, handed down by Judge Otto Mayen Morales in the city
of Salama, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Guatemala City, comes
after the prosecutor in another war-crimes case resigned after
receiving death threats.
	   The trial of 27 Guatemalan soldiers accused in the 1995 Xaman
massacre reopened Nov. 25, seven months after it went into recess
because the public prosecutor resigned due to death threats.
	   A new prosecutor, Alejandro Nunez Pivarel, said he would call 25
witnesses, including survivors of the attack in the village of
Xaman. Eleven people _ among them an 8-year-old boy _ died when a
military patrol opened fire on resettled refugees; 27 others were
wounded.
	   Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu said the Xaman trial
is the first in Guatemala to take members of the armed forces to
court for any of the 424 massacres attributed to them during the
civil war.

summit. The big European aircraft makers _ Daimler-Benz Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale _ agreed in principle in March
to seek a merger.
	   Daimler-Benz Aerospace and British Aerospace are in advanced
talks on a two-way alliance. One stumbling block to Aerospatiale's
early participation is that the aircraft maker is still partly
government-owned and progress toward full privatization has been
slow.
	   Defense ministers were discussing the topic further before the
end of the two-day French-German summit Tuesday.
	   Schroeder called Monday for ``a new beginning'' in German-French
relations, Europe's most important partnership and traditionally
the engine behind the drive for postwar European unity.
	   The summit, the first since Schroeder and the center-left Social
Democrats took power after winning September elections, was
designed to revive momentum after a lull during the last years of
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's reign, according to aides.
	   ``We have set out to bring a new dynamic to the German-French
relationship, and we will do that,'' Schroeder told Chirac at a
banquet.
	   Schroeder and Chirac addressed each other by their first names,
exchanging warm remarks as Schroeder presented Chirac with two
Japanese plates as a birthday present. Chirac turned 66 on Sunday.
	   Schroeder said relations should be strengthened not only among
politicians but among citizens. Both sides announced plans Monday
for a joint German-French university.
	   Separately, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer asked his French
counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, for support for a German-Italian
initiative to try Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan before an
international court, said ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann.
	   Italy arrested Ocalan two weeks ago on a German warrant, but
Schroeder has ruled out bringing him here to trial for fear of
violence within Germany's large Kurdish population.
	   Germany and France hold summits twice yearly, but this meeting
has special significance ahead of Jan. 1, when Europe launches its
single currency, the euro, and Germany takes over the rotating
six-month presidency of the European Union.

ASEAN chairman rules out Cambodia admission before upcoming summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The chairman of a Southeast Asian regional
group has effectively ruled out Cambodia's entry before an upcoming
summit, but said he will consult with foreign ministers on the
issue over the next few days.
	   S. Jayakumar, standing committee chairman of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, also stressed that the mid-December summit
in Hanoi, Vietnam, is unlikely to focus on the Cambodia question.
	   ``I have no plans to convene any special meeting or emergency
meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers,'' Jayakumar said in a statement
late Monday.
	   ``On this question of Cambodia's admission ... I will be
consulting with ASEAN foreign ministers in the course of the next
few days.''
	   After months of political stalemate, Cambodia formed a new
coalition government on Monday. ASEAN has refused to admit Cambodia
until it formed a working government.
	   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said Monday that gaining entry
to ASEAN and reclaiming Cambodia's seat at the United Nations would
be among his top priorities.
	   But Jayakumar said it was impractical for ASEAN foreign
ministers to discuss the issue before the Dec. 15-16 summit because
several are expected to be traveling until then.
	   He added that the Hanoi summit will concentrate on the economic
slowdown afflicting the region, not on Cambodia.
	   ``The priority for the Hanoi meeting is for ASEAN to send a
clear signal to the world that it will act in unison and show its
resolve to overcome the financial and economic crisis,'' he said.

Chinese police detain dissidents in crackdown on illegal party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead and UPDATES throughout with COMMENTS from
dissident's wife confirming arrest, details; no pickup
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police have detained prominent dissident
Xu Wenli and four others, in a crackdown Xu's wife said Tuesday
appeared aimed at crushing a budding opposition party.
	   About 20 police officers went to Xu's home Monday evening, took
him away and ransacked his apartment, seizing a computer, a fax
machine, address books, video tapes, a typewriter, more than 1,000
pages of documents and even a telephone, said his wife, He Xitong.
	   She feared that authorities were planning to charge and convict
Xu to end his campaign for an opposition party.
	   Unlike previous occasions when Xu was held only for short
periods of time, police produced an arrest warrant and a search
warrant that identified him as a criminal suspect, He said.
	   ``Xu Wenli has already paid heavily for democracy. I understand
that he is ready to pay again,'' said his wife. ``Xu Wenli won't
give up.''
	   Xu, 56, is one of the most prominent, active democracy
campaigners left in China. He was jailed after the Democracy Wall
protest movement of the late 1970s and freed in 1993, having served
all but three years of a 15-year sentence, much of it in solitary
confinement.
	   As Xu was being detained, another prominent dissident, Qin
Yongmin and two other members of the would-be China Democracy Party
were taken away by police Monday from their homes in the central
city of Wuhan, a Hong Kong-based human rights group said.
	   A fifth member of the party, Lai Jinbiao, also was detained
Monday afternoon in eastern Hangzhou city after making a speech in
a public park demanding the ruling Communist Party carry out
political reforms, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Encouraged by China's recent signing of key U.N. human rights
treaties, dissidents in many parts of the country have since June
been trying to set up the China Democracy Party to challenge the
Communist Party's monopoly on power.
	   Authorities have rebuffed dissidents' requests to officially
register the party and detained many of its supporters, usually for
short periods. Despite police harassment, Xu, Qin and other
dissidents have continued their efforts, setting up local party
branches, taking party oaths and nominating people for party posts.
	   In their 3 1-2-hour search of Xu's apartment, the police paid
particular attention to documents related to the party and made a
careful record of each document they seized, his wife said. Police
were watching the homes of other party members in Beijing.
	   Given the possibility of arrest, Xu had already prepared a bag
containing clothes and washing gear that he took with him, his wife
said.

Report: Press tycoon told employees to lie to authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The general manager of an English-language
newspaper has testified that a well-known media tycoon asked her
employees to lie to anti-corruption officials, Hong Kong media
reports said Tuesday.
	   The testimony at a district court Monday was part of a
high-profile fraud case that has set off a public outcry in Hong
Kong that its judicial system favors the rich and well-connected.
	   Henrietta So, general manager of English-language Hong Kong
Standard and Sunday Standard, said she gave false statements to
officials at the request of publisher Sally Aw Sian, the South
China Morning Post reported.
	   Aw is owner of Sing Tao Group, which controls the two papers.
And her request was made to save her troubled media empire, the
report quoted So as saying.
	   So and two other executives have been charged with plotting to
deceive advertisers by inflating circulation figures. They say they
are innocent.
	   Aw, a friend of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and a
member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a
political advisory body of the Chinese government, was identified
in court documents as a conspirator but was not charged.
	   Justice officials have declined to give a full explanation on
why Aw was not prosecuted but have denied suggestions that she got
off the hook because of political reasons.
	   As the trial opened Monday, So told the court that the statement
she gave to anti-corruption officials in 1996 was mostly
``incorrect and untrue,'' the Post reported.
	   It quoted her as saying that she tried to protect her colleagues
and Sing Tao Group ``at the request of Sally Aw.''
	   ``We did not want the Sing Tao Group to have any trouble,'' So
was quoted as saying.

Report: Indonesia's military to guard toll roads against robbers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The military has promised to guard
toll roads in the capital, including one to Jakarta's airport,
following a spate of highway robberies, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   In recent weeks motorists have reported being stopped and robbed
by armed gangs. Some drivers and passengers have been assaulted.
	   Several airlines have complained that the road to the airport
has become unsafe and some taxi drivers have demanded extra money
to drive along it.
	   The Indonesian Observer quoted Jakarta military spokesman Lt.
Col. D.J. Nachrowi as saying troops would shoot robbers if
necessary.
	   Residents in Jakarta have complained about an increase in crime
in recent months as poverty, inflation and unemployment rates surge
during the worst economic crisis in Indonesia in a generation.
	   The rise in lawlessness comes amid a spate of student protests
and riots.

AIDS Day observed amid alarm in Third World countries

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ People across Asia handed out condoms and wore red
ribbons Tuesday as part of efforts on World AIDS Day to raise
awareness about the spread of the disease, especially in
underdeveloped countries.
	   In Japan, the Health Ministry organized rallies and charity
concerts in a square in central Tokyo to spread the word about AIDS
and express solidarity with those suffering from the disease.
	   ``It's extremely important to have an event every year to
repeatedly remind people that AIDS exists,'' said Dr. Yoshiki
Sakurai, an official of the Japanese Foundation for AIDS
Prevention.
	   Events in Tokyo will culminate with the lighting of a tree
decorated with home-made red-ribbons, the symbol of AIDS
solidarity, sent in from across Japan.
	   Discrimination against AIDS sufferers remains powerful in Japan,
and the country still lags behind many Western countries in AIDS
treatment facilities and education, Sakurai said.
	   The theme of the 11th World AIDS Day is ``Be a force for
change.''
	   In Hong Kong, bars, restaurants and nightclubs handed out beer
coasters warning people to practice safe sex as part of a
three-week AIDS awareness program organized by the support group,
AIDS Concern.
	   The colorful coasters feature pictures of a fluorescent condom
on one side, with a safe sex messages on the reverse.
	   One version of the coaster reads: ``Do it safely; use a condom
every time.''
	   Aids Concern also handed out 5,000 condoms at subway stations
Tuesday morning.
	   Experts have warned recently that although powerful new drugs
have sent AIDS deaths plunging in industrialized countries, the
disease continues to kill millions of people in the impoverished
nations of Africa and Asia.
	   According to a new U.N. report, about 33.4 million people around
the world are infected with HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan
Africa. Two million people will die of the disease south of the
Sahara this year, four times the total for the rest of the world.
	   Adult HIV infection rates in Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and
Zimbabwe are between 20 percent and 25 percent, the United Nations
says.
	   About 1.7 million people in Africa and 700,000 people in Asia
and the Pacific are infected with HIV every year, according to U.N.
figures.
	   The Cambodian government marked AIDS day with the grim
announcement that 150,000 people _ 1.3 percent of the population _
are infected with the AIDS virus.
	   Officials said that 50 to 70 people catch HIV in Cambodia every
day, the highest HIV infection rate in Asia.
	   The economic crisis sweeping through Southeast Asia has made it
even more difficult for governments in the region to curb the
spread of AIDS.
	   On the eve of AIDS day, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa
launched a plea at the United Nations for governments around the
world to contribute more funds to the worldwide fight against AIDS.
	   ``We aren't doing enough to say to governments, for goodness
sake, why have so much money for death and so little for life,''
Tutu said
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton prepared to mark AIDS day with the
announcement of dlrs 10 million in emergency grants to help poorer
nations care for children orphaned by AIDS.

Riders fear poor arenas may cause injuries to Asian Games horses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARABURI, Thailand (AP) _ Riders in the equestrian events in the
13th Asian Games fear that the poor condition of the riding fields
may lead to injury for their horse partners.
	   The Taiwanese team has complained to organizers that the riding
fields at the army cavalry base where the events will be held are
too soft and have holes that could cause accidents.
	   The Taiwanese suspect poor conditions may have been responsible
for causing a tendon injury to one of their mounts. But they were
told that not much can be done, since the games open in less than a
week.
	   ``We are very upset and worried,'' said Jiuh-chao Lin, 38, who
will compete in show jumping. ``This German-bred horse is the best
bet for a gold medal for the Taiwanese team, but the injury can
possibly affect his performance with the competition just a week
away.''
	   Most sports at the Asian Games require a big investment of
blood, sweat and tears, but competitors in equestrian events must
add the high cash expense of maintaining their horse partners.
	   Transport costs alone for bringing the Taiwan team's 10 horses
to Thailand amounted to 10 million Taiwan dollars (dlrs 312,000).
	   This is the first Asian Games in which competitors have been
allowed to bring their own horses from overseas. Some are the
personal property of the riders; other belong to national teams.
	   Though the riders come from 12 countries in Asia, their 106
horses are mostly foreigners, coming from countries such as
Australia, England, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
	   ``We expect to win as many medals as we can,'' said Etsuke
Nagami, a Japanese rider, as she patted New Zealand-bred Wizard,
whom she has been riding for four years.
	   Japan's team brought in 13 horses, only one of them
Japanese-born and bred, to compete in all three equestrian events _
dressage, show jumping and the three-day-event, combining show
jumping, speed and endurance, and dressage.
	   Even Thailand, mired in a deep economic crisis since the middle
of last year, has imported 10 horses from Germany, France and
Australia at prices ranging from 1 million baht (dlrs 27,000) to 12
million baht (dlrs 330,000).
	   ``Of course, we expect to get some medals, especially from the
three-day-event even though there are some scary competitors, such
as the Koreans and Japanese,'' said Mongkol Yangpong, a 39-year-old
Thai horseman who will compete in show-jumping.
	   Mongkol trained in Germany for one month before the games.
	   As host country, Thailand's expenses go beyond fielding a team.
The venue is a cavalry base an hour's drive north of Bangkok, but
big improvements were required to make it suitable for ``foreign
guests.''
	   A major outlay went to build air-conditioned stables.
	   ``Acclimatizing the animals is a major concern. The horses will
need time to get over travel stress and adjust to the tropical
heat,'' said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary
Commission.
	   A disease control plan was the organizers' biggest concern. The
site was made into a virtual sanitary zone, with all horses and
livestock previously housed there removed seven months ago.
	   The horses themselves undergo medical testing at least as
rigorous as that applied to their human partners, including drug
tests.
	   Siraya said horses found physically unfit for the games can be
screened out at any time. The first test will be conducted this
Friday, three days before the first contest.
	   Two ambulances and 50 veterinarians are standing by in case of
any emergency.
	   Last week, three horses belonging to the Iranian team were
ordered to withdraw since they had no disease-free certificates
from their last point of embarkation, the United States, where they
trained.
	   They are now being kept separately from the other horses _ in
another province _ and are preparing to go back home, Siraya said.

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Quebec's pro-independence government was
re-elected, leaving Canada vulnerable to another wrenching showdown
over secession at almost any point in the next few years.
	   It was a personal triumph for Quebec's charismatic premier,
Lucien Bouchard, who says he will call a referendum on independence
whenever he feels the separatist side can win.
	   But he may need to wait a while for what he calls the ``winning
conditions,'' since his Parti Quebecois failed to increase its
share of the popular vote from the last election in 1994. Many
Quebeckers who backed Bouchard do not want a referendum any time
soon, and current support for secession is less than 45 percent.
	   With nearly all 23,000 polling stations reporting late Monday,
the separatists had 44.3 percent of the votes, to 42.8 percent for
the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party and 12 percent for a third
party, Democratic Action.
	   The separatists were on track to win 78 of the legislature's 125
seats, the Liberals 45 and Democratic Action one, with one seat to
be filled later because the separatist candidate recently died.
	   The outcome was a virtual replay of 1994, when the separatists
won 77 seats to 47 for the Liberals while each receiving about 44
percent of the popular vote.
	   Bouchard's main rival was Liberal party leader Jean Charest, who
tried to convince voters that the province would prosper only if
the decades-old threat of secession was abandoned.
	   Charest, 40, became an early favorite when he quit federal
politics in March to enter the Quebec race; in English-speaking
Canada he was viewed as the potential savior of national unity.
	   But despite his family roots in Quebec, he was widely perceived
by the province's French-speaking majority as more of an outsider
than Bouchard, and less likely to do battle for the province in any
confrontations with the federal government.
	   Bouchard, 59, has maintained high popularity ratings despite
overseeing painful spending cuts over the past three years in a
drive to erase Quebec's deficit. Among Francophones, he has never
lost the mythic aura he gained when, after losing a leg and almost
dying from a flesh-eating disease in 1994, he came back to lead the
separatists to near-victory in a 1995 referendum on secession.
	   Though Bouchard has served in the federal Cabinet and federal
Parliament, this was the first time he ever ran as a party leader
in Quebec. He was appointed premier without an election in 1996
after his predecessor, Jacques Parizeau, resigned following the
1995 referendum.
	   There were 5.2 million eligible voters Monday, and turnout was
more than 80 percent even though this was the fourth province-wide
vote in the past five years.
	   Analysts had suggested that a landslide separatist victory _
approaching 50 percent of the popular vote _ would lead to pressure
from Parti Quebecois militants to hold a secession referendum
quickly. Monday's results were considered more likely to prompt a
cautious approach from Bouchard, and perhaps a wait of a year or
two before considering a referendum.
	   The separatists have lost secession referendums twice before,
once by a big margin in 1980 and just narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, anxious to avoid a third defeat, said he would call
another referendum only when he was convinced the separatists would
win. In the meantime, he says he would seek more autonomy for all
10 provinces, particularly in regard to control over social
programs.
	   Many Quebeckers supported Bouchard even though they oppose
secession. Polls suggest only about 43 percent of Quebec voters
would support independence now, and about two-thirds do not want a
referendum on secession in the next few years.
	   To woo these voters, Bouchard tried to portray the election as
the choice of the most competent leadership, with the thorny
question of a referendum to be addressed at a later date.
	   The Liberals' chances clearly were hurt by the relatively strong
showing of Democratic Action, whose leader, 28-year-old Mario
Dumont, retained his seat in the legislature. His party, which
appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for Quebec
but stops short of advocating outright secession.
	   About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French
speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with
long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from
southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
	   The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a
feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is
different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their
own affairs and have their own national symbols.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ While Randy Johnson is staying at home in
Arizona, Albert Belle finally decided to leave the Chicago White
Sox and sign with Baltimore.
	   Johnson, the top left-handed pitcher in baseball, agreed Monday
to a dlrs 52.4 million, four-year contract with the Diamondbacks,
and Belle finalized his dlrs 65 million, five-year deal with the
Orioles.
	   Johnson's signing completed a pitching transformation for the
Diamondbacks, who last week signed Todd Stottlemyre and Armando
Reynoso to join a rotation that also included Andy Benes, Brian
Anderson and Omar Daal.
	   With an average salary of dlrs 13.1 million per season, Johnson
becomes the game's highest-paid pitcher and the second-highest paid
player behind Mo Vaughn, who agreed last week to an dlrs 80
million, six-year contract with Anaheim that averages dlrs 13.33
million.
	   ``I'm not going to call us a contender, but what I'm hearing
from people in baseball is that our starting rotation could be one
of the top two or three in baseball,'' Diamondbacks owner Jerry
Colangelo said.
	   Johnson, who lives in nearby Paradise Valley, chose the
Diamondbacks over the Anaheim Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and Texas
Rangers because he wants to play close to home and he thinks
Arizona is making moves to quickly become a contender.
	   ``We tried to weigh all the factors _ how competitive the team
would be in the future, where his family would be comfortable,''
said Johnson's agent Barry Meister. ``Money was a non-factor
because everything was pretty comparable. He made the decision
late, late, late last night, slept on it, still felt that way in
the morning, and we called the other clubs.''
	   Johnson, a 35-year-old left-hander who was 10-1 for Houston
after his July 31 trade from Seattle, gets a dlrs 5 million signing
bonus, dlrs 7.35 million next year and dlrs 12.35 million in each
of the following three seasons.
	   Arizona has a dlrs 12 million option for 2003 with a dlrs 3
million buyout. The option would increase to dlrs 15 million if he
wins the 2002 Cy Young Award and to dlrs 13.5 million if he's
second through fifth.
	   Belle's agent, Arn Tellem, had agreed on the financial details
of the contract last Friday, but the Orioles and Tellem didn't
finalize the outfielder's deal until Monday _ when they agreed on
the extent of his no-trade clause.
	   Belle's deal ties him with Mike Piazza of the New York Mets for
the third-highest average salary (dlrs 13 million) behind only
Vaughn and Johnson (dlrs 13.1 million). It is the sixth highest in
total dollars, trailing only Piazza (dlrs 91 million), the Yankees'
Bernie Williams (dlrs 87.5 million), Vaughn, Boston's Pedro
Martinez (dlrs 75 million) and the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield (dlrs
68.5 million).
	   While Wren and Tellem finalized the contract, Belle personally
called Yankees general manager Brian Cashman and White Sox general
manager Ron Schueler on Monday, asking if they still wanted him,
according to a baseball source who spoke on the condition he not be
identified.
	   Belle became a free agent because of a special clause in his
dlrs 55 million, five-year contract with the White Sox, which had
three years left at dlrs 35 million.
	   The contract said if he dropped out of the top three by average
salary he could ask for a raise that kept him among the top three.
The deal allowed him to file for free agency if the White Sox
refused and Chicago balked at giving him the necessary amount, dlrs
4.25 million over three years. But he still had the option, through
Wednesday, of returning to his Chicago contract.
	   White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said Sunday he spoke with
Belle three times last Wednesday but refused to change his stance
against a raise. Reinsdorf didn't speak with Belle on Monday but
wouldn't say if Schueler did.
	   ``If Albert signs someplace else, we'll have a written
statement,'' Reinsdorf said.
	   While Texas lost out on Johnson, the Rangers hung on to
shortstop Royce Clayton, who agreed to an dlrs 18 million,
four-year contract.
	   Clayton, who gets a dlrs 2 million signing bonus and annual
salaries of dlrs 4 million, hit .285 with five homers and 24 RBIs
in helping the Rangers overtake Anaheim to win the AL West this
year.
	   Texas acquired him on July 31 from the St. Louis Cardinals along
with pitcher Todd Stottlemyre for pitcher Darren Oliver and third
baseman Fernando Tatis.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The United States and Australia on
Tuesday agreed to jointly promote electronic commerce throughout
the Asia-Pacific region.
	   In the agreement reached between Prime Minister John Howard and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, each side conceded to the other's
demands.
	   The United States has agreed to relinquish what Australia has
criticized as undue American influence on who gets the biggest and
best sites on the Internet.
	   Australia, in turn, has agreed to work on legislation to
regulate Internet pornography and other efforts to maintain
industry standards.
	   The two countries also agreed that other countries should not
try to censor material on the Internet.
	   That part of the agreement was aimed at China, where censorship
is strict compared to the West, although the agreement did not
specifically identify China.
	   Australia and the United States also agreed to work together to
develop security on payment systems on the Internet.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ People across Asia handed out condoms and wore red
ribbons Tuesday as part of efforts on World AIDS Day to raise
awareness about the spread of the disease, especially in
underdeveloped countries.
	   In Japan, the Health Ministry organized rallies and charity
concerts in a square in central Tokyo to spread the word about AIDS
and express solidarity with those suffering from the disease.
	   ``It's extremely important to have an event every year to
repeatedly remind people that AIDS exists,'' said Dr. Yoshiki
Sakurai, an official of the Japanese Foundation for AIDS
Prevention.
	   Events in Tokyo will culminate with the lighting of a tree
decorated with home-made red-ribbons, the symbol of AIDS
solidarity, sent in from across Japan.
	   Discrimination against AIDS sufferers remains powerful in Japan,
and the country still lags behind many Western countries in AIDS
treatment facilities and education.
	   ``We have to move on from the current situation in Japan where
people with HIV are isolated, to one in which they are accepted as
full members of society, with jobs,'' said Satoru Ienishi, a member
of Parliament.
	   Ienishi was among the thousands of Japanese hemophiliacs who
contracted the AIDS virus through taking government-approved blood
products tainted by HIV.
	   ``The taboo against AIDS is so strong in Japan that people with
HIV are less likely to die from AIDS than from economic
difficulty,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   In Hong Kong, bars, restaurants and nightclubs handed out beer
coasters warning people to practice safe sex as part of a
three-week AIDS awareness program organized by the support group,
AIDS Concern.
	   The colorful coasters feature pictures of a fluorescent condom
on one side, with a safe sex messages on the reverse.
	   One version of the coaster reads: ``Do it safely; use a condom
every time.''
	   Aids Concern also handed out 5,000 condoms at subway stations
Tuesday morning.
	   The theme of the 11th World AIDS Day is ``Be a force for
change.''
	   Experts have warned recently that although powerful new drugs
have sent AIDS deaths plunging in industrialized countries, the
disease continues to kill millions of people in the impoverished
nations of Africa and Asia.
	   According to a new U.N. report, about 33.4 million people around
the world are infected with HIV, two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan
Africa. Two million people will die of the disease south of the
Sahara this year, four times the total for the rest of the world.
	   Adult HIV infection rates in Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and
Zimbabwe are between 20 percent and 25 percent, the United Nations
says.
	   About 1.7 million people in Africa and 700,000 people in Asia
and the Pacific are infected with HIV every year, according to U.N.
figures.
	   The Cambodian government marked AIDS day with the grim
announcement that 150,000 people _ 1.3 percent of the population _
are infected with the AIDS virus.
	   Officials said that 50 to 70 people catch HIV in Cambodia every
day, the highest HIV infection rate in Asia.
	   The economic crisis sweeping through Southeast Asia has made it
even more difficult for governments in the region to curb the
spread of AIDS.
	   On the eve of AIDS day, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa
launched a plea at the United Nations for governments around the
world to contribute more funds to the worldwide fight against AIDS.
	   ``We aren't doing enough to say to governments, for goodness
sake, why have so much money for death and so little for life,''
Tutu said
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton prepared to mark AIDS day with the
announcement of dlrs 10 million in emergency grants to help poorer
nations care for children orphaned by AIDS.
