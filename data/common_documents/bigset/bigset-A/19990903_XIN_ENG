<HEADLINE> Plane Crash Victims in Tanzania Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The 10 tourists from the
United States, together with a pilot and a tourist guide, who were
killed in a plane crash in northern Tanzania's Arusha Region, have
been identified.
</P>
<P>
The dead Americans have been identified as Mr. and Mrs.
Bowersock, Ms B. Hoffman, Ms V. Cox, Mr. R. Ennis, Mr. C.Ennis,
Mr. and Mrs. Putterman, Mr. N. Dolan and Ms. M. Riffuti, reports
from Arusha said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 12 people were killed after their light aircraft crashed
Wednesday morning in the Mount Meru Forest Reserve in Arumeru
District, some 20 kilometers from Arusha municipality.
</P>
<P>
Efforts of policemen, rescue teams and several tour companies
to collect the remains in the dense forest proved completely
futile because of bad weather on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
However, the weather improved Thursday and eyewitnesses said
that the bodies were badly damaged but were assembled ready to be
transported to the Mount Meru Hospital Mortuary.
</P>
<P>
The Cessna 404 plane, belonging to the Arusha-based Northern
Air Charter Company, went down at about 11 a.m. local time
(0800GMT) before it touched down at the Kilimanjaro International
Airport on its way to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tourists, after two days of game viewing at the
world-famous Serengeti National Park, were scheduled to go to the
Maasai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the crash was probably caused by poor
visibility. The pilot of the fateful plane, Christopher Pereira,
had radioed another charter plane following him, with a group of
seven Americans, alerting them of poor weather but seconds later
the communication was suddenly cut off.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said the 14-seat plane was destroyed beyond
recognition save for one engine and a propeller, while dismembered
bodies were flung as far as 500 meters from the crash site, mainly
due to the impact of the crash.
</P>
<P>
A villager who joined the rescue team said some small pieces of
human flesh were seeing hanging down the trees.
</P>
<P>
The work of the rescue was made difficult because of the thick
forest covered with cypress trees and wild animals in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha Regional Police Commander, Juma Ng' wanang' waka,
was at the crash site on Thursday afternoon together with the
Directorate of Civil Aviation (DCA) officials.
</P>
<P>
The other Tanzanian, who was killed in the crash, has been
identified as Mr. William Meiriali, a guide with the Abercrombie
and Kent tourism firm, which arranged the tour of 17 American
tourists.
</P>
<P>
But the other seven who were travelling in another light plane
landed safely at the Kilimanjaro International Airport.

<P>
ATHENS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
officials began here Thursday their fourth meeting sponsored by
Greece in order to foster a climate of trust and seek viable and
lasting solutions to the Mideast problem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation was led by Faisal Al-Husseini, who
is responsible for the Jerusalem issues while the Israeli
officials include Minister to the Prime Minister's office Haim
Ramon and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day meeting, both sides are expected to decide
to create three bipartizan committees such as the
inter-parliamentary committee, the conflict resolution committee
dealing with issues of daily life and the committee to deal with
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is playing an important role in building
confidence between the two sides, is expected to propose the
establishment of two more committees on the protection of cultural
heritage and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The first and the second such meetings were held in Athens in
July and December of 1997 and the third took place in the
southeastern Greek island of Rhodes in July 1998.

<HEADLINE> Russian Population May Decline by 8 Billion in 16 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Statistics Agency
predicted that the population of Russia may shrink by eight
million people by the year 2016, the Interfax news agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Irina Sbarskaya, head of the agency's Demographics Department,
said that since the 1960s, the birth rate has been insufficient to
ensure the simple replenishment of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
To ensure replenishment, she said, every 100 women must have
215 children, not 124 as now.
</P>
<P>
She said the population of Russia has decreased by 2 million
people over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
According to her agency, the population of Russia dropped by
0.28 percent, or 406,200, in the first half of this year to reach
145.9 million as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
As compared with the first half of the previous year, the rate
of population decline almost doubled. From January to June 1998,
the population of Russia diminished only by 226,700, or 0.15
percent.
</P>
<P>
The faster population decline was attributed to a rising death
rate as well as a decrease in migration from outside Russia.

<HEADLINE> Mice with Extra Gene Get Smarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- In an achievement that one day
may be applied to enhance human intelligence, U.S. researchers
have genetically modified mice to be better at learning and
remembering.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from Princeton University, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Washington University, found that
adding a single NR2B gene to mice significantly boosted their
ability to solve maze tasks, learn from objects and sounds in
their environment and to retain that knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Their research, published Thursday in the science journal
Nature and hailed as a "breakthrough" in memory study, revealed a
common biochemical mechanism at the root of nearly all learning.
</P>
<P>
It proved that the NR2B gene is a key switch that controls the
brain's ability to associate one event with another, the core
feature of learning.
</P>
<P>
The NR2B gene is the blueprint for a protein that spans the
surface of neurons and serves as a docking point, or receptor, for
certain chemical signals.
</P>
<P>
After giving mice extra copies of the NR2B gene, and
engineering the genes so that their activity increases as the mice
age, the researchers found that mice with the extra gene had a
much greater learning response than normal mice in a variety of
tests.
</P>
<P>
And, this genetically-modified strain of mice, called Doogie,
also retained into adulthood certain brain features of juvenile
mice, which, like young humans, are widely believed to be better
than adults at grasping large.
</P>
<P>
The finding showed that "genetic improvement of intelligence
and memory in mammals is now feasible, thus offering a striking
example of how genetic technology may affect mankind and society
in the next century", the researchers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Humans also have the corresponding NR2B gene, although it is
not yet known whether it has the same function in people.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientists believed that in the long-term, the
results may promote further discussions on ethical and social
issues regarding whether and how genetic technology should be used
to modify or enhance mental and cognitive attributes in people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspect Russia Mafia Has Moles in U.S. Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. authorities suspect
that Russian organized crime groups may have put "moles" inside
the U.S. financial system while the administration continued to
deny any U.S. aid was misused.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told reporters Thursday
that the U.S. has not found evidence to show that proceeds from a
one billion U.S. food aid package were illegally funnelled to
offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has come to me with any reports of any major diversions
at all, I'm comfortable, based upon what I've been hearing with
the level of monitoring," Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
However, The Wall Street Journal Thursday quoted the U.S.
authorities as saying that the criminals set people up with jobs
to help them launder money and conduct other illegal transactions,
placing the moles in key positions at major banks and securities
firms.
</P>
<P>
"They'll put people in sensitive positions in the bank so they
can utilize them at some later point," a law-enforcement official
who investigates Russian rings in the U.S. told the journal.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the U.S. authorities based their concerns
on information from informants and other confidential sources but
not on public evidence, which they said is scant.
</P>
<P>
The probe is part of a broader investigation into a number of
alleged money-laundering cases at U.S. banks. The initial
investigation centered on the Bank of New York, but has widened in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has called allegations of Russian
involvement in money laundering a smear by Western media and
denied loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
diverted illegally.

ATHENS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Thursday announced measures to reduce taxes and prices on
certain goods in a bid to lower the country's inflation, which now
stands at 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The package also includes income support for pensioners,
farmers and the unemployed, the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the package entails a reduction in the special
consumer tax on heating petrol from 20,000 drachmas (about 65.6
U.S. dollars) per ton to 6,100 drachmas (about 20 dollars) per
ton.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in special consumer charges on cars is expected to
bring down prices of new cars by about 10 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
The tax-free threshold for wage-earners and pensioners will be
increased from 1.355 million drachmas (about 4,442.6 dollars) to
1.9 million drachmas (about 6,229.5 dollars) for the present tax
year, with the threshold rising further to 2.3 million drachmas
(about 7,540.9 dollars) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment benefits are to increase by 10 percent, those
insured with the agricultural pension fund will receive an extra
10,000 drachmas (about 32.8 dollars) as of January 1, 2000 and all
unemployed regardless of age will be eligible to receive free
health care.

MAPUTO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has described the signing of the ceasefire in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo as the opening of a new page in
the region's efforts for peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as Chairman of the Southern African Development
 Community (SADC), Chissano said that the signing of the peace
accord by the two factions of the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD) in Lusaka on Tuesday "represents the end of hostilities and
the beginning of a long process for the restoration of peace in
the Congo and in the Great Lakes region".
</P>
<P>
Other parties involved in the Congolese conflict, namely
Angola, Namibia, Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and the Congolese
government itself, had signed this peace accord on July 10, but
the two RCD groups did not do so then because of their internal
leadership dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a note from the SADC presidency, Chissano expressed the wish
to see the document implemented as urgently as possible, the
process of sending international observers to the Congo,
particularly from the United Nations, "so as to ensure the
implementation of the accord and promote a climate of trust
between the parties involved".
</P>
<P>
The note also congratulated Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
for his commitment in the quest for a lasting peace in the Congo.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Link Sicily and Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A governmental decree published
Thursday could help pave the way for a link between Sicily and
mainland of Italy, Italian Public Works Minister Enrico Micheli
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a turning point," Micheli said after the government
announced the appointment of advisers who are to assess various
projects to link the Italian largest island of Sicily and the
south region of Calabria in Italian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"In order to take a decision you must examine costs, the impact
on the environment, time and the effectiveness of the project,"
he said, adding that "only then can you pick out the best
solution."
</P>
<P>
"Sicily urgently needs a link to the mainland, especially now
that there is a united Europe and the single currency, which raise
new challenges for the island's economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian government's decree, the advisers will
have six months to assess technical, financial and environmental
aspects of the projects to link Sicily and mainland.
</P>
<P>
The main contender, according to the decree, is a 3.3km
suspended bridge which the Stretto di Messina company estimated in
1997 would cost 7 trillion lire ( about 3.78 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another solution, preferred by environmental groups, is for a
"water highway," Micheli says, which would enable high-speed
ferries to cross the straits of Messina.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Israeli, Palestinian Deal Eludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- In a setback in the Middle
East peace, Israel and the Palestinians failed to sign an
agreement over the implementation of the U.S.-brokered Wye peace
deal in Egypt Thursday afternoon as widely expected.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had arranged a signing ceremony in the port city of
Alexandria in the presence of visiting United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. But the Israeli and Palestinian sides
remained deadlocked over the issue of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted "a senior source" in Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's office as saying that a signing ceremony would apparently
be held in Alexandria Friday morning. A spokesman for the prime
minister said, however, Barak "would not fly anywhere at this
moment."
</P>
<P>
The last obstacle to an agreement on the implementation of the
Wye interim deal, signed and then frozen by Israel's former
hard-line prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year, was the
release of Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.
</P>
<P>
After the gaps narrowed in rounds of talks lasting for over one
month, the Palestinians demand that Israel release 400 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities. But Israel
insists that it will release only 350 and reiterated it will not
free those who had killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have actually reached the
verge of an agreement after intensive talks since late July. They
have made significant progress on most issues concerning the
implementation of the Wye accord, including a timetable of further
Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over a period of
12 weeks. Netanyahu froze the deal after carrying out its first
stage.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted Barak's proposal to divide the
two remaining phases of Israeli troop withdrawals into three
stages and put off the final stage until early next year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that if the two sides could not agree on all
issues, it would carry out the Wye agreement as written, meaning
all understandings recently reached including those on the seaport
and safe passages would not be implemented.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the two sides might still have chances to
resolve their difference during Albright's five-day stay in the
region.
</P>
<P>
During a joint news conference with Albright in Alexandria
after the planned ceremony time, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said contacts were going on between Israel and the
Palestinians. He said the U.S. and Egypt were also involved in
the contacts.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who started the visit in Morocco Wednesday, will
arrive in Israel late Thursday night and will hold talks with
Barak Friday. Besides the Palestinian track, she will also
discuss with Barak the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks,
which froze three years ago.

of its function and in violation of general and international
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Yugoslav diplomat said this was also a violation of
a Security Council resolution adopted on June 10 setting out
UNMIK's mandate, rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission, which operates parallel to a NATO-led
military force called KFOR, is administering Kosovo, the mainly
ethnic Albanian province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of UNMIK constitutes an illegal, arbitrary and
unacceptable usurpation of other persons' assets and a violation
of the basic norms of the status of state property and its
inviolability," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Yugoslav government "demands the restitution of the
illegally seized property and its return to the legal owner" and
called on the Security Council to instruct UNMIK "not to abuse its
functions in the future and to abide by its mandate" under the
June 10 council resolution.

<HEADLINE> AL Backs Efforts for Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) on Thursday
reiterated support for the efforts to have economic sanctions on
Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year-old crippling international trade embargo on Iraq
should be lifted to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi people, AL
Assistant Secretary General Ahmad Bin Heli said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation pan-Arab forum rejects the continued attacks on
Iraqi sites by warplanes of the United States and Britain, Heli
told reporters after a meeting with Iraqi Permanent Delegate to
the Arab League Al-Sultan Al-Shawi.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed the economic
sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait, which
sparked the Gulf War in 1991 to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones in north
and south Iraq, set up by the West allies after the Gulf War, have
been attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets since December,
causing serious casualties and damage of properties.
</P>
<P>
Heli delivered to Al-Shawi a letter for Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammad Said al-Sahaf from the league chief, Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The letter is a supplement to an earlier message aimed at
clearing the atmosphere for achieving a success for the upcoming
Arab foreign ministers' meeting, the league official said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf will chair the foreign ministers' meeting slated in
Cairo for September 12-13 under rotational system.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Al-Shawi said he briefed Heli on the daily
military aggressions on Iraq by the U.S. and British forces, which
he said jeopardize the unity of Iraq and the security of the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy called upon Arab countries to support Iraq in
standing up to the embargo and aggressions.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shawi hailed the Arab League's rejection of the U.S.-British
air strikes against Iraq and urged Arabs to take a decisive stand
to end the assault.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Forces Kill 3 Rebels in Caprivi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Namibian security forces
killed three secessionists in a shoot-out early Thursday after
uncovering a " terrorist hideout" in the northeastern Caprivi
Strip, according to report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a ministry statement as saying that security
forces " killed three terrorists" during an operation at the
village of Sibbinda.
</P>
<P>
"The security forces uncovered a secret terrorist hideout in
the Sibbinda area where 10 terrorists were hiding, and this led to
an exchange of fire resulting in three Caprivi Liberation Army
terrorists being killed and two captured," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Sibbinda is about 60 kilometers west of Katima Mulilo, the main
town of the Caprivi region.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "Among the dead terrorists is Alex Chainda,
a former member of the Namibian Defense Force. War materials were
also captured, among which were seven assault rifles and one
shotgun."
</P>
<P>
Security operations were continuing in the area, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned the rebels to hand themselves over to the
authorities or "be prepared to face extinction."
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed when secessionists attacked
Katima Mulilo on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The secessionists, members of the shadowy Caprivi Liberation
Army, are seeking independence for the Caprivi Strip, a narrow
finger of Namibian territory bordered by Angola, Botswana, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Community Urged to Support Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President F. Chiluba
has appealed to international community to cancel the external
debts hanging over the heads of poor countries which were
crippling and destroying hopes of African countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said this when he was meeting with a visiting
British parliamentary delegation in the State House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the worry and request to international community was
for assistance with the debts in order to use the money to service
the people.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking for help from the international community in
order to enable us to use the money in which we must service our
education, health and other sectors," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba further said financial assistance was required for
capacity building to enhance democracy in areas like
anti-corruption commission and permanent human rights commission.
</P>
<P>
He also said the country was looking at the area of conflict as
it was impossible to attract investment where conflicts were the
order of the day.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba regretted that peace had not been achieved in Angola
despite spending 14 months discussing the issue in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent signing of the peace agreement on the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo was for the purpose
of giving the region peace and what system of government the
people wanted.
</P>
<P>
The president also said: "we must make our own efforts to build
and strengthen the economic institutional base in Southern
Africa."
</P>
<P>
That is the case for Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),
also looking at the conflicts issue, "we are making efforts to
stop the conflicts in the Southern African region," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Lord Evens, leader of the delegation,
thanked the president for the effort he has made to bring the two
Congolese rebel groups to sign the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also hopes the international conference on HIV/AIDS
scheduled for September 12-16 in Lusaka will find some cure to the
disease on the African continent.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hopeful Palestinians, Israel to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Thursday that she is hopeful that the
Palestinians and Israel will soon reach an agreement on the
implementation of the Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks at a joint press conference with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa after her meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
But she said in the meantime that she could only do so much to
bring together the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, who refuse
to budge in a dispute over the number of Palestinian prisoners to
be freed by Israel under the Wye accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
"While the United States and Egypt can be helpful, it is up to
the parties themselves to make the hard decisions," she said.
"The negotiations are still going on. We expect them to continue
and we hope very much that they will come to a conclusion as soon
as possible."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Moussa called on the United States to play its
role as the major mediator in the peace talks to help the
Palestinians and Israel reach a resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt does not think that the U.S. will stay on the sidelines
as the peace process is passing through this crucial stage,"
Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that an agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel could be signed in Egypt "within hours, or
within days."
</P>
<P>
Egypt had hoped to host a afternoon signing ceremony of the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Alexandria, but night fell with
no agreement.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Alexandria from Morocco earlier in the day
on the second leg of her Mideast tour, which will also take her to
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria and Jordan. Her
regional tour is also aimed at seeking ways of helping resume the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations, suspended in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. administration has billed her tour as a
stock-taking trip, Albright might have to intervene to help the
Palestinians and Israel to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have agreed on every other
essential issues, including the timetables for the further Israeli
troop pullback from the West Bank and the final status talks under
a revised Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides are stuck over the release of a few dozen
Palestinians held in Israeli jails for anti-Israeli activities.
Israel has offered to free 356 Palestinian prisoners while the
Palestinians sought the release of 400.

<HEADLINE> Over 300,000 Armed Prospectors in Lunda-Sul, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September (Xinhua) -- Angola denounced the existence of
over 300, 000 illegal and armed diamond searchers in the northeast
province of Lunda- Sul, the National Diamond Enterprise (Endiama)
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among those armed prospectors are citizens of Democratic
Republic of Congo, South Africa, Mali and Angola, including
Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi, revealed the company in an
interview with the National Radio of Angola (RNA).
</P>
<P>
The illegal diamond prospectors in the areas with an abundance
of diamond deposits in the Lunda-Sul Province are currently
undertaking their prospecting for the mineral, said Endiama, the
national diamond monopolizing company.
</P>
<P>
Due to the excellent military equipment of the illegal diamond
searchers, the guards of the mines faced difficulties in the
fighting with them. Only a coordination between the management of
Endiama and the defense and security forces can clear up the
areas, said the source of Endiama.
</P>
<P>
Endiama vowed to take measures in the near future to crack
down on the rampant illegal prospecting activities in Lunda-Sul in
northeast Angola, which is an important diamond-producing country
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) also participated in the
circumscription, launching attacks and conducting prospecting,
earning millions of dollars which are used for aquisition of
military equipment supporting the war.

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Multi-talented sprinter-
jumper Marion Jones of the United States, who collapsed during the
World Athletics Championship last week due to back injury, still
has back spasms and will not compete again this season, her agent
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"She continues to improve, but she is not well enough to
compete," Charlie Wells said in a telephone interview from
Brussels, Belgium Ones had hoped to compete in a Golden League
meet there Friday.
</P>
<P>
The pulling-out decision would put an end to Jones' hope of
sharing the one million U.S. dollars as bonues offfered to
athletes who compete the Golden League season undefeated in their
specialties. Jones is one of the three runners who had won all
five of their European circuit races previously.
</P>
<P>
Only the final meet in Berlin next week remained in the Golden
League after Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Jones, the unbeatable sprinter in the 100 and 200 meters so
far, collapsed on the track in the semifinals of the women's 200
meters at the world championships in Seville, Spain, suffering
from cramps and back spasms.
</P>
<P>
She returned to the United States over the weekend for further
evaluation. Her doctors recommended she not compete again this
season, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
The world No. 1 sprinter had hoped to win four gold medals at
the world championships. She successfully defended her 100 meter
title but finished third in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
Wells said the injury will not change Jones' determination to
seek an unprecedented five gold medals in the Sydney Olympics next
year.

JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Zimbabwe
Thursday agreed to expand economic cooperation with a view to
development in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Projects the two countries were pursuing together would be
speeded up within the context of balanced regional development,
South African President Thabo Mbeki told reporters after meeting
his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said: "We are looking at projects where joint efforts

progressive than we would be working separately."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said his meeting with Mugabe focused on matters such as
the development of a gas field in Zimbabwe, and generating
economic activity along the existing road link between Harare and
Beira, Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The Beira corridor would also be discussed with Mozambique with
a view to a tri-lateral effort to maximize the economic potential
of this link.
</P>
<P>
A continuous railway link between Harare and Zambia was another
project under discussion, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said countries in the region would also examine the tourism
potential of cross-border national parks.
</P>
<P>
"The relevant ministers will be dealing with those issues. Task
teams will work on the detail and we will meet again in three
months' time to review progress," Mbeki said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Minister Admits Embezzling Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Minister of Education
Emmanuel Mudidi has admitted that important sums of money were
embezzled in the ministry's project of reconstruction and
rehabilitation of schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
He had been summoned by parliament to explain corruption in an
International Development Association (IDA) 227 Credit worth 26
million U.S. dollars, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told lawmakers Wednesday that embezzlement, which hit the
World Bank project which started in 1995 and was due to end by
this September, caused a loss of over 150 million Rwandan franc
(one U.S. dollar equals to 355 Rwandan franc at current exchange
rate).
</P>
<P>
Mudidi acknowledged that up to now, only 23 million dollars
have been used.
</P>
<P>
However, Mudidi said that the case of corruption has been
submitted to courts which are handling it.
</P>
<P>
Some people involved in this scandal have already been arrested
and asked to return the money.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the project was set up to
reconstruct schools during the emergency period after the 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
It was planned to rehabilitate over 3,000 school blocks and
replace school equipment and stationary in the schools.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, parliamentarians have decided to
follow up another corruption case in which the government is said
to have lost 350 million Rwandan franc to one Rwandan businessman.
</P>
<P>
Corruption is currently at the top of evils the authorities
have stepped up measures to eradicate.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged To Reduce Domestic Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday urged
the Zimbabwean government to mobilize concessional aid from donors
and privatization proceeds to reduce its crippling domestic debt
and to direct more budget expenditure toward poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
World Bank resident representative Thomas Allen made the call
in Harare at the opening of a two-day Structural Adjustment
Participatory Review public forum to assess the impact of
structural and sectoral adjustment and stabilization policies and
to recommend changes in these policies.
</P>
<P>
Allen said that the high level of budgetary interest payments,
accounting for more than a quarter of all budgetary expenditures,
constrained expenditures in support of crucial social services and
poverty reduction activities.
</P>
<P>
"Reducing the stock of domestic debt of the government in order
to cut budgetary interest payments so as to make more money
available for increasing high priority social expenditures has to
be at the core of the strategy," said the World Bank official.
</P>
<P>
This could create a cycle of exchange rate stabilization, lower
interest rates, lower inflation and lower fiscal deficits over the
medium term, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation was the greatest tax on the poor and bringing
it under control through fiscal and monetary stabilization
measures was crucial.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of the privatization program was not only
important for the reduction of domestic debt, he said, adding
there was evidence that the services provided by these enterprises
could be more efficiently provided by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
A workable land reform program could contribute significantly
to poverty reduction, Allen said, but he lamented that progress in
land reform had been slow and had been clouded by politics.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official expressed hope that more donors would
extend financial support to Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> S. African Wrestlers Aim high at All-Africa Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South African wrestlers
aim for at least 10 medals in the up-coming All-Africa Games.
</P>
<P>
South African coach Hennie Minnaar said he was confident that
the wrestlers will repeat their achievements at the previous
Africa Games and the recent All-Africa championships.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 in Harare, the wrestlers won two gold medals on the
final day of the Africa Games to put South Africa at the top of
the medal table.
</P>
<P>
However, Minnaar expected the standard of wrestling to be
exceptionally high because it is a qualifying tournament for the
Sydney Olympics. More than 130 wrestlers from 16 countries and
regions have entered for the competition.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria will undoubtedly be our strongest opponents in the
Free Style division," says Minnaar, quoted by South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
"while Egypt and Tunisia are rated among the world's best in
the Greco-Roman style." added Minnaar. South Africans will also
for the first time see an international female competition and the
Algerians and Tunisians are expected to dominate.
</P>
<P>
The South African Freestyle team is highly experienced and all
the wrestlers have had recent international exposure. Bennie
Labuschagne(69kg) and Jannie du Toit (76kg) are firm favorites for
golds. Both are current Africa champions and ranked among the top
12 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Two veterans of the Atlanta Olympics, Tjaart du Plessis (63kg)
and Andrew Davidson (130kg) are staging a comeback and are
expected to win medals. Tjonkie van Rensburg (58kg) brings vast
experience and exceptional skills to the competition and should do
very well.
</P>
<P>
Shaun Williams (54kg) will return from America where he is
currently studying and excelling in the tough Collegiate-circuit.
As the youngest member of the team he carries the hope for another
gold for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Both Gideon Malherbe (76kg) and Markus Dekker (97kg) have won
medals at Africa championships in the Greco-Roman style and they
are expected to repeat.
</P>
<P>
Two Under-20 wrestlers, Raynard Mouton (63kg) and Juan Nel (
69kg),will use the Games to gain valuable international experience.
</P>
<P>
Amongt the women, the country's medal hopes are pinned on
Yvonnika Kruger (56kg) and Madelyn Swanepoel (75kg). However,
attention will also be fixed on the very talented Simphiwe
Mpungose (46kg) who will get her first taste of international
competition.
</P>
<P>
The South African competition will come from Algeria,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Senegal,
Ivory Coast,Tanzania, Namibia, Cameroon, Kenya, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Central African and Chad.

<HEADLINE> Albright in Egypt for Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in Alexandria, Egypt Thursday on the
second leg of her regional tour aimed at helping push the Mideast
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Albright went straight into talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak after arriving in the Mediterranean port city to seek ways
to bridge the gap between the Palestinians and Israel over an
agreement on the implementation of the Wye peace accord signed
last October.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States administration has billed Albright's
Mideast tour as a stock-taking trip, it appeared that she might
have to help the Palestinians and Israel overcome last-minute
obstacles to the agreement which was supposed to be signed in
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
A difference over the number of the Palestinian prisoners to be
released by Israel is holding up the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to free 356 Palestinians held for
anti-Israeli activities while the Palestinians sought the release
of 400. The two sides refused to budge in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have reached agreement on the
timetables for further Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank
and the final status talks in addition to the opening of two safe
passages between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Albright began her Mideast tour with a visit to Morocco. After
her trip in Egypt, she will also travel to Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Syria and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Patten Hits Out at N.Irish Police Report Leak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Hong Kong governor Chris
Patten on Thursday hit out at the leaking of his report into the
future of Northern Ireland's police force, saying some media
reports were aimed at derailing the province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It has been extremely frustrating," Patten told BBC radio.
"There have been some things which I can only imagine are an
attempt to muddy the water before we report."
</P>
<P>
The Belfast Telegraph newspaper said last week that Patten
would recommend the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) be renamed the
"Police Service of Northern Ireland".
</P>
<P>
Political parties, including the Irish Republican Army's
political wing Sinn Fein, might have places on a new police
supervisory board, it said.
</P>
<P>
Policing is one of the province's most divisive issues. More
than 90 percent of RUC officers are Protestant.
</P>
<P>
Protestant politicians have always made clear they would see
any name change for the RUC as an attempt to appease Northern
Ireland's minority Catholic community by removing any reference to
the British crown.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has branded the force anti-Catholic and wants it
abolished.
</P>
<P>
Patten, who will deliver his report next week as former U.S.
Senator George Mitchell launches a review of the problems holding
up last year's Good Friday peace accord, said the newspaper had
been indulging in "educated guesswork".
</P>
<P>
"I hope that there then can be a full and serious debate on an
issue which is absolutely fundamental to the question of whether
or not Northern Ireland continues to develop as a peaceful,
democratic society," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ghaddafi: Libya Welcomes Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Libya welcomes more foreign
investments and the Libyan people are sincere in international
economic cooperation, said Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The West always accused Libya of being against international
trade and closing our country by ourselves. This is not true,"
said Ghaddafi at the opening of the two-day Symposium on Prospects
of International Investment and Trade in the Great Jamahiriya.
</P>
<P>
Ghaddafi told the symposium, which drew about 40 businessmen
from 30 countries, that Libya is important for foreign investors
because it is situated at the entrance of Africa and it enjoys a
coastline of 2,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Libya intends to be the transit line for trade between northern
and southern Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader assured foreign investors that "we have laws
to protect foreign investments and incentives to attract
investments."
</P>
<P>
Libya's General People's Congress (parliament) passed in 1997
Law No. 5 to attact investment of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Libya remains subject to tough sanctions from the United
States, who accused Libya of supporting terrorist activities.
Libya's asset in the U.S. are frozen, and Americans are banned
from engaging in trade with Libya or traveling to the country.
</P>
<P>
Libya has claimed that the seven-year United Nations sanctions
against Libya, which had been in place since 1992 after the
Lockerbie bombing, has caused the country to lose 24 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government has been making efforts to draw
investment to revitalize the country's oil-dependent economy after
the U.N. suspended the sanctions on Libya in April after Libya
handed over the two Libyans suspected of bombing a Pan Am flight
over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.

TEHRAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas
Klestil is to pay a visit to Iran on September 20, the first by a
Western European head of state in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here quoted Gerhard Rainer, director general of
Austrian Foreign Ministry's Cultural Department, as saying the
visit is aimed at boosting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries' officials will concentrate on exploring
ways of promoting bilateral cooperation and discussing joint
programs, and strengthen political, cultural and economic ties
between Iran and Austria," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian official said the two nations "had good mutual
relations in the past, including in the holding of the conference
of dialog between Islam and Christianity." The second round of the
conference is expected in Vienna in September or October.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has normalized relations with European Union members
states, which were marred by Iran's condemnation of British
writer Salmon Rushdie for his book The Satanic Verses.
</P>
<P>
Rainer said the two sides will cooperate in language teaching,
archeological projects and academic undertaking, hold an
Iran-Austria Culture Week and an exhibition of Austrian
architecture, and promote tourism between them.
</P>
<P>
Expressing welcome to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's
proposal for dialog among civilizations, Rainer said his country
believes "the best way to remove misunderstandings is through
dialog between peoples."

<HEADLINE> Renovated UNITA Urged to Be Responsible for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Renovated Commission of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) should
take great responsibility for peace, national reconciliation and
the defense of the territorial integrity of Angola, an official of
the organization said Thursday
</P>
<P>
Jorge Valentim, Foreign Secretary of the Renovated Commission,
made the statement here in a program of the National Radio of
Angola (RNA) on the occasion of the first anniversary of the
establishment of the organization.
</P>
<P>
According to Valentim, the foundation of the commission is the
first movement for the democratization of the "new" UNITA, which
was announced by some renegade members of the rebel UNITA led by
Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Valentim said that his organization will continue to grow, but
should do more in the future.
</P>
<P>
President of the renovated UNITA, Eugenio Manuvakola reportedly
said Wednesday that the organization will contribute to the
reconstruction of the country which has suffered more than 24
years of civil war since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign secretary stressed that the foundation
of the organization a year ago constituted a "clear defiance"
against Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a good change in thought and in the system of
ideas in the UNITA," said the secretary, adding that "there exists
for the first time a clear defiance against Jonas Savimbi for the
salvation of the UNITA and the general democratization of the
country."

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis More Dangerous Than AIDS: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Hepatitis "B" and "C" are
one hundred times more contagious than AIDS and the number of
patients dying from hepatitis "B" in one day is equal to that of
those dying from AIDS in one year, according to experts attending
a discussion program here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The experts concurred that hepatitis "B" will ultimately lead
to liver cancer and takes life within a short period of time after
contracting the disease. They said that the disease claims lives
of some two million people every year around the world and the
people dying from it in Nepal ranges from 500 to 1,000 every year.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis "B" and "C" are one of the main causes for liver
cirrhosis and cancer. Eighty percent of liver cancer cases are
caused by this disease. More than 80 percent of cases are found in
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The virus causing the disease is found in blood, semen and
vaginal path.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of the Liver Foundation in Nepal Santosh
Shrestha, lactating mothers who are suffering from any infection,
alcoholics and persons who suffer from long fever and diarrhea are
more likely to contract the disease.
</P>
<P>
Persons who establish sexual contact with more than one person
and those who have received blood many times are also likely to
contract the disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease also spreads through handkerchiefs, bed sheets,
toothbrush, shaving blades and scissors used by the patient.
Tattooing, acupuncture, piercing of nose and ears, frequent use of
needles and treatment of teeth may also contribute to the spread
of the disease, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspects Russian Mafia Has Moles in U.S. Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. authorities suspect
that Russian organized crime groups may have put "moles" inside
the U.S. financial system, The Wall Street Journal reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the authorities as saying that the criminals
set people up with jobs to help them launder money and conduct
other illegal transactions, placing the moles in key positions at
major banks and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
"They'll put people in sensitive positions in the bank so they
can utilize them at some later point," a law-enforcement official
who investigates Russian rings in the U.S. told the journal.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the U.S. authorities based their concerns
on information from informants and other confidential sources but
not on public evidence, which they said is scant.
</P>
<P>
The probe is part of a broader investigation into a number of
alleged money-laundering cases at U.S. banks. The initial
investigation centered on the Bank of New York, but has widened in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has called allegations of Russian
involvement in money laundering a smear by Western media and
denied loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
diverted illegally.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Dennis Weakens But Still Menacing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Dennis, which reduced from
a hurricane to a tropical storm Tuesday, continued to lash U.S.
east coastal areas with gusting winds Thursday, spitting rain for
the fourth day in a row and taunting meteorologists who warned
that the storm could still regain strength and become a hurricane
again.
</P>
<P>
The storm remained nearly stalled less than 160 kilometers off
the coast of North Carolina State, astounding weather experts and
confounding residents who had put their lives on hold.
</P>
<P>
Along the coast from North Carolina to Delaware, four straight
days of churning winds kept many beaches closed and carried away
hectares of sand, including the sand that once swelled in front of
the Virginia Beach boardwalk. Crews in Ocean City, Maryland State,
cleared piles of drifted sand from the boardwalk and washing
crusted salt from power lines.
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, where President Bill Clinton Wednesday
declared nine counties eligible for federal disaster funds because
of Dennis, some 5,000 people, mostly residents, who stayed on
Hatteras Island after Sunday's evacuation order remained stranded
when the only north-south highway became impassable.
</P>
<P>
Dennis had weakened enough by Wednesday morning that officials
at the National Hurricane Center considered stripping it of its
tropical storm status as well. But airborne observations showed
that a storm eye may be reforming on its western side, a sign that
Dennis is likely to remain a serious threat well into the weekend.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Growth Slows While Labor Costs Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday that growth of U.S. workers' productivity slowed
considerably in the second quarter while labor costs rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work,
increased at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the April-June
quarter, far below the 3.6 percent rate in the first three months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected smaller 0.6 percent increase was revised
downward from the Department's initial estimate a month ago that
productivity had risen 1.3 percent in the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, unit labor costs, a key measure of wage
pressures, jumped at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the second
quarter, the largest increase since the first quarter of 1994 when
they also rose 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has told Congress
that recent strong gains in productivity were likely to moderate.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan and many other economists believe the good showing on
productivity has helped keep inflation low.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has warned that if productivity slows, wage pressures
are likely to quickly surface, given that labor markets are the
tightest in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
The 0.6 percent increase in productivity was the slowest
quarterly increase since the second quarter of 1998, when
productivity rose only at a 0.4 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in productivity reflected the fact that the gross
domestic product also slowed sharply to an annual rate of 1.8
percent in the second quarter of this year, compared to 4.3
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, productivity increased by 2.2 percent, almost double
the 1.2 percent gain of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has noted this sharp improvement as evidence to
support his view that the nation's heavy investment in computers
and other productivity-enhancing technology is beginning to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5 percent rate of increase in unit labor costs compared
to modest increases of just 2 percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Probes Links Between UNITA, Secessionists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian authorities
are investigating links between secessionist rebels who attacked a
town in the remote Caprivi Strip a month ago and Angola's UNITA
rebels, Agence France Presse (AFP) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seven members of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) were deported in mid-August after being arrested
in the Caprivi Strip in a crackdown following the August 2 rebel
attack on Katima Mulilo, AFP quoted Namibian Defense Force Chief
of Staff Martin Shalli as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They were UNITA people, there is no question about it. They
said it themselves," Shalli said.
</P>
<P>
However, it was unclear how they were linked to the attack, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know what they were doing," Shalli said, adding that
they could have been trading with the secessionists, who are
seeking independence for Caprivi, a strip of land sandwiched by
Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said defense authorities were investigating whether the
seven were in Namibia as individuals or on behalf of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He said the secessionist rebels got some weapons and equipment
from UNITA people.
</P>
<P>
"we are not sure whether it was (officially) from the movement
or from UNITA bandits selling weapons. But they do have a
connection," Shalli said.
</P>
<P>
One possibility was that UNITA had exchanged weapons for fuel
from the Namibian rebels.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed in Katima Mulilo, about 1,200
kilometers northeast of the capital Windhoek, in fighting between
the secessionists and security forces.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency imposed in the region was lifted last
week. "The area is under control," Shalli said.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted The Namibian newspaper as reporting on Thursday that
85 people in connection with the rebel attack were charged with
high treason.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Support Turkey's Bid for EU Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday it
would argue for Turkey to be recognised as an European Union (EU)
candidate at a weekend meeting of EU foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We will be arguing for that (candidate) status to be
recognised...this weekend among foreign ministers," Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook told reporters after talks in London with his
Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Turkey's application should be judged by the same
standards as any other candidate for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"That must be on the same tests and no other test as any other
candidate," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook said both Britain and Turkey recognised there was "much
work to be done" over Turkey's application.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey is a country of great strategic importance and
significance to Europe and has been a good friend of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Union froze Turkey's long-standing membership bid
two years ago, citing its poor human rights records and political
standards.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain would also argue for generous economic
support for Turkey after last month's earthquake killed more than
14,000 people and devastated its industrial north-west region.
</P>
<P>
"Looking beyond the crisis, we recognise that there will be a
requirement for longer term economic reconstruction. I will argue
that the European Union is to recognise the new situation in
Turkey and the need for the EU to respond generously and
appropriately with the economic reconstruction for Turkey," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Zhan Xugang Ready for Another Olympic with World Record by sportswriter Zhou Xin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's strongman Zhao Xugang set a new world record at the
current Asian Weightlifting Championships on Thursday to regain
the confidence for his second Olympic gold medal in next year's
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect to break the world record tonight because I
was in low ebb for almost three years since the Atlanta Olympics,"
said the 25-year-old Zhan after receiving a standing ovation from
the local crowd.
</P>
<P>
Zhan successfully jerked 206.0 kilograms for a new world mark
at his third attempt, surpassing the previous record 205.5kg set
by Aranda Idalberto of Cuba at the Pan America Games in Winnipeg,
Canada last month.
</P>
<P>
"The new world record inspire me for another Olympic gold,"
Zhan said.
</P>
<P>
Zhan, from Zhejian Province, who swept three world records for
his Olympic title in the 70kg in Atlanta, had to change his
division into 77kg as the International Weightlifting Federation
introduced new categories in January last year.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champion had built his supremacy in the 77kg and
terrorized his Asian rivals as he won all the three titles at the
Asian Weightlifting Championships and Bangkok Asian Games last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Though I broke three Asian records at Bangkok Asian Games, I
still felt lack for confidence to the new division in front of the
elite weightlifters from European countries," Zhan said.
</P>
<P>
"But now I am confident to beat them at any international
competitions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hanxiong, head coach of the Chinese national team, said:"
We were 60 percent for sure that Zhan would break the jerk world
record, and volatile as he did it."
</P>
<P>
"His victory looms the hope of taking one or two gold medals
for Chinese men's weightlifters at the Sydney Olympic Games next
year," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Increase Health Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A World Health
Organization (WHO) official Thursday called on African countries
to increase their health budgets to cope with the diseases they
face.
</P>
<P>
WHO regional director Ebrahim Samba said at WHO's annual
meeting in Namibian capital Windhoek that the Namibian government
has allocated about 15 percent of its budget to health and that
the other 45 sub-Saharan countries that make up WHO African region
should follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Health budgets of the countries in the region are between six,
seven and eight percent of their respective budgets, South African
Press Association quoted Samba as saying.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the majority of African countries allocated
less than five percent of their budgets to health.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our advocacy to place health at the center of
 development," he added. "No country can develop when the people
are sick."
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa carries among the world's heaviest burdens
of HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the numerous conflicts in the region were also
damaging health, noting that the WHO had for years urged its
members to end conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the 46 countries in the region are involved in some
sort of war, he said.
</P>
<P>
With about nine million refugees, "Africa (has) the highest in
the world. Internally displaced persons -- 30 million -- the
highest in the world," Samba said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that 70 percent of the total land mines in the
world are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The damage to infrastructure, hospitals, buildings, the roads
... is just terrible. In some countries, you will see they have
gone back 30 years in their development," Samba said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference reviewed the region's work against
HIV/AIDS, making health accessible to all, and prioritizing mental
health.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 70 percent of new infections of HIV in the world were
recorded in sub-Saharan Africa.

<HEADLINE> First Virus Found in Arctic Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of the first
virus preserved in the Arctic ice has prompted a warning that warm
weather may release them into the atmosphere to start new
epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The virus, a common plant pathogen known as tomato mosaic
tobamovirus (ToMV), was found deep within the Greenland icepack by
a team of U.S. researchers, Britain's New Scientist magazine
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery suggested that other viruses, such as ancient
strains of flu, polio and smallpox, may also be entombed and could
make a comeback, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the survival rate, or how often they get back
into the environment. But it certainly is possible." Tom Starmer,
one of the researchers from Syracuse University, United States,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Starmer and his colleagues had earlier found ToMV in clouds and
fog. The researchers thought they might find the virus in the ice
because it is widespread, moves in the atmosphere, and is very
stable.
</P>
<P>
So they examined four ice cores, from three sites in Greenland,
containing ice between 500 and 140,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
As they had suspected, the researchers detected RNA from the
tomato pathogen. Further sequencing revealed that 15 strains of
the virus were present.
</P>
<P>
The frozen viruses were probably still infectious because of
strong protein coats which allow them to survive in harsh
environments, the scientists said, warning that they may be
released to cause outbreak of disease as the ice is melting
constantly around the poles.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are planning to use other techniques to find
out if virues are still viable in other cores taken from Antarctic
and Arctic ice.

OTTAWA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada's atomic energy
laboratory will begin testing nuclear fuel derived from U.S. and
Russian warheads by the end of the year, said a Canadian media
report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The initial test is to be applied to 120 grams of mixed oxide
(MOX) fuel at the laboratory of the Atomic Energy of Canada along
Chalk River, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The American fuel will enter Canada by truck at Sault Ste.
Marie in Ontario, while the Russian fuel is to arrive at Cornwall
of the province by ship, the report quoted government sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the fuel is contained in ceramic pellets against
ignition, the government is taking more precautions to ensure
safety, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The test will help determine if it is feasible to use plutonium
as part of the fuel mix in Candu reactors, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday voiced its welcome to rebels' signing of a
ceasefire accord on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the Security
Council for the month of September, Arnold Peter van Walsum, said,
"Council members welcomed the signing of the Lusaka ceasefire
agreement" on the Democratic Republic of Congo by the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD), which took place on August 31 in
Lusaka, capital of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the 15-nation Security Council met in
a closed-door session to hear a briefing on the situation in Congo
(K) by Kieran Prendergast, U.N. under-secretary-general for
political affairs, and Hedi Annabi, assistant secretary-general
for peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
"Council members urged all parties to abide strictly to the
ceasefire agreement and to refrain from any action putting it at
risk, so that peace can become a reality in the DRC," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members reiterated their continuing support for the
involvement of the United Nations in the peace process, in which
the U.N. will cooperate closely with the Organization of African
Unity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Council members welcomed the imminent deployment of the first
group of military liaison officers in accordance with relevant
Security Council resolution, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "commended the efforts by all African
leaders, particularly by the president of the Republic of Zambia,
Frederic Chiluba, to try to resolve the conflict in the DRC
peacefully," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Urges to Protect Environment in Use of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Toepfer, Executive
Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
Thursday urged to protect public health in the use of pesticide
DDT and reduce its pollution to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The director said that his organization believes the DDT is an
effective tool against malaria, which is a mosquito-borne disease
and one of the top killers on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
However, he also encouraged the search of non-chemical
alternatives for DDT and eliminate its pollution and damage to
human health caused in its phaseout.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. senior official expressed his belief that the
humanbeing will find the way to control malaria while safeguarding
both public health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
About 110 countries will participate in the third round of
talks in Geneva to be held next week to establish an international
legally binding treaty to reduce and eliminate persistent organic
pollutants (POPs) including DDT.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the Intergovernmental negotiating
Committee (INC) are the control measures and deadlines for action
on the 12 POPs listed in the mandate from the UNEP Governing
Council.
</P>
<P>
In addition to DDT are the pesticides--aldrin, chlordane,
dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex, and toxaphene; the
industrial chemicals-- polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
hexachlorobenzene, which is also a pesticide; and the unintended
by-products of combustion and industrial processes--dioxins and
furans.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to develop a framework for clear control
measures on POPs -- the so-called dirty dozen," said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
POPs pose a serious risk to public health and the environment.
They  last for a long time, traveling long distances from the
source. They accumulate in living species, becoming increasingly
concentrated and magnified in fatty tissue as they move up the
food chain.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP mandate, which sets a year 2000 deadline for reaching
agreement on a POPs convention, also calls for scientific
criteria and a procedure for identifying additional pollutants as
candidates for international action.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Pessimistic Over N.Irish Peace Pact Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Protestant Ulster Unionists
leader David Trimble warned Thursday that Northern Ireland's peace
process review does not stand much chance of success.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said a major review of the pact, due to start Monday,
faced stalemate because the Irish Republican Army's political
wing, Sinn Fein, had not "declare themselves for the democratic
way."
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, the Sinn Fein leadership are going backwards,"
Trimble said in an interview with the London-based New Statesman
magazine.
</P>
<P>
"I can't see the prospect in the next month or two, which means
that I can't, as things stand at the moment, see any prospect of
the (Mitchell) review succeeding."
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator George Mitchell, who chaired talks that produced
the Good Friday peace accord, will lead the review hoping to end a
logjam over IRA disarmament and creation of a coalition provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
Trimble again criticized a controversial British ruling that
the IRA's ceasefire remains intact, and he warned the IRA may be
gearing up for murder.
</P>
<P>
He said British intelligence agencies had been told that the
IRA "had a shortage of high quality handguns needed for
close-quarter killings. The (IRA's) Belfast Brigade in particular
needed these weapons. This is the word that's coming through....
They're for close-quarter killing."
</P>
<P>
Trimble's party, the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party, and
Sinn Fein are expected to delay until Saturday decisions on
whether they will participate in the review.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Stress at Office Causes "Desk Rage" in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Growing pressures of the
workplace and long working hours are creating a growing phenomenon
of "desk rage" in British offices, said a survey published
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As stress builds to intolerable levels, workers are
increasingly venting their frustration on colleagues, the study by
Britain's ICM Research has found.
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of employees questioned by the ICM study
admitted that they had been upset by rows with colleagues.
</P>
<P>
And a third said that other people's rudeness was a major
source of stress at work, while a fifth blamed "problems with work
colleagues" for making their lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of the 674 adults surveyed said they were
affected by workplace stress, with more than half (56 percent)
saying that it had caused them to lose sleep.
</P>
<P>
ICM's latest study echoed the conclusion of another survey
conducted last month, which found that workplace stress in Britain
is worse that anywhere else in Europe or North America.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings, Sue Keane, of the British
Psychological Society, said that the extent to which disputes with
colleagues or clients were adding to the widely recognized
pressures caused by heavy workloads and tight deadlines.
</P>
<P>
"We have road rage, now we are seeing `desk rage' as conflicts
boil over between colleagues," she said.
</P>
<P>
Keane advised that "just a few minutes out of the office or
workplace at lunchtime could make all the difference."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Slashes 19 on the Ambassadorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian senate Thursday
approved the recommendation of its foreign affairs committee
rejecting 19 of the 106 ambassadorial nominees submitted about
three weeks ago by President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Among those rejected by the 109-member upper house were 11 of
the 44 career ambassadors and 8 among the 62 political nominees.
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons given by the 12-member committee for the
rejection of some of the nominees was the need to reflect federal
character, a constitutional provision requiring the fair
representation of the country's 36 states and the federal capital
in appointments.
</P>
<P>
The senate also approved the recommendations of the committee
for the president to represent names for some of the states whose
nominees were rejected.
</P>
<P>
The nominations were engulfed controversy after it was
submitted by the president about three weeks ago, most of the
criticisms dwelling on the lopsidedness in favor of a few states.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the committee was forced to submit an interim report
 recommending that each state produces three nominees with the
federal capital producing one.

<HEADLINE> S.African President Visits Mozambique on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano held talks with visiting his South African counterpart
Thabo Mbeki here Thursday on economic cooperation between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the meeting, Mozambican Finance
Minister Tomaz Salomao and South African Industry Minister Alec
Irwin said the two sides discussed the Cahora Bassa dam (in the
Mozambique), the building of a gas pipeline from Mozambique to
South Africa, the restructuring of the Maputo port and rail
system, and trans-border national parks.
</P>
<P>
Salomao said this was the third such high level meeting since
mid-1998, and that the discussions "are not from an immediate
perspective but from a long-term one. Our two countries have no
choice other than to cooperate."
</P>
<P>
He said that "progress" had been made over the thorny issue of
Cahora Bassa, but declined to give any details. The main problem
here is a dispute over the price at which Cahora Bassa power
should be sold to the South African electricity company, Eskom.
</P>
<P>
Eskom is insisting on paying no more than the price negotiated
in 1988, which the dam operating company, HCB, over 80 percent of
whose shares are owned by the Portuguese state, says is completely
unrealistic and out of date. HCB wants a 50 percent rise in the
tariff, and has proposed putting the matter to international
arbitration - a move not favoured by the Mozambican government.
</P>
<P>
Salomao claimed that South Africa "supports Mozambique in
discussions over Cahora Bassa." which implies that the two African
governments are in dispute with Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Moved to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chile's life-long senator
Augusto Pinochet was moved Thursday urgently to a London hospital
to undergo medical examination.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson from the Pinochet Foundation said the elderly ex
military man was taken into a British hospital and that his health
was "very delicate".
</P>
<P>
According to recent medical examination, Pinochet is suffering
from prostate gland disorder and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year old Pinochet has remained under arrest in London
since October 1998, by request of Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon,
who wants to try him for violations of human rights during the
military regime.
</P>
<P>
Chile views the Pinochet case as interference in its internal
affairs, attempting to avoid having the aging general go on trial
abroad.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Slide Amid Steep Wall St. Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets slid on
Thursday as robust U.S. economic data rekindled interest rate
fears.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 was confined to the red for all but the
opening moments of trading, with concerns over U.S. interest rates
paramount.
</P>
<P>
The index ended down 80.6 points to 6195.6, as many traders
kept a wide berth of markets ahead of U.S. unemployment figures
due out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Telecom, bank and utility stocks absorbed some of the biggest
shocks. Bank of Scotland plunged 5.68 percent to 728 pence as rate
fears rattled the sensitive financial sector.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Holdings lost 2.67 percent after it said its merger with
Republic New York may take longer to complete because of a probe
into a Republic unit. Lloyds slipped 2.55 percent, Barclays gave
back 2.78 percent, and Abbey National skid 2.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Legal &AMP; General shares rose sharply on the session, sparked by
speculation that it is about to be the subject of a takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
The life assurance group's 10 percent rise came against a
background of a limp UK stock market, depressed by weakness among
the telecom and banking shares.
</P>
<P>
German Dax closed more than 2 percent weaker at 5189.92 points,
weighed down by weaker U.S. shares.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks closed down, dragged lower by the poor performance
of both U.S. and European markets. The Cac 40 closed down 1.8
percent or 82.78 points at 4550.60.

<HEADLINE> China to Host 1999 World Habitat Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- This year's World Habitat Day
with the theme of "Cities for All" will be held in Dalian, a
northern port city in China, on October 4, Acting Executive
Director Klaus Toepfer of the U.N. Centre for Human Settlements
(Habitat) announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other activities in China include Sustainable Cities Program
(SCP) support to China's Wuhan city and disaster mitigation
measures following the Yangtze floods in 1998, Toepfer said at a
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the 1999 World Habitat Day celebrations, a
major conference will be held in Shenyang, the capital of
Liaoning Province in northeast China, starting on October 5, he
said, adding that the conference will be opened by himself.
</P>
<P>
He said China is an active partner in the global Sustainable
Cities Program (SCP), a joint program promoted by the Habitat and
the U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer explained that as a global program, the SCP provides
municipal authorities and their partners in the public, private
and community sectors with improved environment planning and
management capacities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the SCP has promoted the exchange of knowledge
and expertise among cities, undertaking demonstration projects in
some 40 cities worldwide, saying these city demonstrations
involve environment management strategies, action plans and
priority technical cooperation and capital investment projects
for the cites concerned.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Still Concerned With Security in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
continues to be gravely concerned with security conditions in East
Timor, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the violence Wednesday, the situation is relatively quiet
in Dili, the capital, but the new wave of violence is reaching
other areas of the territory, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
At least two East Timorese were killed Wednesday near the
compound of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
which conducted a ballot on the future of the half-island on
August 30.
</P>
<P>
In a fresh wave of riots, two U.N. local staffers were killed
Thursday in Maliana, some 140 kilometers west of Dili, Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
The ballot, agreed upon by Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N. on
May 5, is to determine whether the majority of the 800,000 people
in the former Portuguese colony want to stay within Indonesia with
special autonomy or to go independent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia occupied East Timor in 1975 and made it a province
the following year after Portugal's withdrawal. However the U.N.
has since called it a non-self-governing territory.
</P>
<P>
Monday's ballot saw a 98.6 percent of voter turnout and a calm
atmosphere, but violent activities followed amid speculation of
the vote in favor of the pro-independence movement. The ballot
result is expected to be announced early next week.
</P>
<P>
Security in East Timor can be restored "only by preventing
armed groups from continuing to move around and terrorize others,"
U.N. Secretary-General's special representative Ian Martin was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Martin called on the leaders of the anti-independence forces
and the Indonesian police and army "to fulfill their respective
commitments" by ordering their members not to move around with
weapons, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
News from Lisbon and Jakarta indicated that U.N. peace-keeping
efforts in East Timor are welcome, but Eckhard said there was no
contingency planning for sending peace-keeping forces there.

MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to maintain the
best of relations with all the countries of the Caucasus --
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Thursday.

Moscow does not give preference to any of them, Ivanov said in

Russia "is taking very seriously criticism of its Caucasus

Aliyev expressed "surprise and disappointment that the Caucasus
holds a secondary role in Russian foreign policy," adding that the
Caucasus is no less a strategic part of the world than the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
On Russian-Armenian military cooperation Ivanov said that
Moscow "understands perfectly well how sensitive the subject is
for Azerbaijan and the entire region."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wheat Group Urges Clinton to Give Iran Farm Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Groups representing U.S.
wheat farmers Thursday urged the Clinton administration to extend
export credits to Iran to boost agricultural sales.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Bill Clinton, the National Association
of Wheat Growers and the Wheat Export Trade Education Committee
said the administration's decision in April to lift sanctions on
food sales to Iran was not enough.
</P>
<P>
"Export financing, especially in this case, shows our
competitors that the United States is a serious contender in the
world market," the two groups said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"Lifting sanctions without access to all of the tools that make
U.S. products competitive against monopolistic and subsidized
traders does nothing for U.S. producers," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
In April, the United States announced it would exempt food,
medicine and medical equipment from economic sanctions on Iran,
Sudan and Libya. But lawmakers and farm groups have criticized the
Clinton administration for failing to offer Iran, a potential big
buyer, credit to buy U.S. farm goods.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iran bypassed the U.S. market and bought more than
1 million metric tons of wheat from Canada. U.S. exporters have
sold a mere 50,000 metric tons of corn to Iran since the new
regulations were issued, according to the U.S. Agriculture
Department.

NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
Thursday as fears of higher interest rates spread the market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 94.67 at
10,843.21. The blue chip index fell as much as 205 points during
the trading.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 11.96 at 1,319.11 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 16.56 at 2,734.24.
</P>
<P>
Fears about higher interest rates sparked after the Labor
Department reported that the growth of American workers'
productivity slowed considerably in the second quarter while labor
costs jumped sharply.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that if new
data suggest that the pace of labor cost and price increases will
be picking up, the Federal Reserve will have to act promptly and
forcefully to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Those fears escalated as Federal Reserve Governor Edward Kelley
told Market News International Thursday that it would be premature
to assume the Federal Reserve will wait until next year to raise
rates again. The Federal Reserve raised rates twice in the past
two months in a bid to preempt inflation from the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
A dismal earnings outlook from Sears and other retailers also
helped to push stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.96 at 611.33 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 3.98 at 779.21. The Russell 2000 index of

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Goes to Hospital For Routine Medical Check: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet was taken to hospital Thursday for a routine medical
check, police in charge of his house-arrest said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who was arrested in a London hospital last October
while recovering from back surgery, had been taken to hospital for
checks a week ago.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested because a Spanish judge accused him of
responsibility for the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people
and requested his extradition to Spain to face charges.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish judge wants to try him for the human rights abuses
alleged to be committed during his 1973-1990 rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Britain is scheduled to begin the extradition proceedings from
September 27.
</P>
<P>
On Pinochet's increasingly frequent visits to the doctor for
medical checks, he is accompanied by police.
</P>
<P>
The retired general's supporters said recently they fear the
83-year-old man is not well enough to face forthcoming court
hearings in Britain and possible trial in Spain.
</P>
<P>
His health problems are said to include depression as well as
diabetes and a weak heart.

JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense
Minister/Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto hinted here Friday that
the result of the August 30 autonomy ballot in East Timor could be
made public on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister Ali Alatas informed me of the announcement
schedule through phone talks," Wiranto told newsmen at the
Parliament Building.
</P>
<P>
He said the military is preparing two battalions of troops to
safeguard the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The two battalions of troops aboard Air Force airplanes will
depart for East Timor to reinforce the police contingent assigned
to safeguard the ballot announcement, he added.
</P>
<P>
According the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
which organized the ballot, more than 98 percent of the total
450,000 registered voters cast their votes during the polling day
in or outside East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot will decide whether East Timor will enjoy a
wide-ranging autonomy under Indonesia or get independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal decided to hold a direct ballot for the
future of the territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Buckingham Palace declined
to comment on Friday on the long-awaited French report on the car
crash that killed Princess Diana two years ago.

A spokeswoman for Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, who accused
the media of hounding her to death, is planning to make a
statement later on the French decision to drop manslaughter
charges against nine photographers and a motorcyclist in the 1997
crash.

<HEADLINE> Riot in E. Timor Kills two People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Two persons were killed and
four houses were set on fire during a riot between the
pro-integration and pro-independence groups in East Timor on
Thursday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The incident, the second one after the August 30 autonomy
ballot in East Timor, took place in Maliana subdistrict, Bobonaro
district, Antara News Agency quoted police as saying Friday in
Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The riot started on 5:30 p.m. local time and was contained at
about 7:00 p.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
The police are still trying to identify the culprits of the
riot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Batuahi Hill, Camea village in east Dili, a
customary house was set ablaze by the pro-independence group on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered the wrath of pro-integrationists, who
then burned down ten houses owned by pro-independence supporters,
police said.
</P>
<P>
However, no report has been received on the number of persons
injured or killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, at least two persons were killed and three others
injured in a violence targeted at the U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET).
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Defense Minister/Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto
hinted here Friday that the result of the August 30 autonomy
ballot in East Timor could be made public on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say where the announcement will be made.
Earlier, U.N. officials said the announcement will be made in New
York. Some reports said the announcement will be made
simultaneously in New York and Dili.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said the military is preparing two battalions of troops
to safeguard the announcement.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNAMET which organized the ballot, more than
98 percent of the total 450,000 registered voters cast their votes
during the polling day in or outside East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot will decide whether East Timor will enjoy a
wide-ranging autonomy under Indonesia or get independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give a wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal decided to hold a direct ballot for the
future of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Urges to Shun Food Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has said that it is absurd for Kenyans to import foodstuff
which could be produced in abundance locally.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Thursday when opening the
Mombasa Show sponsored by the Agricultural Society of Kenya in
Coast Province in east Kenya, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that it was ridiculous for the country to import farm
produces such as eggs which local poultry farmers can easily
produce, and called on relevant government departments to rectify
this anomaly for the benefits of local farmers.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kenya are importing such farm produces as
eggs and fruits from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that the agriculture sector remained
to be the backbone of the country's economic growth, which not
only provides food requirements but also creates employment for
the majority of rural folks.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the country would continue to experience high
food demand throughout the next century due to rapid population
growth.
</P>
<P>
He urged agricultural and livestock officials to advise farmers
on which crop to grow and which animals to keep, taking advantage
of the soil and climate conditions of the farmers' localities.
</P>
<P>
Sound management and appropriate farming methods will bring the
 potential into full play for substantial growth in the
agriculture sector, the president added.

<HEADLINE> China's "Power Tiger" Bows to Market Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ertan Hydro-Power Station
in southwest Chin's Guizhou Province went on line in August last
year and this was hailed as the largest of its kind built in China
this century.
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, general manager Liu Junfeng of the station
has become increasingly anxious as it has been very difficult to
sell his product.
</P>
<P>
With four of the six generators installed and operating so far,
Ertan is capable of generating 10 billion kwh of electricity a
year, but to date Liu has only signed 6.4 billion kwh in contracts.
</P>
<P>
"That means a loss of at least one billion yuan for this year,"
he said. In the coming years, it will be an even tougher job for
Liu's salesmen when the station installs the last two generators
which will add seven billion kwh more to Ertan's power output.
</P>
<P>
China's power industry, which has been under the State monopoly
for decades, used to be nicknamed "Power Tiger" by the people
because it could act as it pleased, regardless of requirements or
complaints from customers.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese remember the days when the "Tiger" was dominant.
Unexpected and frequent stoppages of the power supply often caused
a large amount of waste for factories and damaged electric
appliances in homes.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as many large power plants have come on line,
formerly strutting power producers have had to face an
increasingly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
The current economic restructuring, especially in the State
sector, has allowed local companies to enjoy greater autonomy over
their internal affairs, including the right to choose their own
power suppliers, by a consideration of price and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, differing economic strengths among localities are
another factor.
</P>
<P>
In the developed coastal province of Guangdong in south China,
power stations are working all-out to meet the demands by local
industries that are the main beneficiary of the country's reform
and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
But in underdeveloped areas such as Sichuan Province in the
southwest, local hydro-power electric plants may lose as much as
13.8 billion yuan this year, due to the sluggish market.

</P>

shot early in the morning when he was in plantations facing the
worshiping site. The clergyman died on his way to hospital.

<HEADLINE> EDS-National Day Special Urbanites In China Living More Comfortable Lives (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year is
the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. The past
five decades of achievements in the economy have attracted the
attention of the rest of the world. Xinhua started a series of
stories on the nation's economy on August 17. This is the 14th.
</P>
<P>
The Statistics Bureau reports that, by United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) standards, China's urban dwellers
are leading comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
By FAO standards, an Engel coefficient (based on the percentage
of income spent on food) above 60 percent means a poor life, 60 to
50 percent means a life without food worries, 50 to 40 percent
means a comfortable life, and below 40 percent a rich life. China'
s dropped to 45 percent in 1998 for urban families.
</P>
<P>
Living a more comfortable life has been the dream of ordinary
Chinese for generations, but they have been visited by nightmare
all through this century, with starvation and death becoming a
part of people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
In 1948, a quarter of Beijing's residents, 250,000 people, were
struggling with poverty.

<HEADLINE> China's "Power Tiger" Bows to Market Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, China became the third-largest power producer in the
world, generating a total of 1.160 trillion kwh of electricity,
and the country's hydraulic power sector is now world's largest,
followed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yan, general manager of the State Power Company, attributes
the power surplus to the rapid expansion of the power industry,
and this new situation has produced many new problems for the
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic and foreign experts point out that the present
difficulty in selling electricity is not a result of oversupply,
but rather an indication of low consumption.
</P>
<P>
In China, the average monthly consumption of electricity for
urban families is 100 to 200 kwh, only one-tenth of the average of
urbanites in developed nations.
</P>
<P>
To cope with this situation, governments at all levels have
worked out many favorable polices to encourage customers to
increase electricity consumption.
</P>
<P>
Many urbanites have found they no long need to hesitate on
whether or not to use high energy-consuming appliances such as
electric oven and irons. The former policy of extra charges for
over-consumption has been replaced with "the more electricity you
use, the cheaper the prices become."
</P>
<P>
For decades, rural people had to pay their electricity bills at
rates much higher than their urban counterparts because, it was
said, the farmers should pay for the building costs. No one had
ever explained why the State only paid the building cost for urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, however, villagers are glad to see that the price of
power has been cut to an level equivalent to that enjoyed by city
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
The constant development of the power industry has also been
placed on the top of the central government's agenda. While
efforts are being made to shut down small power stations with
generating capacities of 50,000 kw and below, the plans to build
more large power plants, mainly hydraulic ones, have never been
put aside.
</P>
<P>
The central government continues to restructure the power
industry by separating the management of power stations and power-
supply networks to lay a foundation for the future formation of a
unified, national network.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Eyes Investment From APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada is determined to win investments for the country during
his upcoming trip to New Zealand for the informal leadership
conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a top
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the president wants to
give the Philippine economy a much-needed boost with his APEC
stint, as well as his visit to Latin America following the
conference.
</P>
<P>
"The president will leave by the end of the week for Auckland
to attend the APEC summit and proceed to Chile and Argentina,"
Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Estrada said he hopes to attract much-needed
foreign investments that will spur economic growth and create jobs
for people.
</P>
<P>
The president said he would seek investments during his
meetings with leaders of other APEC economies, which include the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We will seek help during the APEC summit to revitalize
business and the economy," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Following his attendance at APEC's informal leadership
conference in New Zealand, Estrada will proceed to Latin America
for state visits in Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
In his first APEC stint as president in 1998 in Malaysia,
Estrada was designated as spokesman for the poor members of APEC.
</P>
<P>
Upon his initiative, the 20 other leaders of APEC economies
agreed to adopt social safety nets to help poorer nations cope
with the Asian economies crisis.
</P>
<P>
More affluent countries such as the United States and Japan
also started their own initiatives to extend financial assistance
to countries hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Among these initiatives are the 30-billion-U.S.-dollar Miyazawa
package for hard-hit economies, and the 10-billion-dollar joint
initiative by the United States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Recall Parliament for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A state of emergency has
been declared in Botswana for recalling parliament to allow 60,000
more voters to participate in the general elections, South
Africa's Business Day newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament was dissolved in July before the elections
scheduled for October 16 begin.
</P>
<P>
President Festus Mogae announced Thursday that he was declaring
the emergency for the sole purpose of being able to recall the
parliament in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Act could then be amended to permit the
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to complete its work.
</P>
<P>
The 60,000 voters, who had registered during a supplementary
registration exercise, were not included in the voters' roll.
</P>
<P>
Legal problems arose last week when the president issued a writ
for the elections to be held on October 16. At that time, new
certified voters' rolls had not been completed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, opposition parties called for the
resignation of senior IEC staff following the disqualification of
the 60,000 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has accused the government of incompetence in
preparing for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has a population of 1.5 million, of which 900,000 are
eligible for the election. Some 460,000, or 51 percent, of the
eligible voters have registered.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense
Minister/Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto hinted here Friday that
the result of the August 30 autonomy ballot in East Timor could be
made public on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister Ali Alatas informed me of the announcement
schedule through phone talks," Wiranto told newsmen at the
Parliament Building.
</P>
<P>
He said the military is preparing two battalions of troops to
safeguard the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The two battalions of troops aboard Air Force airplanes will
depart for East Timor to reinforce the police contingent assigned
to safeguard the ballot announcement, he added.
</P>
<P>
According the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
which organized the ballot, more than 98 percent of the total
450,000 registered voters cast their votes during the polling day
in or outside East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot will decide whether East Timor will enjoy a
wide-ranging autonomy under Indonesia or get independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-running autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal decided to hold a direct ballot for the
future of the territory.

Now, the symbol of wealth is the telephone, mobile phone, air-

By 1998, there were 105 color TVs for every 100 urban families,
91 washing machines, 76 refrigerators, 76 telephones, 20 air-
conditioners, 4 computers and 0.25 cars.
</P>
<P>
Urban housing has improved remarkably over the past two decades.
In 1981, only 14 percent of urban families had more than 8 square
meters of living space for each member. The figure rose to 48
percent in 1988 and to 77 percent in 1998. In 1981, as much as 37
percent of urban families did not have their own house, or had
less than 4 square meters of living space for each member. The
figure now only 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the figure that speaks the loudest is that of bank
deposits. In 1952, individual bank deposits amounted to only 900
million yuan. That figure began to increase at an incredible rate
after 1978, when it was 21 billion yuan to 233.8 billion yuan by
1986. By the end of 1998, Chinese banks held 5.34 trillion yuan in
individual deposits, a 254-fold increase from 1978.

reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
They were identified as Natasha Wright and Mark Alexander

Richard Samuels, 27.
</P>

August 28, following a search of three apartments where they were
staying.

The five admitted to buying the drugs from a dealer in Ayia
Napa.
</P>
<P>
Drug squad officers are trying to track down a narcotics gang
who they believe supply illegal substances to British tourists in
Ayia Napa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Buys 19 Billion Yuan in T-Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Construction Bank of China
announced here today that it would buy 19 billion yuan of the 60
billion yuan supplementary treasury bonds newly issued by the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it has already paid for 60 percent of the bonds,
while the remaining 40 percent would be paid for by September 8.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress approved the issue of a 60
billion yuan supplementary treasury bonds recently, in a bid to
further stimulate domestic consumption and investment.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the bonds are expected to be spent on ongoing
infrastructure projects, technical upgrading projects in major
industrial sectors, environmental protection projects, and
increasing pensions and the salary of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Among China's four major state-owned commercial banks, the
Construction Bank is the second largest investor in the said
treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Its officials said the 10 year term bonds are a safe investment
and would help the bank improve its structure of financial assets,
as it is the first time a floating interest rate has been applied
to treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
As the 60 billion yuan bonds would require 254 billion yuan in
supporting bank loans, the bank said it would increase its
investment to related industrial sectors in recognition of the
government policy.
</P>
<P>
They disclosed that the Construction Bank is reviewing 1,000 or
more projects recommended by the government and has already
pledged to lend 5.5 billion yuan to the chosen projects.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also reviewing more than 100 other projects of its
choice and has signed preliminary lending agreements with them.

<HEADLINE> Amnesty in Danger Due to Gangs: Turkish Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister
Hikmet Sami Turk has said the new amnesty bill passed by the
parliament is likely to benefit gangs in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel rejected the
amnesty law, which had he approved it, would have freed almost
half of the country's convicts.
</P>
<P>
The president's rejection was in response to the public outcry
over the law, which would have put hundreds of killers and mafia
leaders back on the streets once it was legislated.
</P>
<P>
Demirel has sent the bill back to the parliament, asking
legislators to make revisions that take "justice, rules of
equality and public conscience" into account.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Turkish Prime Minister Develet Bahceli has said it is
natural for the president to listen to the public opinion and
veto the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
"But we wish he had to listen to the government as well, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Demirel Thursday approved a bill that offers
conditional pardon for journalists and writers who have been
jailed for expressing their views.
</P>
<P>
Judicial officials said that at least 50 journalists and
writers will benefit from the conditional pardon.
</P>
<P>
The president also approved another law that pardons civil
servants who have violated the discipline codes.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
is ready to provide aid for South Africa's neighbors to shield
them from the adverse impact of the EU-South African free trade
deal, a visiting EU trade official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Philip Lowe, director-general for development in the
EU, said the promised financial support, in the form of budgetary
support, was not compensation, Business Day reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A study by the South African Foundation has estimated that the
scrapping of tariffs on EU imports could shave as much as 3.5
billion rand (574 million U.S. dollars) off government revenues
for South Africa's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Southern African Customs Union partners --
Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland -- depend heavily on
their large share of the pooled revenue from tariffs on European
goods.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho and Swaziland each derive over 40 percent of their
total government revenue from the pool.
</P>
<P>
The EU-South African free trade deal is expected to be
implemented in January next year. The deal promises to free as
much as 90 percent of bilateral trade in 12 years.

NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Police in Kenya's capital
Nairobi have arrested more than 600 suspected illegal aliens,
recovering two pistols and some assorted pieces of communications
equipment in a night swoop.
</P>
<P>
The operation which began shortly before midnight Wednesday and
went on till Thursday morning was conducted by a 1,000-strong
force, including officers from the paramilitary general service

<HEADLINE> Rapid Increase of Breast Cancer Incidence in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of breast
cancer in Asia, though lower than in Europe and America, is
apparently increasing rapidly, epidemiologists told an on-going
international cancer seminar in Tianjin today.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 specialists and scholars from 14 countries and
regions are attending the second Asian Seminar on Breast Cancer in
this port city in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The specialists attribute the rise to the overall improvement
of living standards in Asia over recent years.
</P>
<P>
In China, the growth rate of such cancer in the ten major
cities has averaged 37 percent, according to the epidemiologist
with Shanghai experiencing the highest figures of 26.5 cases per
100,000 women, followed by Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts say that some 1.2 million women around the
world suffer from breast cancer, a common disease among women, and
500,000 of them will die from it every year. Growth rates around
the world vary between 5 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Epidemiologists note that physical factors, biological
conditions, the environment, and intake of protein, may all
attribute to the increase. And they believe that a longer
menstrual period, first births over 35 years of age and short
breast feeding periods are the most probable causes.
</P>
<P>
Increased intakes of high fat, low fiber food, but little fruit
and vegetables in the daily diet may also lead to the disease.
</P>
<P>
They say that making more information about the disease widely
known, recommending a more practical diet, breast feeding, and a
healthier life style will play an important role in preventing and
controlling the disease.

<HEADLINE> Missile Experts Refute Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese missile specialists
have pledged to speed up the development of missiles to enhance
China's national defense capabilities in a bid to maintain the
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
They said that they resolutely support the Chinese Communist
Party general secretary Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal of
developing the cross-strait relations and promoting the process of
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
These specialists expressed their pledge at a recent meeting
here to refute Lee Teng-hui's "two-state" splittist remarks.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the China Aerospace Machinery and Electronics
Corporation (CAMEC), a missile manufacturer, said that Lee Teng-
hui has underestimated the military strength of the Chinese People
's Liberation Army (PLA) and of the special position and capacity
of missiles in the national defense.
</P>
<P>
The CAMEC said it has developed several dozens of models of
missiles such as strategic, tactical, ground-to-ground, ground-to-
sea and ground-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
It said that it has made some breakthroughs in missile
manufacturing technology in accelerating the development and
manufacturing of a new generation of missiles.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts missiles of various altitudes, ranges and
speeds, it said, adding that they may strike at any targets with
precision.
</P>
<P>
They said Lee Teng-hui openly opposes the "one China" principle
and attempts to separate Taiwan from China, ignoring Taiwan
compatriots' desire for peace, stability, development, and
mutually beneficial cooperation and exchanges between both sides
of the Taiwan strait.
</P>
<P>
This, they pointed out, has seriously undermined the cross-
strait relations and basic interests of the compatriots on both
sides of the Taiwan strait, resulting in a tense situation across
the strait.
</P>
<P>
The world has but one China and Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China and the Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity
brook no separation, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the Taiwan issue cannot be delayed
indefinitely and the Chinese people will never allow Lee Teng-hui
to realize his evil plot.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets With Uruguayan Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao met with visiting Uruguayan Minister of National Defense
Juan Luis Storace and his party here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Uruguayan relationships have developed smoothly since the
two countries forged diplomatic ties, with an increasing high
level exchange of visits growing along with cooperation in various
fields," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation to Uruguay for its adherence to
the "One-China" policy, and said China attaches importance to
developing friendship and cooperative ties with Uruguay and hopes
that both sides work together to further promote the military ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Taiwan issue, Hu noted that the essence of the
"two-states" remarks by Lee Teng-hui is to negate the principle of
"One China" and to separate Taiwan from China, which will
certainly be firmly opposed and strongly condemned by the Chinese
government and all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"It is the common aspiration of the entire Chinese nation to
develop the relationship across the Taiwan Strait and to advance
the country's reunification cause," said Hu. Anyone attempting to
obstruct this historical trend will do so in vain.
</P>
<P>
Storace reiterated that Uruguay will unswervingly keep to the "
One-China" policy, and it will, as always, support China's
peaceful reunification cause. "Uruguay will continue to enhance
its friendship and cooperative relations with China," he said.

<HEADLINE> Number of China's Private Firms Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of private
enterprises in China had reached 1.28 million by June this year,
80,000 more than at end of last year, the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of people working in the sector hit 17.84 million,
up 22.4 percent from the corresponding period last year, and total
registered capital amounted to 817.7 billion yuan, up 24.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period, the economic returns of these
private firms improved remarkably. They registered an industrial
value of 370.5 billion yuan, a sales income of 350.5 billion yuan
and an export revenue of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration pointed out that the rapid
growth of Chinese private firms helped alleviate the pressure on
the country's current employment problems and helped 720,000
workless find new jobs in the six months under review.
</P>
<P>
The number of limited companies increased by a big margin
during the same period, and now accounts for more than 50 percent
of all private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this positive change mainly to the successful
switch by a number of state-owned enterprises to the private
sector, with company operators gradually introducing modern
techniques to streamline management.

<HEADLINE> Prosperity Returns to Ancient Silk Road (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Parts of the remote ancient
Silk Road are once again echoing to the bustle and buzz of
business as trade and commerce have returned with a vengeance to
Urumqi, one of the gateways linking the East and the West.
</P>
<P>
This week an estimated 10,000 business people from home and
abroad are attending the ongoing Eighth Urumqi Economic and Trade
Fair in this capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The event, one of the six major regional fairs in China, was
established in the wake of a state strategy to make the border
areas of the country prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 years ago, Xinjiang was a crucial section of the
Silk Road,an economic route linking China with central Asia and
Europe in the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Its importance waned after
sea routes flourished and the environment along the Silk Road
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, though remaining an underdeveloped area in China,
this remote region is enjoying an increasing popularity among
investors because of its abundant natural resources and
attractive investment conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Jun, a research fellow at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, Xinjiang is rich in land resources,
petroleum and cotton. Both domestic and foreign investors are
confident that Xinjiang is attractive because of its improving
infrastructure and a series of preferential policies from the
local government.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, the largest region of ethnic groups in China, shares
a border with eight countries. Currently, 15 posts and 60 counties
are open to the outside world, and two economic development zones
and three border cooperation zones authorized by the central
government with greater powers to trade with countries across the
border have been established.

"Xinjiang has now become a huge cotton market as well as an
important center for grain, livestock and sugar, due to the
efforts since the 1990s of revitalizing this western area of the
country," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
A modernized industrial system featuring petrochemicals,
building materials, textiles and the food processing industry is
also taking shape in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
So far, 32,000 kilometers of highways, 2,000 km of railways and
14 airports have formed a modern transportation system for this
remote region, shortening the distance between Xinjiang and the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The region is also rebuilding the highways around the Tarim and
the Junggar basins following the completion of 44 roads leading to
foreign countries. And the extension project for the South
Xinjiang Railway line going westward to Kashi will be completed at
the end of this year. Consequently, the Tarim Basin will be no
longer isolated, which will facilitate the exploitation of
petroleum and cotton production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kashi International Airport, which is the most
important aviation port in Northwest China, is being expanded.
</P>
<P>
An advanced telecommunications network will also help Xinjiang
to become more well-known to the outside. Using the longest inland
communication optical fiber cable in the world, the network will
link the cities of Xi'an, Lanzhou, Urumqi and Yili, all in
northwest China, with developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this improvement in communications, and a better
investment environment, Xinjiang is being transformed into a busy
commercial hub in the western regions of China.
</P>
<P>
The border trade volume alone had rocketed from 320 million US
dollars in 1992 to 870 million US dollars last year, an annual
growth rate of 42 percent. Xinjiang is now the second largest
region in terms of border trade turnover in China.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 400 foreign funded enterprises have been set up in
the region, with actual investment of 2.2 billion US dollars.
Similarly, over 1,000 projects with investment totalling 7.8
billion yuan from other parts of China have been set up.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Vaccine Trials to Start Next Year in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The first preliminary trials
for a new AIDS vaccine developed by British and Kenyan scientists
are due to start early next year among volunteers in Oxford,
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Following tests on primates, which saw 70 percent of the
animals turning HIV-resistant, scientists believe that a
preliminary stage of trial on humans is now ready to begin,
Friday's Daily Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the vaccine is likely to stimulate the key
"killer T- cells" in human body so as to hold the virus at bay.
</P>
<P>
The research team has promised that if the trials are
successful, the AIDS vaccine will be available to Kenyans at
prices which even the poor can afford.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still likely to be some years before the trials
are completed.
</P>
<P>
While there are around 25 kinds of AIDS vaccines being
developed worldwide, the research in Kenya and Britain is one of
the few to involve a combination of DNA research with a more
conventional approach based on the vaccine used to immunize
against smallpox.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Andrew McMichael of Oxford announced that a group
of Nairobi prostitutes had demonstrated HIV-resistance after
using the vaccine.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Symposium on Trade Unions Cooperation Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A week-long international
symposium on the work of trade unions in the period of transition
to the market economy opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is co-sponsored by the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU) and a visiting delegation from the General
Confederation of Trade Unions (GCTU) which consists of some member
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
It aims at probing ways to safeguard the rights and interests
of the workers and to increase mutual understanding and trade
union cooperation between China and CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junjiu, vice president and first secretary of the
Secretariat of the ACFTU, said at the opening ceremony that the
celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China and the return of Macao are imminent,
and so this trade unions gathering is significant.
</P>
<P>
He said that although China and the CIS countries have
different domestic situations, their trade unions face similar
problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the Chinese trade unions hope to strengthen their
cooperation with all the trade unions of the world, including
those of the CIS countries, so as to contribute to the
establishment of a new international trade unions order".
</P>
<P>
Scherbakov Vladimir, head of the GCTU delegation, said that
even though there is a border between China and the CIS countries,
their existing traditional friendship has further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"The exchanges between the trade unions will further promote
such friendship and cooperation between China and the CIS
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, the representatives of the ACFTU will
brief the guests on the work of the Chinese trade unions, and the
CIS visitors will deliver speeches on their respective trade
unions and the current political and economic situation in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
The CIS visitors are here at the invitation of the ACFTU.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Expand Cooperation With UNDP: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to continue and
expand its cooperation with the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) in many areas, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shi said in a speech at a seminar marking the 20th anniversary
of the cooperation between China and the UNDP that there are many
areas in which China can continue to cooperate with the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
China needs to go on raising the income of farmers and resolve
the problem of poverty in the rural areas. Out of its 1.2 billion
population, 900 million live in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
"China is striving to build a socialist market economy and a
country ruled by law. It is also carrying out more reforms and
trying to help improve the technical standards and management
style of small and medium-sized companies," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, China needs to do a lot more in the development
of bilateral trade and economic cooperation with the developing
countries," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we can continue to keep and expand cooperation
with other countries and relevant international bodies like the
UNDP," added Shi.
</P>
<P>
He described the cooperation between China and the UNDP over
the past 20 years as "effective" and "fruitful." More than 840
cooperation projects have been successfully carried out in China,
with a total contribution of approximately 500 million US dollars
from the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Those projects cover agriculture, industry, energy,
transportation, telecommunications, education, health care finance,
taxation, social security, poverty alleviation, the development of
women, economic structural reform and utilization of overseas
capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since China restored its seat at the United Nations in 1971, it
has actively made contributions to the development programs of the
UN. But it refused to take contributions from the UNDP, even after
the deadly earthquake in Tangshan, northern China's Hebei Province,
one of the worst in history, that killed 240,000 people.
</P>
<P>
China's refusal to accept such aid continued until it adopted
the reform and opening policy in 1978. "In September 1979, the
UNDP established its Beijing representative office, marking the
beginning of a new phase of cooperation," according to the Shi.
</P>
<P>
"This effective cooperation has helped expand relations between
China and international organizations on a mutually beneficial
basis, introduced new technology and trained specialized
professionals for China," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"With limited capital, the UNDP has played a unique role in the
reform and opening drive and economic construction of a country
that has a vast territory and a huge population," he said. "This
fully demonstrates that the UNDP's assistance is effective."
</P>
<P>
Nay Htun, assistant Administrator of the UNDP, said, "The
cooperation between the UNDP and China is excellent and has
produced some very important results as it was built on mutual
trust."
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and visiting UNDP Administrator Mark Brown, the two sides agreed
to continue to work and be focused on poverty elimination,
environmental protection, to bring in new knowledge, new
technology and new management approaches, according to Kerstin
Leitner, resident representative of the UNDP in China.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
In January 1980, a general election to the House of the People
was held. The Indian National Congress received 42.7 percent of
the total votes and won an overwhelming majority (352) of the
elective seats. Indira Gandhi was reinstated as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 and 1984, disturbances occurred in Jammu and Kashmir
during local elections.
</P>
<P>
In October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by militant
Sikh members of her personal guards. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, was
immediately sworn in as prime minister. The widespread communal
violence that erupted throughout India, resulting in more than
2,000 deaths, was curbed by the prompt action of the government.
</P>
<P>
In the January 1985 election polling, the Indian National
Congress received 49.2 percent of the total votes and won 403 of
the 513 contested seats.
</P>
<P>
In February 1986, there were mass demonstrations and strikes
throughout India in protest against the government-imposed
increases of the prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
In June 1986, Laldenga, the leader of the Mizo National Front
(MNF), signed a peace agreement with Rajiv Gandhi, thus ending
Mizoram's 25 years of rebellion.
</P>
<P>
During 1987, the Indian National Congress experienced serious
political setbacks. It sustained defeats in a number of state
elections, and political tensions were intensified by an open
dispute between the prime minister and the outgoing president,
Giani Zail Singh.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a more confrontational style was adopted by the
central administration towards non-Indian National Congress state
governments, and presidential rule was imposed in states suffering
political instability.
</P>
<P>
In November 1989, the Indian National Congress lost its overall
majority (193 of the 525) in the general election to the House of
the People. On December 2, after the National Front promised the
support of the communist parties and the BJP, V.P. Singh was sworn
in as the new prime minister.

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
In November 1990, one of the prime minister's leading rivals in
the Janata Dal, Chandra Shekhar, formed his own dissident faction,
known as the Janata Dal (Socialist) or Janata Dal (S) (which
merged with the Janata party in April 1991 to become the Samajwadi
Party). And he was sworn in as prime minister on November 10,
1990.
</P>
<P>
On May 21, 1991, after the first day of the general election,
Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. The remaining election was
postponed until mid-June. The final result gave Indian National
Congress 227 of the 511 seats contested, the BJP won 119 seats.
</P>
<P>
On January 16, 1993, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's
59-member Cabinet resigned to make for a new set of ministers to
help deal with the religious crisis (at least 70 more people there
died in Muslim-Hindu clashes).
</P>
<P>
On December 22, 1994, the health minister, the food minister
and a junior development minister resigned from their posts after
being accused of official corruption (participating in commodities
and stock market scams).
</P>
<P>
On October 28, 1995, President Shankar Dayal Sharma dissolved
the Uttar Pradesh State legislature on the recommendation of Prime
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and imposed federal rule. The
Legislature's dismissal was to keep the BJP from forming a new
government ahead of the elections and establishing a political
grip there.

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
In late April and early May 1996, a general election was held.
The largest party in terms of seats was the BJP, which won 160
seats. While the Indian National Congress gained 136 seats, the
National Front and Left Front together obtained 179 seats.
</P>
<P>
On May 15, President Shankar Dayal Sharma appointed Atal Bihari
Vajpayee as prime minister to form a new government, which
resigned ahead of a parliamentary confidence vote that was
virtually certain to be negative on May 28.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, the new United Front coalition government of Prime
Minister Deve Gowda, appointed by the president on May 28, won a
vote of confidence in the Parliament, ending a period of
administrative paralysis since the May election.
</P>
<P>
On July 25, 1997, Kocheril Raman Narayanan, a member of
Hinduism's lowest caste, was sworn in as president. He earned
about 95 percent of the 5,000 votes on July 14.
</P>
<P>
On December 2, President Narayanan dissolved the Parliament and
announced the parliamentary election would be held in February
1998.
</P>
<P>
From February 16, 1998, India started its general elections and
after three phases of polling on February 16, 22, and 28, the
election process in most of the country's 545 constituencies had
been virtually concluded on March 7. The Bharatiya Janata party
(BJP) and the Indian National Congress, the two major national
political parties, got 182 and 141 of 545 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, Sonia Gandhi, new president of the Congress Party,
was unanimously elected chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary
Party.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the BJP was sworn
in as Indian prime minister at the head of a two-tied 43-member
coalition which included a number of new faces.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1999, the BJP-led government resigned immediately
after losing the vote of confidence by 269 to 270 in the House of
the People. President Narayanan asked Prime Minister Vajpayee to
continue as caretaker till alternative arrangements were made.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, India's caretaker cabinet headed by Vajpayee
decided to recommend to President Narayanan to dissolve the lower
house of parliament as no political party and its allies could be
able to provide a stable majority government.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Sets Deadline for Troop Deployment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has set
October 31 as the deadline for a bill regulating its troop
deployment, especially outside the country, the New Vision
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to State Minister of Defense Steven
Kavuma Thursday, Prime Minister Apollo Nsibambi asked him to
prepare the bill under the Constitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that some MPs demanded such a bill for
consideration when President Yoweri Museveni addressed the
Parliament on the issue of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) on August 30.
</P>
<P>
Nsibambi considered the bill as an urgent matter following the
recent controversy over Ugandan troops deployed in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Under article 210 of Uganda's Constitution, Parliament shall
make laws regulating the Uganda People's Defense Forces, in
particular its deployment of troops outside the country.
</P>
<P>
MPs recently grilled the president over his sending troops to
the DRC without consulting the legislature while the president
insisted that he did not have to do so because it was not
declaring war with a third country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's deployment of forces in the DRC soon after the
rebellion eruption on August 2, 1998 has been blamed for the
country's current economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The government argued that its troops were there to secure the
safety of its borders vulnerable to attacks from rebels of the
DRC-based Allied Democratic Forces.
</P>
<P>
There has been a domestic outcry for its pullout and some donor
 countries have been pressing the Ugandan government to reduce its
surging defense budget.

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
The Indian National Congress:
</P>
<P>
The Congress, founded in 1885 to oppose British rule, has ruled
India for around 45 of the 50 years since independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Jawahar Lal Nehru ruled India as its first prime minister at
the head of a Congress government from 1947 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, headed the country's Congress
government twice from 1966 to 1977 and from 1980 to 1984 when she
was killed by her body guard.
</P>
<P>
Rajiv Gandhi replaced his mother as Congress leader and prime
minister in 1984 and he was assassinated in 1989 by a suicide
bomb.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, a minority Congress government took office
and won over enough members of parliament to attain a majority
after two years.
</P>
<P>
The party got only 141 seats in the 545-member low house of
parliament in the 1998 elections. In order to prevent the Indian
People's Party (BJP) from coming to power, the Congress, which
could not come to power itself, decided to offer its support from
outside to the UF which then formed a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, 1998, Sonia Gandhi, who was appointed new
president of the Congress Party on March 14, was unanimously
elected as chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party.
</P>
<P>
The Congress in its 1999 election manifesto pledged to provide
a "stable, able and experienced government" if it were elected in
the coming Lok Sabha elections.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's Party):
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party, founded in 1980 as a breakaway
group of the People's party, is the largest parliamentary party in
India. The BJP got its first taste of power at the national level
after the inconclusive 1996 elections during which the party won
193 seats with its alliance. Its government, however, fell within
a fortnight after failing to establish a majority in the hung
parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998 elections, the BJP obtained 182 seats in the
Lower House of parliament and on March 19, 1998, Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, leader of BJP, was sworn-in as Indian prime Minister at
the head of a two-tied 43 member coalition which included a number
of new faces.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1999, the 13-month Vajpayee coalition government
was defeated by one vote in the vote of confidence in the Lower
House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In its manifesto of 1999 election, the BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance pledged to continue the reform process to
ensure that the national economy grow on the principle that "India
shall be built by Indians."

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- India is one of the
countries with an ancient civilization in the world. It became a
unified country in 4th century BC.
</P>
<P>
European colonists began to invade India in the 16th century.
The Pulasi War between India and Britain broke out in 1757. India
was defeated and became a British colony. Britain occupied all the

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Considers Converting Vehicles Into Natural Gas Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
considering converting all its vehicles to compressed-natural gas
(CNG) users and establishing CNG filling stations across the
country to combat air pollution, The Bangladesh Observer reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials were quoted as saying that an inter-ministerial
meeting recently decided that a formal proposal would be presented
to the Establishment Ministry in consultation with the Environment
Ministry, and another proposal to the Dhaka Urban Transport
Authority and Air Quality Management Project to bring all the
three-stroke engine vehicles under the CNG program.
</P>
<P>
The issue of expanding CNG use will be placed in the next
meeting of the National Environment Council, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to encourage the state-owned
Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) to go for plying
gas-fueled "dedicated engine" buses, following a positive response
from the BRTC.
</P>
<P>
A BRTC representative said they got a good result in running
buses with natural gas on experimental basis and the cost didn't
widely vary in comparison with diesel-engine buses.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,050 vehicles have been transformed into CNG-users since
the government initiated the program about 10 years ago to protect
the environment from diesel and petrol and save foreign exchange,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in the Bangladeshi capital has reached a very
high level due to emission of suspended particulate materials by
pollution vehicles at an increasing rate, according to a survey
conducted by the Department of Environment on the air quality in
the city.
</P>
<P>
About 160,000 motorized vehicles are operating in Dhaka
metropolitan area at present, with about one-third of them having
no fitness certificates, according to the Bangladesh Road
Transport Authority.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's First Private EPZ to Be Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The development work of
Bangladesh's first private export processing zone (EPZ) on 68
hectares of land will begin in the second week of October this
year, the Independent daily newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A large number of foreign investors from Singapore, United
States of America and Europe have expressed their keen interest in
the Rangunia Export Processing Zone (REPZ), which is located at
Rangunia, about 30 kilometers away from the country's southeastern
sea-port city of Chittagong, A. Qaiyum Chowdhury, managing
director of the Chittagong Industrial Park Limited, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The REPZ would be divided into information technology valley
and agro-valley, and initially, a total of 100 industrial plots
including 20 for heavy industries would be developed over 42.4
hectares of land, Chowdhury said, adding that ultimately the
number of plots would increase to 250 and the area of the REPZ
would also be expanded to 280 hectares of land in phases.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.5 billion taka (about 50 million U.S. dollars) would be
spent for the infrastructural development of the REPZ, and with
implementation of the project, 25 billion taka (about 505 million
dollars) would be invested creating job opportunities for over
50,000 people, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The project would include a golf course, an artificial lake, a
recreational park, a greenbelt, an international standard hotel
and recreation center, and the project area would also be
surrounded by a ring road, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, one 100-megawatt capacity generator would be installed
in the project site and one jetty and container terminal would
also be set up in the REPZ site, he said, hoping that the
operation of the zone would begin in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor to End by 2005 in Nepal: Industrialist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Child labor from the carpet
industry, one of the biggest employers of child labor, could be
wiped out by the year 2005, The Kathmandu Post quoted a carpet
industrialist as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to wipe out child labor from the country
within the next six years," said carpet industrialist Bimal Nepal,
who is also general secretary of the National Society for
Protection of Environment and Children (NASPEC), an organization
working to phase out child labor.
</P>
<P>
Nepal was addressing an interaction program on NASPEC's Role on
Phasing Out Child Labor from the Carpet Industry Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The phasing-out process includes rescuing child workers from
the carpet industry and rehabilitating them with non-formal
education, counseling, health services and vocational training.
Over one thousand child workers have been rescued by the
organization.
</P>
<P>
There are 2.6 million child workers in Nepal which make up
nearly half of the child population in the country. About half of
them have worked without pay.
</P>
<P>
A research conducted by the organization revealed that 46
percent of child workers were aged between 10 and 12, followed by
40 percent aged 13 and 14. Most of these children came from the
central region of Nepal.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are India's
major political events from 1947 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, 1947, India became independent from the
Commonwealth. Jawahar Lal Nehru, Congress leader, became India's
first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On November 26, 1949, the Constituent Assembly approved a
republican Constitution, providing for a president as head of
state.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, 1950, India became a republic, although

</P>
<P>
In May 1964, Nehru died and was succeeded by Lal Bahadur

</P>
<P>
In 1965, India and Pakistan fought a second war over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In January 1966, following mediation by the U.S.S.R, Shastri
and President Ayab Khan of Pakistan signed a joint declaration,
aiming at a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
In August 1969, the presidential election was held. Two

<HEADLINE> IAAF to Clear Jayasinghe of Doping Charges: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The world athletics ruling
body IAAF is set to clear Sri Lanka's 1997 world 200m runner-up
Susanthika Jayasinghe of doping charges, a press report said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe's manager Tony Campbell was quoted as saying in the
English language The Island newspaper that the IAAF was expected
to exonerate her within a week.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Campbell as saying that the IAAF had actually
cleared her of any wrongdoing in July but an announcement had been
delayed because the organization was involved in arranging the
world athletics championships in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF secretary apologized to me and said that since they
had so many other work including organizing the world games he
could not attend to this matter," Campbell was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, who tested positive for a banned steroid, was
suspended in April last year, but her ban was lifted four months
later after a local hearing. However, the IAAF was unhappy over
the inquiry and referred her case to an arbitration panel.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Peruvians Remit 1 Billion Dollars Home Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 2 (Xinhua)-- Peruvians living abroad remit
around 1 billion U.S. dollars to their families every year,
reports from Lima said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Remittances are fundamental for many families, especially the
middle and lower middle classes. In our investigation we have
found that many families depend exclusively on the remittances",
Professor Teofilo Altamirano of the Ponticia Catholic University
said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Investigators estimated that the sum of money sent back is up
to some 1 billion dollars every year, but it's difficult to know
exactly how much money overseas Peruvians have remit home.
</P>
<P>
Altamirano said that in the case of Western Union, one of the
firms that transfers money, the monthly movement of capital is
around 10 million dollars, with an average of 500 dollars per
remittance, which represented about 10 percent of the total
remittances sent back to Peru.
</P>
<P>
Western Union and its main competitors represented 29 percent
of remittances, while another 25 percent was made through banks
and the remaining sum (around 600 million dollars) was brought
into Peru through informal channels, he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Research Highlights Global Climate Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Because it is an
important influence on the world's climate, the North Pole's
impact on the earth was the focus of the recently concluded
Chinese arctic research expedition, Chen Liqi, chief scientist of
the expedition, said today.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the homeward-bound ship Snow Dragon, Chen pointed out
that the resources and environmental changes of the North Pole may
potentially influence the environment in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that in the past 50 years, the temperature in some
polar areas rose one to two degrees centigrade, the frozen earth
belt moved northward, and glaciers receded.
</P>
<P>
These phenomena, accompanied by an ever thinner ozone layer,
has intensified the amount of ultraviolet radiation, and obviously
this indicates changes in the global climate.
</P>
<P>
Considering that the interaction between cold airflow from the
Arctic and hot airflow from the tropics deeply affects China's
climate, Chinese scientists are intensely focused on the Arctic
effects, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"China will benefit from Arctic research," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
During the recent Arctic research, one major subject of concern
was how the eco-system and biologic resources of the Arctic Ocean
will affect the development of the Chinese fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
China has been engaged in Arctic research since the 1980s, and
took part in the International Arctic Science Committee in 1996.
This January, the Chinese State Council approved China's first
Arctic expedition, which came to a successful end last week.

<HEADLINE> Software Piracy Continues to Impair U.S. Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A Microsoft-sponsored
study released Thursday showed that software piracy still inflicts
a severe impact on states and local communities across the United
States, despite increased attention to the issue from both
government and industry.
</P>
<P>
The software piracy rates rose last year in the country's 21
states, including California and Virginia, where much of the
recent growth in the technology sector has been fueled.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have made some gains in protecting intellectual
property and reducing the impact of software piracy worldwide,"
Microsoft said in a statement, "criminal counterfeiting and the
Internet has posed distinct challenges for Microsoft and the rest
of the software industry in battling this issue."
</P>
<P>
According to the study, losses for the 10 most affected states
including California, Texas and New York amounted to some 3.5
billion U.S. dollars, or 57 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, communities nationwide lost over 1 billion dollars in
tax revenues, about 40 million dollars above the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
The study said that 29 states had piracy rates higher than the
national average of 25 percent. And eight states among them had
rates over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that last year it filed actions against 168
resellers for distributing counterfeit software and hard disk
loading -- the practice of installing pirated software in
computers sold to consumers.
</P>
<P>
The company did not say how much it suffered in terms of money,
but confirmed that more than 43 million units of counterfeit
Microsoft software were seized in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumers using counterfeit software could find they are
missing key elements including computer code, have higher risk of
viruses, and are ineligible for technical support or upgrade, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
By pirating software or spending money on counterfeit products,
Microsoft added, consumers also are inadvertently contributing to
causing losses in the form of tax revenue and employment in an
industry that has recently been responsible for much of the growth
of the U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> Polar Research to Be Int's Scientific Focus Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Scientific research in the
North and South poles will become a hot research topic in the
international scientific community in the new century, said
Chinese scientists who have just completed their 56-day Arctic
expedition, the first of its kind by Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi, the home-bound chief scientist of the Chinese North
Pole expedition, said: "The earth is a whole system, in which the
North and South poles are playing an ever increasing role."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the peculiar geographic positions and the
unique natural environments of the poles provide ideal locations
to study the evolution of the earth and the global climate changes.
</P>
<P>
"Global changes and human environmental problems have become
not only a research object for scientists, but also a major
concern for more and more political figures. In the next century,
many more governments and scientists will join the cause of polar
study," said the chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
Chen is also in charge of China's polar research activities.
China's first North Pole expedition demonstrated China's concern
about the world's environmental problems, and Chinese scientists'
strong sense of responsibility to make contributions to precisely
forecasting and solving environmental problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned in particular that 15 years ago, the late senior
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the purpose of China
's polar research is "to make due contributions for the peaceful
use of the polar areas."
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi also said that "the ability to conduct polar
expedition is a clear illustration of a nation's comprehensive
national strength, especially its scientific and technological
establishment. With China's scientific research level elevated to
a new high, we will be more active in polar research, mainly on
environmental issues."

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 2 (Xinhua) -- With low prices and buyers
flush with cash, the U.S. auto industry sales rate in August hit
the highest level in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
A report from Detroit on Thursday said total vehicle sales rose
by 20.4 percent. August sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 17.8 million light vehicles, compared to a 14.8 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division as a group
sold 987,333 cars and light trucks last month -- a 26-percent
increase over the strike-torn August of a year ago. The American
nameplates captured about 66 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies in Europe saw sales increase by about 29 percent,
while American automakers in Asia gained about 7 percent as a
group.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that several economic conditions -- low
unemployment, low inflation, low interest rates -- have combined
to keep vehicles affordable.
</P>
<P>
They do not see the recent increase in short-term interest
rates as having a dramatic effect on vehicle sales for the rest of
this year. A strong job market has buoyed the consumer confidence,
while household income has gone up steadily.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Imports Large Amount of Edible Oil in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar imported a total of 112
million U.S. dollars' worth of edible oil in fiscal 1998-99, which
ended in March, according to the latest official figures published
by the country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
Of a total of over 340,000 tons of annual consumption of edible
oil by the Myanmar people, per capita consumption of the oil
reached 7.3 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Although annual domestic production of edible oil is just over
180,000 tons, the country still needs to import nearly 160,000
tons of the oil annually, which accounts for 46.6 percent of the
country's total oil demand.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for Myanmar's domestic insufficiency of edible
oil are said to be due to less cultivated areas for oil crops,
low annual per-hectare output and fast increase of population.

<HEADLINE> WFP Praises China's Efforts in Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's achievement in poverty
alleviation has attracted worldwide attention and served as a
model for many countries, a senior official of the World Food
Program (WFP) said in a recent interview here with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 20 years, the impoverished population in China
has been decreasing by an annual average of 10 million and this is
a great success for China," said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director
in charge of Asian affairs, who made a working visit to China last
month.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the past 20 years, in contrast to the
worsening situation of poverty in many countries and regions, the
Chinese government allocated huge amounts of funds for poverty
alleviation, and by the end of 1998, the impoverished population
in rural areas dropped to 42 million from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Hopkins said she was satisfied with the implementation of the
WFP's 62 development projects and three emergency projects in
China at a value of 876 U.S. million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hopkins, who has 21 years of experience in the U.N. system,
said that since the mid-1980s, China has implemented integrated
agricultural development projects instead of direct food aid in
the impoverished regions. "These projects are very appreciated by
the WFP."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government's high political will and right
policy have guaranteed the successful poverty relief work, she
expressed confidence that China will eventually win the battle
against poverty.

SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial city, will begin to gain status as a key
international city by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"By then, Shanghai will basically reach the level of a modern
international metropolis in terms of overall economic strength,
economic structure, city layout, and cultural and educational
progress," said Mayor Xu Kuangdi in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Xu, also an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
said that by then the city will haven taken major steps toward its
final goal of becoming an international center of economy, finance
and trade.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, what Shanghai has achieved over the past 50
years has laid a firm foundation for further development.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 when the People's Republic was founded, to the mid-
sixties, Xu said, the city managed to create a complete industrial
system comprising nearly every industry and began playing a major
role in helping the country form an independent industrial system.
</P>
<P>
China's first 10,000-ton ocean-going vessel, first missile,
first satellite, and first jumbo jet were all manufactured in
Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has become the
fifth largest recipient country of foreign investment in the world
and the third largest in Latin America over the past five years,
the authorities said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The annual foreign investment inflow to Mexico has increased
from 3 billion U.S. dollars to an average 11 billion dollars since
President Ernesto Zedillo took power in 1994, said Carlos Garcia,
chief of Foreign Investment at the Secretariat of Trade.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's foreign investment totaled 15 billion dollars at the
end of 1994, and amounted to over 60 billion dollars by last June,
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
The investment increase was attributed mainly to Mexico's entry
into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) at the end of
1993.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Striving to Become Key Int'l City (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has since shifted its focus of development from the
processing industry to finance, trade, information technology, and
other new and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Shanghai achieved 368.8 billion
yuan in gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998, and its per capita
GDP topped 28,000 yuan, ranking the first in the country.
</P>
<P>
Of the total volume, about half came from the major industries
of automobiles, iron and steel, telecommunications, mechanical and
electrical equipment, chemicals, and electric home appliances, and
16 percent from the sectors of integrated circuitry and computers,
pharmaceuticals, and new materials.
</P>
<P>
A series of State-level exchanges have been established in
Shanghai, including the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Shanghai
Futures Exchange, and the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of overseas business people have shown
keen interest in investing in Shanghai, and so far some 20,000
overseas-funded businesses have been operational, with a combined
contractual investment of 37 billion U.S. dollars. And 59 of the
top 100 multinational firms in the world have made investment in
the city.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, Xu said, Shanghai will open up wider to
the outside world and take a more active part in the global
economy, while continuing its market-oriented reforms.
</P>
<P>
And more capital and talented people will be introduced from
abroad, the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Produces 1 Mln Barrels of Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced a total of
1.108 million barrels of crude oil in the first four months of
this year, a reduction of 60,000 barrels as compared with the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data published by the country's Central
Statistical Organization, the output of natural gas was 563
million cubic-meters during the period, a drop of 29 million
cubic-meters as compared with the corresponding period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of April this year, foreign investment in the oil
and gas sector coming from Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia,
Japan, Thailand and the United States had reached 2.3 billion U.S.
dollars in 46 projects, accounting for 32.39 percent of the 7.108
billion dollars' total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Myanmar's crude oil and petroleum products are still
self-insufficient and the country has to import 280,000 to 300,000
tons of crude oil and 100,000 to 150,000 tons of diesel oil
annually, the official statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Mia Audina Hopes to Lift Dutch Players to Higher Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Dutch women's team coach
Judith Meulendjiks is hopeful the presence of former Indonesian
number one Mia Audina on her squad will lift her players to a
higher level.
</P>
<P>
Meulendjiks, who also plays singles on the team in Indonesia
Open currently held in Denpasar, capital of Bali, said she was
happy to have Mia on the national team.
</P>
<P>
She said she expected her to compete in the Grand Prix
tournament series for the Netherlands and also represent the
country in the Uber Cup, the sport's most prestigious women's team
event.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can learn a lot from her as she was the 1996 Olympic
silver medalist. Hopefully, she will lift us to a higher level and
will boost our side when we compete in the Uber Cup in 2002," she
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mia sparked controversy when she decided to move to the
Netherlands with her Surinamese-born husband Tylio Lobman, who
also holds Dutch citizenship. They married in March.
</P>
<P>
Mia was scheduled to represent the Netherlands for the first
time in last week's Singapore Open but the International Badminton
Federation (IBF) ruled her ineligible because she remained under
dual jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) complained to the
IBF that Mia officially left the association on August 12 and
could not play for a new country.
</P>
<P>
IBF rules stipulate a player can only represent a second
country after residing there for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
Dutch national team coach Robbie Kneefel said he was unaware of
Mia's training program.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the chance to speak to Mia because we had to
leave for Singapore when she arrived in the Netherlands. But my
training director Martijn Doormalen told me that she might be able
to compete in the Dutch Open, German Open, Danish Open, Hong Kong
Open and China Open," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mia is scheduled to train with the national team at the
Netherlands Badminton Center in Utrecht five times a week. Mia
lives in Rotterdam,about 45 minutes from Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
Meulendjiks said she would recommend that Mia play in a German
club and compete in the German league.
</P>
<P>
"In the Netherlands, there are not as many clubs and
competitions as in Germany. I played for Langenfeld together with
Sweden's Margit Borg and Kelly Morgan of Wales. I think it's
better for Mia to consider playing in Germany," she added.

<HEADLINE> Larsen's Poor Performance Disappointing, Danish Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Danish team manager Thomas
Lund was disappointed with men's singles second seed Poul-Erik
Hoyer-Larsen's poor performance in the Indonesia Open badminton
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Larsen had to unexpectedly bow out to Malaysian rookie Yap Yong
Jyen 13-15, 12-15 in the third round of the tournament in Bali on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Hoyer-Larsen didn't play really well today (Thursday). He
seemed like he didn't have any confidence. Yap played well and
used many chances. Under normal circumstances, Hoyer-Larsen would
win," Lund was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, the 1996 Olympics gold medalist and world number
four, could not hide his disappointment with his poor result.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to finish the match immediately but I lost control.
Statistically, I would have won over him in nine of the 10 matches.
I believed I wouldn't lose to him, but I underestimated him. I'm
quite disappointed in the way I was playing. Actually, it was a
very good draw, so I can't complain to anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lund also commented on another Dane player Peter Rasmussen's
performance against Indonesian Hendrawan.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan, ranked 17th in the world defeated world number seven
and fourth-seeded in the tournament Rasmussen 15-6, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
"He was on the bad side of the court in the first set. I think
he played quite well and tried to use his chances. But Hendrawan
survived some bad points. Hendrawan could control the game and the
win. He also played really good nets, he's a very confident player,
" Lund said.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time Rasmussen lost to the Indonesian players.
In the early rounds, he also bowed out to Marlev Mainaky in the
second round of the Singapore Open last week.

<P>
LAHSA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Luo Yu, a 60-year old road
worker, made a special trip to express his deep thanks to Aduo, a
Tibetan doctor in the village of Luelang in southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Luo wouldn't have recovered without the Tibetan medicine, he
told the 56-year old doctor. Luo had suffered from gall-stones for
a year before getting Aduo's help earlier this year. A recent
examination showed that the gall-stones had disappeared completely.
</P>
<P>
Luelang lies in a valley where for generations Tibetans have
had a reputation for the use of leeches to treat ailments and Aduo
began learning Tibetan medicine at the age of 8.
</P>
<P>
In the past, both serf owners and serfs came to them for
treatment, he said, and they were very busy but got little pay.
Sometimes they were even beaten by the serf owners and had to make
a living however they could.
</P>
<P>
After New China was established, Aduo and other Tibetan doctors
were given land but were also encouraged to develop traditional
Tibetan medicine, and doctors in the village now use 250 kinds of
herbal medicines and have developed more than 100 kinds of
traditional Tibetan medicines.

Earlier this year, Ceringmar, a local herdsman, complained of
having been sick for months with a cold and fever, but he was able
to resume his work after 2 months of treatment by Aduo.
</P>
<P>
There are six people in Audo's family. His children study or
work in other places outside the village. The family's annual
average income is more than 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the humid climate in the county caused a serious skin
disease to spread, affecting hundreds of people and Western
medicine didn't seem to help.
</P>
<P>
But, Aduo developed a medicine from herbs and minerals and
cured most of the patients. More recently, he developed a new
medicine to treat bronchitis in children and 400 Tibetan children
were cured.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is an important part of traditional Chinese
medicine, Audo said, and he is determined to continue research and
development in his field.

<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Scottish Premier League
investigation into last May's Old Firm fracas has cleared Rangers
of any breach of rules.
</P>
<P>
The central charge against the Ibrox club related to their
players' post-match celebrations, which angered watching Celtic
fans.
</P>
<P>
Rangers clinched the title with victory in the match at
Parkhead on May 2 - and then appeared to mock Celtic's traditional
huddle" celebrations at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
But a commission dismissed allegations of any impropriety.
</P>
<P>
Celtic have already been fined 45,000 pounds by a separate
commission for their part in the infamous scenes, which included
referee Hugh Dallas being struck by a coin and three players red-
carded.

Graham told the Daily Mail: "It's been made to look like a lack

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Tells French How Much Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhao said that 100 years later, the Chinese people are living a
totally different life and are fully confident to enter the new
millennium with other peoples of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that 100 years ago, Chinese women entered a new century
with bound feet. Today, they entered the final match of the
Women's Soccer World Cup held last summer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
This dramatic change reflected not only the great changes of
the life of Chinese women in the past 100 years, but also the
great changes lived by the whole Chinese society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that since China launched the policy of economic
reform and opening in 1978, the life style of the Chinese has been
undergoing fundamental transformations, which are reflected in
their changing culture of food, clothes, transport and housing.
</P>
<P>
With increasing incomes, more and more Chinese are capable of
making choice between Chinese food and Western food, including
French wine and cheese, and are traveling abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Western suits, jeans, sportswear, and feminine pret-a-porter
have already become commonalities for Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the Chinese people are becoming more choosy
about what they should buy. For instance, they are wondering
whether they should accept too much American culture like
Disneyland and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people are also more and more familiar with the role
and function of laws and legal rules in their life and are using
them to protect their personal interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
He gave "Qiu Ju Makes Suit Against Her Husband," a film
starring actress Gong Li, as an example of how an ordinary woman
in the Chinese countryside can take advantage of the protection of
law to seek a better life.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Seles, Williams Advance at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi knows that it
does not take much to go from tournament favorite to early-round
loser. So he did not take any chances today against Axel Pretzsch.
</P>
<P>
Agassi dispatched the German qualifier 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 to advance
to the third round at the U.S. Open Tennis Championships in New
York.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, two-time winner and fourth seed Monica
Seles of the United States cruised past Silvia Farina of Italy 6-2,
6-2 in 62 minutes. She won the title here in 1991 and 1992, and
appeared in the final in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Appearing in her second U.S. Open, seventh seed Serena Williams
of the United States faced a player with less experience than she
and dominated Croatian qualifier Jelena Kostanic 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Favored to win his second Grand Slam of the season since No. 1
Pete Sampras and two-time defending champion Patrick Rafter of
Australia pulled out due to injuries, Agassi never was truly
pushed during the 94-minute match.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded American made 26 unforced errors but won 76
percent of his first-service points, hit 32 winners and converted
6-of-10 break points. He improved to 21-2 lifetime against
qualifiers at Grand Slams.
</P>
<P>
He won the Frnehc Open in June and could become the No. 1
player in the world if he goes farther in the draw than third seed
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
In action involving men's seeds, 10th seed Marcelo Rios of
Chile overcame a slow start to get past George Bastl of
Switzerland 4-6,6-3, 6-2, 6-2; No. 12 Richard Krajicek of the
Netherlands moved into the third round with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-1 win
over Lorenzo Manta of Switzerland; and No. 15 Nicolas Kiefer of
Germany topped countryman Michael Kohlmann 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Michael Chang of the United States takes on Arnaud
Clement of France in a battle of unseeded players.
</P>
<P>
In the women's battles, the 25-year-old Seles took advantage of
24 unforced errors by Farina and hit 21 winners as she raised her
record at the U.S. Open to 40-6. She will face Ai Sugiyama of
Japan, who defeated Karina Habsudova of Slovakia 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Second seed and defending champion Lindsay Davenport of the
United States plays Dragomir of Romania tonight. Davenport cruised
past doubles partner Corina Morariu 6-0, 6-3 on Tuesday. She has
never lost to Dragomir in four all-time meetings.

<HEADLINE> New Thinking Brings Success to Miao People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Miao ethnic minority
people in southwest China's Guizhou Province are ridding
themselves of the outdated notion that "one ought not leave their
hometown no matter how poor," and many of them are now earning a
good living in other places.
</P>
<P>
The Miao people of the Miao-Dong Qiandongnan Autonomous
Prefecture once dared not make friends with the Han people because
they had been ill-treated by the Kuomintang troops before the
founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
They were forced to give up their folk costumes and their own
language, and the Kuomintang soldiers would cut short the hair of
the Miao women.
</P>
<P>
But now it is a common sight to see Miao people intermarry with
other ethnic groups, and some families are made up of three or
four different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also provided opportunities for
ethnic minorities to become better trained. Over 1,300 Miao
officials in the province had been sent to colleges by the year
1956 when the prefecture was established.
</P>
<P>
And now, one-third of all prefecture officials, or more than 20,
000, are Miaos.
</P>
<P>
Miao people used to think that they could only survive by
farming, even though 80 percent of them could not even feed
themselves by just working on the farm before the founding of New
China.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the 1.57 million Miao people in the prefecture no
longer worry about how they will eat tomorrow, as more and more
Miaos have left their hometowns to enter business elsewhere since
the implementation of the opening-up and reform policies two
decades ago.

<P>
Thousands of Miao women in a county of Kaili City, the first
place with regional autonomy for minorities, have left their
hometown to sell folk-style jewelry, and many of them have gone as
far as Myanmar and Russia.
</P>
<P>
There are some 40,000 to 50,000 young people of Sansui County,
another place mainly inhabited by Miaos, working outside the
county, and many of them return with money and skills and start
their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that the county's young workers now
earn a total of over 100 million yuan ( about 12 million U.S.
dollars) a year, and remittance back to the county is more than 30
million yuan, twice that of the annual revenue for the whole
county.
</P>
<P>
The Miao people have also learned to earn a living by
exploiting their special customs and traditions. Foe example,
there are some 39 Miao traditional living compounds in Qiandongnan
Prefecture that have been developed into tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Folk dances, wonderful folk music, and special costumes and
houses are attracting many tourists, and every household in one of
the compounds, called Langde, for example, will earn over 20,000
yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has been named one of the top ten ethnic
minority cultural tourism attractions in the world by the United
Nations Folk Culture Fund for its spectacular customs and natural
scenery.
</P>
<P>
The Miao ethnic minority now live mostly in the southeastern
part of Guizhou, in south China's Guangxi and Hainan provinces,
and in the border areas of the Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Yuannan
provinces.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Plans to Go Public in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
board of directors decided Thursday to push back the timetable for
a possible initial sale to 2000 from Thanksgiving this year as it
sees the need to solve regulatory and tax issues first.
</P>
<P>
NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso said the exchange would work out a
strategic business plan to solve a number of "public policy
questions."
</P>
<P>
Grasso said in July he hoped investors would be able to buy
NYSE stocks by Thanksgiving. Another Wall Street big stock
exchange -- the NASDAQ Stock Market -- also showed its willingness
to go public.
</P>
<P>
They thought such a move would help them prevail against
fast-growing competition from electronic trading networks which
match buy and sell orders by computer in a cheaper way for
investors, rather than on a traditional trading floor.
</P>
<P>
Grasso said Thursday the NYSE may spin off its regulatory unit.
Federal Securities and Exchange Commission and exchanges officials
are in talks about how to provide for the independence of the
regulatory unit.
</P>
<P>
Whether initial public offering (IPO) members should pay
capital gains taxes on the value of their seats is another issue
to be solved.
</P>
<P>
Congress is also watching the implications of exchanges going
public. The Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a September 23
hearing on the NYSE and NASDAQ IPO plans, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Tells French How Much Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior government minister of
China told a 700-person French audience Thursday that the changes
the Chinese people have experienced in the past 100 years are the
biggest ever in their 5,000-year history.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Qizheng, director of the Information Office of China's
State Council, made the speech entitled "Chinese People Meet the
21st Century" at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) headquarters here on the first day
of the China Culture Week -- '99 Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that the purpose of his speech is to let the French
people know better about China's past and present and make a
comparison between the situation of the Chinese people at the
beginning of the 20th century and 100 years afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that 100 years ago, China was living under full
humiliations inflicted by foreign invaders and was looked down
upon by other countries.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, a Dutch dictionary published at that time
explained the word "Chinese" as "foolish men and mentally ill
men." Another example, an American newspaper published in the
early 19th century a cartoon which compared a Chinese man with a
swine.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, because of their poor health and archaic habits, the
Chinese people bore the nickname "Sick man of East Asia" until
1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
As for the status of Chinese women at the beginning of the 20th
century, Zhao said that their feet were bound and prevented from
grow since they were little girls, and they were the private
properties of their husbands after marriage.
</P>
<P>
A typical situation of Chinese women at that time was described
by Ba Jin, a famous Chinese writer, in his novel "Family," which
has been translated into French and many other languages, he said.

LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Bobby Robson looks certain to
be appointed as Newcastle United manager on Friday morning, after
traveling to St James's Park to finalize the deal.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC reports on Thursday, the 66-year-old
former England manager said that he still had some issues to

</P>
<P>
It is reported that the club will call a news conference Friday
morning, when Robson is expected to be unveiled as Ruud Gullit's
successor.
</P>

A club statement read: "Newcastle United Football Club confirm
that they held discussions with Bobby Robson in London yesterday
with a view to him taking over the job of manager at St James's
Park."
</P>
<P>
Robson will replace Dutchman Gullit, who quit the Magpies last
Saturday after one of the worst starts to the season in the club's
history.
</P>
<P>
The team have earned just one point from six games - leaving
them second from bottom in the Premiership.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Sanctions Committee Okays Iraqi Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
committee overseeing sanctions against Iraq has approved Baghdad's
donation of 10 million U.S. dollars in oil to assist the victims
of the devastating earthquake that jolted Turkey on August 17,
U.N. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Council members did not object to Iraq's plan to provide
500,000 barrels of oil to Turkey, according to a spokesman for the
chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The donation will not count against Iraq's export limit as
governed by the United Nations oil-for-food program, which allows
Iraq to use the revenue from oil sales to purchase humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Wednesday announced its donation of 10 million U.S.
dollars in urgent oil assistance to Turkey, which suffered
devastation damage and loss of human lives caused by an earthquake
in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations
said, "The Iraqi government donated for relief a quantity of Crude
Oil equivalent in value to an amount of 10 million U.S. dollars,
to be distributed by the Turkish Red Crescent Society to the
Turkish families victims of the earthquake in Turkey."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq have started from August 29 to pump through the
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline a quantity of 100,000 barrels of oil a day
for a period of 5 days for a total of about 500,000 barrels," the
news release said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced the donation despite the hardship caused by the
continuation of what Baghdad called "the unjust comprehensive
sanctions imposed by the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"On the last day, Iraq shall pump an additional quantity to
make up of any shortage to reach an equivalent amount of 10
million U.S. dollars," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth noting that Iraq has ranked first in providing
humanitarian emergency assistance to Turkey," the news release
said. "The second rank is left to the U.S."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's sanction committee approved unofficially
Tuesday on Iraq's proposed donation in oil to Turkey's earthquake
victims, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is expected to sell the oil and donate the revenues to
the Turkish Red Crescent Society to aid those made homeless in the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil to be donated to Turkey will flow through the
same pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan that carries about 45
percent of the oil sold under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The plan, an exception to the sanctions, allows Iraq to sell
5.26 billion U.S. dollars in oil every six months to buy needed
humanitarian supplies for its people.

<HEADLINE> Redknapp and Sutton Add to Keegan Agony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Jamie Redknapp and Chris Sutton
became the latest players to pull out of Kevin Keegan's England
squad for the Euro 2000 qualifier with Luxembourg on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, Liverpool midfielder Redknapp
failed to recover from an Achilles tendon problem, while Chelsea
frontman Sutton is still troubled by a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
They will both miss the Wembley clash on Saturday - but manager
Keegan is still hopeful they will be in contention for the second
vital match in the double-header, against Poland next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These latest withdrawals take the number of players who have
pulled out of the squad for Luxembourg to six.
</P>
<P>
First-choice goalkeeper David Seaman and center-back Sol
Campbell succumbed to injury on Wednesday, while Darren Anderton
and Rio Ferdinand announced the day before that they could not
play.
</P>
<P>
There are other concerns for Keegan, with eight players in his
squad on yellow cards.
</P>
<P>
A second booking against Luxembourg would rule any of them out
of the make-or-break clash with the Poles.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "It will be at the back of my mind but I don't
want it to be at the back of the minds of the players.
</P>
<P>
"Unavoidably some of t there's nothing we can do about it. What
will be will be," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- England soccer manager Kevin
Keegan said Thursday that Bobby Robson is a right choice for
Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great appointment," said Keegan. "He is the
right guy at the right time."
</P>
<P>
Robson, who ended Keegan's international career as a player, is
well on his way to St. James Park. It has been reported that
Newcastle United may make an announcement Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "He's a Geordie. He obviously loves the club,
which I think is really, really important.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying Kenny (Dalglish) didn't and I'm not saying Ruud
Gullit didn't, but he knows the club. I think that's a massive
advantage," Keegan told a news conference at the England team's
hotel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Robson, who describes his loyalty by saying he bleeds the
Newcastle colors of black and white, has supported the club since
his boyhood in the north-east and has long dreamed of managing the
side.
</P>
<P>
Robson, 66, who managed England to the semifinals of the 1990
World Cup, said he expected to be in charge for the visit to
Chelsea on September 11.
</P>
<P>
He replaces Dutchman Gullit who resigned at the weekend after
Newcastle had collected just one point from their opening five
league games this season.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who revived Newcastle's fortunes during his time and
almost took them to the league title, had no hard feelings towards
Robson and said the appointment should also help players such as
England captain Alan Shearer.
</P>
<P>
Gullit dropped Shearer against local rivals Sunderland --his
last game in charge.
</P>
<P>
"I do wish him all the luck in the world. When I went there(
Newcastle) as a player that's what he wished me. He left me out of
the England side just afterwards but he did wish me all the luck
in the world," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole idea of stability will help the players,not
least Shearer," he added.

<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- British woman Rachel Anderson,
the world only female agent licensed by soccer's governing body
FIFA, claimed victory in discrimination lawsuit on Thursday after
she was barred from the British player union's all-male awards
dinner.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reuters report, Anderson's case hinged on
whether the Professional Football Association (PFA) annual dinners
in 1997 and 1998 were public or private events. Private functions
are not subject to the Sexual Discrimination Act.
</P>
<P>
"They said it was a private event but it's very hard to argue
that when you've allowed an agency to sell tickets on your behalf
to members of the public," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
"I was obviously very pleased that I won but disappointed that
it had to go as far as that."
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who represents dozens of British professionals, won 7,
500 pounds (12,000 U.S. dollars) in damages but said that was not
the reason she brought the lawsuit against the PFA.
</P>
<P>
"I think they've realized that they've got to conform to public
opinion and a changing world," she said. "Women are part of
everyone's life whether people like it or not and certainly part
of business life and certainly football now."

made the statement here in a program of the National Radio of
Angola (RNA) on the occasion of the first anniversary of the
establishment of the organization.
</P>
<P>
According to Valentim, the foundation of the commission is the
first movement for the democratization of the "new" UNITA, which
was announced by some renegade members of the rebel UNITA led by
Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Valentim said that his organization will continue to grow, but
should do more in the future.
</P>
<P>
President of the renovated UNITA, Eugenio Manuvakola reportedly
said Wednesday that the organization will contribute to the
reconstruction of the country which has suffered more than 24
years of civil war since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign secretary stressed that the foundation
of the organization a year ago constituted a "clear defiance"
against Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a good change in thought and in the system of
ideas in the UNITA," said the secretary, adding that "there exists
for the first time a clear defiance against Jonas Savimbi for the
salvation of the UNITA and the general democratization of the
country."

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis More Dangerous Than AIDS: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Hepatitis "B" and "C" are
one hundred times more contagious than AIDS and the number of
patients dying from hepatitis "B" in one day is equal to that of
those dying from AIDS in one year, according to experts attending
a discussion program here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The experts concurred that hepatitis "B" will ultimately lead
to liver cancer and takes life within a short period of time after
contracting the disease. They said that the disease claims lives
of some two million people every year around the world and the
people dying from it in Nepal ranges from 500 to 1,000 every year.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis "B" and "C" are one of the main causes for liver
cirrhosis and cancer. Eighty percent of liver cancer cases are
caused by this disease. More than 80 percent of cases are found in
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The virus causing the disease is found in blood, semen and
vaginal path.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of the Liver Foundation in Nepal Santosh
Shrestha, lactating mothers who are suffering from any infection,
alcoholics and persons who suffer from long fever and diarrhea are
more likely to contract the disease.
</P>
<P>
Persons who establish sexual contact with more than one person
and those who have received blood many times are also likely to
contract the disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease also spreads through handkerchiefs, bed sheets,
toothbrush, shaving blades and scissors used by the patient.
Tattooing, acupuncture, piercing of nose and ears, frequent use of
needles and treatment of teeth may also contribute to the spread
of the disease, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspects Russian Mafia Has Moles in U.S. Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. authorities suspect
that Russian organized crime groups may have put "moles" inside
the U.S. financial system, The Wall Street Journal reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the authorities as saying that the criminals
set people up with jobs to help them launder money and conduct
other illegal transactions, placing the moles in key positions at
major banks and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
"They'll put people in sensitive positions in the bank so they
can utilize them at some later point," a law-enforcement official
who investigates Russian rings in the U.S. told the journal.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the U.S. authorities based their concerns
on information from informants and other confidential sources but
not on public evidence, which they said is scant.
</P>
<P>
The probe is part of a broader investigation into a number of
alleged money-laundering cases at U.S. banks. The initial
investigation centered on the Bank of New York, but has widened in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has called allegations of Russian
involvement in money laundering a smear by Western media and
denied loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
diverted illegally.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Dennis Weakens But Still Menacing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Dennis, which reduced from
a hurricane to a tropical storm Tuesday, continued to lash U.S.
east coastal areas with gusting winds Thursday, spitting rain for
the fourth day in a row and taunting meteorologists who warned
that the storm could still regain strength and become a hurricane
again.
</P>
<P>
The storm remained nearly stalled less than 160 kilometers off
the coast of North Carolina State, astounding weather experts and
confounding residents who had put their lives on hold.
</P>
<P>
Along the coast from North Carolina to Delaware, four straight
days of churning winds kept many beaches closed and carried away
hectares of sand, including the sand that once swelled in front of
the Virginia Beach boardwalk. Crews in Ocean City, Maryland State,
cleared piles of drifted sand from the boardwalk and washing
crusted salt from power lines.
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, where President Bill Clinton Wednesday
declared nine counties eligible for federal disaster funds because
of Dennis, some 5,000 people, mostly residents, who stayed on
Hatteras Island after Sunday's evacuation order remained stranded
when the only north-south highway became impassable.
</P>
<P>
Dennis had weakened enough by Wednesday morning that officials
at the National Hurricane Center considered stripping it of its
tropical storm status as well. But airborne observations showed
that a storm eye may be reforming on its western side, a sign that
Dennis is likely to remain a serious threat well into the weekend.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Growth Slows While Labor Costs Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday that growth of U.S. workers' productivity slowed
considerably in the second quarter while labor costs rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work,
increased at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the April-June
quarter, far below the 3.6 percent rate in the first three months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected smaller 0.6 percent increase was revised
downward from the Department's initial estimate a month ago that
productivity had risen 1.3 percent in the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, unit labor costs, a key measure of wage
pressures, jumped at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the second
quarter, the largest increase since the first quarter of 1994 when
they also rose 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has told Congress
that recent strong gains in productivity were likely to moderate.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan and many other economists believe the good showing on
productivity has helped keep inflation low.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has warned that if productivity slows, wage pressures
are likely to quickly surface, given that labor markets are the
tightest in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
The 0.6 percent increase in productivity was the slowest
quarterly increase since the second quarter of 1998, when
productivity rose only at a 0.4 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in productivity reflected the fact that the gross
domestic product also slowed sharply to an annual rate of 1.8
percent in the second quarter of this year, compared to 4.3
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, productivity increased by 2.2 percent, almost double
the 1.2 percent gain of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has noted this sharp improvement as evidence to
support his view that the nation's heavy investment in computers
and other productivity-enhancing technology is beginning to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5 percent rate of increase in unit labor costs compared
to modest increases of just 2 percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Probes Links Between UNITA, Secessionists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian authorities
are investigating links between secessionist rebels who attacked a
town in the remote Caprivi Strip a month ago and Angola's UNITA
rebels, Agence France Presse (AFP) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seven members of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) were deported in mid-August after being arrested
in the Caprivi Strip in a crackdown following the August 2 rebel
attack on Katima Mulilo, AFP quoted Namibian Defense Force Chief
of Staff Martin Shalli as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They were UNITA people, there is no question about it. They
said it themselves," Shalli said.
</P>
<P>
However, it was unclear how they were linked to the attack, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know what they were doing," Shalli said, adding that
they could have been trading with the secessionists, who are
seeking independence for Caprivi, a strip of land sandwiched by
Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said defense authorities were investigating whether the
seven were in Namibia as individuals or on behalf of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He said the secessionist rebels got some weapons and equipment
from UNITA people.
</P>
<P>
"we are not sure whether it was (officially) from the movement
or from UNITA bandits selling weapons. But they do have a
connection," Shalli said.
</P>
<P>
One possibility was that UNITA had exchanged weapons for fuel
from the Namibian rebels.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed in Katima Mulilo, about 1,200
kilometers northeast of the capital Windhoek, in fighting between
the secessionists and security forces.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency imposed in the region was lifted last
week. "The area is under control," Shalli said.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted The Namibian newspaper as reporting on Thursday that
85 people in connection with the rebel attack were charged with
high treason.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Support Turkey's Bid for EU Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday it
would argue for Turkey to be recognised as an European Union (EU)
candidate at a weekend meeting of EU foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We will be arguing for that (candidate) status to be
recognised...this weekend among foreign ministers," Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook told reporters after talks in London with his
Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Turkey's application should be judged by the same
standards as any other candidate for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"That must be on the same tests and no other test as any other
candidate," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook said both Britain and Turkey recognised there was "much
work to be done" over Turkey's application.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey is a country of great strategic importance and
significance to Europe and has been a good friend of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Union froze Turkey's long-standing membership bid
two years ago, citing its poor human rights records and political
standards.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain would also argue for generous economic
support for Turkey after last month's earthquake killed more than
14,000 people and devastated its industrial north-west region.
</P>
<P>
"Looking beyond the crisis, we recognise that there will be a
requirement for longer term economic reconstruction. I will argue
that the European Union is to recognise the new situation in
Turkey and the need for the EU to respond generously and
appropriately with the economic reconstruction for Turkey," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Zhan Xugang Ready for Another Olympic with World Record by sportswriter Zhou Xin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's strongman Zhao Xugang set a new world record at the
current Asian Weightlifting Championships on Thursday to regain
the confidence for his second Olympic gold medal in next year's
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect to break the world record tonight because I
was in low ebb for almost three years since the Atlanta Olympics,"
said the 25-year-old Zhan after receiving a standing ovation from
the local crowd.
</P>
<P>
Zhan successfully jerked 206.0 kilograms for a new world mark
at his third attempt, surpassing the previous record 205.5kg set
by Aranda Idalberto of Cuba at the Pan America Games in Winnipeg,
Canada last month.
</P>
<P>
"The new world record inspire me for another Olympic gold,"
Zhan said.
</P>
<P>
Zhan, from Zhejian Province, who swept three world records for
his Olympic title in the 70kg in Atlanta, had to change his
division into 77kg as the International Weightlifting Federation
introduced new categories in January last year.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champion had built his supremacy in the 77kg and
terrorized his Asian rivals as he won all the three titles at the
Asian Weightlifting Championships and Bangkok Asian Games last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Though I broke three Asian records at Bangkok Asian Games, I
still felt lack for confidence to the new division in front of the
elite weightlifters from European countries," Zhan said.
</P>
<P>
"But now I am confident to beat them at any international
competitions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hanxiong, head coach of the Chinese national team, said:"
We were 60 percent for sure that Zhan would break the jerk world
record, and volatile as he did it."
</P>
<P>
"His victory looms the hope of taking one or two gold medals
for Chinese men's weightlifters at the Sydney Olympic Games next
year," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Increase Health Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A World Health
Organization (WHO) official Thursday called on African countries
to increase their health budgets to cope with the diseases they
face.
</P>
<P>
WHO regional director Ebrahim Samba said at WHO's annual
meeting in Namibian capital Windhoek that the Namibian government
has allocated about 15 percent of its budget to health and that
the other 45 sub-Saharan countries that make up WHO African region
should follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Health budgets of the countries in the region are between six,
seven and eight percent of their respective budgets, South African
Press Association quoted Samba as saying.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the majority of African countries allocated
less than five percent of their budgets to health.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our advocacy to place health at the center of
 development," he added. "No country can develop when the people
are sick."
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa carries among the world's heaviest burdens
of HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the numerous conflicts in the region were also
damaging health, noting that the WHO had for years urged its
members to end conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the 46 countries in the region are involved in some
sort of war, he said.
</P>
<P>
With about nine million refugees, "Africa (has) the highest in
the world. Internally displaced persons -- 30 million -- the
highest in the world," Samba said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that 70 percent of the total land mines in the
world are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The damage to infrastructure, hospitals, buildings, the roads
... is just terrible. In some countries, you will see they have
gone back 30 years in their development," Samba said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference reviewed the region's work against
HIV/AIDS, making health accessible to all, and prioritizing mental
health.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 70 percent of new infections of HIV in the world were
recorded in sub-Saharan Africa.

ADDIS ABABA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Thursday signed the
 Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, thus
becoming the 33rd signatory to the document adopted by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was held in the office of OAU Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim here.
</P>

Salim praised Uganda for its initiative to sign the convention

Uganda's ambassador to Ethiopia Alex Kamugish said he was

He assured the OAU chief that Uganda will work hard to speedily
ratify the convention, and work with other member states in its
implementation.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Won't Compete Again This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Multi-talented sprinter-
jumper Marion Jones of the United States, who collapsed during the
World Athletics Championship last week due to back injury, still
has back spasms and will not compete again this season, her agent
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"She continues to improve, but she is not well enough to
compete," Charlie Wells said in a telephone interview from
Brussels, Belgium Ones had hoped to compete in a Golden League
meet there Friday.
</P>
<P>
The pulling-out decision would put an end to Jones' hope of
sharing the one million U.S. dollars as bonues offfered to
athletes who compete the Golden League season undefeated in their
specialties. Jones is one of the three runners who had won all
five of their European circuit races previously.
</P>
<P>
Only the final meet in Berlin next week remained in the Golden
League after Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Jones, the unbeatable sprinter in the 100 and 200 meters so
far, collapsed on the track in the semifinals of the women's 200
meters at the world championships in Seville, Spain, suffering
from cramps and back spasms.
</P>
<P>
She returned to the United States over the weekend for further
evaluation. Her doctors recommended she not compete again this
season, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
The world No. 1 sprinter had hoped to win four gold medals at
the world championships. She successfully defended her 100 meter
title but finished third in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
Wells said the injury will not change Jones' determination to
seek an unprecedented five gold medals in the Sydney Olympics next
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Zimbabwe
Thursday agreed to expand economic cooperation with a view to
development in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Projects the two countries were pursuing together would be
speeded up within the context of balanced regional development,
South African President Thabo Mbeki told reporters after meeting
his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said: "We are looking at projects where joint efforts
could be made and where we could be much more productive and
progressive than we would be working separately."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said his meeting with Mugabe focused on matters such as
the development of a gas field in Zimbabwe, and generating
economic activity along the existing road link between Harare and
Beira, Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The Beira corridor would also be discussed with Mozambique with
a view to a tri-lateral effort to maximize the economic potential
of this link.
</P>
<P>
A continuous railway link between Harare and Zambia was another
project under discussion, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said countries in the region would also examine the tourism
potential of cross-border national parks.
</P>
<P>
"The relevant ministers will be dealing with those issues. Task
teams will work on the detail and we will meet again in three
months' time to review progress," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, together with Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and
 Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza, will be in Mozambique Thursday
afternoon for talks with the Mozambican authorities, the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement earlier Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Minister Admits Embezzling Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Minister of Education
Emmanuel Mudidi has admitted that important sums of money were
embezzled in the ministry's project of reconstruction and
rehabilitation of schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
He had been summoned by parliament to explain corruption in an
International Development Association (IDA) 227 Credit worth 26
million U.S. dollars, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told lawmakers Wednesday that embezzlement, which hit the
World Bank project which started in 1995 and was due to end by
this September, caused a loss of over 150 million Rwandan franc
(one U.S. dollar equals to 355 Rwandan franc at current exchange
rate).
</P>
<P>
Mudidi acknowledged that up to now, only 23 million dollars
have been used.
</P>
<P>
However, Mudidi said that the case of corruption has been
submitted to courts which are handling it.
</P>
<P>
Some people involved in this scandal have already been arrested
and asked to return the money.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the project was set up to
reconstruct schools during the emergency period after the 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
It was planned to rehabilitate over 3,000 school blocks and
replace school equipment and stationary in the schools.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, parliamentarians have decided to
follow up another corruption case in which the government is said
to have lost 350 million Rwandan franc to one Rwandan businessman.
</P>
<P>
Corruption is currently at the top of evils the authorities
have stepped up measures to eradicate.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged To Reduce Domestic Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday urged
the Zimbabwean government to mobilize concessional aid from donors
and privatization proceeds to reduce its crippling domestic debt
and to direct more budget expenditure toward poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
World Bank resident representative Thomas Allen made the call
in Harare at the opening of a two-day Structural Adjustment
Participatory Review public forum to assess the impact of
structural and sectoral adjustment and stabilization policies and
to recommend changes in these policies.
</P>
<P>
Allen said that the high level of budgetary interest payments,
accounting for more than a quarter of all budgetary expenditures,
constrained expenditures in support of crucial social services and
poverty reduction activities.
</P>
<P>
"Reducing the stock of domestic debt of the government in order
to cut budgetary interest payments so as to make more money
available for increasing high priority social expenditures has to
be at the core of the strategy," said the World Bank official.
</P>
<P>
This could create a cycle of exchange rate stabilization, lower
interest rates, lower inflation and lower fiscal deficits over the
medium term, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation was the greatest tax on the poor and bringing
it under control through fiscal and monetary stabilization
measures was crucial.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of the privatization program was not only
important for the reduction of domestic debt, he said, adding
there was evidence that the services provided by these enterprises
could be more efficiently provided by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
A workable land reform program could contribute significantly
to poverty reduction, Allen said, but he lamented that progress in
land reform had been slow and had been clouded by politics.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official expressed hope that more donors would
extend financial support to Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> S. African Wrestlers Aim high at All-Africa Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South African wrestlers
aim for at least 10 medals in the up-coming All-Africa Games.
</P>
<P>
South African coach Hennie Minnaar said he was confident that
the wrestlers will repeat their achievements at the previous
Africa Games and the recent All-Africa championships.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 in Harare, the wrestlers won two gold medals on the
final day of the Africa Games to put South Africa at the top of
the medal table.
</P>
<P>
However, Minnaar expected the standard of wrestling to be
exceptionally high because it is a qualifying tournament for the
Sydney Olympics. More than 130 wrestlers from 16 countries and
regions have entered for the competition.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria will undoubtedly be our strongest opponents in the
Free Style division," says Minnaar, quoted by South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
"while Egypt and Tunisia are rated among the world's best in
the Greco-Roman style." added Minnaar. South Africans will also
for the first time see an international female competition and the
Algerians and Tunisians are expected to dominate.
</P>
<P>
The South African Freestyle team is highly experienced and all
the wrestlers have had recent international exposure. Bennie
Labuschagne(69kg) and Jannie du Toit (76kg) are firm favorites for
golds. Both are current Africa champions and ranked among the top
12 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Two veterans of the Atlanta Olympics, Tjaart du Plessis (63kg)
and Andrew Davidson (130kg) are staging a comeback and are
expected to win medals. Tjonkie van Rensburg (58kg) brings vast
experience and exceptional skills to the competition and should do
very well.
</P>
<P>
Shaun Williams (54kg) will return from America where he is
currently studying and excelling in the tough Collegiate-circuit.
As the youngest member of the team he carries the hope for another
gold for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Both Gideon Malherbe (76kg) and Markus Dekker (97kg) have won
medals at Africa championships in the Greco-Roman style and they
are expected to repeat.
</P>
<P>
Two Under-20 wrestlers, Raynard Mouton (63kg) and Juan Nel (
69kg),will use the Games to gain valuable international experience.
</P>
<P>
Amongt the women, the country's medal hopes are pinned on
Yvonnika Kruger (56kg) and Madelyn Swanepoel (75kg). However,
attention will also be fixed on the very talented Simphiwe
Mpungose (46kg) who will get her first taste of international
competition.
</P>
<P>
The South African competition will come from Algeria,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Senegal,
Ivory Coast,Tanzania, Namibia, Cameroon, Kenya, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Central African and Chad.

<HEADLINE> Albright in Egypt for Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in Alexandria, Egypt Thursday on the
second leg of her regional tour aimed at helping push the Mideast
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Albright went straight into talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak after arriving in the Mediterranean port city to seek ways
to bridge the gap between the Palestinians and Israel over an
agreement on the implementation of the Wye peace accord signed
last October.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States administration has billed Albright's
Mideast tour as a stock-taking trip, it appeared that she might
have to help the Palestinians and Israel overcome last-minute
obstacles to the agreement which was supposed to be signed in
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
A difference over the number of the Palestinian prisoners to be
released by Israel is holding up the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to free 356 Palestinians held for
anti-Israeli activities while the Palestinians sought the release
of 400. The two sides refused to budge in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have reached agreement on the
timetables for further Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank
and the final status talks in addition to the opening of two safe
passages between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Albright began her Mideast tour with a visit to Morocco. After
her trip in Egypt, she will also travel to Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Syria and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Patten Hits Out at N.Irish Police Report Leak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Hong Kong governor Chris
Patten on Thursday hit out at the leaking of his report into the
future of Northern Ireland's police force, saying some media
reports were aimed at derailing the province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It has been extremely frustrating," Patten told BBC radio.
"There have been some things which I can only imagine are an
attempt to muddy the water before we report."
</P>
<P>
The Belfast Telegraph newspaper said last week that Patten
would recommend the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) be renamed the
"Police Service of Northern Ireland".
</P>
<P>
Political parties, including the Irish Republican Army's
political wing Sinn Fein, might have places on a new police
supervisory board, it said.
</P>
<P>
Policing is one of the province's most divisive issues. More
than 90 percent of RUC officers are Protestant.
</P>
<P>
Protestant politicians have always made clear they would see
any name change for the RUC as an attempt to appease Northern
Ireland's minority Catholic community by removing any reference to
the British crown.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has branded the force anti-Catholic and wants it
abolished.
</P>
<P>
Patten, who will deliver his report next week as former U.S.
Senator George Mitchell launches a review of the problems holding
up last year's Good Friday peace accord, said the newspaper had
been indulging in "educated guesswork".
</P>
<P>
"I hope that there then can be a full and serious debate on an
issue which is absolutely fundamental to the question of whether
or not Northern Ireland continues to develop as a peaceful,
democratic society," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ghaddafi: Libya Welcomes Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Libya welcomes more foreign
investments and the Libyan people are sincere in international
economic cooperation, said Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The West always accused Libya of being against international
trade and closing our country by ourselves. This is not true,"
said Ghaddafi at the opening of the two-day Symposium on Prospects
of International Investment and Trade in the Great Jamahiriya.
</P>
<P>
Ghaddafi told the symposium, which drew about 40 businessmen
from 30 countries, that Libya is important for foreign investors
because it is situated at the entrance of Africa and it enjoys a
coastline of 2,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Libya intends to be the transit line for trade between northern
and southern Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader assured foreign investors that "we have laws
to protect foreign investments and incentives to attract
investments."
</P>
<P>
Libya's General People's Congress (parliament) passed in 1997
Law No. 5 to attact investment of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Libya remains subject to tough sanctions from the United
States, who accused Libya of supporting terrorist activities.
Libya's asset in the U.S. are frozen, and Americans are banned
from engaging in trade with Libya or traveling to the country.
</P>
<P>
Libya has claimed that the seven-year United Nations sanctions
against Libya, which had been in place since 1992 after the
Lockerbie bombing, has caused the country to lose 24 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government has been making efforts to draw
investment to revitalize the country's oil-dependent economy after
the U.N. suspended the sanctions on Libya in April after Libya
handed over the two Libyans suspected of bombing a Pan Am flight
over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.

TEHRAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas
Klestil is to pay a visit to Iran on September 20, the first by a
Western European head of state in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here quoted Gerhard Rainer, director general of
Austrian Foreign Ministry's Cultural Department, as saying the
visit is aimed at boosting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries' officials will concentrate on exploring
ways of promoting bilateral cooperation and discussing joint
programs, and strengthen political, cultural and economic ties
between Iran and Austria," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian official said the two nations "had good mutual
relations in the past, including in the holding of the conference
of dialog between Islam and Christianity." The second round of the
conference is expected in Vienna in September or October.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has normalized relations with European Union members
states, which were marred by Iran's condemnation of British
writer Salmon Rushdie for his book The Satanic Verses.
</P>
<P>
Rainer said the two sides will cooperate in language teaching,
archeological projects and academic undertaking, hold an
Iran-Austria Culture Week and an exhibition of Austrian
architecture, and promote tourism between them.
</P>
<P>
Expressing welcome to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's
proposal for dialog among civilizations, Rainer said his country
believes "the best way to remove misunderstandings is through
dialog between peoples."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President F. Chiluba
has appealed to international community to cancel the external
debts hanging over the heads of poor countries which were
crippling and destroying hopes of African countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said this when he was meeting with a visiting
British parliamentary delegation in the State House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the worry and request to international community was
for assistance with the debts in order to use the money to service
the people.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking for help from the international community in
order to enable us to use the money in which we must service our
education, health and other sectors," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba further said financial assistance was required for
capacity building to enhance democracy in areas like
anti-corruption commission and permanent human rights commission.
</P>
<P>
He also said the country was looking at the area of conflict as
it was impossible to attract investment where conflicts were the
order of the day.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba regretted that peace had not been achieved in Angola
despite spending 14 months discussing the issue in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent signing of the peace agreement on the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo was for the purpose
of giving the region peace and what system of government the
people wanted.
</P>
<P>
The president also said: "we must make our own efforts to build
and strengthen the economic institutional base in Southern
Africa."
</P>
<P>
That is the case for Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),
also looking at the conflicts issue, "we are making efforts to
stop the conflicts in the Southern African region," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Lord Evens, leader of the delegation,
thanked the president for the effort he has made to bring the two
Congolese rebel groups to sign the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also hopes the international conference on HIV/AIDS
scheduled for September 12-16 in Lusaka will find some cure to the
disease on the African continent.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hopeful Palestinians, Israel to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Thursday that she is hopeful that the
Palestinians and Israel will soon reach an agreement on the
implementation of the Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks at a joint press conference with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa after her meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
But she said in the meantime that she could only do so much to
bring together the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, who refuse
to budge in a dispute over the number of Palestinian prisoners to
be freed by Israel under the Wye accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
"While the United States and Egypt can be helpful, it is up to
the parties themselves to make the hard decisions," she said.
"The negotiations are still going on. We expect them to continue
and we hope very much that they will come to a conclusion as soon
as possible."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Moussa called on the United States to play its
role as the major mediator in the peace talks to help the
Palestinians and Israel reach a resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt does not think that the U.S. will stay on the sidelines
as the peace process is passing through this crucial stage,"
Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that an agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel could be signed in Egypt "within hours, or
within days."
</P>
<P>
Egypt had hoped to host a afternoon signing ceremony of the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Alexandria, but night fell with
no agreement.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Alexandria from Morocco earlier in the day
on the second leg of her Mideast tour, which will also take her to
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria and Jordan. Her
regional tour is also aimed at seeking ways of helping resume the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations, suspended in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. administration has billed her tour as a
stock-taking trip, Albright might have to intervene to help the
Palestinians and Israel to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have agreed on every other
essential issues, including the timetables for the further Israeli
troop pullback from the West Bank and the final status talks under
a revised Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides are stuck over the release of a few dozen

<HEADLINE> Over 300,000 Armed Prospectors in Lunda-Sul, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September (Xinhua) -- Angola denounced the existence of
over 300, 000 illegal and armed diamond searchers in the northeast
province of Lunda- Sul, the National Diamond Enterprise (Endiama)
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among those armed prospectors are citizens of Democratic
Republic of Congo, South Africa, Mali and Angola, including
Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi, revealed the company in an
interview with the National Radio of Angola (RNA).
</P>
<P>
The illegal diamond prospectors in the areas with an abundance
of diamond deposits in the Lunda-Sul Province are currently
undertaking their prospecting for the mineral, said Endiama, the
national diamond monopolizing company.
</P>
<P>
Due to the excellent military equipment of the illegal diamond
searchers, the guards of the mines faced difficulties in the
fighting with them. Only a coordination between the management of
Endiama and the defense and security forces can clear up the
areas, said the source of Endiama.
</P>
<P>
Endiama vowed to take measures in the near future to crack
down on the rampant illegal prospecting activities in Lunda-Sul in
northeast Angola, which is an important diamond-producing country
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) also participated in the
circumscription, launching attacks and conducting prospecting,
earning millions of dollars which are used for aquisition of
military equipment supporting the war.

meeting with Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej at the Grand Palace
Thursday evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The relations between China
and Thailand have seen a "sound and steady" development despite
the vicissitudes of the international situation, visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the welcoming state banquet hosted by Thai King Bhumibol
Adulyadej, Jiang said that since the establishment of diplomatic
ties 24 years ago, there have been frequent exchanges of visits by
the leaders of the two countries and people-to-people contacts.
</P>
<P>
"Areas for bilateral cooperation have expanded and more and
more common ground has been achieved between the two sides on
regional and international issues," said Jiang, who arrived here
Thursday afternoon for a state visit as the king's guest.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the Joint Statement on the Plan of Action for the
21st Century signed by the two countries earlier this year, saying
it outlines the future framework and charts the direction for the
development of bilateral relations and cooperation in the new
century.
</P>

"We can say that China and Thailand have already established an
all-round partnership of good-neighborliness and mutual trust
which can be seen as an example of good-neighborly friendship and
mutually beneficial cooperation between countries with different
social systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that to further consolidate and develop the friendly
relations and cooperation between China and Thailand not only
conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries and the
common aspiration of the two peoples, but also conduces to peace,
stability and development in the region.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Link Sicily and Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A governmental decree published
Thursday could help pave the way for a link between Sicily and
mainland of Italy, Italian Public Works Minister Enrico Micheli
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a turning point," Micheli said after the government
announced the appointment of advisers who are to assess various
projects to link the Italian largest island of Sicily and the
south region of Calabria in Italian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"In order to take a decision you must examine costs, the impact
on the environment, time and the effectiveness of the project,"
he said, adding that "only then can you pick out the best
solution."
</P>
<P>
"Sicily urgently needs a link to the mainland, especially now
that there is a united Europe and the single currency, which raise
new challenges for the island's economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian government's decree, the advisers will
have six months to assess technical, financial and environmental
aspects of the projects to link Sicily and mainland.
</P>
<P>
The main contender, according to the decree, is a 3.3km
suspended bridge which the Stretto di Messina company estimated in
1997 would cost 7 trillion lire ( about 3.78 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another solution, preferred by environmental groups, is for a
"water highway," Micheli says, which would enable high-speed
ferries to cross the straits of Messina.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Israeli, Palestinian Deal Eludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- In a setback in the Middle
East peace, Israel and the Palestinians failed to sign an
agreement over the implementation of the U.S.-brokered Wye peace
deal in Egypt Thursday afternoon as widely expected.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had arranged a signing ceremony in the port city of
Alexandria in the presence of visiting United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. But the Israeli and Palestinian sides
remained deadlocked over the issue of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted "a senior source" in Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's office as saying that a signing ceremony would apparently
be held in Alexandria Friday morning. A spokesman for the prime
minister said, however, Barak "would not fly anywhere at this
moment."
</P>
<P>
The last obstacle to an agreement on the implementation of the
Wye interim deal, signed and then frozen by Israel's former
hard-line prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year, was the
release of Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.
</P>
<P>
After the gaps narrowed in rounds of talks lasting for over one
month, the Palestinians demand that Israel release 400 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities. But Israel
insists that it will release only 350 and reiterated it will not
free those who had killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have actually reached the
verge of an agreement after intensive talks since late July. They
have made significant progress on most issues concerning the
implementation of the Wye accord, including a timetable of further
Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over a period of
12 weeks. Netanyahu froze the deal after carrying out its first
stage.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted Barak's proposal to divide the
two remaining phases of Israeli troop withdrawals into three
stages and put off the final stage until early next year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that if the two sides could not agree on all
issues, it would carry out the Wye agreement as written, meaning
all understandings recently reached including those on the seaport
and safe passages would not be implemented.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the two sides might still have chances to
resolve their difference during Albright's five-day stay in the
region.
</P>
<P>
During a joint news conference with Albright in Alexandria
after the planned ceremony time, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said contacts were going on between Israel and the
Palestinians. He said the U.S. and Egypt were also involved in
the contacts.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who started the visit in Morocco Wednesday, will
arrive in Israel late Thursday night and will hold talks with
Barak Friday. Besides the Palestinian track, she will also
discuss with Barak the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks,
which froze three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Says U.N. Seizing its Kosovo Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) - Yugoslavia Thursday
complained to the United Nations that the U.N. Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) illegally seized
Yugoslavia's "public and State property" in the Serbian province
and demanded its return.
</P>
<P>
The complaint came in a letter from Vladislav Jovanovic, charge
d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, to the
president of the U.N. Security Council circulated on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Seizing automobiles, funds and buildings, UNMIK is in breach
of its function and in violation of general and international
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Yugoslav diplomat said this was also a violation of
a Security Council resolution adopted on June 10 setting out
UNMIK's mandate, rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission, which operates parallel to a NATO-led
military force called KFOR, is administering Kosovo, the mainly
ethnic Albanian province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of UNMIK constitutes an illegal, arbitrary and
unacceptable usurpation of other persons' assets and a violation
of the basic norms of the status of state property and its
inviolability," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Yugoslav government "demands the restitution of the
illegally seized property and its return to the legal owner" and
called on the Security Council to instruct UNMIK "not to abuse its
functions in the future and to abide by its mandate" under the
June 10 council resolution.

<HEADLINE> AL Backs Efforts for Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) on Thursday
reiterated support for the efforts to have economic sanctions on
Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
The nine-year-old crippling international trade embargo on Iraq
should be lifted to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi people, AL
Assistant Secretary General Ahmad Bin Heli said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation pan-Arab forum rejects the continued attacks on
Iraqi sites by warplanes of the United States and Britain, Heli
told reporters after a meeting with Iraqi Permanent Delegate to
the Arab League Al-Sultan Al-Shawi.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed the economic
sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait, which
sparked the Gulf War in 1991 to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones in north
and south Iraq, set up by the West allies after the Gulf War, have
been attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets since December,
causing serious casualties and damage of properties.
</P>
<P>
Heli delivered to Al-Shawi a letter for Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammad Said al-Sahaf from the league chief, Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The letter is a supplement to an earlier message aimed at
clearing the atmosphere for achieving a success for the upcoming
Arab foreign ministers' meeting, the league official said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf will chair the foreign ministers' meeting slated in
Cairo for September 12-13 under rotational system.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Al-Shawi said he briefed Heli on the daily
military aggressions on Iraq by the U.S. and British forces, which
he said jeopardize the unity of Iraq and the security of the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy called upon Arab countries to support Iraq in
standing up to the embargo and aggressions.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shawi hailed the Arab League's rejection of the U.S.-British
air strikes against Iraq and urged Arabs to take a decisive stand
to end the assault.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Forces Kill 3 Rebels in Caprivi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Namibian security forces
killed three secessionists in a shoot-out early Thursday after
uncovering a " terrorist hideout" in the northeastern Caprivi
Strip, according to report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a ministry statement as saying that security
forces " killed three terrorists" during an operation at the
village of Sibbinda.
</P>
<P>
"The security forces uncovered a secret terrorist hideout in
the Sibbinda area where 10 terrorists were hiding, and this led to
an exchange of fire resulting in three Caprivi Liberation Army
terrorists being killed and two captured," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Sibbinda is about 60 kilometers west of Katima Mulilo, the main
town of the Caprivi region.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "Among the dead terrorists is Alex Chainda,
a former member of the Namibian Defense Force. War materials were
also captured, among which were seven assault rifles and one
shotgun."
</P>
<P>
Security operations were continuing in the area, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned the rebels to hand themselves over to the
authorities or "be prepared to face extinction."
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed when secessionists attacked
Katima Mulilo on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The secessionists, members of the shadowy Caprivi Liberation
Army, are seeking independence for the Caprivi Strip, a narrow
finger of Namibian territory bordered by Angola, Botswana, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The 10 tourists from the
United States, together with a pilot and a tourist guide, who were
killed in a plane crash in northern Tanzania's Arusha Region, have
been identified.
</P>
<P>
The dead Americans have been identified as Mr. and Mrs.
Bowersock, Ms B. Hoffman, Ms V. Cox, Mr. R. Ennis, Mr. C.Ennis,
Mr. and Mrs. Putterman, Mr. N. Dolan and Ms. M. Riffuti, reports
from Arusha said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 12 people were killed after their light aircraft crashed
Wednesday morning in the Mount Meru Forest Reserve in Arumeru
District, some 20 kilometers from Arusha municipality.
</P>
<P>
Efforts of policemen, rescue teams and several tour companies
to collect the remains in the dense forest proved completely
futile because of bad weather on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
However, the weather improved Thursday and eyewitnesses said
that the bodies were badly damaged but were assembled ready to be
transported to the Mount Meru Hospital Mortuary.
</P>
<P>
The Cessna 404 plane, belonging to the Arusha-based Northern
Air Charter Company, went down at about 11 a.m. local time
(0800GMT) before it touched down at the Kilimanjaro International
Airport on its way to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tourists, after two days of game viewing at the
world-famous Serengeti National Park, were scheduled to go to the
Maasai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the crash was probably caused by poor
visibility. The pilot of the fateful plane, Christopher Pereira,
had radioed another charter plane following him, with a group of
seven Americans, alerting them of poor weather but seconds later
the communication was suddenly cut off.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said the 14-seat plane was destroyed beyond
recognition save for one engine and a propeller, while dismembered
bodies were flung as far as 500 meters from the crash site, mainly
due to the impact of the crash.
</P>
<P>
A villager who joined the rescue team said some small pieces of
human flesh were seeing hanging down the trees.
</P>
<P>
The work of the rescue was made difficult because of the thick
forest covered with cypress trees and wild animals in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha Regional Police Commander, Juma Ng' wanang' waka,
was at the crash site on Thursday afternoon together with the
Directorate of Civil Aviation (DCA) officials.
</P>
<P>
The other Tanzanian, who was killed in the crash, has been
identified as Mr. William Meiriali, a guide with the Abercrombie
and Kent tourism firm, which arranged the tour of 17 American
tourists.
</P>
<P>
But the other seven who were travelling in another light plane
landed safely at the Kilimanjaro International Airport.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Statistics Agency
predicted that the population of Russia may shrink by eight
million people by the year 2016, the Interfax news agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Irina Sbarskaya, head of the agency's Demographics Department,
said that since the 1960s, the birth rate has been insufficient to
ensure the simple replenishment of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
To ensure replenishment, she said, every 100 women must have
215 children, not 124 as now.
</P>
<P>
She said the population of Russia has decreased by 2 million
people over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
According to her agency, the population of Russia dropped by
0.28 percent, or 406,200, in the first half of this year to reach
145.9 million as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
As compared with the first half of the previous year, the rate
of population decline almost doubled. From January to June 1998,
the population of Russia diminished only by 226,700, or 0.15
percent.
</P>
<P>
The faster population decline was attributed to a rising death
rate as well as a decrease in migration from outside Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- In an achievement that one day
may be applied to enhance human intelligence, U.S. researchers
have genetically modified mice to be better at learning and
remembering.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from Princeton University, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Washington University, found that
adding a single NR2B gene to mice significantly boosted their
ability to solve maze tasks, learn from objects and sounds in
their environment and to retain that knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Their research, published Thursday in the science journal
Nature and hailed as a "breakthrough" in memory study, revealed a
common biochemical mechanism at the root of nearly all learning.
</P>
<P>
It proved that the NR2B gene is a key switch that controls the
brain's ability to associate one event with another, the core
feature of learning.
</P>
<P>
The NR2B gene is the blueprint for a protein that spans the
surface of neurons and serves as a docking point, or receptor, for
certain chemical signals.
</P>
<P>
After giving mice extra copies of the NR2B gene, and
engineering the genes so that their activity increases as the mice
age, the researchers found that mice with the extra gene had a
much greater learning response than normal mice in a variety of
tests.
</P>
<P>
And, this genetically-modified strain of mice, called Doogie,
also retained into adulthood certain brain features of juvenile
mice, which, like young humans, are widely believed to be better
than adults at grasping large.
</P>
<P>
The finding showed that "genetic improvement of intelligence
and memory in mammals is now feasible, thus offering a striking
example of how genetic technology may affect mankind and society
in the next century", the researchers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Humans also have the corresponding NR2B gene, although it is
not yet known whether it has the same function in people.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientists believed that in the long-term, the
results may promote further discussions on ethical and social
issues regarding whether and how genetic technology should be used
to modify or enhance mental and cognitive attributes in people.

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Thursday the approval of a loan
of 35 million U.S. dollars to Jamaica to strengthen the capacity
of local governments to finance and manage basic services and to
maintain infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The resources will assist the implementation of the Local
Governments Reform Program, continuing and expanding efforts now
under way to rehabilitate local infrastructure and to improve the
legal and institutional framework for local government, the
Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The program will strengthen the capabilities of the parish
councils so that they become more efficient and accountable as
providers of services to citizens, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, resources will be used to strengthen mechanisms
that will enhance the participation of citizens, nongovernment
organizations, and private sector entities in local economic
development planning and the delivery of services.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is 50 million dollars. The IDB
loan is for a 25-year term, with a five-year grace period, at the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspect Russia Mafia Has Moles in U.S. Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. authorities suspect
that Russian organized crime groups may have put "moles" inside
the U.S. financial system while the administration continued to
deny any U.S. aid was misused.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told reporters Thursday
that the U.S. has not found evidence to show that proceeds from a
one billion U.S. food aid package were illegally funnelled to
offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has come to me with any reports of any major diversions
at all, I'm comfortable, based upon what I've been hearing with
the level of monitoring," Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
However, The Wall Street Journal Thursday quoted the U.S.
authorities as saying that the criminals set people up with jobs
to help them launder money and conduct other illegal transactions,
placing the moles in key positions at major banks and securities
firms.
</P>
<P>
"They'll put people in sensitive positions in the bank so they
can utilize them at some later point," a law-enforcement official
who investigates Russian rings in the U.S. told the journal.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the U.S. authorities based their concerns
on information from informants and other confidential sources but
not on public evidence, which they said is scant.
</P>
<P>
The probe is part of a broader investigation into a number of
alleged money-laundering cases at U.S. banks. The initial
investigation centered on the Bank of New York, but has widened in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has called allegations of Russian
involvement in money laundering a smear by Western media and
denied loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
diverted illegally.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Statistics Agency
predicted that the population of Russia may shrink by eight
million people by the year 2016, the Interfax news agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Irina Sbarskaya, head of the agency's Demographics Department,
said that since the 1960s, the birth rate has been insufficient to
ensure the simple replenishment of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
To ensure replenishment, she said, every 100 women must have
215 children, not 124 as now.
</P>
<P>
She said the population of Russia has decreased by 2 million
people over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
According to her agency, the population of Russia dropped by
0.28 percent, or 406,200, in the first half of this year to reach
145.9 million as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
As compared with the first half of the previous year, the rate
of population decline almost doubled. From January to June 1998,
the population of Russia diminished only by 226,700, or 0.15
percent.
</P>
<P>
The faster population decline was attributed to a rising death
rate as well as a decrease in migration from outside Russia.

ATHENS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Thursday announced measures to reduce taxes and prices on
certain goods in a bid to lower the country's inflation, which now
stands at 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The package also includes income support for pensioners,
farmers and the unemployed, the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the package entails a reduction in the special
consumer tax on heating petrol from 20,000 drachmas (about 65.6
U.S. dollars) per ton to 6,100 drachmas (about 20 dollars) per
ton.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in special consumer charges on cars is expected to
bring down prices of new cars by about 10 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
The tax-free threshold for wage-earners and pensioners will be
increased from 1.355 million drachmas (about 4,442.6 dollars) to
1.9 million drachmas (about 6,229.5 dollars) for the present tax
year, with the threshold rising further to 2.3 million drachmas
(about 7,540.9 dollars) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment benefits are to increase by 10 percent, those
insured with the agricultural pension fund will receive an extra
10,000 drachmas (about 32.8 dollars) as of January 1, 2000 and all

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Praises Signing of Congo Ceasefire Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has described the signing of the ceasefire in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo as the opening of a new page in
the region's efforts for peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as Chairman of the Southern African Development
 Community (SADC), Chissano said that the signing of the peace
accord by the two factions of the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD) in Lusaka on Tuesday "represents the end of hostilities and
the beginning of a long process for the restoration of peace in
the Congo and in the Great Lakes region".
</P>
<P>
Other parties involved in the Congolese conflict, namely
Angola, Namibia, Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and the Congolese
government itself, had signed this peace accord on July 10, but
the two RCD groups did not do so then because of their internal
leadership dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a note from the SADC presidency, Chissano expressed the wish
to see the document implemented as urgently as possible, the
process of sending international observers to the Congo,
particularly from the United Nations, "so as to ensure the
implementation of the accord and promote a climate of trust
between the parties involved".
</P>
<P>
The note also congratulated Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
for his commitment in the quest for a lasting peace in the Congo.

<HEADLINE> First Virus Found in Arctic Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of the first
virus preserved in the Arctic ice has prompted a warning that warm
weather may release them into the atmosphere to start new
epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The virus, a common plant pathogen known as tomato mosaic
tobamovirus (ToMV), was found deep within the Greenland icepack by
a team of U.S. researchers, Britain's New Scientist magazine
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery suggested that other viruses, such as ancient
strains of flu, polio and smallpox, may also be entombed and could
make a comeback, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the survival rate, or how often they get back
into the environment. But it certainly is possible." Tom Starmer,
one of the researchers from Syracuse University, United States,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Starmer and his colleagues had earlier found ToMV in clouds and
fog. The researchers thought they might find the virus in the ice
because it is widespread, moves in the atmosphere, and is very
stable.
</P>
<P>
So they examined four ice cores, from three sites in Greenland,
containing ice between 500 and 140,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
As they had suspected, the researchers detected RNA from the
tomato pathogen. Further sequencing revealed that 15 strains of
the virus were present.
</P>
<P>
The frozen viruses were probably still infectious because of
strong protein coats which allow them to survive in harsh
environments, the scientists said, warning that they may be
released to cause outbreak of disease as the ice is melting
constantly around the poles.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are planning to use other techniques to find
out if virues are still viable in other cores taken from Antarctic
and Arctic ice.

Although the fuel is contained in ceramic pellets against
ignition, the government is taking more precautions to ensure
safety, according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Toepfer, Executive
Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
Thursday urged to protect public health in the use of pesticide
DDT and reduce its pollution to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The director said that his organization believes the DDT is an
effective tool against malaria, which is a mosquito-borne disease
and one of the top killers on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
However, he also encouraged the search of non-chemical
alternatives for DDT and eliminate its pollution and damage to
human health caused in its phaseout.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. senior official expressed his belief that the
humanbeing will find the way to control malaria while safeguarding
both public health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
About 110 countries will participate in the third round of
talks in Geneva to be held next week to establish an international
legally binding treaty to reduce and eliminate persistent organic
pollutants (POPs) including DDT.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the Intergovernmental negotiating
Committee (INC) are the control measures and deadlines for action
on the 12 POPs listed in the mandate from the UNEP Governing
Council.
</P>
<P>
In addition to DDT are the pesticides--aldrin, chlordane,
dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex, and toxaphene; the
industrial chemicals-- polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
hexachlorobenzene, which is also a pesticide; and the unintended
by-products of combustion and industrial processes--dioxins and
furans.
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time to develop a framework for clear control
measures on POPs -- the so-called dirty dozen," said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
POPs pose a serious risk to public health and the environment.
They  last for a long time, traveling long distances from the
source. They accumulate in living species, becoming increasingly
concentrated and magnified in fatty tissue as they move up the
food chain.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP mandate, which sets a year 2000 deadline for reaching
agreement on a POPs convention, also calls for scientific
criteria and a procedure for identifying additional pollutants as
candidates for international action.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Pessimistic Over N.Irish Peace Pact Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Protestant Ulster Unionists
leader David Trimble warned Thursday that Northern Ireland's peace
process review does not stand much chance of success.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said a major review of the pact, due to start Monday,
faced stalemate because the Irish Republican Army's political
wing, Sinn Fein, had not "declare themselves for the democratic
way."
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, the Sinn Fein leadership are going backwards,"
Trimble said in an interview with the London-based New Statesman
magazine.
</P>
<P>
"I can't see the prospect in the next month or two, which means
that I can't, as things stand at the moment, see any prospect of
the (Mitchell) review succeeding."
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator George Mitchell, who chaired talks that produced
the Good Friday peace accord, will lead the review hoping to end a
logjam over IRA disarmament and creation of a coalition provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
Trimble again criticized a controversial British ruling that
the IRA's ceasefire remains intact, and he warned the IRA may be
gearing up for murder.
</P>
<P>
He said British intelligence agencies had been told that the
IRA "had a shortage of high quality handguns needed for
close-quarter killings. The (IRA's) Belfast Brigade in particular
needed these weapons. This is the word that's coming through....
They're for close-quarter killing."
</P>
<P>
Trimble's party, the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party, and
Sinn Fein are expected to delay until Saturday decisions on
whether they will participate in the review.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Stress at Office Causes "Desk Rage" in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Growing pressures of the
workplace and long working hours are creating a growing phenomenon
of "desk rage" in British offices, said a survey published
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As stress builds to intolerable levels, workers are
increasingly venting their frustration on colleagues, the study by
Britain's ICM Research has found.
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of employees questioned by the ICM study
admitted that they had been upset by rows with colleagues.
</P>
<P>
And a third said that other people's rudeness was a major
source of stress at work, while a fifth blamed "problems with work
colleagues" for making their lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of the 674 adults surveyed said they were
affected by workplace stress, with more than half (56 percent)
saying that it had caused them to lose sleep.
</P>
<P>
ICM's latest study echoed the conclusion of another survey
conducted last month, which found that workplace stress in Britain
is worse that anywhere else in Europe or North America.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings, Sue Keane, of the British
Psychological Society, said that the extent to which disputes with
colleagues or clients were adding to the widely recognized
pressures caused by heavy workloads and tight deadlines.
</P>
<P>
"We have road rage, now we are seeing `desk rage' as conflicts
boil over between colleagues," she said.
</P>
<P>
Keane advised that "just a few minutes out of the office or
workplace at lunchtime could make all the difference."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Slashes 19 on the Ambassadorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian senate Thursday
approved the recommendation of its foreign affairs committee
rejecting 19 of the 106 ambassadorial nominees submitted about
three weeks ago by President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Among those rejected by the 109-member upper house were 11 of
the 44 career ambassadors and 8 among the 62 political nominees.
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons given by the 12-member committee for the
rejection of some of the nominees was the need to reflect federal
character, a constitutional provision requiring the fair
representation of the country's 36 states and the federal capital
in appointments.
</P>
<P>
The senate also approved the recommendations of the committee
for the president to represent names for some of the states whose
nominees were rejected.
</P>
<P>
The nominations were engulfed controversy after it was
submitted by the president about three weeks ago, most of the
criticisms dwelling on the lopsidedness in favor of a few states.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the committee was forced to submit an interim report
 recommending that each state produces three nominees with the
federal capital producing one.

<HEADLINE> S.African President Visits Mozambique on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano held talks with visiting his South African counterpart
Thabo Mbeki here Thursday on economic cooperation between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the meeting, Mozambican Finance
Minister Tomaz Salomao and South African Industry Minister Alec
Irwin said the two sides discussed the Cahora Bassa dam (in the
Mozambique), the building of a gas pipeline from Mozambique to
South Africa, the restructuring of the Maputo port and rail
system, and trans-border national parks.
</P>
<P>
Salomao said this was the third such high level meeting since
mid-1998, and that the discussions "are not from an immediate
perspective but from a long-term one. Our two countries have no
choice other than to cooperate."
</P>
<P>
He said that "progress" had been made over the thorny issue of
Cahora Bassa, but declined to give any details. The main problem
here is a dispute over the price at which Cahora Bassa power
should be sold to the South African electricity company, Eskom.
</P>
<P>
Eskom is insisting on paying no more than the price negotiated
in 1988, which the dam operating company, HCB, over 80 percent of
whose shares are owned by the Portuguese state, says is completely
unrealistic and out of date. HCB wants a 50 percent rise in the
tariff, and has proposed putting the matter to international
arbitration - a move not favoured by the Mozambican government.
</P>
<P>
Salomao claimed that South Africa "supports Mozambique in
discussions over Cahora Bassa." which implies that the two African
governments are in dispute with Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Moved to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chile's life-long senator
Augusto Pinochet was moved Thursday urgently to a London hospital
to undergo medical examination.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson from the Pinochet Foundation said the elderly ex
military man was taken into a British hospital and that his health
was "very delicate".
</P>
<P>
According to recent medical examination, Pinochet is suffering
from prostate gland disorder and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year old Pinochet has remained under arrest in London
since October 1998, by request of Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon,
who wants to try him for violations of human rights during the
military regime.
</P>
<P>
Chile views the Pinochet case as interference in its internal
affairs, attempting to avoid having the aging general go on trial
abroad.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Slide Amid Steep Wall St. Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets slid on
Thursday as robust U.S. economic data rekindled interest rate
fears.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 was confined to the red for all but the
opening moments of trading, with concerns over U.S. interest rates
paramount.
</P>
<P>
The index ended down 80.6 points to 6195.6, as many traders
kept a wide berth of markets ahead of U.S. unemployment figures
due out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Telecom, bank and utility stocks absorbed some of the biggest
shocks. Bank of Scotland plunged 5.68 percent to 728 pence as rate
fears rattled the sensitive financial sector.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Holdings lost 2.67 percent after it said its merger with
Republic New York may take longer to complete because of a probe
into a Republic unit. Lloyds slipped 2.55 percent, Barclays gave
back 2.78 percent, and Abbey National skid 2.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Legal &AMP; General shares rose sharply on the session, sparked by
speculation that it is about to be the subject of a takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
The life assurance group's 10 percent rise came against a
background of a limp UK stock market, depressed by weakness among
the telecom and banking shares.
</P>
<P>
German Dax closed more than 2 percent weaker at 5189.92 points,
weighed down by weaker U.S. shares.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks closed down, dragged lower by the poor performance
of both U.S. and European markets. The Cac 40 closed down 1.8
percent or 82.78 points at 4550.60.

<HEADLINE> China to Host 1999 World Habitat Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- This year's World Habitat Day
with the theme of "Cities for All" will be held in Dalian, a
northern port city in China, on October 4, Acting Executive
Director Klaus Toepfer of the U.N. Centre for Human Settlements
(Habitat) announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other activities in China include Sustainable Cities Program
(SCP) support to China's Wuhan city and disaster mitigation
measures following the Yangtze floods in 1998, Toepfer said at a
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the 1999 World Habitat Day celebrations, a
major conference will be held in Shenyang, the capital of
Liaoning Province in northeast China, starting on October 5, he
said, adding that the conference will be opened by himself.
</P>
<P>
He said China is an active partner in the global Sustainable
Cities Program (SCP), a joint program promoted by the Habitat and
the U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer explained that as a global program, the SCP provides
municipal authorities and their partners in the public, private
and community sectors with improved environment planning and
management capacities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the SCP has promoted the exchange of knowledge
and expertise among cities, undertaking demonstration projects in
some 40 cities worldwide, saying these city demonstrations
involve environment management strategies, action plans and
priority technical cooperation and capital investment projects
for the cites concerned.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Still Concerned With Security in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
continues to be gravely concerned with security conditions in East
Timor, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the violence Wednesday, the situation is relatively quiet
in Dili, the capital, but the new wave of violence is reaching
other areas of the territory, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
At least two East Timorese were killed Wednesday near the
compound of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
which conducted a ballot on the future of the half-island on
August 30.
</P>
<P>
In a fresh wave of riots, two U.N. local staffers were killed
Thursday in Maliana, some 140 kilometers west of Dili, Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
The ballot, agreed upon by Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N. on
May 5, is to determine whether the majority of the 800,000 people
in the former Portuguese colony want to stay within Indonesia with
special autonomy or to go independent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia occupied East Timor in 1975 and made it a province
the following year after Portugal's withdrawal. However the U.N.
has since called it a non-self-governing territory.
</P>
<P>
Monday's ballot saw a 98.6 percent of voter turnout and a calm
atmosphere, but violent activities followed amid speculation of
the vote in favor of the pro-independence movement. The ballot
result is expected to be announced early next week.
</P>
<P>
Security in East Timor can be restored "only by preventing
armed groups from continuing to move around and terrorize others,"
U.N. Secretary-General's special representative Ian Martin was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Martin called on the leaders of the anti-independence forces
and the Indonesian police and army "to fulfill their respective
commitments" by ordering their members not to move around with
weapons, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
News from Lisbon and Jakarta indicated that U.N. peace-keeping
efforts in East Timor are welcome, but Eckhard said there was no
contingency planning for sending peace-keeping forces there.

MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia wants to maintain the
best of relations with all the countries of the Caucasus --
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Thursday.

Moscow does not give preference to any of them, Ivanov said in

Aliyev expressed "surprise and disappointment that the Caucasus
holds a secondary role in Russian foreign policy," adding that the
Caucasus is no less a strategic part of the world than the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
On Russian-Armenian military cooperation Ivanov said that
Moscow "understands perfectly well how sensitive the subject is
for Azerbaijan and the entire region."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wheat Group Urges Clinton to Give Iran Farm Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Groups representing U.S.
wheat farmers Thursday urged the Clinton administration to extend
export credits to Iran to boost agricultural sales.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Bill Clinton, the National Association
of Wheat Growers and the Wheat Export Trade Education Committee
said the administration's decision in April to lift sanctions on
food sales to Iran was not enough.
</P>
<P>
"Export financing, especially in this case, shows our
competitors that the United States is a serious contender in the
world market," the two groups said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"Lifting sanctions without access to all of the tools that make
U.S. products competitive against monopolistic and subsidized
traders does nothing for U.S. producers," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
In April, the United States announced it would exempt food,
medicine and medical equipment from economic sanctions on Iran,
Sudan and Libya. But lawmakers and farm groups have criticized the
Clinton administration for failing to offer Iran, a potential big
buyer, credit to buy U.S. farm goods.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iran bypassed the U.S. market and bought more than
1 million metric tons of wheat from Canada. U.S. exporters have
sold a mere 50,000 metric tons of corn to Iran since the new
regulations were issued, according to the U.S. Agriculture
Department.

NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
Thursday as fears of higher interest rates spread the market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 94.67 at
10,843.21. The blue chip index fell as much as 205 points during
the trading.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 11.96 at 1,319.11 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 16.56 at 2,734.24.
</P>
<P>
Fears about higher interest rates sparked after the Labor
Department reported that the growth of American workers'
productivity slowed considerably in the second quarter while labor
costs jumped sharply.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that if new
data suggest that the pace of labor cost and price increases will
be picking up, the Federal Reserve will have to act promptly and
forcefully to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Those fears escalated as Federal Reserve Governor Edward Kelley
told Market News International Thursday that it would be premature
to assume the Federal Reserve will wait until next year to raise
rates again. The Federal Reserve raised rates twice in the past
two months in a bid to preempt inflation from the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
A dismal earnings outlook from Sears and other retailers also
helped to push stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.96 at 611.33 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 3.98 at 779.21. The Russell 2000 index of

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Goes to Hospital For Routine Medical Check: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet was taken to hospital Thursday for a routine medical
check, police in charge of his house-arrest said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who was arrested in a London hospital last October
while recovering from back surgery, had been taken to hospital for
checks a week ago.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested because a Spanish judge accused him of
responsibility for the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people
and requested his extradition to Spain to face charges.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish judge wants to try him for the human rights abuses
alleged to be committed during his 1973-1990 rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Britain is scheduled to begin the extradition proceedings from
September 27.
</P>
<P>
On Pinochet's increasingly frequent visits to the doctor for
medical checks, he is accompanied by police.
</P>
<P>
The retired general's supporters said recently they fear the
83-year-old man is not well enough to face forthcoming court
hearings in Britain and possible trial in Spain.
</P>
<P>
His health problems are said to include depression as well as
diabetes and a weak heart.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Plans to Go Public in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
board of directors decided Thursday to push back the timetable for
a possible initial sale to 2000 from Thanksgiving this year as it
sees the need to solve regulatory and tax issues first.
</P>
<P>
NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso said the exchange would work out a
strategic business plan to solve a number of "public policy
questions."
</P>
<P>
Grasso said in July he hoped investors would be able to buy
NYSE stocks by Thanksgiving. Another Wall Street big stock
exchange -- the NASDAQ Stock Market -- also showed its willingness
to go public.
</P>
<P>
They thought such a move would help them prevail against
fast-growing competition from electronic trading networks which
match buy and sell orders by computer in a cheaper way for
investors, rather than on a traditional trading floor.
</P>
<P>
Grasso said Thursday the NYSE may spin off its regulatory unit.
Federal Securities and Exchange Commission and exchanges officials
are in talks about how to provide for the independence of the
regulatory unit.
</P>
<P>
Whether initial public offering (IPO) members should pay

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Tells French How Much Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior government minister of
China told a 700-person French audience Thursday that the changes
the Chinese people have experienced in the past 100 years are the
biggest ever in their 5,000-year history.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Qizheng, director of the Information Office of China's
State Council, made the speech entitled "Chinese People Meet the
21st Century" at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) headquarters here on the first day
of the China Culture Week -- '99 Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that the purpose of his speech is to let the French
people know better about China's past and present and make a
comparison between the situation of the Chinese people at the
beginning of the 20th century and 100 years afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that 100 years ago, China was living under full
humiliations inflicted by foreign invaders and was looked down
upon by other countries.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, a Dutch dictionary published at that time
explained the word "Chinese" as "foolish men and mentally ill
men." Another example, an American newspaper published in the
early 19th century a cartoon which compared a Chinese man with a
swine.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, because of their poor health and archaic habits, the
Chinese people bore the nickname "Sick man of East Asia" until
1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
As for the status of Chinese women at the beginning of the 20th
century, Zhao said that their feet were bound and prevented from
grow since they were little girls, and they were the private
properties of their husbands after marriage.
</P>
<P>
A typical situation of Chinese women at that time was described
by Ba Jin, a famous Chinese writer, in his novel "Family," which
has been translated into French and many other languages, he said.

<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Bobby Robson looks certain to
be appointed as Newcastle United manager on Friday morning, after
traveling to St James's Park to finalize the deal.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC reports on Thursday, the 66-year-old
former England manager said that he still had some issues to
resolve, but he hoped an announcement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the club will call a news conference Friday
morning, when Robson is expected to be unveiled as Ruud Gullit's
successor.
</P>
<P>
A club statement read: "Newcastle United Football Club confirm
that they held discussions with Bobby Robson in London yesterday
with a view to him taking over the job of manager at St James's
Park."
</P>
<P>
Robson will replace Dutchman Gullit, who quit the Magpies last
Saturday after one of the worst starts to the season in the club's
history.
</P>
<P>
The team have earned just one point from six games - leaving
them second from bottom in the Premiership.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Sanctions Committee Okays Iraqi Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
committee overseeing sanctions against Iraq has approved Baghdad's
donation of 10 million U.S. dollars in oil to assist the victims
of the devastating earthquake that jolted Turkey on August 17,
U.N. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Council members did not object to Iraq's plan to provide
500,000 barrels of oil to Turkey, according to a spokesman for the
chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The donation will not count against Iraq's export limit as
governed by the United Nations oil-for-food program, which allows
Iraq to use the revenue from oil sales to purchase humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Wednesday announced its donation of 10 million U.S.
dollars in urgent oil assistance to Turkey, which suffered
devastation damage and loss of human lives caused by an earthquake
in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations
said, "The Iraqi government donated for relief a quantity of Crude
Oil equivalent in value to an amount of 10 million U.S. dollars,
to be distributed by the Turkish Red Crescent Society to the
Turkish families victims of the earthquake in Turkey."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq have started from August 29 to pump through the
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline a quantity of 100,000 barrels of oil a day
for a period of 5 days for a total of about 500,000 barrels," the
news release said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced the donation despite the hardship caused by the
continuation of what Baghdad called "the unjust comprehensive
sanctions imposed by the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"On the last day, Iraq shall pump an additional quantity to
make up of any shortage to reach an equivalent amount of 10
million U.S. dollars," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth noting that Iraq has ranked first in providing
humanitarian emergency assistance to Turkey," the news release
said. "The second rank is left to the U.S."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's sanction committee approved unofficially
Tuesday on Iraq's proposed donation in oil to Turkey's earthquake
victims, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is expected to sell the oil and donate the revenues to
the Turkish Red Crescent Society to aid those made homeless in the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil to be donated to Turkey will flow through the
same pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan that carries about 45
percent of the oil sold under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The plan, an exception to the sanctions, allows Iraq to sell
5.26 billion U.S. dollars in oil every six months to buy needed
humanitarian supplies for its people.

<HEADLINE> Redknapp and Sutton Add to Keegan Agony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Jamie Redknapp and Chris Sutton
became the latest players to pull out of Kevin Keegan's England
squad for the Euro 2000 qualifier with Luxembourg on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, Liverpool midfielder Redknapp
failed to recover from an Achilles tendon problem, while Chelsea
frontman Sutton is still troubled by a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
They will both miss the Wembley clash on Saturday - but manager
Keegan is still hopeful they will be in contention for the second
vital match in the double-header, against Poland next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These latest withdrawals take the number of players who have
pulled out of the squad for Luxembourg to six.
</P>
<P>
First-choice goalkeeper David Seaman and center-back Sol
Campbell succumbed to injury on Wednesday, while Darren Anderton
and Rio Ferdinand announced the day before that they could not
play.
</P>
<P>
There are other concerns for Keegan, with eight players in his
squad on yellow cards.
</P>
<P>
A second booking against Luxembourg would rule any of them out
of the make-or-break clash with the Poles.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "It will be at the back of my mind but I don't
want it to be at the back of the minds of the players.
</P>
<P>
"Unavoidably some of t there's nothing we can do about it. What
will be will be," he added.

<HEADLINE> Keagan Praises Robson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- England soccer manager Kevin
Keegan said Thursday that Bobby Robson is a right choice for
Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great appointment," said Keegan. "He is the
right guy at the right time."
</P>
<P>
Robson, who ended Keegan's international career as a player, is
well on his way to St. James Park. It has been reported that
Newcastle United may make an announcement Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "He's a Geordie. He obviously loves the club,
which I think is really, really important.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying Kenny (Dalglish) didn't and I'm not saying Ruud
Gullit didn't, but he knows the club. I think that's a massive
advantage," Keegan told a news conference at the England team's
hotel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Robson, who describes his loyalty by saying he bleeds the
Newcastle colors of black and white, has supported the club since
his boyhood in the north-east and has long dreamed of managing the
side.
</P>
<P>
Robson, 66, who managed England to the semifinals of the 1990
World Cup, said he expected to be in charge for the visit to
Chelsea on September 11.
</P>
<P>
He replaces Dutchman Gullit who resigned at the weekend after
Newcastle had collected just one point from their opening five
league games this season.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who revived Newcastle's fortunes during his time and
almost took them to the league title, had no hard feelings towards
Robson and said the appointment should also help players such as
England captain Alan Shearer.
</P>
<P>
Gullit dropped Shearer against local rivals Sunderland --his
last game in charge.
</P>
<P>
"I do wish him all the luck in the world. When I went there(
Newcastle) as a player that's what he wished me. He left me out of
the England side just afterwards but he did wish me all the luck
in the world," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole idea of stability will help the players,not
least Shearer," he added.

<HEADLINE> British Women Soccer Agent Wins over Men's Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- British woman Rachel Anderson,
the world only female agent licensed by soccer's governing body
FIFA, claimed victory in discrimination lawsuit on Thursday after
she was barred from the British player union's all-male awards
dinner.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reuters report, Anderson's case hinged on
whether the Professional Football Association (PFA) annual dinners
in 1997 and 1998 were public or private events. Private functions
are not subject to the Sexual Discrimination Act.
</P>
<P>
"They said it was a private event but it's very hard to argue
that when you've allowed an agency to sell tickets on your behalf
to members of the public," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
"I was obviously very pleased that I won but disappointed that
it had to go as far as that."
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who represents dozens of British professionals, won 7,
500 pounds (12,000 U.S. dollars) in damages but said that was not
the reason she brought the lawsuit against the PFA.
</P>
<P>
"I think they've realized that they've got to conform to public
opinion and a changing world," she said. "Women are part of
everyone's life whether people like it or not and certainly part
of business life and certainly football now."

LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Ireland and Manchester United
skipper Roy Keane has been forced out of his country's next two
Euro 2000 qualifiers against Croatia and Malta after aggravation
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
Keane's United teammate Denis Irwin has also been ruled out of
the games by injury against Croatia on September 4 and Malta on
September 8.
</P>
<P>
Both players, aggravated injuries in the second half of Ireland
's 2-1 defeat of Yugoslavia on Wednesday night in Dublin, came off
before the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
Irwin was replaced in defense by Tottenham Hotspur's Stephen
Carr after 66 minutes and Keane in midfield by Blackburn's Lee
Carsley three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Irish media reported that Keane, who injured his hamstring,
could also miss Manchester United's opening Champions League match
against Croatia Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
Irwin suffered a recurring injury to his Achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
Ireland manager Mick McCarthy called up Stoke's Graham Kavanagh
and Ipswich's Matt Holland to his squad.

<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Scottish Premier League
investigation into last May's Old Firm fracas has cleared Rangers
of any breach of rules.
</P>
<P>
The central charge against the Ibrox club related to their
players' post-match celebrations, which angered watching Celtic
fans.
</P>
<P>
Rangers clinched the title with victory in the match at
Parkhead on May 2 - and then appeared to mock Celtic's traditional
huddle" celebrations at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
But a commission dismissed allegations of any impropriety.
</P>
<P>
Celtic have already been fined 45,000 pounds by a separate
commission for their part in the infamous scenes, which included
referee Hugh Dallas being struck by a coin and three players red-
carded.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Tells French How Much Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhao said that 100 years later, the Chinese people are living a
totally different life and are fully confident to enter the new
millennium with other peoples of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that 100 years ago, Chinese women entered a new century
with bound feet. Today, they entered the final match of the
Women's Soccer World Cup held last summer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
This dramatic change reflected not only the great changes of
the life of Chinese women in the past 100 years, but also the
great changes lived by the whole Chinese society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that since China launched the policy of economic
reform and opening in 1978, the life style of the Chinese has been
undergoing fundamental transformations, which are reflected in
their changing culture of food, clothes, transport and housing.
</P>
<P>
With increasing incomes, more and more Chinese are capable of
making choice between Chinese food and Western food, including
French wine and cheese, and are traveling abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Western suits, jeans, sportswear, and feminine pret-a-porter
have already become commonalities for Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the Chinese people are becoming more choosy
about what they should buy. For instance, they are wondering
whether they should accept too much American culture like
Disneyland and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people are also more and more familiar with the role
and function of laws and legal rules in their life and are using
them to protect their personal interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
He gave "Qiu Ju Makes Suit Against Her Husband," a film
starring actress Gong Li, as an example of how an ordinary woman
in the Chinese countryside can take advantage of the protection of
law to seek a better life.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Seles, Williams Advance at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi knows that it
does not take much to go from tournament favorite to early-round
loser. So he did not take any chances today against Axel Pretzsch.
</P>
<P>
Agassi dispatched the German qualifier 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 to advance
to the third round at the U.S. Open Tennis Championships in New
York.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, two-time winner and fourth seed Monica
Seles of the United States cruised past Silvia Farina of Italy 6-2,
6-2 in 62 minutes. She won the title here in 1991 and 1992, and
appeared in the final in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Appearing in her second U.S. Open, seventh seed Serena Williams
of the United States faced a player with less experience than she
and dominated Croatian qualifier Jelena Kostanic 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Favored to win his second Grand Slam of the season since No. 1
Pete Sampras and two-time defending champion Patrick Rafter of
Australia pulled out due to injuries, Agassi never was truly
pushed during the 94-minute match.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded American made 26 unforced errors but won 76
percent of his first-service points, hit 32 winners and converted
6-of-10 break points. He improved to 21-2 lifetime against
qualifiers at Grand Slams.
</P>
<P>
He won the Frnehc Open in June and could become the No. 1
player in the world if he goes farther in the draw than third seed
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
In action involving men's seeds, 10th seed Marcelo Rios of
Chile overcame a slow start to get past George Bastl of
Switzerland 4-6,6-3, 6-2, 6-2; No. 12 Richard Krajicek of the
Netherlands moved into the third round with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-1 win
over Lorenzo Manta of Switzerland; and No. 15 Nicolas Kiefer of
Germany topped countryman Michael Kohlmann 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Michael Chang of the United States takes on Arnaud
Clement of France in a battle of unseeded players.
</P>
<P>
In the women's battles, the 25-year-old Seles took advantage of
24 unforced errors by Farina and hit 21 winners as she raised her
record at the U.S. Open to 40-6. She will face Ai Sugiyama of
Japan, who defeated Karina Habsudova of Slovakia 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Second seed and defending champion Lindsay Davenport of the
United States plays Dragomir of Romania tonight. Davenport cruised
past doubles partner Corina Morariu 6-0, 6-3 on Tuesday. She has
never lost to Dragomir in four all-time meetings.

<HEADLINE> New Thinking Brings Success to Miao People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Miao ethnic minority
people in southwest China's Guizhou Province are ridding
themselves of the outdated notion that "one ought not leave their
hometown no matter how poor," and many of them are now earning a
good living in other places.
</P>
<P>
The Miao people of the Miao-Dong Qiandongnan Autonomous
Prefecture once dared not make friends with the Han people because
they had been ill-treated by the Kuomintang troops before the
founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
They were forced to give up their folk costumes and their own
language, and the Kuomintang soldiers would cut short the hair of
the Miao women.
</P>
<P>
But now it is a common sight to see Miao people intermarry with
other ethnic groups, and some families are made up of three or
four different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also provided opportunities for
ethnic minorities to become better trained. Over 1,300 Miao
officials in the province had been sent to colleges by the year
1956 when the prefecture was established.
</P>
<P>
And now, one-third of all prefecture officials, or more than 20,
000, are Miaos.
</P>
<P>
Miao people used to think that they could only survive by
farming, even though 80 percent of them could not even feed
themselves by just working on the farm before the founding of New
China.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the 1.57 million Miao people in the prefecture no
longer worry about how they will eat tomorrow, as more and more
Miaos have left their hometowns to enter business elsewhere since
the implementation of the opening-up and reform policies two
decades ago.

<P>
Thousands of Miao women in a county of Kaili City, the first
place with regional autonomy for minorities, have left their
hometown to sell folk-style jewelry, and many of them have gone as
far as Myanmar and Russia.
</P>
<P>
There are some 40,000 to 50,000 young people of Sansui County,
another place mainly inhabited by Miaos, working outside the
county, and many of them return with money and skills and start
their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that the county's young workers now
earn a total of over 100 million yuan ( about 12 million U.S.
dollars) a year, and remittance back to the county is more than 30
million yuan, twice that of the annual revenue for the whole
county.
</P>
<P>
The Miao people have also learned to earn a living by
exploiting their special customs and traditions. Foe example,
there are some 39 Miao traditional living compounds in Qiandongnan
Prefecture that have been developed into tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Folk dances, wonderful folk music, and special costumes and
houses are attracting many tourists, and every household in one of
the compounds, called Langde, for example, will earn over 20,000
yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has been named one of the top ten ethnic
minority cultural tourism attractions in the world by the United
Nations Folk Culture Fund for its spectacular customs and natural
scenery.
</P>
<P>
The Miao ethnic minority now live mostly in the southeastern
part of Guizhou, in south China's Guangxi and Hainan provinces,
and in the border areas of the Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Yuannan
provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAHSA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Luo Yu, a 60-year old road
worker, made a special trip to express his deep thanks to Aduo, a
Tibetan doctor in the village of Luelang in southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Luo wouldn't have recovered without the Tibetan medicine, he
told the 56-year old doctor. Luo had suffered from gall-stones for
a year before getting Aduo's help earlier this year. A recent
examination showed that the gall-stones had disappeared completely.
</P>
<P>
Luelang lies in a valley where for generations Tibetans have
had a reputation for the use of leeches to treat ailments and Aduo
began learning Tibetan medicine at the age of 8.
</P>
<P>
In the past, both serf owners and serfs came to them for
treatment, he said, and they were very busy but got little pay.
Sometimes they were even beaten by the serf owners and had to make
a living however they could.
</P>
<P>
After New China was established, Aduo and other Tibetan doctors
were given land but were also encouraged to develop traditional
Tibetan medicine, and doctors in the village now use 250 kinds of
herbal medicines and have developed more than 100 kinds of
traditional Tibetan medicines.

Earlier this year, Ceringmar, a local herdsman, complained of
having been sick for months with a cold and fever, but he was able
to resume his work after 2 months of treatment by Aduo.
</P>
<P>
There are six people in Audo's family. His children study or
work in other places outside the village. The family's annual
average income is more than 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the humid climate in the county caused a serious skin
disease to spread, affecting hundreds of people and Western
medicine didn't seem to help.
</P>
<P>
But, Aduo developed a medicine from herbs and minerals and
cured most of the patients. More recently, he developed a new
medicine to treat bronchitis in children and 400 Tibetan children
were cured.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is an important part of traditional Chinese
medicine, Audo said, and he is determined to continue research and
development in his field.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Imports Large Amount of Edible Oil in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar imported a total of 112
million U.S. dollars' worth of edible oil in fiscal 1998-99, which
ended in March, according to the latest official figures published
by the country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
Of a total of over 340,000 tons of annual consumption of edible
oil by the Myanmar people, per capita consumption of the oil
reached 7.3 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Although annual domestic production of edible oil is just over
180,000 tons, the country still needs to import nearly 160,000
tons of the oil annually, which accounts for 46.6 percent of the
country's total oil demand.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for Myanmar's domestic insufficiency of edible
oil are said to be due to less cultivated areas for oil crops,
low annual per-hectare output and fast increase of population.

<HEADLINE> WFP Praises China's Efforts in Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's achievement in poverty
alleviation has attracted worldwide attention and served as a
model for many countries, a senior official of the World Food
Program (WFP) said in a recent interview here with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 20 years, the impoverished population in China
has been decreasing by an annual average of 10 million and this is
a great success for China," said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director
in charge of Asian affairs, who made a working visit to China last
month.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the past 20 years, in contrast to the
worsening situation of poverty in many countries and regions, the
Chinese government allocated huge amounts of funds for poverty
alleviation, and by the end of 1998, the impoverished population
in rural areas dropped to 42 million from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Hopkins said she was satisfied with the implementation of the
WFP's 62 development projects and three emergency projects in
China at a value of 876 U.S. million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hopkins, who has 21 years of experience in the U.N. system,
said that since the mid-1980s, China has implemented integrated
agricultural development projects instead of direct food aid in
the impoverished regions. "These projects are very appreciated by
the WFP."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government's high political will and right
policy have guaranteed the successful poverty relief work, she
expressed confidence that China will eventually win the battle
against poverty.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial city, will begin to gain status as a key
international city by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"By then, Shanghai will basically reach the level of a modern
international metropolis in terms of overall economic strength,
economic structure, city layout, and cultural and educational
progress," said Mayor Xu Kuangdi in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Xu, also an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
said that by then the city will haven taken major steps toward its
final goal of becoming an international center of economy, finance
and trade.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, what Shanghai has achieved over the past 50
years has laid a firm foundation for further development.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 when the People's Republic was founded, to the mid-
sixties, Xu said, the city managed to create a complete industrial
system comprising nearly every industry and began playing a major
role in helping the country form an independent industrial system.
</P>
<P>
China's first 10,000-ton ocean-going vessel, first missile,
first satellite, and first jumbo jet were all manufactured in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The central government's 1990 decision to turn the Pudong New
Area in the eastern part of Shanghai into a financial and trade
zone has given great impetus to the local economy.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Becomes 5th Largest Recipient of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has become the
fifth largest recipient country of foreign investment in the world
and the third largest in Latin America over the past five years,
the authorities said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The annual foreign investment inflow to Mexico has increased
from 3 billion U.S. dollars to an average 11 billion dollars since
President Ernesto Zedillo took power in 1994, said Carlos Garcia,
chief of Foreign Investment at the Secretariat of Trade.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's foreign investment totaled 15 billion dollars at the
end of 1994, and amounted to over 60 billion dollars by last June,
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
The investment increase was attributed mainly to Mexico's entry
into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) at the end of
1993.

The city has since shifted its focus of development from the
processing industry to finance, trade, information technology, and
other new and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Shanghai achieved 368.8 billion
yuan in gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998, and its per capita
GDP topped 28,000 yuan, ranking the first in the country.

electrical equipment, chemicals, and electric home appliances, and
16 percent from the sectors of integrated circuitry and computers,
pharmaceuticals, and new materials.
</P>
<P>
A series of State-level exchanges have been established in

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Produces 1 Mln Barrels of Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced a total of
1.108 million barrels of crude oil in the first four months of
this year, a reduction of 60,000 barrels as compared with the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data published by the country's Central
Statistical Organization, the output of natural gas was 563
million cubic-meters during the period, a drop of 29 million
cubic-meters as compared with the corresponding period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of April this year, foreign investment in the oil
and gas sector coming from Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia,
Japan, Thailand and the United States had reached 2.3 billion U.S.
dollars in 46 projects, accounting for 32.39 percent of the 7.108
billion dollars' total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Myanmar's crude oil and petroleum products are still
self-insufficient and the country has to import 280,000 to 300,000
tons of crude oil and 100,000 to 150,000 tons of diesel oil
annually, the official statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Mia Audina Hopes to Lift Dutch Players to Higher Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Dutch women's team coach
Judith Meulendjiks is hopeful the presence of former Indonesian
number one Mia Audina on her squad will lift her players to a
higher level.
</P>
<P>
Meulendjiks, who also plays singles on the team in Indonesia
Open currently held in Denpasar, capital of Bali, said she was
happy to have Mia on the national team.
</P>
<P>
She said she expected her to compete in the Grand Prix
tournament series for the Netherlands and also represent the
country in the Uber Cup, the sport's most prestigious women's team
event.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can learn a lot from her as she was the 1996 Olympic
silver medalist. Hopefully, she will lift us to a higher level and
will boost our side when we compete in the Uber Cup in 2002," she
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mia sparked controversy when she decided to move to the
Netherlands with her Surinamese-born husband Tylio Lobman, who
also holds Dutch citizenship. They married in March.
</P>
<P>
Mia was scheduled to represent the Netherlands for the first
time in last week's Singapore Open but the International Badminton
Federation (IBF) ruled her ineligible because she remained under
dual jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) complained to the
IBF that Mia officially left the association on August 12 and
could not play for a new country.
</P>
<P>
IBF rules stipulate a player can only represent a second
country after residing there for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
Dutch national team coach Robbie Kneefel said he was unaware of
Mia's training program.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the chance to speak to Mia because we had to
leave for Singapore when she arrived in the Netherlands. But my
training director Martijn Doormalen told me that she might be able
to compete in the Dutch Open, German Open, Danish Open, Hong Kong
Open and China Open," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mia is scheduled to train with the national team at the
Netherlands Badminton Center in Utrecht five times a week. Mia
lives in Rotterdam,about 45 minutes from Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
Meulendjiks said she would recommend that Mia play in a German
club and compete in the German league.
</P>
<P>
"In the Netherlands, there are not as many clubs and
competitions as in Germany. I played for Langenfeld together with
Sweden's Margit Borg and Kelly Morgan of Wales. I think it's
better for Mia to consider playing in Germany," she added.

<HEADLINE> Larsen's Poor Performance Disappointing, Danish Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Danish team manager Thomas
Lund was disappointed with men's singles second seed Poul-Erik
Hoyer-Larsen's poor performance in the Indonesia Open badminton
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Larsen had to unexpectedly bow out to Malaysian rookie Yap Yong
Jyen 13-15, 12-15 in the third round of the tournament in Bali on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Hoyer-Larsen didn't play really well today (Thursday). He
seemed like he didn't have any confidence. Yap played well and
used many chances. Under normal circumstances, Hoyer-Larsen would
win," Lund was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, the 1996 Olympics gold medalist and world number
four, could not hide his disappointment with his poor result.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to finish the match immediately but I lost control.
Statistically, I would have won over him in nine of the 10 matches.
I believed I wouldn't lose to him, but I underestimated him. I'm
quite disappointed in the way I was playing. Actually, it was a
very good draw, so I can't complain to anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lund also commented on another Dane player Peter Rasmussen's
performance against Indonesian Hendrawan.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan, ranked 17th in the world defeated world number seven
and fourth-seeded in the tournament Rasmussen 15-6, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
"He was on the bad side of the court in the first set. I think
he played quite well and tried to use his chances. But Hendrawan
survived some bad points. Hendrawan could control the game and the
win. He also played really good nets, he's a very confident player,
" Lund said.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time Rasmussen lost to the Indonesian players.
In the early rounds, he also bowed out to Marlev Mainaky in the
second round of the Singapore Open last week.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Regional Industrial Sector Being Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
spent 3.12 million U.S. dollars on infrastructure development of
the regional industrial sector to reduce unemployment at regional
level, media sources said.
</P>
<P>
So far 5, 000 direct employment opportunities have been
provided in 32 industries which are operating in 14 industrial
parks in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Once these establishments are in full operation, they will
generate 20,000 direct employment opportunities, Northwestern
Provincial Minister of Health and Cooperatives Jayaratne Herath
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister spoke at Wednesday's seminar for local
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was in connection with plans to establish a
multi-purpose industrial city on a 55 acre block of land in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for support from local industrialists to
extend their cooperation for the success of the project, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the current government's industrial policy was
based on a multi-pronged strategy which features the promotion of
export-oriented industries and the provision of a comprehensive
network of infrastructure facilities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arctic Research Highlights Global Climate Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Because it is an
important influence on the world's climate, the North Pole's
impact on the earth was the focus of the recently concluded
Chinese arctic research expedition, Chen Liqi, chief scientist of
the expedition, said today.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the homeward-bound ship Snow Dragon, Chen pointed out
that the resources and environmental changes of the North Pole may
potentially influence the environment in the future.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that in the past 50 years, the temperature in some
polar areas rose one to two degrees centigrade, the frozen earth
belt moved northward, and glaciers receded.
</P>
<P>
These phenomena, accompanied by an ever thinner ozone layer,
has intensified the amount of ultraviolet radiation, and obviously
this indicates changes in the global climate.
</P>
<P>
Considering that the interaction between cold airflow from the
Arctic and hot airflow from the tropics deeply affects China's
climate, Chinese scientists are intensely focused on the Arctic
effects, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"China will benefit from Arctic research," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
During the recent Arctic research, one major subject of concern
was how the eco-system and biologic resources of the Arctic Ocean
will affect the development of the Chinese fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
China has been engaged in Arctic research since the 1980s, and
took part in the International Arctic Science Committee in 1996.
This January, the Chinese State Council approved China's first
Arctic expedition, which came to a successful end last week.

<HEADLINE> Software Piracy Continues to Impair U.S. Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A Microsoft-sponsored
study released Thursday showed that software piracy still inflicts
a severe impact on states and local communities across the United
States, despite increased attention to the issue from both
government and industry.
</P>
<P>
The software piracy rates rose last year in the country's 21
states, including California and Virginia, where much of the
recent growth in the technology sector has been fueled.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have made some gains in protecting intellectual
property and reducing the impact of software piracy worldwide,"
Microsoft said in a statement, "criminal counterfeiting and the
Internet has posed distinct challenges for Microsoft and the rest
of the software industry in battling this issue."
</P>
<P>
According to the study, losses for the 10 most affected states
including California, Texas and New York amounted to some 3.5
billion U.S. dollars, or 57 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, communities nationwide lost over 1 billion dollars in
tax revenues, about 40 million dollars above the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
The study said that 29 states had piracy rates higher than the
national average of 25 percent. And eight states among them had
rates over 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that last year it filed actions against 168
resellers for distributing counterfeit software and hard disk
loading -- the practice of installing pirated software in
computers sold to consumers.
</P>
<P>
The company did not say how much it suffered in terms of money,
but confirmed that more than 43 million units of counterfeit
Microsoft software were seized in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumers using counterfeit software could find they are
missing key elements including computer code, have higher risk of
viruses, and are ineligible for technical support or upgrade, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
By pirating software or spending money on counterfeit products,
Microsoft added, consumers also are inadvertently contributing to
causing losses in the form of tax revenue and employment in an
industry that has recently been responsible for much of the growth
of the U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> Polar Research to Be Int's Scientific Focus Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Scientific research in the
North and South poles will become a hot research topic in the
international scientific community in the new century, said
Chinese scientists who have just completed their 56-day Arctic
expedition, the first of its kind by Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi, the home-bound chief scientist of the Chinese North
Pole expedition, said: "The earth is a whole system, in which the
North and South poles are playing an ever increasing role."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the peculiar geographic positions and the
unique natural environments of the poles provide ideal locations
to study the evolution of the earth and the global climate changes.
</P>
<P>
"Global changes and human environmental problems have become
not only a research object for scientists, but also a major
concern for more and more political figures. In the next century,
many more governments and scientists will join the cause of polar
study," said the chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
Chen is also in charge of China's polar research activities.
China's first North Pole expedition demonstrated China's concern
about the world's environmental problems, and Chinese scientists'
strong sense of responsibility to make contributions to precisely
forecasting and solving environmental problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned in particular that 15 years ago, the late senior
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the purpose of China
's polar research is "to make due contributions for the peaceful
use of the polar areas."
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi also said that "the ability to conduct polar
expedition is a clear illustration of a nation's comprehensive
national strength, especially its scientific and technological
establishment. With China's scientific research level elevated to
a new high, we will be more active in polar research, mainly on
environmental issues."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Rate Highest in 33 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 2 (Xinhua) -- With low prices and buyers
flush with cash, the U.S. auto industry sales rate in August hit
the highest level in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
A report from Detroit on Thursday said total vehicle sales rose
by 20.4 percent. August sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 17.8 million light vehicles, compared to a 14.8 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division as a group
sold 987,333 cars and light trucks last month -- a 26-percent
increase over the strike-torn August of a year ago. The American
nameplates captured about 66 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies in Europe saw sales increase by about 29 percent,
while American automakers in Asia gained about 7 percent as a
group.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that several economic conditions -- low
unemployment, low inflation, low interest rates -- have combined
to keep vehicles affordable.
</P>
<P>
They do not see the recent increase in short-term interest
rates as having a dramatic effect on vehicle sales for the rest of
this year. A strong job market has buoyed the consumer confidence,
while household income has gone up steadily.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Peruvians Remit 1 Billion Dollars Home Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 2 (Xinhua)-- Peruvians living abroad remit
around 1 billion U.S. dollars to their families every year,
reports from Lima said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Remittances are fundamental for many families, especially the
middle and lower middle classes. In our investigation we have
found that many families depend exclusively on the remittances",
Professor Teofilo Altamirano of the Ponticia Catholic University
said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Investigators estimated that the sum of money sent back is up
to some 1 billion dollars every year, but it's difficult to know
exactly how much money overseas Peruvians have remit home.
</P>
<P>
Altamirano said that in the case of Western Union, one of the
firms that transfers money, the monthly movement of capital is
around 10 million dollars, with an average of 500 dollars per
remittance, which represented about 10 percent of the total
remittances sent back to Peru.
</P>
<P>
Western Union and its main competitors represented 29 percent
of remittances, while another 25 percent was made through banks
and the remaining sum (around 600 million dollars) was brought
into Peru through informal channels, he added.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
The Indian National Congress:
</P>
<P>
The Congress, founded in 1885 to oppose British rule, has ruled
India for around 45 of the 50 years since independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Jawahar Lal Nehru ruled India as its first prime minister at
the head of a Congress government from 1947 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, headed the country's Congress
government twice from 1966 to 1977 and from 1980 to 1984 when she
was killed by her body guard.
</P>
<P>
Rajiv Gandhi replaced his mother as Congress leader and prime
minister in 1984 and he was assassinated in 1989 by a suicide
bomb.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, a minority Congress government took office
and won over enough members of parliament to attain a majority
after two years.
</P>
<P>
The party got only 141 seats in the 545-member low house of
parliament in the 1998 elections. In order to prevent the Indian
People's Party (BJP) from coming to power, the Congress, which
could not come to power itself, decided to offer its support from
outside to the UF which then formed a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, 1998, Sonia Gandhi, who was appointed new
president of the Congress Party on March 14, was unanimously
elected as chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party.
</P>
<P>
The Congress in its 1999 election manifesto pledged to provide
a "stable, able and experienced government" if it were elected in
the coming Lok Sabha elections.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's Party):
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party, founded in 1980 as a breakaway
group of the People's party, is the largest parliamentary party in
India. The BJP got its first taste of power at the national level
after the inconclusive 1996 elections during which the party won
193 seats with its alliance. Its government, however, fell within
a fortnight after failing to establish a majority in the hung
parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998 elections, the BJP obtained 182 seats in the
Lower House of parliament and on March 19, 1998, Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, leader of BJP, was sworn-in as Indian prime Minister at
the head of a two-tied 43 member coalition which included a number
of new faces.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1999, the 13-month Vajpayee coalition government
was defeated by one vote in the vote of confidence in the Lower
House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In its manifesto of 1999 election, the BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance pledged to continue the reform process to
ensure that the national economy grow on the principle that "India
shall be built by Indians."

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- India is one of the
countries with an ancient civilization in the world. It became a
unified country in 4th century BC.
</P>
<P>
European colonists began to invade India in the 16th century.
The Pulasi War between India and Britain broke out in 1757. India
was defeated and became a British colony. Britain occupied all the
territory of India in 1849.
</P>
<P>
An uprising against the British by the Indian people took place
in 1857.
</P>
<P>
In June 1947, Britain promulgated "Mountbatten Plan", which
divided India into India and Pakistan. After a prolonged struggle
against British colonial rule, India became independent within the
commonwealth on August 15, 1947. In November 1949, the Constituent
Assembly approved a republican Constitution, providing for a
president as head of state.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Considers Converting Vehicles Into Natural Gas Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
considering converting all its vehicles to compressed-natural gas
(CNG) users and establishing CNG filling stations across the
country to combat air pollution, The Bangladesh Observer reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials were quoted as saying that an inter-ministerial
meeting recently decided that a formal proposal would be presented
to the Establishment Ministry in consultation with the Environment
Ministry, and another proposal to the Dhaka Urban Transport
Authority and Air Quality Management Project to bring all the
three-stroke engine vehicles under the CNG program.
</P>
<P>
The issue of expanding CNG use will be placed in the next
meeting of the National Environment Council, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to encourage the state-owned
Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) to go for plying
gas-fueled "dedicated engine" buses, following a positive response
from the BRTC.
</P>
<P>
A BRTC representative said they got a good result in running
buses with natural gas on experimental basis and the cost didn't
widely vary in comparison with diesel-engine buses.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,050 vehicles have been transformed into CNG-users since
the government initiated the program about 10 years ago to protect
the environment from diesel and petrol and save foreign exchange,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in the Bangladeshi capital has reached a very
high level due to emission of suspended particulate materials by
pollution vehicles at an increasing rate, according to a survey
conducted by the Department of Environment on the air quality in
the city.
</P>
<P>
About 160,000 motorized vehicles are operating in Dhaka
metropolitan area at present, with about one-third of them having
no fitness certificates, according to the Bangladesh Road
Transport Authority.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's First Private EPZ to Be Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The development work of
Bangladesh's first private export processing zone (EPZ) on 68
hectares of land will begin in the second week of October this
year, the Independent daily newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A large number of foreign investors from Singapore, United
States of America and Europe have expressed their keen interest in
the Rangunia Export Processing Zone (REPZ), which is located at
Rangunia, about 30 kilometers away from the country's southeastern
sea-port city of Chittagong, A. Qaiyum Chowdhury, managing
director of the Chittagong Industrial Park Limited, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The REPZ would be divided into information technology valley
and agro-valley, and initially, a total of 100 industrial plots
including 20 for heavy industries would be developed over 42.4
hectares of land, Chowdhury said, adding that ultimately the
number of plots would increase to 250 and the area of the REPZ
would also be expanded to 280 hectares of land in phases.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.5 billion taka (about 50 million U.S. dollars) would be
spent for the infrastructural development of the REPZ, and with
implementation of the project, 25 billion taka (about 505 million
dollars) would be invested creating job opportunities for over
50,000 people, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The project would include a golf course, an artificial lake, a
recreational park, a greenbelt, an international standard hotel
and recreation center, and the project area would also be
surrounded by a ring road, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, one 100-megawatt capacity generator would be installed
in the project site and one jetty and container terminal would
also be set up in the REPZ site, he said, hoping that the
operation of the zone would begin in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor to End by 2005 in Nepal: Industrialist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Child labor from the carpet
industry, one of the biggest employers of child labor, could be
wiped out by the year 2005, The Kathmandu Post quoted a carpet
industrialist as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to wipe out child labor from the country
within the next six years," said carpet industrialist Bimal Nepal,
who is also general secretary of the National Society for
Protection of Environment and Children (NASPEC), an organization
working to phase out child labor.
</P>
<P>
Nepal was addressing an interaction program on NASPEC's Role on
Phasing Out Child Labor from the Carpet Industry Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The phasing-out process includes rescuing child workers from
the carpet industry and rehabilitating them with non-formal
education, counseling, health services and vocational training.
Over one thousand child workers have been rescued by the
organization.
</P>
<P>
There are 2.6 million child workers in Nepal which make up
nearly half of the child population in the country. About half of
them have worked without pay.
</P>
<P>
A research conducted by the organization revealed that 46
percent of child workers were aged between 10 and 12, followed by
40 percent aged 13 and 14. Most of these children came from the
central region of Nepal.

<HEADLINE> IAAF to Clear Jayasinghe of Doping Charges: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The world athletics ruling
body IAAF is set to clear Sri Lanka's 1997 world 200m runner-up
Susanthika Jayasinghe of doping charges, a press report said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe's manager Tony Campbell was quoted as saying in the
English language The Island newspaper that the IAAF was expected
to exonerate her within a week.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Campbell as saying that the IAAF had actually
cleared her of any wrongdoing in July but an announcement had been
delayed because the organization was involved in arranging the
world athletics championships in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF secretary apologized to me and said that since they
had so many other work including organizing the world games he
could not attend to this matter," Campbell was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, who tested positive for a banned steroid, was
suspended in April last year, but her ban was lifted four months
later after a local hearing. However, the IAAF was unhappy over
the inquiry and referred her case to an arbitration panel.

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
In January 1980, a general election to the House of the People
was held. The Indian National Congress received 42.7 percent of
the total votes and won an overwhelming majority (352) of the
elective seats. Indira Gandhi was reinstated as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 and 1984, disturbances occurred in Jammu and Kashmir
during local elections.
</P>
<P>
In October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by militant
Sikh members of her personal guards. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, was
immediately sworn in as prime minister. The widespread communal
violence that erupted throughout India, resulting in more than
2,000 deaths, was curbed by the prompt action of the government.
</P>
<P>
In the January 1985 election polling, the Indian National
Congress received 49.2 percent of the total votes and won 403 of
the 513 contested seats.
</P>
<P>
In February 1986, there were mass demonstrations and strikes
throughout India in protest against the government-imposed
increases of the prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
In June 1986, Laldenga, the leader of the Mizo National Front
(MNF), signed a peace agreement with Rajiv Gandhi, thus ending
Mizoram's 25 years of rebellion.
</P>
<P>
During 1987, the Indian National Congress experienced serious
political setbacks. It sustained defeats in a number of state
elections, and political tensions were intensified by an open
dispute between the prime minister and the outgoing president,
Giani Zail Singh.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a more confrontational style was adopted by the
central administration towards non-Indian National Congress state
governments, and presidential rule was imposed in states suffering
political instability.
</P>
<P>
In November 1989, the Indian National Congress lost its overall
majority (193 of the 525) in the general election to the House of
the People. On December 2, after the National Front promised the
support of the communist parties and the BJP, V.P. Singh was sworn
in as the new prime minister.

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
In November 1990, one of the prime minister's leading rivals in
the Janata Dal, Chandra Shekhar, formed his own dissident faction,
known as the Janata Dal (Socialist) or Janata Dal (S) (which
merged with the Janata party in April 1991 to become the Samajwadi
Party). And he was sworn in as prime minister on November 10,
1990.
</P>
<P>
On May 21, 1991, after the first day of the general election,
Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. The remaining election was
postponed until mid-June. The final result gave Indian National
Congress 227 of the 511 seats contested, the BJP won 119 seats.
</P>
<P>
On January 16, 1993, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's
59-member Cabinet resigned to make for a new set of ministers to
help deal with the religious crisis (at least 70 more people there
died in Muslim-Hindu clashes).
</P>
<P>
On December 22, 1994, the health minister, the food minister
and a junior development minister resigned from their posts after
being accused of official corruption (participating in commodities
and stock market scams).
</P>
<P>
On October 28, 1995, President Shankar Dayal Sharma dissolved
the Uttar Pradesh State legislature on the recommendation of Prime
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and imposed federal rule. The
Legislature's dismissal was to keep the BJP from forming a new
government ahead of the elections and establishing a political
grip there.

NEW DELHI, September 3 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
In late April and early May 1996, a general election was held.
The largest party in terms of seats was the BJP, which won 160
seats. While the Indian National Congress gained 136 seats, the
National Front and Left Front together obtained 179 seats.
</P>
<P>
On May 15, President Shankar Dayal Sharma appointed Atal Bihari
Vajpayee as prime minister to form a new government, which
resigned ahead of a parliamentary confidence vote that was
virtually certain to be negative on May 28.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, the new United Front coalition government of Prime
Minister Deve Gowda, appointed by the president on May 28, won a
vote of confidence in the Parliament, ending a period of
administrative paralysis since the May election.
</P>
<P>
On July 25, 1997, Kocheril Raman Narayanan, a member of
Hinduism's lowest caste, was sworn in as president. He earned
about 95 percent of the 5,000 votes on July 14.
</P>
<P>
On December 2, President Narayanan dissolved the Parliament and
announced the parliamentary election would be held in February
1998.
</P>
<P>
From February 16, 1998, India started its general elections and
after three phases of polling on February 16, 22, and 28, the
election process in most of the country's 545 constituencies had
been virtually concluded on March 7. The Bharatiya Janata party
(BJP) and the Indian National Congress, the two major national
political parties, got 182 and 141 of 545 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, Sonia Gandhi, new president of the Congress Party,
was unanimously elected chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary
Party.
</P>
<P>
On March 19, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the BJP was sworn
in as Indian prime minister at the head of a two-tied 43-member
coalition which included a number of new faces.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1999, the BJP-led government resigned immediately
after losing the vote of confidence by 269 to 270 in the House of
the People. President Narayanan asked Prime Minister Vajpayee to
continue as caretaker till alternative arrangements were made.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, India's caretaker cabinet headed by Vajpayee
decided to recommend to President Narayanan to dissolve the lower
house of parliament as no political party and its allies could be
able to provide a stable majority government.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Sets Deadline for Troop Deployment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has set
October 31 as the deadline for a bill regulating its troop
deployment, especially outside the country, the New Vision
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to State Minister of Defense Steven
Kavuma Thursday, Prime Minister Apollo Nsibambi asked him to
prepare the bill under the Constitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that some MPs demanded such a bill for
consideration when President Yoweri Museveni addressed the
Parliament on the issue of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) on August 30.
</P>
<P>
Nsibambi considered the bill as an urgent matter following the
recent controversy over Ugandan troops deployed in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Under article 210 of Uganda's Constitution, Parliament shall
make laws regulating the Uganda People's Defense Forces, in
particular its deployment of troops outside the country.
</P>
<P>
MPs recently grilled the president over his sending troops to
the DRC without consulting the legislature while the president
insisted that he did not have to do so because it was not
declaring war with a third country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's deployment of forces in the DRC soon after the
rebellion eruption on August 2, 1998 has been blamed for the
country's current economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The government argued that its troops were there to secure the
safety of its borders vulnerable to attacks from rebels of the
DRC-based Allied Democratic Forces.
</P>
<P>
There has been a domestic outcry for its pullout and some donor
 countries have been pressing the Ugandan government to reduce its
surging defense budget.

<P>
On Wednesday, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel rejected the
amnesty law, which had he approved it, would have freed almost
half of the country's convicts.
</P>
<P>
The president's rejection was in response to the public outcry
over the law, which would have put hundreds of killers and mafia
leaders back on the streets once it was legislated.
</P>
<P>
Demirel has sent the bill back to the parliament, asking
legislators to make revisions that take "justice, rules of
equality and public conscience" into account.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Turkish Prime Minister Develet Bahceli has said it is
natural for the president to listen to the public opinion and
veto the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
"But we wish he had to listen to the government as well, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Demirel Thursday approved a bill that offers
conditional pardon for journalists and writers who have been
jailed for expressing their views.
</P>
<P>
Judicial officials said that at least 50 journalists and
writers will benefit from the conditional pardon.
</P>
<P>
The president also approved another law that pardons civil
servants who have violated the discipline codes.

<HEADLINE> EU to Help S. Africa's Neighbors Cope With Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
is ready to provide aid for South Africa's neighbors to shield
them from the adverse impact of the EU-South African free trade
deal, a visiting EU trade official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Philip Lowe, director-general for development in the
EU, said the promised financial support, in the form of budgetary
support, was not compensation, Business Day reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A study by the South African Foundation has estimated that the
scrapping of tariffs on EU imports could shave as much as 3.5
billion rand (574 million U.S. dollars) off government revenues
for South Africa's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Southern African Customs Union partners --
Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland -- depend heavily on
their large share of the pooled revenue from tariffs on European
goods.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho and Swaziland each derive over 40 percent of their
total government revenue from the pool.
</P>
<P>
The EU-South African free trade deal is expected to be
implemented in January next year. The deal promises to free as
much as 90 percent of bilateral trade in 12 years.

MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
when a five-seater Cesna 150 light plane crashed Thursday morning
in southern Philippines, a report of the Philippine News Agency
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Southern Command Chief Lt. General Edgardo
Espinosa as saying that no survivors were found at the crash site
at Piakan Bay in Zamboanga del Norte province in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Espinosa said a floating body was recovered at the site, but
the cadavers remain unidentified for lack of identification papers
on them.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the plane came from Dumaguete city in
Negros Oriental province, but the destination of the plane is
still unknown.
</P>
<P>
A team of divers from the Naval was dispatched to the area to
check the plane submerged in meters of sea water.
</P>
<P>
The search has been hampered by near zero visibility because of
intermittent rains in the area for the past two weeks, said the

<HEADLINE> 600 Illegal Aliens Arrested in Kenyan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Police in Kenya's capital
Nairobi have arrested more than 600 suspected illegal aliens,
recovering two pistols and some assorted pieces of communications
equipment in a night swoop.
</P>
<P>
The operation which began shortly before midnight Wednesday and
went on till Thursday morning was conducted by a 1,000-strong
force, including officers from the paramilitary general service
unit, the regular police and the administration police, local
newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi Provincial Police officer Peter Mbuvi said Thursday the
swoop was mainly intended to nab illegal aliens, illegal
possessors of firearms and communications equipment as well as
suspects with stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
Mbuvi noted that the arrested suspects, including Somalis and
Ethiopians, comprised refugees who had sneaked out of the camps,
illegal aliens residing in the country and those possessing either
firearms or other equipment illegally.
</P>
<P>
For the refugees arrested, he stated, they would have to either
be taken back to refugee camps or be repatriated back to their
respective countries. Others will be charged in court and illegal
aliens be deported.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced on July 22 this year
the closure of Kenyan-Somali border citing rampant insecurity and
influx of firearms into Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Mbuvi reiterated that the security personnel in the capital
were determined to rid the city of illegally acquired firearms
and to reduce the crime rate.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Increase of Breast Cancer Incidence in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of breast
cancer in Asia, though lower than in Europe and America, is
apparently increasing rapidly, epidemiologists told an on-going
international cancer seminar in Tianjin today.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 specialists and scholars from 14 countries and
regions are attending the second Asian Seminar on Breast Cancer in
this port city in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The specialists attribute the rise to the overall improvement
of living standards in Asia over recent years.
</P>
<P>
In China, the growth rate of such cancer in the ten major
cities has averaged 37 percent, according to the epidemiologist
with Shanghai experiencing the highest figures of 26.5 cases per
100,000 women, followed by Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts say that some 1.2 million women around the
world suffer from breast cancer, a common disease among women, and
500,000 of them will die from it every year. Growth rates around
the world vary between 5 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Epidemiologists note that physical factors, biological
conditions, the environment, and intake of protein, may all
attribute to the increase. And they believe that a longer
menstrual period, first births over 35 years of age and short
breast feeding periods are the most probable causes.
</P>
<P>
Increased intakes of high fat, low fiber food, but little fruit
and vegetables in the daily diet may also lead to the disease.
</P>
<P>
They say that making more information about the disease widely
known, recommending a more practical diet, breast feeding, and a
healthier life style will play an important role in preventing and
controlling the disease.

<HEADLINE> Missile Experts Refute Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese missile specialists
have pledged to speed up the development of missiles to enhance
China's national defense capabilities in a bid to maintain the
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
They said that they resolutely support the Chinese Communist
Party general secretary Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal of
developing the cross-strait relations and promoting the process of
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
These specialists expressed their pledge at a recent meeting
here to refute Lee Teng-hui's "two-state" splittist remarks.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the China Aerospace Machinery and Electronics
Corporation (CAMEC), a missile manufacturer, said that Lee Teng-
hui has underestimated the military strength of the Chinese People
's Liberation Army (PLA) and of the special position and capacity
of missiles in the national defense.
</P>
<P>
The CAMEC said it has developed several dozens of models of
missiles such as strategic, tactical, ground-to-ground, ground-to-
sea and ground-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
It said that it has made some breakthroughs in missile
manufacturing technology in accelerating the development and
manufacturing of a new generation of missiles.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts missiles of various altitudes, ranges and
speeds, it said, adding that they may strike at any targets with
precision.
</P>
<P>
They said Lee Teng-hui openly opposes the "one China" principle
and attempts to separate Taiwan from China, ignoring Taiwan
compatriots' desire for peace, stability, development, and
mutually beneficial cooperation and exchanges between both sides
of the Taiwan strait.
</P>
<P>
This, they pointed out, has seriously undermined the cross-
strait relations and basic interests of the compatriots on both
sides of the Taiwan strait, resulting in a tense situation across
the strait.
</P>
<P>
The world has but one China and Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China and the Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity
brook no separation, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the Taiwan issue cannot be delayed
indefinitely and the Chinese people will never allow Lee Teng-hui
to realize his evil plot.

<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao met with visiting Uruguayan Minister of National Defense
Juan Luis Storace and his party here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Uruguayan relationships have developed smoothly since the
two countries forged diplomatic ties, with an increasing high
level exchange of visits growing along with cooperation in various
fields," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation to Uruguay for its adherence to
the "One-China" policy, and said China attaches importance to
developing friendship and cooperative ties with Uruguay and hopes
that both sides work together to further promote the military ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Taiwan issue, Hu noted that the essence of the
"two-states" remarks by Lee Teng-hui is to negate the principle of
"One China" and to separate Taiwan from China, which will
certainly be firmly opposed and strongly condemned by the Chinese
government and all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"It is the common aspiration of the entire Chinese nation to
develop the relationship across the Taiwan Strait and to advance
the country's reunification cause," said Hu. Anyone attempting to
obstruct this historical trend will do so in vain.
</P>
<P>
Storace reiterated that Uruguay will unswervingly keep to the "
One-China" policy, and it will, as always, support China's
peaceful reunification cause. "Uruguay will continue to enhance
its friendship and cooperative relations with China," he said.

<HEADLINE> Number of China's Private Firms Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of private
enterprises in China had reached 1.28 million by June this year,
80,000 more than at end of last year, the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of people working in the sector hit 17.84 million,
up 22.4 percent from the corresponding period last year, and total
registered capital amounted to 817.7 billion yuan, up 24.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period, the economic returns of these
private firms improved remarkably. They registered an industrial
value of 370.5 billion yuan, a sales income of 350.5 billion yuan
and an export revenue of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration pointed out that the rapid
growth of Chinese private firms helped alleviate the pressure on
the country's current employment problems and helped 720,000
workless find new jobs in the six months under review.
</P>
<P>
The number of limited companies increased by a big margin
during the same period, and now accounts for more than 50 percent
of all private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this positive change mainly to the successful
switch by a number of state-owned enterprises to the private
sector, with company operators gradually introducing modern
techniques to streamline management.

<HEADLINE> Prosperity Returns to Ancient Silk Road (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Parts of the remote ancient
Silk Road are once again echoing to the bustle and buzz of
business as trade and commerce have returned with a vengeance to
Urumqi, one of the gateways linking the East and the West.
</P>
<P>
This week an estimated 10,000 business people from home and
abroad are attending the ongoing Eighth Urumqi Economic and Trade
Fair in this capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The event, one of the six major regional fairs in China, was
established in the wake of a state strategy to make the border
areas of the country prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 years ago, Xinjiang was a crucial section of the
Silk Road,an economic route linking China with central Asia and
Europe in the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Its importance waned after
sea routes flourished and the environment along the Silk Road
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, though remaining an underdeveloped area in China,
this remote region is enjoying an increasing popularity among
investors because of its abundant natural resources and
attractive investment conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Jun, a research fellow at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, Xinjiang is rich in land resources,
petroleum and cotton. Both domestic and foreign investors are
confident that Xinjiang is attractive because of its improving
infrastructure and a series of preferential policies from the
local government.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, the largest region of ethnic groups in China, shares
a border with eight countries. Currently, 15 posts and 60 counties
are open to the outside world, and two economic development zones
and three border cooperation zones authorized by the central
government with greater powers to trade with countries across the
border have been established.

"Xinjiang has now become a huge cotton market as well as an
important center for grain, livestock and sugar, due to the
efforts since the 1990s of revitalizing this western area of the
country," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
A modernized industrial system featuring petrochemicals,
building materials, textiles and the food processing industry is
also taking shape in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
So far, 32,000 kilometers of highways, 2,000 km of railways and
14 airports have formed a modern transportation system for this
remote region, shortening the distance between Xinjiang and the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The region is also rebuilding the highways around the Tarim and
the Junggar basins following the completion of 44 roads leading to
foreign countries. And the extension project for the South
Xinjiang Railway line going westward to Kashi will be completed at
the end of this year. Consequently, the Tarim Basin will be no
longer isolated, which will facilitate the exploitation of
petroleum and cotton production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kashi International Airport, which is the most
important aviation port in Northwest China, is being expanded.
</P>
<P>
An advanced telecommunications network will also help Xinjiang
to become more well-known to the outside. Using the longest inland
communication optical fiber cable in the world, the network will
link the cities of Xi'an, Lanzhou, Urumqi and Yili, all in
northwest China, with developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to this improvement in communications, and a better
investment environment, Xinjiang is being transformed into a busy
commercial hub in the western regions of China.
</P>
<P>
The border trade volume alone had rocketed from 320 million US
dollars in 1992 to 870 million US dollars last year, an annual
growth rate of 42 percent. Xinjiang is now the second largest
region in terms of border trade turnover in China.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 400 foreign funded enterprises have been set up in
the region, with actual investment of 2.2 billion US dollars.
Similarly, over 1,000 projects with investment totalling 7.8
billion yuan from other parts of China have been set up.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Vaccine Trials to Start Next Year in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The first preliminary trials
for a new AIDS vaccine developed by British and Kenyan scientists
are due to start early next year among volunteers in Oxford,
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Following tests on primates, which saw 70 percent of the
animals turning HIV-resistant, scientists believe that a
preliminary stage of trial on humans is now ready to begin,
Friday's Daily Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the vaccine is likely to stimulate the key
"killer T- cells" in human body so as to hold the virus at bay.
</P>
<P>
The research team has promised that if the trials are
successful, the AIDS vaccine will be available to Kenyans at
prices which even the poor can afford.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still likely to be some years before the trials
are completed.
</P>
<P>
While there are around 25 kinds of AIDS vaccines being
developed worldwide, the research in Kenya and Britain is one of
the few to involve a combination of DNA research with a more
conventional approach based on the vaccine used to immunize
against smallpox.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Andrew McMichael of Oxford announced that a group
of Nairobi prostitutes had demonstrated HIV-resistance after
using the vaccine.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Symposium on Trade Unions Cooperation Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A week-long international
symposium on the work of trade unions in the period of transition
to the market economy opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is co-sponsored by the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU) and a visiting delegation from the General
Confederation of Trade Unions (GCTU) which consists of some member
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
It aims at probing ways to safeguard the rights and interests
of the workers and to increase mutual understanding and trade
union cooperation between China and CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junjiu, vice president and first secretary of the
Secretariat of the ACFTU, said at the opening ceremony that the
celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China and the return of Macao are imminent,
and so this trade unions gathering is significant.
</P>
<P>
He said that although China and the CIS countries have
different domestic situations, their trade unions face similar
problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the Chinese trade unions hope to strengthen their
cooperation with all the trade unions of the world, including
those of the CIS countries, so as to contribute to the
establishment of a new international trade unions order".
</P>
<P>
Scherbakov Vladimir, head of the GCTU delegation, said that
even though there is a border between China and the CIS countries,
their existing traditional friendship has further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"The exchanges between the trade unions will further promote
such friendship and cooperation between China and the CIS
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, the representatives of the ACFTU will
brief the guests on the work of the Chinese trade unions, and the
CIS visitors will deliver speeches on their respective trade
unions and the current political and economic situation in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
The CIS visitors are here at the invitation of the ACFTU.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Expand Cooperation With UNDP: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to continue and
expand its cooperation with the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) in many areas, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shi said in a speech at a seminar marking the 20th anniversary
of the cooperation between China and the UNDP that there are many
areas in which China can continue to cooperate with the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
China needs to go on raising the income of farmers and resolve
the problem of poverty in the rural areas. Out of its 1.2 billion
population, 900 million live in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
"China is striving to build a socialist market economy and a
country ruled by law. It is also carrying out more reforms and
trying to help improve the technical standards and management
style of small and medium-sized companies," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, China needs to do a lot more in the development
of bilateral trade and economic cooperation with the developing
countries," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we can continue to keep and expand cooperation
with other countries and relevant international bodies like the
UNDP," added Shi.
</P>
<P>
He described the cooperation between China and the UNDP over
the past 20 years as "effective" and "fruitful." More than 840
cooperation projects have been successfully carried out in China,
with a total contribution of approximately 500 million US dollars
from the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Those projects cover agriculture, industry, energy,
transportation, telecommunications, education, health care finance,
taxation, social security, poverty alleviation, the development of
women, economic structural reform and utilization of overseas
capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since China restored its seat at the United Nations in 1971, it
has actively made contributions to the development programs of the
UN. But it refused to take contributions from the UNDP, even after
the deadly earthquake in Tangshan, northern China's Hebei Province,
one of the worst in history, that killed 240,000 people.
</P>
<P>
China's refusal to accept such aid continued until it adopted
the reform and opening policy in 1978. "In September 1979, the
UNDP established its Beijing representative office, marking the
beginning of a new phase of cooperation," according to the Shi.
</P>
<P>
"This effective cooperation has helped expand relations between
China and international organizations on a mutually beneficial
basis, introduced new technology and trained specialized
professionals for China," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"With limited capital, the UNDP has played a unique role in the
reform and opening drive and economic construction of a country
that has a vast territory and a huge population," he said. "This
fully demonstrates that the UNDP's assistance is effective."
</P>
<P>
Nay Htun, assistant Administrator of the UNDP, said, "The
cooperation between the UNDP and China is excellent and has
produced some very important results as it was built on mutual
trust."
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and visiting UNDP Administrator Mark Brown, the two sides agreed
to continue to work and be focused on poverty elimination,
environmental protection, to bring in new knowledge, new
technology and new management approaches, according to Kerstin
Leitner, resident representative of the UNDP in China.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Urges to Shun Food Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has said that it is absurd for Kenyans to import foodstuff
which could be produced in abundance locally.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Thursday when opening the
Mombasa Show sponsored by the Agricultural Society of Kenya in
Coast Province in east Kenya, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that it was ridiculous for the country to import farm
produces such as eggs which local poultry farmers can easily
produce, and called on relevant government departments to rectify
this anomaly for the benefits of local farmers.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kenya are importing such farm produces as
eggs and fruits from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that the agriculture sector remained
to be the backbone of the country's economic growth, which not
only provides food requirements but also creates employment for
the majority of rural folks.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the country would continue to experience high
food demand throughout the next century due to rapid population
growth.
</P>
<P>
He urged agricultural and livestock officials to advise farmers
on which crop to grow and which animals to keep, taking advantage
of the soil and climate conditions of the farmers' localities.
</P>
<P>
Sound management and appropriate farming methods will bring the
 potential into full play for substantial growth in the
agriculture sector, the president added.

<HEADLINE> China's "Power Tiger" Bows to Market Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ertan Hydro-Power Station
in southwest Chin's Guizhou Province went on line in August last
year and this was hailed as the largest of its kind built in China
this century.
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, general manager Liu Junfeng of the station
has become increasingly anxious as it has been very difficult to
sell his product.
</P>
<P>
With four of the six generators installed and operating so far,
Ertan is capable of generating 10 billion kwh of electricity a
year, but to date Liu has only signed 6.4 billion kwh in contracts.
</P>
<P>
"That means a loss of at least one billion yuan for this year,"
he said. In the coming years, it will be an even tougher job for
Liu's salesmen when the station installs the last two generators
which will add seven billion kwh more to Ertan's power output.
</P>
<P>
China's power industry, which has been under the State monopoly
for decades, used to be nicknamed "Power Tiger" by the people
because it could act as it pleased, regardless of requirements or
complaints from customers.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese remember the days when the "Tiger" was dominant.
Unexpected and frequent stoppages of the power supply often caused
a large amount of waste for factories and damaged electric
appliances in homes.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as many large power plants have come on line,
formerly strutting power producers have had to face an
increasingly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
The current economic restructuring, especially in the State
sector, has allowed local companies to enjoy greater autonomy over
their internal affairs, including the right to choose their own
power suppliers, by a consideration of price and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, differing economic strengths among localities are
another factor.
</P>
<P>
In the developed coastal province of Guangdong in south China,
power stations are working all-out to meet the demands by local
industries that are the main beneficiary of the country's reform
and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
But in underdeveloped areas such as Sichuan Province in the
southwest, local hydro-power electric plants may lose as much as
13.8 billion yuan this year, due to the sluggish market.

<HEADLINE> EDS-National Day Special Urbanites In China Living More Comfortable Lives (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year is
the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. The past
five decades of achievements in the economy have attracted the
attention of the rest of the world. Xinhua started a series of
stories on the nation's economy on August 17. This is the 14th.
</P>
<P>
The Statistics Bureau reports that, by United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) standards, China's urban dwellers
are leading comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
By FAO standards, an Engel coefficient (based on the percentage
of income spent on food) above 60 percent means a poor life, 60 to
50 percent means a life without food worries, 50 to 40 percent
means a comfortable life, and below 40 percent a rich life. China'
s dropped to 45 percent in 1998 for urban families.
</P>
<P>
Living a more comfortable life has been the dream of ordinary
Chinese for generations, but they have been visited by nightmare
all through this century, with starvation and death becoming a
part of people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
In 1948, a quarter of Beijing's residents, 250,000 people, were
struggling with poverty.

<HEADLINE> China's "Power Tiger" Bows to Market Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, China became the third-largest power producer in the
world, generating a total of 1.160 trillion kwh of electricity,
and the country's hydraulic power sector is now world's largest,
followed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yan, general manager of the State Power Company, attributes
the power surplus to the rapid expansion of the power industry,
and this new situation has produced many new problems for the
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic and foreign experts point out that the present
difficulty in selling electricity is not a result of oversupply,
but rather an indication of low consumption.
</P>
<P>
In China, the average monthly consumption of electricity for
urban families is 100 to 200 kwh, only one-tenth of the average of
urbanites in developed nations.
</P>
<P>
To cope with this situation, governments at all levels have
worked out many favorable polices to encourage customers to
increase electricity consumption.
</P>
<P>
Many urbanites have found they no long need to hesitate on
whether or not to use high energy-consuming appliances such as
electric oven and irons. The former policy of extra charges for
over-consumption has been replaced with "the more electricity you
use, the cheaper the prices become."
</P>
<P>
For decades, rural people had to pay their electricity bills at
rates much higher than their urban counterparts because, it was
said, the farmers should pay for the building costs. No one had
ever explained why the State only paid the building cost for urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, however, villagers are glad to see that the price of
power has been cut to an level equivalent to that enjoyed by city
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
The constant development of the power industry has also been
placed on the top of the central government's agenda. While
efforts are being made to shut down small power stations with
generating capacities of 50,000 kw and below, the plans to build
more large power plants, mainly hydraulic ones, have never been
put aside.
</P>
<P>
The central government continues to restructure the power
industry by separating the management of power stations and power-
supply networks to lay a foundation for the future formation of a
unified, national network.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, China will invest 260 billion yuan in
rebuilding both urban and rural power-supply networks.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Eyes Investment From APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada is determined to win investments for the country during
his upcoming trip to New Zealand for the informal leadership
conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a top
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the president wants to
give the Philippine economy a much-needed boost with his APEC
stint, as well as his visit to Latin America following the
conference.
</P>
<P>
"The president will leave by the end of the week for Auckland
to attend the APEC summit and proceed to Chile and Argentina,"
Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Estrada said he hopes to attract much-needed
foreign investments that will spur economic growth and create jobs
for people.
</P>
<P>
The president said he would seek investments during his
meetings with leaders of other APEC economies, which include the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"We will seek help during the APEC summit to revitalize
business and the economy," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Following his attendance at APEC's informal leadership
conference in New Zealand, Estrada will proceed to Latin America
for state visits in Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
In his first APEC stint as president in 1998 in Malaysia,
Estrada was designated as spokesman for the poor members of APEC.
</P>
<P>
Upon his initiative, the 20 other leaders of APEC economies
agreed to adopt social safety nets to help poorer nations cope
with the Asian economies crisis.
</P>
<P>
More affluent countries such as the United States and Japan
also started their own initiatives to extend financial assistance
to countries hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Among these initiatives are the 30-billion-U.S.-dollar Miyazawa
package for hard-hit economies, and the 10-billion-dollar joint
initiative by the United States and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Recall Parliament for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A state of emergency has
been declared in Botswana for recalling parliament to allow 60,000
more voters to participate in the general elections, South
Africa's Business Day newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament was dissolved in July before the elections
scheduled for October 16 begin.
</P>
<P>
President Festus Mogae announced Thursday that he was declaring
the emergency for the sole purpose of being able to recall the
parliament in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Act could then be amended to permit the
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to complete its work.
</P>
<P>
The 60,000 voters, who had registered during a supplementary
registration exercise, were not included in the voters' roll.
</P>
<P>
Legal problems arose last week when the president issued a writ
for the elections to be held on October 16. At that time, new
certified voters' rolls had not been completed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, opposition parties called for the
resignation of senior IEC staff following the disqualification of
the 60,000 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has accused the government of incompetence in
preparing for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has a population of 1.5 million, of which 900,000 are
eligible for the election. Some 460,000, or 51 percent, of the
eligible voters have registered.

By 1998, there were 105 color TVs for every 100 urban families,
91 washing machines, 76 refrigerators, 76 telephones, 20 air-
conditioners, 4 computers and 0.25 cars.
</P>
<P>
Urban housing has improved remarkably over the past two decades.
In 1981, only 14 percent of urban families had more than 8 square
meters of living space for each member. The figure rose to 48
percent in 1988 and to 77 percent in 1998. In 1981, as much as 37
percent of urban families did not have their own house, or had
less than 4 square meters of living space for each member. The
figure now only 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the figure that speaks the loudest is that of bank
deposits. In 1952, individual bank deposits amounted to only 900
million yuan. That figure began to increase at an incredible rate
after 1978, when it was 21 billion yuan to 233.8 billion yuan by
1986. By the end of 1998, Chinese banks held 5.34 trillion yuan in
individual deposits, a 254-fold increase from 1978.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Buys 19 Billion Yuan in T-Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Construction Bank of China
announced here today that it would buy 19 billion yuan of the 60
billion yuan supplementary treasury bonds newly issued by the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it has already paid for 60 percent of the bonds,
while the remaining 40 percent would be paid for by September 8.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress approved the issue of a 60
billion yuan supplementary treasury bonds recently, in a bid to
further stimulate domestic consumption and investment.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the bonds are expected to be spent on ongoing
infrastructure projects, technical upgrading projects in major
industrial sectors, environmental protection projects, and
increasing pensions and the salary of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Among China's four major state-owned commercial banks, the
Construction Bank is the second largest investor in the said
treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Its officials said the 10 year term bonds are a safe investment
and would help the bank improve its structure of financial assets,
as it is the first time a floating interest rate has been applied
to treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
As the 60 billion yuan bonds would require 254 billion yuan in
supporting bank loans, the bank said it would increase its
investment to related industrial sectors in recognition of the
government policy.
</P>
<P>
They disclosed that the Construction Bank is reviewing 1,000 or
more projects recommended by the government and has already
pledged to lend 5.5 billion yuan to the chosen projects.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also reviewing more than 100 other projects of its
choice and has signed preliminary lending agreements with them.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Efforts Fighting Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is making efforts to
cure drug addicts and fight drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
More than 12,300 drug addicts have so far this year received
medical treatment at centers and within communities and families
in accordance with the guidelines of Vietnam's Ministry of Labor,
War Invalids and Social Affairs, according to a report of Vietnam
News Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Almost all detoxification centers have extended treatment time
from three to six months or even a year and have built more
facilities to treat more addicts.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to fight drug abuse among young people, Vietnam's
Ministry of Education and Training has coordinated with relevant
agencies and local authorities in taking measures of various
kinds.
</P>
<P>
However, nearly 90 percent of Vietnam's 97,000 drug addicts and
8,000 drug-addicted prisoners have failed to respond to treatment
and the number of relapsed victims accounts for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
To effectively cure drug addicts, Vietnam's Ministry of Public
Health has asked relevant agencies to speed up the research,
evaluation and experiments of traditional medicines and
acupuncture in treatment.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Works for East Asian Cooperation Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Friday that
the framework for cooperation and working relationship among East
Asian countries should be well structured.
</P>
<P>
"Working together in the next century on East Asian basis has
to be structured in a way that will detail serious discussions,"
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz
told reporters after meeting with a Japanese mission for
revitalization of Asian Economy here.
</P>
<P>
She said that among the areas that could be worked on are the
reform of the financial system, on how to strengthen the regional
economy, working together to affect more optimum flow of resources
within the East Asian region and how to enable the region to
become a very viable market.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has always voiced out the need for such cooperation
through the formation of East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), which
Japan was in favor of, Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
She said if there was an established and well structured East
Asia entity, then the concept of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
to be implemented by the year 2003 could be expanded to the East
Asia Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
Such idea is not against the World Trade Organization but
feasible as free trade would allow East Asian countries to have
more liberal flows of goods and services within the region, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the reform of international financial architecture,
she said: "Putting our heads together in East Asia, we can get our
experts to think what kind of strategies, what kind of measures we
can suggest to the authorities to shape or reshape the financial
structure on a global basis."

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Thai Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here Friday that the all-round healthy and steady
partnership of good neighborliness and friendly cooperation
already established between China and Thailand surely embraces
broad prospects for development.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai Friday
morning, Jiang said such a partnership conforms to the fundamental
interests and aspirations of China and Thailand and the two
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Thailand is one of China's closest partners of
cooperation in the region. He said the two countries treat each
other with sincerity and trust each other since they established
diplomatic relations 24 years ago and have thus enjoyed fruitful
cooperation in politics, economy, culture and science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
He said economic and trade cooperation between China and
Thailand has continued to maintain a good momentum of development
under joint efforts, with a sustained increase in bilateral trade
volume and a number of large cooperation projects under
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed his confidence that bilateral
economic and trade cooperation will gain further development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he is pleased to see that the efforts made by the
Thai government and people to overcome the difficulties brought by
the Asian financial crisis, which broke out two years ago, have
born remarkable success, as a good momentum of economic recovery
has emerged in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no difficulty which cannot be overcome so long
as the peoples of various countries unite and fight against it
indomitably.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Chuan Leekpai said this visit by President
Jiang, which came when the Chinese people are about to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China and the Thai people are holding nationwide celebrations for
the 72nd birthday of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, constitutes a major
happy event in his country.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister said the joint statement issued by
China and Thailand on a Plan of Action for the 21st century will
give great impetus to the development of the relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of economic and trade ties between
Thailand and China is beneficial to the development of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai expressed his gratitude to China for its selfless
assistance to Thailand during the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the correct and firm stand and policies adopted by
China have provided the best support for countries swept by the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived in Thailand on September 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech at the National Cultural
Center of the Kingdom of Thailand on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Enhance Good-Neighbourliness and Friendship
</P>
<P>
And Build a Better Future Together
</P>
<P>
Your Royal Highness Princess Sirindhorn,
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul,
</P>
<P>
Mr. Director,
</P>
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
I am honored to be here with you and address you today at the
invitation of the International Studies Center of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Thailand. At the outset, I wish to extend, on
behalf of the Chinese Government and people and also in my own
name, our cordial greetings and best wishes to the people of
Thailand and our heartfelt thanks to all those, present or not,
who have helped enhance the friendship between our two peoples.
</P>
<P>
We are delighted to see the further development of the time-
honored China-Thailand relations over the last quarter of this
century. Cooperation between our two countries has been effective
and productive in all fields. A line from the song "the Chinese
and the Thais are brothers" has expressed the common will of our
two peoples. His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej and members of
the royal family have made outstanding contributions to the
friendship between our two countries. On the occasion of the 72nd
birthday of His Majesty, I would like to extend my best wishes to
His Majesty. The Chinese Government attaches high importance to
its relations with Thailand and regards your country as one of our
most important cooperation partners in this region. May Thailand
enjoy prosperity! May CHina-Thailand relations last forever and
become more and more important as time goes by, like the porcelain
masterpiece "Sangkhalok: jointly made by Chinese and Thai
craftsmen in ancient times!
</P>
<P>
The Asian civilization has been created and developed by the
Asian people, Chinese and Thais included. Standing at the
threshold of a new century, mankind is about to usher in a new
millennium. As we look back on the changes in the past 100 years
in Asia and into its future of hopes and challenges at this
important historical moment, all sorts of feelings well up in our
mind.
</P>
<P>
The 100-year history of Asia in the 20th century is a splendid
epic poem depicting the heroic, persevering and unyielding
struggle by the Asia people against colonialism and imperialism
and for national independence and liberation. It is also an
imposing scroll of the Asian people working hard in an
enterprising spirit to gradually lift themselves out of poverty
and backwardness and standing rock firm in the family of nations
of the world. Since the end of World War II, Asian countries,
through tenacious struggle, have stepped onto the international
arena as independent and equal members of the international
community and made significant contribution to world peace and
development. In the last 20 years or so, Asia, East Asia in
particular, with its rapid economic growth, has become one of the
most dynamic regions in the world. The drastic changes and the
rise of Asia represent a great miracle performed by Asian people
as well as an important symbol of the development and progress of
the world in the 20th century. The Chinese Government resumed the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 and Macao will come
back to the embrace of the motherland as of 20 December this year.
This marks the complete conclusion of the Western colonial rule in
Asia. We are very proud of glories that Asia has won in the 20th
century.

<TEXT>
<P>
National Independence and unification are important
prerequisites for the great success of Asian countries. Having
suffered enormously from imperialist invasion and bullying and
from the disintegration of their countries and families, the Asian
people have cherished dearly the hard-won national independence
and unity. It is the sacred right of the Asian peoples to
safeguard national dignity and state sovereignty, choose
independently their own social system, road to development and way
of life and reject external intervention in their internal affairs.
It is also the basic guarantee for the prosperity of Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Self-confidence, self-respect, self-reliance and self-
improvement are important Asian spirit that has encouraged the
Asian people to go in for changes and reform and remove all
obstacles and difficulties. And it is this spirit that has
enabled the Asian people to achieve success one after another in
their economic, scientific and cultural development and nation-
building endeavour. When faced with the impact of the financial
crisis, the Thai people called on the Thais to help Thailand pull
through the hard times and stabilize the economy. Likewise in
China, when faced with last year's devastating floods rarely seen
in history, the whole nation fought courageously and unremittingly
together, winning the war against the floods. All these are vivid
expressions of the Asian spirit of Self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
Most Asian countries belong to the Third World. They
experienced the same bitter sufferings in the past and all aspire
to development now. They all know full well the importance of
treating each other as equals, conducting mutually beneficial
cooperation and living in harmony with each other. It is exactly
for this reason that the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence were born on the land of Asia. These norms governing
international relations accord with both the fundamental interests
of the Asia people and the demands of our times. In following
these norms, Asian counties have set up a good example for the
peaceful coexistence by countries with different social systems
and for the friendly relations and cooperation among developing
countries, which has had a far-reaching impact on the
international community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Asia's historical experience has greatly enlightened us on how
to work out a blueprint for the new century. The growing trend
towards multi-polarisation of the world and economic globalisation,
together with the rapid advancement of science and technology and
the quiet rise of knowledge economy have brought about both new
hopes and new challenges to the development of the world including
Asia. At the threshold of the now century, the Asian people are
thinking about the future of Asia and that of the world as well.
How to seize the opportunity and meet the challenges? How to
continue the efforts to promote the establishment of a just and
reasonable new international political and economic order of peace
and stability and work hard to bring into the 21st century a new
Asia and a new world with lasting peace and universal prosperity?
These are the pressing tasks to be tackled by the statesmen and
people from Asia, including China and Thailand, and the rest of
the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
At present, the international situation is undergoing profound
changes and, on the whole, it has been moving towards relaxation
since the end of the Cold War. There has been an increasingly
louder and bigger voice for peace, stability and development in
the world. However, the world is far from being tranquil.
Hegemonism and power politics still exist and have even developed
in the international political, economic and security fields. The
new "Gunboat Policy" and the economic neo-colonialism pursued by
some big powers have severely undermined the sovereign
independence and the development interests of many small- and
medium-sized countries, and have threatened world peace and
international security. To maintain world peace and promote
common development, all the countries must strictly abide by the
basic norms governing international relations that have been
established since the end of the war against Fascism in the world,
including the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter. No country should be
allowed to defy the laws, or willfully violate and trample on
these norms. All the countries, regardless of their strength, are
equal members of the international community. Internal affairs of
any country should be decided by its own people, while
international affairs should be settled by all through discussion.
This is the common will of all the peace-loving countries and
peoples, and it is also an irresistible historical trend.
</P>
<P>
International economic exchanges should be conducted in
compliance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit and
common development. In working out new rules for international
economic and trade activities, the reasonable demands of the
developing countries should be adequately reflected and their
legitimate rights and interests be protected. The developed
countries should shoulder more obligations and they have the
capability to do so. No country should be allowed to make use of
its advantages to seek privileges and impair other countries'
interests in the process of economic globalisation Economic
cooperation and foreign aid with political strings attached are
never welcome. Trade protectionism of various forms undermines
not only the interests of others, but also those of the practicing
states in the end. Historical lessons in this regard should not
be forgotten. The malignant trend of the continuously widening
gap between the South and the North deserves our high attention
and concrete and effective measures should be taken to gradually
settle the problem. Otherwise, the poor will become poorer and
the rich richer. In that case, not only will developing countries
find their economic development hampered, but developed countries
will also find it difficult to achieve a steady economic growth.

<P>
To safeguard international security, the Cold War mentality
must be completely cast away. A lasting peace of the international
community must be built on the basis of a new security concept
through enhanced mutual confidence and common interests. Mutual
confidence should be enhanced through dialogue, security should be
sought through cooperation, and disputes settled through peaceful
means on the basis of mutual respect for state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Both China and ASEAN countries are advocators for a new
international order. We are all developing countries and neighbors
linked by mountains and waters. Our consensus on strategic issues
is increasing. Both China and ASEAN countries need to maintain
good-neighborliness and friendship with each other. So long as we
always try to resort to friendly consultation, there is no dispute
that cannot be solved. China and ASEAN countries should always be
good neighbors, good friends, and good partners. In the course of
the Asian financial crisis, China shared the difficulties of
Thailand and other ASEAN countries, went through thick and thin
together with them, and provided assistance within its capacity to
the affected countries. China is ready to have in-depth
discussions with the relevant ASEAN countries on the principles
and ways of safeguarding peace and stability in this region as
well as in the South China Sea. It stands for settlement of
existing differences through friendly consultation and negotiation.
China respects ASEAN's efforts for the establishment of a zone of
peace, freedom and neutrality. It respects and supports the
Protocol to the Treaty on Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone.
We welcome the economic integration of ASEAN and are taking an
active part in the cooperation in the Lancang-Mekong River basin
development. We attach great importance to the ASEAN Vision 2020
and the Hanoi Plan of Action, and hope to deepen cooperation with
ASEAN in the economic, trade, scientific and technological, social
and other fields. I have always believed that a united and
prosperous ASEAN is an important force for peace and development
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have witnessed an all-around and deepened
development of China-ASEAN relations. In the Joint Statement
issued by leaders of ASEAN countries and myself in 1997, it was
decided to build a partnership of good-neighbourliness and mutual
trust between China and ASEAN. That document has charted a course
and provided a framework for the future development of relations
between the two sides. China has signed or issued documents for
the 21st-century-oriented cooperation with Thailand, Vietnam,
Malaysia and Brunei respectively, and it hopes to further deepen
the mutually beneficial cooperation with all ASEAN countries.
China and ASEAN have become each other's important trade and
investment partners. We have the reason to believe that, so long
as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are adhered to,
there is a bright prospect for the development of the friendly
relations between China and ASEAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
The 20th century is one of earth-shaking changes for China.
Thanks to the pioneering work and arduous efforts by the People's
Republic of China over the past 50 years, especially over the last
20 years or so since the beginning of reform and opening-up, the
overall national strength and the living standards of the people
have been improved in no small ways. Now, the Chinese people are
advancing with big strides along the path of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics. It is our strategic objective to
basically realize modernization and build China into a prosperous
and strong socialist country with a high degree of democracy and
civilization by the middle of the 21st century. In the new century,
the Chinese people will stand ready to work together with the
people of Thailand, ASEAN, Asia and other countries in the world
for the lofty cause of peace and development in Asia and in the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
China's modernization drive calls for a long-term peaceful
international environment and a good surrounding environment. The
stability and development in China itself, peace and prosperity in
its surrounding areas and a new regional security order based on
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are where the common
interests of Asian countries and also the fundamental interests of
China lie. China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace
and a defense policy of a defensive nature. A developed China will
pose no threat to any country, and it will only be conducive to
regional and world peace and prosperity. Even when China becomes
developed in future, it will continue to pursue unswervingly an
independent foreign policy of peace and will firmly stand together
with all other developing countries and all the peace-loving
countries and peoples. "Do unto others as you would have them do
unto you". China firmly opposes hegemonism and power politics and
will never seek hegemony -- that is a solemn commitment that the
Chinese Government and people have made to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese civilization of several thousand years, to keep
the nation unified has always been the main stream in China's
history and a lofty goal that the Chinese people have cherished
from generation to generation. There is but one China in the world
and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. To solve
the Taiwan question in accordance with the basic principles of "
peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems" represents
the common aspiration of the entire Chinese people and the
overwhelming historical trend of China's development. The
situation in Hong Kong since its return to China has shown that
China's complete reunification is conducive to Asia's stability
and prosperity. The Chinese Government thinks highly of the
support given to it by the Thai Government and governments of
other ASEAN countries on the question of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Before I conclude, I also wish to say a few words to the young
people present here. The 21st century is yours. I am confident
that you will carry forward the fine tradition of your nation and
of other Asian nations, take up boldly the glorious mission of
developing your country and safeguarding regional and world peace
in your march to the new century, and work together with all
peoples of the world to build a better future for Asia and for the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionists Set Conditions on Peace Process Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP) said on Friday it would take part initially
in a review of the British province's stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the pro-British party said full-scale participation in next
week's review, headed by former U.S. senator George Mitchell,
would depend on whether the republicans were truly committed to
peace.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Friday morning, the UUP ruled out
UUP leader David Trimble's face-to-face meeting with Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams until he has proof that the republicans are
exclusively committed to peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The party will not totally boycott the review of the workings
of the Good Friday Agreement due to start on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The party demanded that Mitchell establish at the review
whether Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and the political
allies of pro-British loyalist militias, are committed to the
province's peace drive.

"This is the essential pre-requisite for success and will
determine our subsequent engagement in the review," the UUP said
in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Having already indicated to Senator Mitchell in July that we
support a review, the party will therefore take it a stage at a
time, monitoring progress closely and take such action as it deems
necessary," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement is a rebuff to Sinn Fein, which is expected to
decide whether it will participate in the review at a meeting of
the party's ruling council in Dublin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The UUP said it is still considering legal action to overturn
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam's statement that the IRA
cease-fire is intact.
</P>
<P>
Twelve senior UUP party officials, including Trimble, are due
to meet on Friday and the party's ruling executive of around 100
members meets on Saturday to finalize policy regarding the review.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled for more than a year as the
UUP and Sinn Fein argued about IRA disarmament and the formation
of a coalition government for the British province.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists refused to form a power-sharing executive
with Sinn Fein because the IRA rejection demands that arms
decommissioning should start before the devolved government was
set up.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Friday afternoon talked to Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie over the phone, urging an end to the violence in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I expressed my great alarm at what has happened over the past
few days," Howard told ABC radio. "I particularly expressed
concern about the safety of the Australian police and the other
Australians who are in East Timor and how damaging it would be to
the relationship if any harm were to come to them."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AAP said in a report that the two leaders talks for
one and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, violence in East Timor was reported
and even the life of the U.N. staff there was threatened.
</P>
<P>
"I stressed it was the responsibility of Indonesia and the
Indonesian Armed Forces and police to restore order and maintain
it," Howard was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of an imminent evacuation of
Australians from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Servicemen and aircraft are assembled at an air base in the
Northern Territory, ready to help evacuate Australians or take

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprise Permitted to Expand lumbering Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation has recently given permission to the
Harbin International Economic and Technological Cooperation Corp.
in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province to expand lumbering
business in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese enterprise will soon travel to Khabarovsk in Russia
's far east to undertake a project which involves felling three
million cubic meters of timber.
</P>
<P>
Deputy General Manager Yang Qiusheng said today that the
project is under the direct management of his company, and the
total investment is estimated at 50 million yuan (about six
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Yang said that a large part of the labor force and equipment
will be hired, bought or rented in Russia, and all the cut timber
will be transported back to China for sale.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Russia's forestry authorities are supporting
the project, as it reduces the possibility of an infection of tree
insects following disastrous forest fires last year.
</P>
<P>
"The company is the first to get permission for such work since
regulations were introduced on strengthening the administration of
Sino-Russian exploitation and utility of forest resources on April
26," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials said that the premiers of the two states
signed a contract concerning timber imports and exports during
their fourth meeting last February.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing woman in her fifties
complained to a police officer that she was kicked like a football,
shuttling between a police station and a government personnel
department, but the answer to the request for a residential ID was
still "not enough documents."
</P>
<P>
"You guys are spending tax payers' money just to keep my legs
busy!" she was almost yelling.
</P>
<P>
This was one of a number of incidents Xinhua reporters
encountered after the national legislature adopted amendments to
the Personal Income Tax Law on August 30 to allow the government
to tax hundreds of million of depositors on their savings interest.
Such incidents used to be impossible.
</P>
<P>
Stories on this topic has been making the rounds of all the
media in China. To the surprise of policy-makers, the new taxation
will not only increase revenues to the state coffer, but has also
spurred the public to be more aware of their obligations as tax
payers.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the second day after the law was passed, a group of
Qigong practitioners in a park were engaged in a dispute with
security officers there over why they were not allowed to clap
their hands.
</P>
<P>
One of the practitioners said, "We are tax payers, but you are
not doing your job right."
</P>
<P>
Never having heard of such accusations before, the security
officers looked rather embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
Liu Longxiang, a taxation professor with the Beijing
University, said that a "tax-payer mentality" is growing stronger
in the mind of the Chinese public as the government has been
launching high-profile reforms to the existing taxation system and
propagating the knowledge of law.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia suffered a 0.93
percent deflation or negative inflation in August, the country's
sixth month of deflation in a row, according to the Central Bureau
of Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
The negative monthly inflation rate was primarily caused by a
stability in the prices of most basic food commodities, especially
rice, Chief of the BPS Sugito Suwito told reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia posted a deflation of 0.18 percent in March, 0.68
percent in April, 0.28 percent in May, 0.34 percent in June and
1.05 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier projected an inflation target of 17
percent for the current 1999-2000 fiscal year which ended in March
next year, but recently revised it to 10 percent following
positive development in the country's macroeconomic picture.

When the chain store "Makro", which originated in the
Netherlands, opened its branches in Beijing, it printed the
consumer taxes a customer has to pay on the receipts. However,
never having heard of such practice, one customer reportedly said
to a sales manager, "I never pay tax in other stores, so why do I
have to pay it here?"
</P>
<P>
But today, everyone knows that other stores also are obliged to
include taxes in their prices but don't highlight the fact.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the government is beefing up efforts to collect
personal income tax, and as a result, people in Beijing have found
in recent months that a new item was added to their salary sheet:
the amount deducted for personal income tax. All these changes
have contributed to the new tax awareness of the general public.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiafu, a civil law expert and senior Chinese legislator,
said that when talking about the "tax-payer mentality", the
government and the media used to blame tax evaders but never
mention the responsibility of the government to serve the people.
</P>
<P>
This situation has now changed too.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, nine officials representing 2.81 million
tax payers in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, including its mayor Lin Guoqiang, last year
publicly received their monthly salary to demonstrate that they
are accountable to the people.
</P>
<P>
The leading official newspaper People's Daily also published a
commentary recently to criticize officials who take advantage of
the people.
</P>
<P>
"Those (officials) who take the gratitude of the public for
granted or even make unreasonable demands of them should be
punished," it said.
</P>
<P>
The complaining woman in the police station later said in an
interview, "If all the people in society, including government
officials, have the 'tax payer mentality', it's worth paying our
due taxes."

GUANGZHOU, September 3 (Xinhua)-- Lee Teng-hui's "two states"
remarks were denounced today by a group of Chinese from Canada,
who are attending the 99' Summer Camp of Chinese Youth in Canada,
held in Zhongshan City of South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Jinhou, an elderly overseas Chinese who once met late
Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping, said at today's forum that Lee Teng-
hui has "attempted to take advantage of the current tensions
between China and the U.S." to promote his "two states" statement,
which has been strongly criticized by Chinese from both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Another overseas Chinese leader Lin Zhongqiang, who had been
invited to observe National Day ceremonies on three occasions,
pointed out that it is the common wish of all Chinese to achieve
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ganxi, an overseas Chinese from Vancouver, said that "the
two states" statement undermined the basis of cross-straits
dialogue and negotiation, and fundamentally contradicts and
compromises the interests of Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
All attendants warned that Lee should stop playing with fire,
halt at the brink of the precipice, and abandon the so-called "two
states" statements, otherwise he will become the sinner of the
Chinese nation.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad will not attend the September 12-13 Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' informal meeting in New
Zealand, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's absence from the APEC meeting is because of a heavy
domestic schedule and is not a snub to APEC nor related to the
impending general election or his health, Syed Hamid told
reporters after handing over a donation of 100,000 U.S. dollars
from the Malaysian government to Turkish Ambassador Koray Targay
in aid of victims of the recent earthquake in Turkey.
</P>

"Mahathir is in good health, he told me on Wednesday that he
has many things to attend to and so many speeches to make within
the country," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
He said Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi would
represent the prime minister at the APEC leaders' informal
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said Mahathir would be in New York from September 25
to 29 for the annual United Nations General Assembly and in
Zimbabwe for the Third South Africa International Dialogue from
October 2 to 6.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The first foreign ministers'
meeting of the East Asia-Latin America Forum (EALAF) has been
scheduled to be held in the Chilean capital of Santiago in the
first quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Bilahari Kansikan and Christian Barros, coordinators of the
meeting and respectively heads of the Singapore and Chilean
delegations, announced the schedule at a press conference at the
end of the two-day inaugural EALAF meeting of officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kansikan described the inaugural meeting as "productive" and
"encouraging," saying there were a great deal of commitments made
by all participants and they shared a common view on the value of
the forum.
</P>
<P>
Citing the meeting as a very strong forward step, Kansikan said
there was an agreement that there is a great deal of potentials in
the two regions and this forum will make valuable contribution to
tapping the potentials.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that the forum should be multidimensional in which
we have political, cultural, social as well as economic
dimensions," he said. He stressed, "The general purpose is to
promote that multidimensional understanding and over the time it
will enable us to realize the potential of relations in our
regions."
</P>
<P>
Calling the meeting the start of a long process, Kansikan said
participating countries proposed a lot of projects including three
by Singapore concerning economic study, a journalist visit program
and a travel fair.
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions, Kansikan confirmed that the forum only
composes sovereign states, saying it is not the same as the APEC
which has a much broader basis.
</P>
<P>
Barros said he agreed to Kansikan's assessment of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the next EALAF meeting of officials will
be held next August to prepare for the foreign ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The EALAF was proposed by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong during his October 1998 visit to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that strengthening dialogue and
cooperation between East Asia and Latin America conforms to the
fundamental interests of the people in the two regions and is
conducive to enhancing the role of developing countries in the
international affairs.

interests of the people of all countries and reflect the demand of
history and the progress of the time.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, who is also chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of
China' National People's Congress, pointed out that the core of
the principles of the U.N. Charter, the five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten principles of Bandung Conference
is mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Without sovereignty, there would be no independence, security
and human rights to speak of, he said, adding, "The principle of
respect for sovereignty brooks no challenge, otherwise, there
would be no tranquillity for the international community and no
guarantee for the security of medium- and small-sized countries."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the allegation that human rights override
sovereignty is nothing but an excuse by hegemonism to interfere in
the internal affairs of other countries and constitutes a grave
threat to world peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the disputes between states, he said they should
only be resolved through peaceful negotiation without resorting to
threat or use of force.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that no country or group of countries has the
privilege to override the international community, nor does any
country has the right to impose its own values on others. "No
country should damage other countries' security under any
pretext."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese law-maker called for the establishment of a just
and rational new international economic order as early as
possible, saying developing countries must unite so as to break
the monopoly of world economic affairs by a small number of
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries should be allowed equal and full
participation in the current international financial reform,
international economic decision-making process and the formation
of new rules of the game," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said China finds it necessary to enhance regional economic
cooperation and South-South cooperation, which has proved to be an
effective way to promote lasting prosperity at the national and
regional levels.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar Friday
finished higher by gaining more than one U.S. cent over Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed the session at 64.52 U.S. cents
from Thursday's close at 64.03.
</P>
<P>
The jump in the currency was partly due to the receding threat
of IMF gold sales which have cast a cloud over the market for some
time.
</P>
<P>
The IMF reported that it was finalizing a plan to sell gold to
central banks rather than directly to market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 60.19 euro cents Friday from
60.64 at Thursday's close and 70.79 Japanese yen from 69.81.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Dispute over Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators have overcome the last obstacle to an agreement on
the implementation of a U.S.-brokered peace agreement Friday,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted senior diplomatic sources in Jerusalem as
saying that the two sides had reached agreement on the release of
Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Palestinians had accepted the Israeli
proposal that Israel releases 350 Palestinian political
prisoners. The Palestinians had demanded the release of 400
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli sources said a signing ceremony would probably
take place Saturday night, after the end of the Jewish Sabbath, in
the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. sources said there would be chances that the ceremony
be held Friday afternoon in Sharm el-Sheikh before the Jewish
Sabbath starts later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister's Office has not confirmed the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The settlement was achieved after visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright intervened to mediate between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
A tentatively planned signing ceremony in the Egyptian port
city of Alexandria Thursday afternoon was scotched by continued
difference between Israel and the Palestinians over the prisoner
issue. Albright had planned to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
She held talks with Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat Thursday evening in Alexandria before flying to
Israel for an immediate meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office issued the statement after the meeting, which
lasted for three and a half hours, saying that the Israeli side
expected answers from the Palestinian side over the Israeli
proposal on the prisoners issue Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Palestinian negotiators stayed in Alexandria Friday
morning, apparently preparing for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Albright postponed a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy scheduled at 1100 a.m. (0900 GMT). Israel Radio said
she would now focus on a possible signing ceremony.

SINGAPORE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed lower

The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) lost 25.03 points to
end at 2,093.18 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean women took a
clean sweep of medals in the individual competition at the Asian

</P>
<P>
Kang Hyun Ji, 22, defeated compatriot Kim Du Ri 112-107 points
in the final to become the Asian champion. Kim won the silver

registered by Lee Mi Jeong, also from South Korea, at Bangkok,
Thailand in October last year.

<P>
Kang, a Christian who began archery training 12 years ago,
added: "During the final I thought of nothing. I just kept praying.
"
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Declares September as Y2K Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has declared the month of September 1999 as "Y2K
Consciousness Month," Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said
Friday in a new release.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the initiative is part of the government's
stepped-up campaign for public consciousness of the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Barican said, it is also aimed at allaying fears
of a meltdown of public services if computers fail to recognize
the date when their internal clock rolls into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as the Social Security System (SSS) and
the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) announced that they
do not expect any interruption of their services due to the
millennium bug at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Various sectors have aired apprehension that the country may
not be ready to face the millennium bug and that public services
may be temporarily halted, should the government computers fail to
recognize the date when the new millennium comes.
</P>
<P>
In signing the proclamation, Barican said, "the president cited
the need to highlight the efforts being undertaken by both
government and the private sector performing critical missions
toward addressing the Y2K factor."
</P>
<P>
Y2K Commission Chairman Amable Aquiluz said earlier that the
GSIS and the SSS are very likely to complete preparations
relatively early, adding that the former is now 77 percent
complete while the latter is 80 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
According to a Y2K Commission report, the finance sector is 95
percent Y2K ready; utilities and manufacturing, 80 percent;
telecommunication and transportation, 79 percent; government
services, 77 percent; and health care, 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem is likely to affect computer systems that could
not properly read dates from January 1, 2000 onward.

BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), met
here today with visiting Uruguayan Defense Minister Juan Luis
Storace and expressed his pleasure over the positive development
of ties between the two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of the Central Military Commission, said he
is eager to further the cooperation between the two armies.
</P>
<P>
Fu briefed Storace and his party on China's domestic situation
and refuted Lee Teng-hui's "Two States" theory, saying that Lee
Teng-hui openly issued separatist remarks, denied the "One China"
principle, and attempted to separate Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely unacceptable for the Chinese people," he said,
noting that the PLA bears the responsibility for safeguarding
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and they will foil
any conspiracy to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Storace expressed his willingness to promote the friendly
cooperation between the two countries and armies. He respects
China's stance on the Taiwan issue, and said that Uruguay will
continue to adhere to the "one China" position.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Thai National Assembly President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin expressed hope Friday that the National People's
Congress of China and the National Assembly of Thailand will
continue to strengthen exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Thai National Assembly President Wan
Muhammad Nor Matha, Jiang said the National People's Congress of
China and the National Assembly of Thailand have always maintained
close exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The visit to China by Wan Muhammad Nor Matha last year and the
visit to Thailand by Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress of China Li Peng earlier this year,
among other exchanges, have deepened the mutual understanding and
cooperation between the parliaments of the two countries, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China and Thailand are good neighbors, partners and
friends, with relations dating back more than 2,000 years. The two
countries now enjoy close cooperation in the fields of politics,
economy and culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his satisfaction over the development of Sino-
Thai relations and his confidence in the prospects of further
development of cooperation in the future, saying there are no
historical problems, nor any current conflict of interests between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the Asian financial crisis, Jiang said the Thai government
and people, after more than two years of arduous efforts, have
weathered the most difficult time since the outbreak of the crisis,
and the Thai economy is now moving steadily toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the crisis, the Chinese government held to
its promise not to devalue the renminbi, the Chinese currency, and
tried to aid Thailand and other countries severely struck by the
crisis, despite the great difficulties inflicted by the crisis
upon China.
</P>
<P>
The Thai National Assembly president said Thailand and China
have been enjoying a long-term close cooperation. The current
visit to Thailand by President Jiang constitutes a major event in
the history of the relations between the two countries and will
definitely have an important and profound impact on the
development of such relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai National Assembly and the National People's
Congress of China have maintained close exchanges between them,
adding that his visit to China last year and the visit to Thailand
by Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China Li Peng, among other exchanges, have promoted
the friendship between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai National Assembly will further strengthen its
exchanges with the Chinese National People's Congress in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin also met former Thai
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh this morning. Jiang thanked
Chavalit for his constructive work to accelerate the development
of Sino-Thai friendship and cooperation over the past years.

BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's modernization drive
calls for a long-term peaceful international environment and a
good surrounding environment, President Jiang Zemin said in
Bangkok today.
</P>
<P>
The stability and development in China, the peace and
prosperity in its surrounding areas, and a new regional security
order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, are
where the common interests of Asian countries and the fundamental
interests of China lie, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived Thursday afternoon for a state visit, said
this during a speech entitled "Enhance Good-Neighborliness and
Friendship and Build a Better Future Together" at the National
Cultural Center of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China firmly opposes hegemonism and power politics
and will never seek hegemony -- that is a solemn commitment that
the Chinese government and people have made to the whole world."
</P>
<P>
He said China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace
and a defense policy of a defensive nature, saying a developed
China will pose no threat to any country, and it will only be
conducive to regional and world peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Even when China becomes more developed in the future, Jiang
said, it will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of
peace and will stand firmly together with all other developing
countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
In the new century, the Chinese people will stand ready to work
together with the people of Thailand, ASEAN, Asia and other
countries in the world for the lofty cause of peace and
development in Asia and in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
On China's reunification cause, Jiang said that to keep the
nation unified has always been the main stream in China's history
and a lofty goal that the Chinese people have cherished from
generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "There is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of Chinese territory. To solve the Taiwan
question in accordance with the basic principles of 'peaceful
reunification' and 'one country, two systems,' represents the
common aspiration of the entire Chinese people and the
overwhelming historical trend of China's development.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Hong Kong, since its return to China, has
shown that China's complete reunification is conducive to Asia's
stability and prosperity, Jiang added.

<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The China Nuclear Insurance
Community (CNIC) was set up here today, indicating deeper
cooperation in the country's high risk insurance community.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear insurance group consists of the China Reinsurance
Company, the People's Insurance Company of China, the China
Pacific Insurance Company, the China Ping'an Insurance Company,
and the Huatai Insurance Company.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai Fengju, chairman of the CNIC, the various
insurance companies within the community will share risks and
losses, which will provide insurance and guarantees to the fullest
extent for the country's nuclear power development.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the services of the nuclear insurance community
include loss and liability insurance concerning nuclear power
stations within the border of China as well as other commercial
and civilian nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power plants demand higher safety standards than
facilities in other sectors. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in
south China's Shenzhen City, for instance, was insured at 1.4
billion U.S. dollars for property -- a cost which could not be
borne by any single insurance company.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Close to Deal on Implementing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said Friday that Israel and the Palestinians were very
close to an agreement on the implementation of a U.S.-brokered
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are very close to concluding an agreement on the Wye River
Accord," Levy said at a joint news conference after talks with
visiting United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
"It is never in doubt that Israel will implement the Wye
agreement...I hope the other sides will accept its responsibility
in the process," he said, referring to the interim agreement
signed and then frozen by former hard-line Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both Israeli and Palestinian sources said they had
overcome the last major obstacle to an agreement on the
implementation of the Wye agreement: the dispute over the release
of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Palestinians had accepted the Israeli
proposal that Israel release 350 Palestinian security prisoners,
or political prisoners called by the Palestinians. The
Palestinians had demanded the release of 400 political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports from Egypt quoted Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat as saying that a deal had
already been reached and a signing ceremony would be held in the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
But after arriving in Gaza from the Egyptian port city of
Alexandria, Arafat told reporters that a deal had yet to be
finalized and there were still difficult issues.
</P>
<P>
A tentatively planned signing ceremony in Alexandria Thursday
afternoon was scotched by continued difference between Israel and
the Palestinians over the prisoner issue.
</P>
<P>
The dispute forced Albright, who had planned to oversee the
ceremony, to intervene to mediate between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
She held talks with Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Thursday evening in Alexandria before flying to Israel into an
immediate meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak, which Albright
described as "excellent" at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office issued the statement after the meeting, which
lasted for three and a half hours, saying that the Israeli side
expected answers from the Palestinian side over the Israeli
proposal on the prisoners issue Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the two sides were trying to resolve a last
dispute on the draft deal, the one banning the two sides from
taking unilateral actions in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
These actions include the building of Jewish settlements by
the Israeli side and a unilateral declaration of Palestinian
state by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said this issue might be resolved by a letter
written by the U.S. and attached to the agreement.

<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The three-volume "Return of
Macao," with a preface by China's Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, has
been published by the Xinhua Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
The preface says that the Chinese government will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20 this year, and
that Macao will become a special administrative region of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that the return of Macao to the motherland
will put an end to over 400 years of humiliation suffered by the
Chinese nation, signaling a further step forward toward
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
And it hails the return of Macao, another great event following
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier says in his preface that the State Council
appointed the first Chief Executive of the Macao Special
Administrative Region this May, which marks the start of "Macao
people governing Macao."
</P>
<P>
The preface says that "peaceful reunification" and "one country,
two systems" are consistent policies of the Chinese government.
With the "one China" principle, the great cause of reunifying the
motherland is bound to succeed, with the joint efforts of the
Chinese at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on International Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A lasting peace of the
international community must be built on the basis of a new
security concept through enhanced mutual confidence and common
interests, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said in Bangkok today.
</P>
<P>
"To safeguard the international security, the Cold War
mentality must be cast away completely. Mutual confidence should
be enhanced through dialogue, security should be sought through
cooperation, and disputes settled through peaceful means on the
basis of mutual respect for state sovereignty," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Thursday afternoon on a state visit,
said this during a speech entitled "Enhance Good-Neighborliness
and Friendship and Build a Better Future Together" at the National
Cultural Center of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He spoke at the invitation of the International Studies Center
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
At present, the international situation is undergoing profound
changes and, on the whole, it has been moving towards relaxation
since the end of the Cold War, Jiang said, adding there has been
an increasingly louder and bigger voice for peace, stability and
development in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, he went on to say, "The world is far from being
tranquil. Hegemonism and power politics still exist and have even
been developed in the international political, economic and
security fields.
</P>
<P>
The new "gunboat policy" and the economic neo-colonialism
pursued by some big powers have severely undermined the sovereign
independence and the development interests of many small- and
medium-sized countries, and have threatened world peace and
international security, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
To maintain world peace and promote common development, he
stressed, all countries must strictly abide by the basic norms
governing international relations that have been established since
the end of the war against Fascism in the world, including the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the purposes and
principles of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
No country should be allowed to defy the laws, or willfully
violate and trample on these norms, Jiang said, adding that all
countries, regardless of their strength, are equal members of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The internal affairs of any country should be decided by its
own people, while international affairs should be addressed by all
through discussion, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted this is the common will of all the peace-loving
countries and peoples, and it is also an irresistible historical
trend.
</P>
<P>
On international economic exchanges, Jiang said this should be
conducted in compliance with the principles of equality, mutual
benefit and common development.
</P>
<P>
In working out new rules for international economic and trade
activities, Jiang said, the reasonable demands of the developing
countries should be adequately reflected and their legitimate
rights and interests be protected. He also urged the developed
countries to shoulder more obligations as they have the capability
to do so.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the malignant trend of the continuously widening
gap between the South and the North should deserve high attention
and concrete and effective measures be taken to gradually settle
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Jiang noted, the poor will become poorer and the
rich richer.
</P>
<P>
In that case, not only will developing countries find their
economic development hampered, but developed countries will also
find it difficult to achieve a steady economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
targeted to provide 781,213 homes households for 1999-2004,
Housing and Urban Development Council (HUDCC) Secretary Karina
David said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Congress, David said of this total about 509,303
households or 65 percent correspond to the socialized sector, that
is, the informal settler, income poor or homeless.
</P>
<P>
He said the HUDCC will mobilize approximately 200.5 billion
pesos (5 billion U.S. dollars) in public and private funds to
provide decent and affordable housing to those families, which is
the bottom 30 percent of Philippine economic society.
</P>
<P>
For the year 2000, the government is targeting to provide
social and economic housing to 144,738 homes or 18.5 percent of
the overall six-year planned target, with an estimated funding
requirement of 31.7 billion pesos (792.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The HUDCC said during the past year, the government housing
agencies provided socialized and low-cost housing to 89,516
households valued at 14.9 billion pesos (372.5 million dollars).

peace and development in Asia, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have the reason to believe that so long as the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are adhered to, there is a
bright prospect for the development of friendly relations between
China and ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"China and ASEAN countries should always be good neighbors,
good friends and good partners," the Chinese president noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived Thursday afternoon on a state visit, made
the remarks in a speech entitled "Enhance Good-Neighbourliness and
Friendship and Build a Better Future Together" at the National
Cultural Center of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Both China and ASEAN countries are advocates for a new
international order, he said, adding "Our consensus on strategic
issues is increasing."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Both China and ASEAN countries need to maintain good-
neighborliness and friendship with each other. So long as we
always try to resort to friendly consultation, there is no dispute
that cannot be solved."
</P>
<P>
In the course of the Asian financial crisis, Jiang went on to
say, China shared the difficulties of Thailand and other ASEAN
countries, went through thick and thin together with them, and
provided assistance within its capacity to the affected countries.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to have in-depth discussions with the relevant
ASEAN countries on the principles and ways of safeguarding peace
and stability in this region as well as in the South China Sea. It
stands for the settlement of existing differences through friendly
consultation and negotiation," he said.

<HEADLINE> MQM Stages Anti-Government Rally in Karachi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of activists of the
ethnic Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) Friday staged an
anti-government rally in a tense area of Pakistan's commercial
nerve center of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
MQM workers waving their party flags in the densely-populated
Burns road overcame the barricades erected by the security forces
to prevent the planned rally, sources from Karachi said.
</P>
<P>
Police fired in the air and used batons to prevent the MQM
demonstrators from entering the rally site in Burns road area.
However, about 400 activists managed to break the siege.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of policemen and other security personnel ringed the
venue for the protest rally. The security forces were seen
patrolling the area in armored vehicles and commandeered buses.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the rally, the police shot dead two MQM activists
in the city and sealed the city center to prevent the planned
anti-government rally.
</P>
<P>
MQM had been a coalition partner of the ruling Pakistan Muslim
League until a year ago when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif parted
ways with the group for its alleged involvement in the murder of
former provincial governor Hakim Saeed.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Encourage Entry of More Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
continue with its policy of liberalizing the banking environment
and allowing the entry of more foreign banks, Presidential
Spokesman Jerry Barican said Friday in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Barican said this policy does not pose a threat to the local
banking industry but will further strengthen it since local banks
would be able to develop their expertise and resources to meet the
growing needs of their clientele.
</P>
<P>
Smaller banks, on the other hand, will also be able to find
their "niche" in the banking system by undertaking specialized
services that larger banks are unable to offer, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barican stressed that "some macroeconomic mechanisms
would have to be put in place to ensure that majority of the
assets of the banking industry will remain within the hands of
Filipinos."
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Bank of the Philippines will continue to
encourage the consolidations and mergers among local banks by
extending short-term incentives to those planning to combine their
resources, services and technological know-how.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's move to encourage the mergers of local banks
is part of the measures being implemented to further strengthen
the local banking industry, which has remained stable despite the
economic crisis that had swept across Asia.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has vowed to institute
reforms in the banking industry to make the economy more
competitive and has urged the congress to pass his
administration's priority measure which seeks amendments to the
General Banking Act.

<HEADLINE> Botswana President Defends State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Botswana President Festus
Mogae Friday defended Thursday's declaration of a state of
emergency ahead of the country's general elections scheduled for
October 16, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Mogae declared the emergency in order to recall parliament and
amend the Electoral Act to allow 60,000 more voters to take part
in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The 60,000 voters registered during a supplementary
registration exercise, but were not included in the voters' roll.
</P>
<P>
According to Section 27 of the Electoral Act, however, the
supervisor of elections is barred from preparing, publishing or
certifying a roll of voters after the president has issued an
election writ.
</P>
<P>
Mogae issued the writ for election date last week.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the presidential office said that Mogae learnt
only Monday that the country's Independent Electoral Commission
(IEC) had been unable to finish its work to enable the 60,000
names to be added to the voters' rolls.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to criticisms that the state of emergency was too
dramatic a way of dealing with the problem, Mogae's spokesman
Andrew Sesinyi said the president had no other legal options.
</P>
<P>
"He could not consider any criticism his action might attract.
The only issue was that 60,000 people would have been denied their
constitutional right to vote, had he not done what he did. That
was unacceptable to him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sesinyi said the matter was not a crisis as no freedom or
rights had been suspended. The problem was being rectified in a
prompt and lawful way.
</P>
<P>
Mogae had been under the impression the IEC would continue
working until October 10. Neither he, the chairman of the IEC, nor
the attorney-general had realized that once a writ of election had
been issued, the IEC could not make any further changes to the
rolls.
</P>
<P>
"The president had been told the IEC would have completed its
work by October 10, in time for elections in October as has been
the case for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament was dissolved, the only way it could be reconvened
was through a state of emergency," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
When the house reconvenes Monday ostensibly to debate the state
of emergency, the more important matter on the order paper will be
amendments to the Electoral Act to allow the IEC to carry on its
work despite the writ of election.
</P>
<P>
Mogae has also canceled next week's trip to a special meeting
of the Organization of African Unity in Libya.
</P>
<P>
Sesinyi refused to suggest who had been responsible for the
debacle. He said the matter would be investigated.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking stock and asking questions. The emergency will
be lifted as soon as all the necessary things have been done,
after the IEC has completed its task and parliament met and
amended the law as necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has a population of 1.5 million, of which 900,000 are
eligible for the voting. Including the 60,000 disqualified voters,
460,000, or 51 percent of the eligible voters, have registered.

<HEADLINE> Two World Records Fall at Asian Weightlifting Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, CHINA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Two world records fell at
the hands of Chinese strongwoman Lin Weining in the 69kg category
of the Asian Weightlifting Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Lin roared the world record at her third
attempt with a jerk of 142.5 kilograms which gave her another
world mark for a total of 252.5kg.
</P>
<P>
"I exploded my personal-best of 142.5kg in the jerk, but I was
a little bit upset for not shattering the snatch world record,"
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin's junior compatriot Zhao Nan lifted 138.0kg for a new world
record, 0.5kg heavier than the previous weight set by Lin at the
World Youth Weightlifting Championships in Savannah, United States
in July before Lin snatched 138.5kg at her second attempt.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin snapped Zhao's delight by lifting 138.5kg at her
second attempt before she added the bar to 142.5kg.
</P>
<P>
"I always set my target to break the world record as heavy as
possible," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hsi-Li from Chinese Taipei won the silver medal with a
total of 230.kg and Kageyama Miya of Japan place third for 177.5kg.
</P>
<P>
Shahin Nassirinia of Iran swept three titles in the men's 85kg
class with a snatch of 170.0, a jerk of 200.0 and a total of 370.
0kg,followed by his compatriot Hassan Pasham 342.5kg.
</P>
<P>
"My coach and I were confident to break the snatch world record
of 180.0kg at the World Weightlifting Championships in Athens,
Greece on November," said Nassirinia after failing to lift 180.5kg
at his third attempt.
</P>
<P>
The competitions of the women's 75kg and men's 94kg categories
will be contested tomorrow.

"We welcome the economic integration of ASEAN and are taking an
active part in cooperating in the Lancang-Mekong River basin
development. We attach great importance to the ASEAN Vision 2020
and the Hanoi Plan of Action, and hope to deepen cooperation with
ASEAN in the economic, trade, scientific and technological, social
and other fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN have become each other's important trade and
investment partners, he said, adding that China has signed or
issued documents for the 21st-century-oriented cooperation with
Thailand, Vietnam Malaysia and Brunei, and it hopes to further
deepen the mutually beneficial cooperation with all ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
On Asian countries, Jiang said national independence and
unification are important prerequisites for the great success of
Asian countries, and the drastic changes and the rise of Asia
represent a great miracle performed by the Asian people as well as
an important symbol of the development and progress of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
Self-confidence, self-respect, self-reliance and self-
improvement are an important Asian spirit that has encouraged the
Asian people to go in for change and reform and remove all
obstacles and difficulties, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the threshold of the new century, he said, the Asian people
are thinking about the future of Asia and that of the world as
well.
</P>
<P>
How to continue the efforts to promote the establishment of a
just and reasonable new international political and economic order
of peace and stability and work hard to bring into the 21st
century of a new Asia and a new world with lasting pace and
universal prosperity? Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Judicial Cooperation with Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin Friday called on the judicial departments of China and
Thailand to further expand bilateral exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the Thai Supreme Court President Pintip
Sucharitkul here, Jiang hoped that bilateral judicial cooperation
should be particularly conducted to combat transnational organized
crimes related to drug trafficking, smuggling, economic crimes and
illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China's great achievements in economic construction
since its opening-up and reform 20 years ago could not be
separated from its efforts to build and perfect the legal system.
</P>
<P>
Rule of law constitutes a fundamental policy of the Chinese
government, which also stems from the need to develop the
socialist market economy and provides an important guarantee for
maintaining the long-term and sustained stability of the country,
said the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Hence, Jiang said, the Chinese government highly values
judicial reform while strengthening legislation.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Thailand now enjoy close ties of
cooperation, which he believes could not be secured without the
efforts made by people from all walks of life. The Supreme Court
of Thailand, in particular, has played an important role in the
development of such ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pintip said the Sino-Thai judicial cooperation has been
proceeding well. Both sides have signed a treaty on judicial
assistance. The two countries have cooperated well in combating
drug trafficking, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped for closer exchanges and cooperation between
China and Thailand in the judicial sphere in the future.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Jiang also met with Thai Privy
Councilor Prem Tinsulanonda. The Chinese president believed that
Prem, also former Thai prime minister and an old friend of the
Chinese people, will continue to make new contributions to the
development of the full-fledged Sino-Thai friendship and
cooperation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Prem noted that as an old friend of China, he keenly hopes that
the friendly relations between Thailand and China will continue to
grow.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, hosted a
dinner here Friday evening in honor of visiting Ecuadorian
President Jamil Mahuad Witt.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to the Ecuadorian president, Tung said Hong
Kong and Ecuador are separated by a vast ocean, but the links
across the Pacific are still developing and evolving.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Hong Kong visit by an Ecuadorian business
delegation along with the president is very important for forging
closer ties between Hong Kong and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
"Ecuador has an abundance of natural resources that are
exported around the world either as raw material or as processed
goods or as fruit or food.
</P>
<P>
"Here in Hong Kong we have no natural resources except the
finest deep-water port in Asia and our location as the preeminent
gateway to trade and investment with the Chinese mainland and
greater East Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Tung said, "Ecuadorian enterprises looking for new
markets in China and Asia will certainly find all that they need
in Hong Kong to facilitate their undertakings.
</P>
<P>
"On the other side of the coin, there is undoubtedly
opportunity to explore new markets for our goods and services in
Ecuador," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung also said he was delighted to learn that the state visit
by the Ecuadorian president to China was successful and that the
relationship between the two countries is moving forward from
strength to strength.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian president arrived in Hong Kong Friday for a two-
day visit on the last leg of his China tour.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Good Drug Donation Practice in New Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (
WHO) has issued new guidelines for drug donations during
emergencies since the disposal of unwanted drugs has made a bad
situation worse in some cases, according to a WHO press release
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as any disaster reaches our television screens, many
drugs, the great majority sent with the best of intentions, are
dispatched to the scene of the emergency," said Dr Jonathan Quick,
Director of WHO's Department of Essential Drugs and Other
Medicines.
</P>
<P>
"However, there have also been problems with some drug
donations," he added. "They fail to meet the most urgent real
health needs and, once in the recipient country, they clog up
already overloaded distribution systems and become difficult to
dispose of," said Quick.
</P>
<P>
A recent WHO survey of 108 drug donation lists submitted to the
Albanian Ministry of Health during May 1999 found that half of
these lists only mentioned trade names, many of which were unknown
to local health professionals; only 56 percent included
information on shelf-life, of which about 41 percent of the drugs
had a remaining shelf-life of less than one year; and 18 percent
of donations contained small packs of free samples or drugs
returned to pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
In its new guidelines, WHO stressed that none of the above-
mentioned practices are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
It repeated its plea to donors to ensure that their donations
are of maximum benefit to the recipient; respect the wishes and
authority of the recipient; strictly avoid any double standards in
quality; and are based on effective communication between donor
and recipient.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that the release of the revised guidelines is
particularly timely in light of the flux of drug donations into
Turkey following the earthquake there.

"I have got a massive job ahead of me. It's a great challenge
and I am up for it. There is no need for panic here."
</P>
<P>
Chairman Freddie Shepherd introduced Robson to a packed news
conference saying his first priority was to improve results -
Newcastle have not won a game since April.
</P>
<P>
But he said Robson, who has only signed a contract until the
end of the season, will also undertake a thorough review of all
aspects of the playing side.
</P>
<P>
Robson replaces Dutchman Ruud Gullit, who quit the Magpies last
Saturday after one of the worst starts to the season in the club's
history. Newcastle have only one point from six games in the
Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Robson said he had no immediate plans to bring in his own
deputy to replace Steve Clarke, the second-in-command appointed by
Gullit.
</P>
<P>
He said he had dreamed about managing Newcastle since he
watched the team as a boy in the 1950s but thought his chance had
gone when he turned the job down while manager of Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
"I thought Barcelona was a big club but I think this has just
pipped that."
</P>
<P>
He was courted for the top job at St James' Park during his
time in charge of the Spanish giants.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to break his contract and the job passed to
Kenny Dalglish.
</P>
<P>
Robson has not managed an English club side since leaving
Ipswich in 1982 to take over as England manager.
</P>
<P>
The oldest manager in the Premiership, Robson instead found
success at clubs in Portugal, the Netherlands and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Skipper Alan Shearer, whose breakdown in relations with Gullit
was one of the factors in the Dutchman's decision to quit,
welcomed his new boss.
</P>
<P>
"I have never had the privilege of playing for Bobby Robson,
but it is obvious from his track record that he is an outstanding
achiever with vast experience of football at every level.
</P>
<P>
"He also has local roots and will understand and share the
passion of our magnificent fans. I am looking forward to playing
for him," said the star football player.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Drops Back to 29-Year Low in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
dropped back to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in August because of
gains in computer services and health care jobs, the Labor
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that the decrease in August's
unemployment rate followed a 4.3 percent rate in July. Despite the
decline in the unemployment rate, employers added a
smaller-than-expected 124,000 jobs to their payrolls in August,
following a gain of 338,000 jobs in July.
</P>
<P>
In August, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation
pressures, grew a tiny 0.2 percent to 13.30 dollars, a 3.5 percent
increase compared to a year ago. That was the third straight
monthly rise, but slightly slower than 0.3 percent increase in
July.
</P>
<P>
The report showed the number of service sector jobs increased
by 132,000 last month, led by gains in computer services which
grew by 15,000 jobs. Doctors offices, hospitals and other
health-care facilities added 19,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers, still feeling the lingering affects of the
global financial crisis, cut 63,000 jobs in August. That more than
wiped out an increase of 51,000 jobs in July.
</P>
<P>
The loss in manufacturing jobs hit the apparel and industrial
machinery industries hardest, while car and furniture makers
continued to add jobs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, construction jobs declined by 29,000, largely
offsetting gains in the previous two months.

The decision to set up the leadership council was made at a
