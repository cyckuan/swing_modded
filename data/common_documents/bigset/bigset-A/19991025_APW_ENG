<HEADLINE> Comebacks Haunt Miami No More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Miami Hurricanes coach Butch Davis was unusually  
calm after falling behind Boston College 28-0 in the third quarter, 
and it's easy to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew better than to think the lead was insurmountable.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis was the defensive line coach in 1984 when Miami blew a  
31-point lead to Maryland in what is still the biggest college 
football comeback ever. The very next week, Miami lost to BC in a 
47-45 shootout that ended on Doug Flutie's 48-yard desperation 
touchdown heave. 
</P>
<P>
	``People ask you, `Have you ever seen anything like this  
before?' Unfortunately, I've been on the other side of that,'' 
Davis said Sunday, a day after the Hurricanes rallied from a 
four-touchdown deficit to beat Boston College 31-28. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably the calmest I've ever been in a locker room at  
halftime,'' Davis said. ``It's not about screaming and ranting and 
raving. It's about execution and making some plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 23 Miami (3-3, 1-0 Big East) had not beaten a Division I-A  
opponent since August, when they beat Ohio State in the Kickoff 
Classic. They followed that with a win over Florida A&AMP;M before 
losing three straight by a total of 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami has led in all three losses -- including blown  
fourth-quarter leads against Penn State and East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some last-minute games like this earlier this year  
and last year,'' said Daniel Franks, who caught the game-tying 
touchdown pass with 3:51 left. ``It was nice to be able to pull one 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami also has had three weeks off, the most recent last weekend  
when the game against Temple was postponed until Dec. 4 because of 
Hurricane Irene. Davis said he thinks rust might factor into why 
his team looked so bad in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to believe that the inconsistency has got to come  
from the schedule,'' he said. ``They're not good enough to put it 
on automatic pilot. The game was faster than they were at that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite losing the last 10 matchups, Boston College (5-2, 2-2)  
has come close the last three games at home. Miami won 17-14 in 
1995 when the Eagles missed a desperation last-second field goal; 
in '97, Miami won 45-44 in double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Miami spotted BC a 28-0 lead with 21 minutes left,  
committing virtually every imaginable mistake in the process. There 
were a handful of dropped passes, some shanked punts and two 
fourth-down penalties that led to Boston College touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But BC made all of the mistakes in the second half, and Miami  
took advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inexcusable,'' Eagles safety Pedro Cirino said. ``We're  
never going to let it happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami scored four consecutive touchdowns to tie it -- two of them  
just 22 seconds apart. Then, facing a fourth-and-17 from the BC 35 
with 14 seconds to play and no timeouts, Kenny Kelly hit Reggie 
Wayne on the sideline for a 22-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne stepped out of bounds to stop the clock, setting up Andy  
Crosland's game-winning 30-yard field goal with 3 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long history. It goes all the way back to Doug  
Flutie,'' Franks said. ``Every time we play, it seems like a 
dogfight.''

<HEADLINE> Buffett Group Acquires Iowa Utility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- An investor group led by billionaire  
investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has agreed to 
acquire MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. for about $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal announced today, Berkshire Hathaway of Omaha, Neb.,  
will acquire the Des Moines-based utility for $35.05 per share, 
about 29 percent over Friday's closing price of $27.25. Berkshire 
will also assume about $7 billion in debt in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition is Berkshire's first investment in the energy  
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We buy good companies with outstanding management and good  
growth potential at a fair price, and we're willing to wait longer 
than some investors for that potential to be realized,'' Buffett 
said in a statement. ``This investment is right in our sweet 
spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MidAmerican president Gregory E. Abel said his company will  
benefit from having Berkshire ``as our primary sponsor or 
shareholder'' and can count on having ``their capital resources and 
support to any specific transaction we pursue going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MidAmerican merged with the Omaha-based CalEnergy, an  
international energy company, last March. MidAmerican has about 
9,800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its retail utility subsidiaries, MidAmerican Energy in  
the U.S. and Northern Electric in the United Kingdom, the company 
provides electric service to 2.2 million customers and natural gas 
service to 1.2 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire will have about a 75 percent interest in MidAmerican  
Energy. The other investors, who are also based in Omaha, are 
Walter Scott, former chairman of Omaha-based Peter Kiewit Sons' 
Inc. and MidAmerican's largest individual stockholder, and certain 
Scott family interests, and David L. Sokol, the chairman and chief 
executive officer of MidAmerican. Sokol is an Omaha executive whom 
Kiewit backed as part of its purchase of a controlling stake in 
CalEnergy. 
</P>
<P>
	MidAmerican's directors approved the deal on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's headquarters will remain in Des Moines, with the  
office of the chairman and CEO remaining in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really business as usual,'' Abel said today in a phone  
interview. ``We don't anticipate any management or employment 
changes as a result of this transaction and I think we're all very 
excited with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the completion of the transaction, expected by April 2000,  
MidAmerican will become a privately owned company with publicly 
traded fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction so far has been very positive. When you look at  
it, people, I think, believe it's a fair price,'' Abel said.

<HEADLINE> 3M Profits Rise 17.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing on  
Monday reported a nearly 18 percent increase in third-quarter 
profits, beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	3M, which manufactures a wide range of industrial, commercial  
and health care products including Post-it Notes, Scotch tape and 
Thinsulate insulation, said earnings were helped by increased sales 
and a new line of products. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings before one-time items came to $462 million, or $1.14 a  
share, compared with $392 million, or 97 cents a share, during the 
same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings topped the $1.06-per-share expectations of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not include one-time charges for restructuring  
and litigation or one-time gains from divestiture. When those 
amounts are included, 3M reported net earnings of $459 million, or 
$1.13 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues increased 6.1 percent to $3.99 billion from $3.77  
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and CEO L.D. DeSimone said 3M's profits were also  
boosted by cutting administrative expenses and double-digit volume 
gains in the Asia-Pacific region and a 6 percent gain in European 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's consumer and office, electro and communications,  
and specialty materials businesses led sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, net income totaled $1.32 billion, or  
$3.25 per share, compared with $964 million, or $2.36 per share in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $11.63 billion, up 3.6 percent from $11.23 billion  
in the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	3M shares were up 6 cents to $92.63 a share on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> USOC President Hybl To Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee will  
start with a clean slate of leaders at least a year before the 
scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most harrowing years in U.S. Olympic history is  
ending with USOC president Bill Hybl's decision to follow executive 
director Dick Schultz in stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl told USOC board members Sunday that he will not seek  
reelection and will leave office after completing his four-year 
term at the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a year when a bribery scandal in Salt Lake City stained the  
Olympic image, three of the most powerful men in the USOC have 
announced their resignations -- former marketing boss John Krimsky, 
Schultz, and now Hybl. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl, 57, said his business obligations as chief executive  
officer of the philanthropic El Pomar Foundation and vice chairman 
of the luxurious Broadmoor hotel in Colorado Springs were too 
pressing to continue his 40-60 hour a week volunteer position at 
the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick and I talked about this over the last three months,''  
Hybl said. ``It really is a question of being able to devote the 
amount of time necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the deciding factor was his feeling that he had to  
devote all his energy at the USOC over the next 14 months to moving 
ahead with an independent drug-testing program and putting 
restructuring proposals into place without spending time running 
for another term. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some regrets,'' Hybl said, saying he might have  
pushed sooner for the independent drug-testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for all of us currently in office, Salt Lake City and,  
to a lesser degree, Atlanta have had an impact on the way that 
we've been perceived by the public. And it's our job then to work 
even harder to bring the true Olympic ideals back to the 
forefront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz praised Hybl's quiet, steadying influence in the face of  
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did a great job in providing the leadership we needed  
during the Salt Lake City challenge,'' Schultz said. ``The thing 
everybody has to realize is that the president's job, as it's 
constructed now, demands a huge amount of time. I'm amazed that he 
or any other volunteer could give that amount of time. This is a 
job you don't get paid for. You get all the crap and none of the 
glory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz announced two months ago that he would resign as soon as  
a replacement was found. He could be replaced as early as February. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be 71 by the time of Sydney,'' Schultz said. ``What we  
need now in a chief executive officer is somebody willing to come 
in and make a 5- to 10-year commitment, start the changes, see them 
through and have that continuity. My family would kill me if I made 
another five-year commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said he believes ``the transition will be seamless'' as the  
USOC installs new leaders. He and Schultz will continue to help 
with fund raising and act as advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the chairman/president role goes,'' Hybl said,  
``there are 20 to 25 individuals in this movement in the United 
States that could do that job starting tomorrow, and that's why I'm 
comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said he also believes that International Olympic Committee  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch is serious about reforming the IOC 
in the wake of its bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is making, I believe, many of the right steps to present a  
new face of the IOC to the world,'' Hybl said. ``The greatest thing 
he is doing is involving the athletes, electing their own 
representatives, 15 of them, to serve on the IOC as voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC already has 20 athletes on its 113-member board, while  
20 percent of the executive committee is made up of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will be the legacy,'' Hybl said. ``They're not always  
right, in my view, but they certainly are a conscience to this 
organization.''

<HEADLINE> McKeon Unsure If He'll Manage Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jack McKeon doesn't know if he'll manage the  
Cincinnati Reds again. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon spent the weekend at his North Carolina home watching his  
grandchildren, taking in the World Series and thinking about the 
club's disappointing contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Sunday night, he hadn't decided whether to accept the  
offer of a one-year extension with a minimal raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in the next day or so,'' McKeon said, in a telephone  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got a tough choice to make.  
</P>
<P>
	McKeon returned to his home in Elon College, N.C., after meeting  
with Reds managing executive John Allen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got an offer. There was no negotiating,'' McKeon said.  
``They said it was a firm offer. There was no movement at all on 
their part. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the way you look at it is: It's take it or leave it.''  
</P>
<P>
	McKeon, who turns 69 next month, is a candidate for the NL  
Manager of the Year award. He led the Reds to 96 victories -- their 
best total since 1976 -- despite a $35 million payroll last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds missed out on the playoffs by losing a one-game  
tiebreaker for the NL wild card berth to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon's one-year contract expired at the end of the season, and  
the front office had to wait until a new ownership group took over 
for Marge Schott before talking to McKeon about an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	During the season, McKeon made it clear he wanted at least a  
two-year deal and a raise that would put him on par with other 
managers. McKeon made a little more than $500,000 last season in 
base salary and incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' offer reportedly contained a pay increase of about  
$50,000 over last season. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching other recent manager hires, McKeon expected a  
much better offer. Buddy Bell recently got a three-year contract 
from Colorado reportedly worth $2.25 million, and the Detroit 
Tigers gave Phil Garner a four-year deal reportedly worth $1.2 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' McKeon said of the Reds' offer. ``I thought  
they'd have a better figure than they gave.''

<HEADLINE> Annan Criticizes U.S. on Iraq Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan took aim at  
the United States for continuing to hold up contracts that he said 
could relieve the suffering of ordinary Iraqis trying to cope with 
economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the U.N. Security Council circulated Monday, he  
said the number of holds on contracts has continued to increase in 
the past two months -- to 572 contracts worth about $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While Annan didn't specifically mention the United States, the  
letter was clearly directed at the United States, which at the end 
of August had placed holds on more than 450 of the 500 contracts 
that hadn't been approved. Britain had placed holds on the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan asked the U.N. Sanctions Committee, which reviews what  
food, medicine and other aid can be purchased by Iraq through 
U.N.-supervised oil sales, to undertake an early review of all 
applications now on hold ``with a view to expediting a decision, as 
appropriate, in each case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh defended the U.S. holds,  
expressing concern that Saddam Hussein's government could direct 
the equipment towards weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put contracts on hold for a variety of different reasons  
including potential dual use, contracts that are sponsored by 
questionable firms, and contracts which are not justified under the 
humanitarian oil-for-food program,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has been barred from selling its oil on the open market  
since the Security Council imposed sanctions following its 1990 
invasion of Kuwait. Concerned that ordinary Iraqis were suffering 
the brunt of the sanctions, the council in 1996 began allowing Iraq 
to sell limited amounts of oil provided the proceeds went to buy 
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The program lets Iraq export $5.26 billion in oil every six  
months primarily to buy food and medicine, but has been expanded to 
include other sectors including water, utilities and spare parts 
for the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	While still deadlocked on an overall new policy for Iraq, the  
Security Council decided earlier this month to increase Baghdad's 
export cap by more than $3 billion for the current six-month phase. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations reported Monday that last week Iraqi oil  
exports surged to a post-Gulf War record of 2.94 million barrels 
per day. Exports had been averaging about 2.08 million barrels per 
day since May. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week, the Security Council is expected to debate  
Annan's recommendation to double the $300 million worth of oil 
sector spare parts that Iraq is allowed to import under the 
oil-for-food program during the current six-month period.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Chain Gang Revival Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The revival of chain gangs in Alabama  
four years ago, partly to discourage crime by showing how miserable 
prison could be, has come to a quiet end. 
</P>
<P>
	State prison officials earlier this month closed down the last  
detail of shackled inmates because of a need for more guards inside 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections' spokesman Tom Gilkeson said Monday the financially  
strapped department needs 300 additional officers inside its 
lockups and cannot spare employees to accompany medium-security 
inmates on roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have enough people for it,'' Gilkeson said.  
</P>
<P>
	When former Gov. Fob James revived the chain gangs in mid-1995,  
inmates were chained in groups of five with 8-foot leg irons 
connecting them. That form of chain gang ended after a lawsuit was 
filed challenging it. Under an agreement between the state and 
inmates' attorneys, prisoners on road details were shackled at the 
ankles individually. 
</P>
<P>
	The revival of chain gangs in Alabama in 1995 led Florida,  
Arizona, Wisconsin and Iowa, as well as sheriffs in several 
jurisdictions, to adopt forms of the leg-ironed work crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Before ending the detail, Limestone Correctional Facility had  
been sending out 320 medium-security inmates on 10-hour days 
picking up litter and cutting underbrush along highways while 
wearing chains around the ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just feel the manpower can be better utilized keeping the  
medium custody squads on state property,'' warden Ralph Hooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama corrections officials earlier discontinued chain gang  
details at other prisons.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Not Giving Up on Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Their bodies injured along with their pride, the  
Denver Broncos looked back at Sunday's loss to New England as a 
case of missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	But, at 2-5, they refused to write off the season.  
</P>
<P>
	Realistically, kicker Jason Elam said, the Broncos need to go  
8-1 the rest of the way to have a legitimate shot at the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got to win eight of the next nine, at least,''  
Elam said Monday. ``But we're only thinking about our next 
opponent, Minnesota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Howard Griffith agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	After an 0-4 start, the two-time defending Super Bowl champions  
posted back-to-back wins over Oakland and Green Bay before 
stumbling on Sunday at New England. Elam missed a 59-yard field 
goal attempt with 1:45 left, allowing the Patriots to escape with a 
24-23 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, while acknowledging that the feeling among his  
teammates is more positive at 2-5 than it was at 0-4, said, 
``You've still got to go out and play. And the bottom line is, if 
we go out and play as well as we're capable of playing, good things 
can happen. We can't worry about what our status means in terms of 
being a potential playoff team. We need to worry about our next 
game, and this is against another outstanding team in Minnesota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Shanahan put it succinctly after Sunday's game:  
``Until we're mathematically out of it, you're going to see our 
best shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Shanahan noted that San Diego started 0-4 in 1992 and  
made the playoffs, and Washington started 7-1 in 1996 and failed to 
make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really doesn't matter right now,'' he said. ``I just know  
that we have to win some football games and play extremely well in 
all three phases to give us a chance to get there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take advantage of the opportunities like we passed  
up against New England. We can't let that happen again. If you do, 
you are digging yourself a bigger hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos were plagued by critical penalties and defensive  
lapses Sunday. Their run defense, which limited their two previous 
opponents to 76 yards combined, allowed 133 to a Patriots team 
which was struggling to find a running game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos settled for field goals instead of touchdowns, and  
failed to get a field goal on their last possession, which ended 
when Elam's long attempt fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great opportunity to win,'' Griffith said. ``We just  
didn't make the plays down the stretch that we needed to make. We 
didn't turn the ball over, which was good, and we were able to 
overcome some of our mistakes. But you still have to go out and 
make all your plays, and we didn't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters more difficult is the injury situation. Shanahan  
rattled off a list of injuries to 12 players. The most serious may 
be the concussion sustained by wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, who must 
pass a test before being cleared by doctors to play. Quarterback 
Brian Griese has a bruised right calf and minor knee sprain, and 
running back Olandis Gary has a bruised shoulder, but both were 
expected to practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese played well for the third straight game, completing  
25-of-38 passes for 316 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver finds itself 2 1/2 games behind in the AFC West. Kansas  
City, San Diego and Seattle are 4-2, and Oakland is 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	One advantage for the Broncos is that six of their last eight  
games are within the division.

<HEADLINE> Seven More ID'd As Rape Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Seven more young men have been identified as  
suspects in the case of four teen-age girls who said they were held 
captive for two weeks and raped repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Five others already have been charged, and authorities were  
awaiting a judge's signature on warrants naming the latest 
suspects, Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Robert Donaldson said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims and suspects are all Laotian-Americans and members  
of the Hmong ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were still looking for the seven named on the unsigned  
warrants, Sgt. Eleanor McBurrows said today. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven are from the Detroit area, McBurrows said, but she  
could not specify their ages, hometowns, charges or other details. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls disappeared from Wisconsin in September. When they  
were found days later and hundreds of miles away in Detroit, they 
said they had been repeatedly raped by as many as 20 men and 
threatened with death if they tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	All the girls have said they willingly came to Detroit. Three of  
the girls, ages 14, 15, and 16, are being held as material 
witnesses in the Wayne County youth home system. The fourth girl, 
who is 17, is at a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is investigating whether any federal crimes have been  
committed, assistant county prosecutor Robert Donaldson told The 
Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
	The five defendants charged earlier -- four teen-age boys and a  
20-year-old man -- were all charged as adults and are being held in 
lieu of $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of those defendants -- Ladsamee Lee, 20, and Vang Yee Leng  
Chang, 17, both of Warren -- are each charged with 21 counts of 
first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of using a 
firearm in a felony. Three others -- Jinabson Hang, 16, Yeng Chang, 
15, and Sa Lee, 14, all students at Osborn High School in Detroit -- 
are each charged with six counts of first-degree criminal sexual 
conduct.

<HEADLINE> No Permanent Y2K Problems Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Year 2000 bug is much like a storm that may  
or may not come, and any damage to the U.S. economy will not likely 
be permanent, a senior government official says. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies are bulking up on inventory now in case of  
problems with the supply chain. If no Y2K trouble emerges, those 
businesses are likely to curb buying early next year to unload that 
accumulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Steindel, senior vice president for the Federal Reserve  
Bank of New York, offered the storm analogy at a special Senate 
hearing here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in September, the approach of Hurricane Floyd led to the  
evacuation of wide areas of coastal Florida, Georgia and South 
Carolina,'' he said. ``The storm stayed away from those states, and 
the inhabitants returned to their undamaged homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd hit North Carolina instead, leading to heavy flooding.  
Steindel said natural disasters are akin to Y2K computer trouble. 
Resources, he said, will be diverted to repair and recovery, and 
the economy will then return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem  
is holding hearings around the country to assess Y2K readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The bug stems from a common programming practice that uses only  
two digits for the year. Computers that are not updated could 
misinterpret ``00'' as 1900, creating potential problems ranging 
from billing errors to power outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's chairman, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, warned  
that business and government leaders simply do not know whether 
preparations are adequate and projections accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett raised concerns about disruptions abroad affecting U.S.  
businesses, noting that auto companies might not get foreign parts 
needed and consumers might not get fresh produce from countries 
such as Chile. He added that much of the petroleum Americans use 
come from countries ``that are wholly unprepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This may affect the United States, he warned. ``The question is,  
'How much?''' 
</P>
<P>
	But William Dudley, director of the U.S. Economic Research Group  
at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., said U.S. businesses are generally not 
dependent on those least prepared countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Y2K impact, he said, will result from precautionary  
efforts to build inventory. ``Y2K will have noticeable but far from 
cataclysmic effects on U.S. growth,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Berle, Caesar Honored by NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lights! Cameras! And action for Milton Berle and  
Sid Caesar as they were honored Monday as the first inductees in 
NBC's walk of fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The 91-year-old Uncle Miltie told a crowd: ``I think it was  
1951, I signed a lifetime contract with NBC. It expired 20 years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ba-dum-bum.  
</P>
<P>
	Berle dominated television in the 1950s with his ``Texaco Star  
Theater'' and ``The Milton Berle Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time the public will be able to step on  
Berle,'' he joked as his gold plaque was unveiled inside NBC 
Experience, the network's Manhattan store. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Caesar, a seven-time Emmy winner and the comic  
brains behind ``Your Show of Shows,'' played it straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful, wonderful business, a terribly important  
business,'' he said. ``It sets the culture for the United States. 
It sets the culture for the world, television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC plans to add several new names each year.

	AltaVista Revamps Site  
</P>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- AltaVista Co., one of the oldest  
Internet search companies, is undergoing a radical makeover as it 
seeks to overtake competitors such as Yahoo! and America Online as 
a peak Web destination. The company is kicking off a $120 million 
marketing campaign today -- its first ever -- to alert Web surfers to 
its newly designed Internet site, complete with slick and colorful 
graphics, an advanced comparison shopping service and self-updating 
news and sports information with easier-to-use features. The move 
is the latest salvo in what could become a bruising war among 
companies that are trying to build loyalty to their portal. Portal 
sites, which serve as entry points to the Internet and make it 
easier for consumers to reach thousands of Web sites, make money by 
touting the amount of reach they can provide to advertisers and 
marketers.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Dell Computer surpassed Houston-based Compaq as  
the biggest seller of personal computers in the United States 
during the third quarter, according to data from two leading 
research firms expected to be released today. Dell's third quarter 
sales increased nearly 57 percent over sales in last year's 
comparable quarter. Compaq's sales in the same time period 
increased only about 25 percent. Dell shipped 1,996 personal 
computers in the third quarter of 199, compared with 1,780 personal 
computers shipped by Compaq during the same period. Dell had 
shipped 1,275 in the third quarter of 1998, compared with 1,426 
shipped by Compaq.

	Hawaii Dock Strike Averted  
</P>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii's shipping industry and the state  
dockworkers' union reached a tentative settlement early today, 
averting a statewide dock strike. The agreement was reached at 
12:20 a.m., after nearly 34 hours of negotiations over two days. 
The threat of a strike had triggered panic buying of staples like 
rice and toilet paper. In Hawaii, 90 percent of goods arrive by 
ship. International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 142 
President Eusebio Lapenia and Tim Ho, president of the Hawaii 
Employers Council, refused to discuss details of the accord. It 
must be ratified by a majority of the union's 507 members. The 
employers council represents four shipping companies.

	NTT Considering Major Cut in Staff  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese telecommunications company Nippon  
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. is considering cutting its staff by 
20,000 people, a company spokesman said today. The company is also 
studying a plan to reduce annual capital spending by $2.8 billion 
from the $26 billion it plans to spend in the current fiscal year 
through March 2000, spokesman Kenya Nakatsuka said. The personnel 
reduction would bring NTT's total workforce to just over 200,000. 
NTT is considering including these plans in a three-year business 
reform program that it is currently compiling, and both would take 
effect by March 2003, Nakatsuka said.

	Japan's Trade Surplus Falls  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A stronger yen helped push Japan's trade surplus  
with the world lower during the first six months of the fiscal 
year, the government said today. The merchandise trade surplus, the 
measure of all goods exported by Japan minus those imported, 
declined 13.6 percent to $6.03 billion from April through September 
from the same period last year. In fiscal 1998, Japan's overall 
trade surplus rose 23 percent from the previous year to reach the 
second highest total ever recorded. The drop in fiscal first half 
was largely due to the yen's strength against the dollar, said a 
ministry official briefing reporters on customary condition of 
anonymity.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply Friday, led by financial  
shares that soared on hopes that legislation will soon allow banks, 
stock brokerages and insurance companies to merge. The rally capped 
a volatile week in which the Dow industrials rose 450 points, 
wiping out much of last week's stunning loss. The Dow Jones 
industrial average rose 172.56 to close at 10,470.25, gaining 
450.54 on the week after a 630.05-point loss last week. The

<HEADLINE> Gannon Has Broken Bone in Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon broke a  
bone in his left wrist while being knocked to the ground after 
throwing the deciding touchdown pass in the Raiders' 24-23 win over 
the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	And tailback Tyrone Wheatley, who was taken off the field on a  
cart after injuring his lower back in the third quarter of Sunday's 
game, remained in a hospital today for further tests. Raiders coach 
Jon Gruden said tests so far have shown no serious damage to 
Wheatley's back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gannon injury to his non-throwing arm came on the play he  
threw a 5-yard scoring pass to James Jett with 26 seconds 
remaining, capping a comeback from a 17-point deficit late in the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned. Right now he is very questionable for the  
next game. We'll see if there's a soft cast he can wear,'' Gruden 
said. ``I know the snap itself is not going to be easy 
procedurally. He's going to be sore for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Gannon can't play, Gruden said Bobby Hoying will be the  
Raiders' starter Sunday at home against the Miami Dolphins. Hoying, 
obtained by Oakland in a trade from Philadelphia during the 
preseason, has not played yet for the Raiders but played for the 
Eagles while Gruden was the offensive coordinator there. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruden said it is unclear whether Wheatley, the Raiders' leading  
runner this season, will be available for the game against Miami. 
The Raiders have a bye the following week.

disasters. Avoid foreign intervention not affecting U.S. vital 
interest: ``I intend to isolate America from all the bloody 
territorial, tribal and ethnic wars.'' NATO campaign for Kosovo was 
``illegal war on Serbia.'' Would withdraw United States from 
unspecified ``international organizations that imperil our 
financial stability and economic independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GUN CONTROL: ``No compromise'' on gun rights. Deny convicted  
felons right to own firearms.

until that nation ``closes its concentration camps, stops coercive 
abortions, and ceases the persecution of its people.'' Opposes 
admitting China to WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	WELFARE: Sees as state and local responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Law Students Work To Help Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- A Tibetan monk looking for asylum. A  
Dominican schoolgirl in search of an education. The rebuilding of 
war-torn Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some University of California law students are following the  
paper chase into the gritty world of human rights struggles as part 
of a program that flows from classroom to courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the students have helped refugee clients from countries  
including Mexico, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Kenya, Egypt, Colombia, Bulgaria and El Salvador. Of the 18 asylum 
cases the students have handled, the INS has issued a decision on 
17 on them, of which 16 were favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It totally puts law in context,'' says Kirstin Carlson, a  
second-year student at Berkeley's Boalt Hall. ``A problem with law 
school is you can become really myopic. You can get really good at 
contract law, but you can forget to ask yourself: 'How should this 
be? What's justice?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boalt Hall International Human Rights Clinic was started in  
January 1998 by two lecturers, Patty Blum and Laurel Fletcher. The 
idea was to go beyond the traditional teaching tools of simulated 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a simulation class you can carefully control the facts for  
a pedagogic purpose. In a clinic setting, the pedagogic purpose is 
to learn how to be a lawyer by dealing with the real problems 
lawyers deal with,'' Fletcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has six to 10 students a semester, second- and  
third-year students who work under the close supervision of a 
practicing lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students aren't simply thrown in and told, 'Just learn how to  
do it.' Any document is reviewed countless times before it goes out 
of the office,'' says Fletcher, clinic associate director. 
</P>
<P>
	One early case was that of Tibetan monk Jigdol Ngawang, who  
requested asylum last year on the grounds he had been beaten, 
imprisoned and tortured under Chinese rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Ngawang, who began studying to be a monk at age 12, began  
protesting for Tibetan rights at age 15, joining other Buddhist 
monks and nuns who marched outside of a temple in Tibet. Police 
descended and although Ngawang escaped, he was arrested the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	In prison, he said, he was beaten, sharp bamboo sticks were  
shoved under his fingernails, and he was hanged from the prison 
ceiling by handcuffs as police demanded to know who was behind the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, he was released without explanation, but he  
soon learned he was under surveillance and likely to go back to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He fled, spending two months walking across the Himalayan  
mountains and living as an undocumented refugee in Nepal for five 
years before being able to manage passage to California. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparing Ngawang's case, law student Anastasia Telesetsky  
put together Ngawang's declaration of his experiences, 
corroborating news articles and his personal photos and letters. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic, says Ngawang, ``saved my future life.'' Now 28 and  
working at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Ngawang says 
every day is a revelation. ``When I was in Tibet, I was fighting 
for freedom, but I don't really know how freedom is. Now I'm 
experiencing the real freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinic students also worked on the case of a 14-year-old  
Dominican girl who was denied schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was expelled from school after third grade because she  
didn't have a birth certificate. She was born in the Dominican 
Republic to a Dominican mother, but her father is Haitian. Her 
relatives were told it was policy not to give certificates to 
children of Haitian parents, Fletcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the  
human rights arm of the Washington, D.C.-based Organization of 
American States, granted the clinic's emergency request to direct 
the Dominican Republic to enroll the girl in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Working on the schoolgirl's cause ``doesn't compare,'' with  
typical law school classes, says Gina Amato, who with fellow 
student Katie Fleet, worked on the case. ``It's real. There are 
real deadlines. There are real people. There's real passion ... to 
win the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another international project, Carlson spent this summer in  
Bosnia, along with two other Boalt students and three Bosnian law 
students -- one Muslim, one Croat and one Serb. 
</P>
<P>
	The six interviewed judges about how effective the role of law  
has been in social reconstruction. They are now working on a report 
to the International Criminal Tribunal on how it can make its work 
more relevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching theory spring to life was an experience to remember,  
says Carlson. ``It was hard and it was amazing and it touched me in 
ways I didn't expect,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Coach Returns to Green Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Mike Holmgren expects to find out a lot  
about the Seattle Seahawks next Monday night when they go against a 
team that he coached for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about as far as he will go in talking about his inner  
thoughts this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can go in and you can compete against the Green Bay  
Packers or against any of the top teams in the league, then you can 
kind of measure where your team is,'' the Seahawks first-year coach 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle lured Holmgren away from the Packers in January, making  
him their general manager as well as the highest-paid coach in the 
NFL with an eight-year, $32 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Packers are a top team,'' Holmgren said. ``It's a  
confidence thing for your own team. We're too early in this thing 
to say we've arrived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams each go into the game in Green Bay with 4-2 records  
and a share of the lead in their divisions, the AFC West and the 
NFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks beat Buffalo 26-16 on Sunday, while the Packers won  
31-3 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren is trying to keep his emotions under control. He'd like  
to win the game against his former team, but said he'd be happy if 
the Seahawks play a strong game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if there's anything at stake personally,''  
Holmgren said. ``I want the team to play well. I'd be very 
disappointed if we don't compete. I want us to go in there and 
function and function well. I think we will. I think we'll 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren will be returning to Green Bay for the first time since  
Sept. 3, when he attended the funeral of Fritz Shurmur. Shurmur, 
Holmgren's defensive coordinator in Green Bay, was supposed to be 
Holmgren's defensive coordinator in Seattle. He died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren doesn't know what kind of reception he will get from  
Green Bay's fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have some of the greatest fans in the world and they root  
for the Green Bay Packers,'' he said. ``When I was there, they 
rooted hard for me. But I'm no longer a Green Bay Packer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Green Bay player whom Holmgren won't like to see again is  
Brett Favre, who led Holmgren's Packers into two Super Bowls. 
Holmgren considers him the best quarterback in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has the physical tools right now that no one can  
match in the game,'' his former coach said. ``He has the ability to 
take over a game by himself, which is the mark of a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren revealed he placed a phone call to Favre about a month  
ago after the quarterback went on national television and said all 
the right things about how he got along with Holmgren in Green Bay. 
It was the first time the two men talked since Holmgren departed 
the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful conversation,'' he said. ``He knows how I  
feel about him. He and I and our so-called problems. There weren't 
any problems. Did I call him into my office on occasions? Yes. 
Would I correct him and yell at him a little bit? Yes. My 
relationship with him was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren doesn't have Favre in Seattle, but he has quarterback  
Jon Kitna and Derrick Mayes, a receiver whom he acquired from the 
Packers in a trade for a seventh-round draft choice in August. They 
teamed for two touchdown passes against the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's performance, Kitna led the AFC with a 92.4  
quarterback rating with seven touchdown passes and two 
interceptions and a 58.8 completion percentage (87-for-148). 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes is the Seahawks' top receiver with 25 catches for 392  
yards and four touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> UPS Shareholders OK Going Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Stockholders of United Parcel Service today  
approved the company's plan for an initial public stock offering of 
109.4 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock offering, first announced by the UPS board in July,  
represents about 10 percent of existing shares. Ninety percent of 
the votes favored the offering, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based shipping company has told the Securities and  
Exchange Commission that it expects to sell the shares for between 
$36 and $42 per share after a 2-for-1 split planned immediately 
before the initial public offering. At $42 a share, the IPO would 
bring in $4.6 billion, the largest IPO in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees and retirees own about two-thirds of the company's  
shares. The IPO is scheduled for November, although no date has 
been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenues of  
$24.8 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS has requested to trade on the New York Stock Exchange with  
the symbol UPS.

<HEADLINE> Overnite Unfazed By Union Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A strike by the Teamsters union at Overnite  
Transportation Co. terminals in ten states was having little effect 
on the trucking company's operations, a company spokesman said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overnite is in the driver's seat'' in the walkout, said  
spokesman Ira Rosenfeld. He said all 30,000 pickups and deliveries 
scheduled for Monday would be met. 
</P>
<P>
	Picket lines went up Sunday at terminals in Tennessee, Illinois,  
Kentucky, Georgia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenfeld said 95 percent of the picketers were not Overnite  
employees, but Teamsters from other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Richfield, Ohio, there were 80 people on the gate. Not one  
was an Overnite employee,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cameron, Teamsters' coordinator for the Overnite strike,  
predicted the company will be hauling empty trucks by the end of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite is ``in the driver's seat with a car with no wheels,''  
Cameron said. ``These guys are putting on a brave face in a 
hopeless situation. They've already lost this strike; they just 
don't know it yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters and Overnite have been trying to negotiate a  
contract for four years for the 22 centers where the union 
represents employees. The company has 166 terminals in the United 
States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite said its 22 union-represented locations account for 14  
percent of the company's 13,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite said a major issue in the dispute is control of the  
company's pension fund for employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron said the main issue is that Overnite has failed to  
negotiate in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also claimed fast-moving Overnite trucks hit picketers  
in Lexington, Ky., Harrisburg, Pa., Indianapolis and South Holland, 
Ill., requiring the hospitalization of one picketer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently they are instructing drivers to drive at unsafe  
rates when leaving the gates,'' said Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenfeld said the company had no reports of pickets being hit  
by Overnite trucks, although he said some pickets were trying to 
block trucks by standing in front of them. As far as being 
instructed to drive unsafely, ``that is ridiculous,'' Rosenfeld 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has increased security during the strike, Rosenfeld  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're filming some operations at the gate,'' he said. ``Where  
necessary, we will follow some of our trucks to destinations to 
assure that the Teamsters don't follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite was founded in 1935 and was acquired in 1986 by Union  
Pacific Corp. of Omaha, Neb. It is the nation's sixth-largest 
provider of ``less-than-truckload'' transportation, in which the 
loads of several customers are consolidated aboard one truck 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said 90 percent of its revenue came from  
less-than-truckload operations. Overnite reported 1998 operating 
revenue of $1 billion.

	Buchanan Bolting GOP for Reform Party  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan will  
announce today that he is leaving the Republican Party to seek the 
Reform Party nomination. Buchanan, a GOP presidential candidate in 
1992 and 1996, said he is bolting the party ``because the 
Washington elite of the GOP has left me,'' according to a letter 
obtained by the Associated Press. Buchanan would not be assured of 
winning the Reform Party nomination and would be a longshot in the 
general election, although Democratic and Republican operatives say 
he could win enough votes to make a mark on the 2000 elections. He 
will become the sixth Republican candidate to drop out, months 
before the first primaries. It will leave a field of six, dominated 
by George W. Bush.

	Hawaii Dock Strike Averted  
</P>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii's shipping industry and the state  
dockworkers' union reached a tentative settlement early today, 
averting a statewide dock strike. The threat of a strike had 
triggered panic buying of staples like rice and toilet paper. In 
Hawaii, 90 percent of goods arrive by ship. The dockworkers union 
had been seeking a contract similar to the three-year, 8 percent 
wage increase West Coast dockworkers received this summer.

<P>
	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israel opened today a  
long-awaited land link between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
allowing travel by the Palestinians between the autonomous areas 
where they hope to establish a state. The passage has been part of 
peace agreements between the Israelis and Palestinians since 1995, 
but its implementation was always delayed because of Israeli 
security concerns. Palestinians considered to be security risks 
will be allowed to travel the route twice a week on special buses 
manned by Israeli security forces.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian tanks moved closer to the Chechen  
capital today, while jets and artillery attacked suspected rebel 
bases around the republic. There was no indication, however, that 
the Russians were planning an attack on Grozny. The Russian 
military claimed to have destroyed an anti-aircraft gun and two 
vehicles full of militants in strikes overnight, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency said today. There was no immediate word on casualties from 
Chechen officials. Chechen government leaders have called 
repeatedly for peace talks, demanding they be held on neutral 
territory with international mediation.

	N. Korea Returns Remains of U.S. Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- North Korea handed over to American officials today  
the bodies of four U.S. soldiers missing since the Korean War, 
media in the communist country said. Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense Robert Jones accepted the remains in the North Korean 
capital, Pyongyang, the official Korean Central News Agency said.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- An aggressive interview of former baseball star  
Pete Rose by NBC reporter Jim Gray prompted a flood of calls to the 
network's affiliates from outraged viewers and criticism from 
current players. Rose was banned from baseball in 1989 for 
gambling, but was allowed to attend Game 2 of the World Series last 
night as the sport unveiled its All-Century team. It was his first 
appearance in a big league park since the punishment was handed 
out. Gray's relentless questioning of Rose about gambling prompted 
hundreds of fans to phone in complaints. And some New York Yankees 
players told Gray his line of questioning was ``barbaric'' and an 
``embarrassment'' to his profession.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- David Cone gave up just one hit in seven innings  
and the New York Yankees took advantage of poor defense to beat the 
Atlanta Braves 7-2 last night for a 2-0 lead in the World Series. 
The Yankees jumped on Braves starter Kevin Millwood for three runs 
in the first inning and later added runs on misplays by shortstop 
Ozzie Guillen and second baseman Keith Lockhart. The Braves had 
only two hits in the Game 1 loss.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Gather at Stewart's Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDERMERE, Fla. (AP) -- Some of golf's best players gathered at  
the gated and landscaped mansion Payne Stewart called home. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors brought flowers and spoke of the man who died in a  
plane crash Monday and was one of the most recognizable players in 
his sport. 
</P>
<P>
	At the lakeside home, about 10 miles southwest of Orlando,  
police cars protected the family's privacy and reporters were kept 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	After word spread of the Learjet crash in South Dakota, some of  
golf's finest paid their respects at Stewart's home. Among them 
were Lee Janzen and his wife, Mark O'Meara, Scott Hoch and Ernie 
Els. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and friends of Stewart's children, 13-year-old Chelsea  
and 10-year-old Aaron, recalled Payne as friendly and easygoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a straight-up nice guy,'' said 12-year-old Jonathan  
Caballero. ``He would come out here and play with the kids, all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Brown, 13, said, ``He used to play tag with us, but he  
wasn't any good at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Cooki Spears stopped by the Stewart home to deliver  
flowers with her 11-year-old son, Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne was an unbelievable person,'' a tearful Spears said. ``I  
don't know why God took him but I'm sure there's a reason. He was 
fun to be with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her son was very close with Aaron.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever my son spent the night at their house, Payne got up  
first thing in the morning and made pancakes for them. He made them 
breakfast, and he horsed around with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Curry, a family friend, read a statement outside the gates  
of the Stewart home: ``We appreciate the heartfelt love and 
kindness shown by our friends and loved ones in our loss of Payne. 
We know he is with the Lord and in that we take comfort. Please 
keep the Stewart family in your prayers along with the families of 
Robert Fraley, Van Ardan, and the two pilots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning his second U.S. Open in June, the 42-year-old  
Stewart had spoken of his renewed faith and inner peace. Winner of 
three major championships and a member of five Ryder Cup teams, 
Stewart had also recently talked about trying to keep golf in 
perspective and spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jim Henry, a retired pastor for First Baptist Church of  
Orlando, used to minister to the Stewart family. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a wonderful Christian who had Christ in his life and  
somehow in his death,'' he said. ``That brought a great sense of 
peace to his family in a difficult and tragic time.''

<HEADLINE>  Baseball All-Century Team Assembles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- One by one, they were introduced, a gathering of  
the greatest players in baseball history, chosen for the 
All-Century team and honored before Game 2 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Bench ... Yogi Berra ... Mark McGwire ... Cal Ripken, Jr.  
... Ernie Banks ... Mike Schmidt ... Brooks Robinson ... Ken
Griffey, Jr.  
</P>
<P>
	On and on, the dream team lineup continued.  
</P>
<P>
	Stan Musial ... Nolan Ryan ... Sandy Koufax ... Roger Clemens  
... Bob Gibson ... Warren Spahn ... Ted Williams ... Hank Aaron ...
Willie Mays.  
</P>
<P>
	The Turner Field crowd stood from start to finish Sunday, joined  
by members of the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees, who were at 
the top steps of their dugouts, applauding baseball's rich heritage 
and some of the men who helped weave it. For the moment, the 
intensity of the World Series was set aside for a salute to the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18 living members of the 30-player All-Century team -- the  
most glamorous gathering of baseball talent ever assembled on one 
field -- stood on a podium at second base and glowed over the 
tribute. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire wore jeans because his luggage was lost en route to  
Atlanta. Many of the others wore caps of their teams and tipped 
them to the roaring crowd as they were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	The loudest, longest cheers were reserved for Pete Rose,  
suspended from baseball for gambling and back on a major league 
field for the first time in 10 years. For 55 seconds, the crowd 
cheered him, an eloquent statement to the continuing popularity of 
baseball's hit king. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable. I thought I hit a grand slam to win the  
World Series in Game 7,'' a tearful Rose said after he came off the 
field. ``I thought I broke the record all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked through the Yankees dugout, he exchanged a firm  
handshake with Paul O'Neill, one of the players he managed at 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famer Joe Morgan, broadcasting the game for NBC,  
welcomed the reception for his old teammate. ``I thought it was 
great,'' he said. ``Pete has been away from the game for so long 
and I think the fans who are true baseball fans miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But NBC stirred some controversy when broadcaster Jim Gray  
pressed Rose after the ceremony on why he refuses to admit to any 
wrongdoing. ``I'm not going to admit to something that didn't 
happen,'' Rose said defiantly. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the few unpleasant moments in a day that paid  
homage to a 100 years of baseball's history. 
</P>
<P>
	There was Aaron, throwing out the first pitch after warming up  
with Schmidt, and Mays throwing one of his own without any catcher. 
In the night's most emotional moment, Mays and Griffey helped 
Williams to the podium while Aaron steadied a chair for baseball's 
last .400 hitter, weakened by a series of strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre admitted that tears came to his eyes  
as he watched the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was welling up a little bit,'' the manager said. ``Ted  
Williams, Stan Musial. It's great to see Pete Rose back in a big 
league ballpark. Baseball is so much of its history. It's so 
important to the game. To see all those players on one stage, it 
was pretty emotional. I thought it was terrific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the players talked about themselves and each other.  
</P>
<P>
	Mays was asked about Koufax. ``Sandy was a nice guy,'' he said.  
``He struck me out all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koufax called Spahn the greatest pitcher of all time and then  
explained why. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only for what he did on the field,'' he said. ``He'll kill  
me for doing this. He pitched in the whole damn century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bench caught Koufax's little joke and added to it.  
</P>
<P>
	``Making the All-Century team, that's great,'' he said. ``Spahn  
made it for last century and this century. Now that's amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spahn, who pitched in the generation before Koufax and Bench,  
hesitated to compare eras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's better depends whose eyes you're looking through,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson said he had pride in his generation of players.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're not aware until after your career is over who came  
before and who came after,'' he said. ``I don't know if there will 
ever be a group as good as that group from the '60s and '70s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson recalled the All-Star game ceremony when the 100 nominees  
for the team were introduced and said he wondered if he belonged in 
this All-Century group. ``Then I looked around,'' he said, ``and 
most of the other guys I got out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he was staggered by the talent assembled on the  
ballot and admitted he failed to vote in the All-Century team 
election, which was sponsored by MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't fill out the ballot,'' he said. ``It would be too  
tough.''

<HEADLINE> Ind. Man Off Hook for 1-Cent Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Herman Wicker is off the hook for a  
recent emergency room bill, even after refusing to give one red 
cent to a collection agency to clear up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all it would have taken to pay the bill, which said the  
85-year-old man owed a penny to a doctor at an Evansville hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, Wicker, who has Medicare and private health  
insurance, was billed in error after he was examined for pains in 
his head and neck. He did not owe anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Wicker said he was surprised about two months ago when he  
received a letter explaining the charge from Professional Recovery 
Service of Fort Wayne. He had not received a bill from the hospital 
or the doctor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter told the retired car salesman it was to his advantage  
to pay up if he wanted to maintain good credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe it,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wicker telephoned the collection agency, pointed out the amount  
due was one cent and said he wasn't going to pay it. About 10 
minutes later, the company called back to say an error had been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did apologize,'' Wicker said.

<HEADLINE> Ford Brit. Plants Check Race Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. chief executive Jac Nasser agreed  
today to set up committees to monitor racial equality at each of 
the company's 13 factories in Britain after complaints of abuse 
sparked a walkout at the largest of the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is aimed at achieving equality of opportunity in the  
workplace and ensuring that employees of diverse ethnic backgrounds 
are free from harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford officials signed the pact with leaders of four British  
labor unions, agreeing to review diversity and equality at the 
company's British operations and to appoint a manager responsible 
for diversity issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides agreed on the measures after Nasser took the  
unusual step of intervening personally to try to defuse tensions at 
the Ford factory in Dagenham in east London, where at least 800 
employees walked off their jobs to protest alleged racist abuses 
and bullying by some plant foremen. 
</P>
<P>
	The spontaneous, one-day walkout earlier this month halted  
production of Ford Fiesta models bound for sale in Europe, Latin 
America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said the walkout was triggered by a series of  
incidents. An Asian worker claimed last month that he had been 
subjected to racist abuse and Ku Klux Klan graffiti. Later, a white 
foreman allegedly pushed an Asian shop steward. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the meeting, Transport and General Workers Union chief  
Bill Morris said the case of Sukjit Parmar, who claimed to be a 
victim of intense racist abuse, exposed Ford's ``callous and 
systematic failure'' to take seriously the need to ensure all its 
employees have equal opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser met with Morris and other union leaders in London while  
here for other company business, Ford spokeswoman Anne-Marie 
Chatterton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks were to have been held Saturday, but had to be  
postponed due to a delay in Nasser's flight from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Fox Cancels Two Friday Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fox's harsh fall season just got worse. Poor  
ratings forced the cancellation of the network's Friday lineup of 
``Harsh Realm'' and ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Movies will fill the two-hour slot through November, the network  
said Monday. The replacement series were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox has struggled to find an audience for its new series,  
including the sitcoms ``Action'' and ``Get Real,'' while the 
delayed returns of its most popular shows have put a further dent 
in the network's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ally McBeal'' started its third season Monday, while ``The  
X-Files'' is back Nov. 7 for its seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations had been high for ``Harsh Realm,'' a  
virtual-reality thriller from ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter, but 
the show premiered a disappointing fourth in its time slot Oct. 8 
and has seen its ratings slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ryan Caulfield: Year One,'' a drama about a rookie police  
officer, also proved a ratings dud with an unduly optimistic title. 
The series lasted only two episodes.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Back in Fold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines said today it has  
been readmitted to the International Air Transport Association 
after settling its debts with the airline industry body. 
</P>
<P>
	``PAL has now returned to the fold of the international aviation  
community,'' airline president Avalino Zapanta said in a statement. 
``This is a major step in our inexorable march to full recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline was suspended from the IATA's clearing house in  
September 1998 after it failed to pay debts of $32 million to other 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Its suspension from the IATA was a serious blow to the ailing  
carrier because it effectively severed its links with the 
association's 198 member airlines. Passengers with Philippine 
Airlines tickets were unable to transfer to other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers traveling from Manila to New York, for example, had  
to purchase separate tickets on the airline and a second airline 
and manually recheck their baggage since Philippine Airlines does 
not fly beyond the U.S. West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the airline was near bankruptcy and struggling to  
get its creditors, owed $2.2 billion, to accept a recovery plan. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL said its debts to IATA airlines were settled earlier this  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms for PAL's reinstatement also included a $12 million  
security deposit, which is repayable after a year if the airline 
meets all its IATA debt payments, or six months if it is a net 
creditor under the association's clearing system over that period. 
The move was approved under PAL's rehabilitation plan. 
</P>
<P>
	After a disastrous 1998, which saw the airline nearly close, PAL  
has been slowly recovering, posting a net profit in the first 
quarter of the financial year which began in April after several 
years of heavy losses.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Drops Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Justice Department dropped its efforts  
to deport a Palestinian immigrant suspected of plotting to kill 
Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced about an hour before a midnight  
deadline, led to the immediate release of Hany Mahmoud Kiareldeen, 
who had been jailed for 19 months on the basis of allegations in 
secret evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration judges this month found that evidence ``unreliable''  
and a federal judge ruled last week it was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen, 31, who managed a Passaic electronics shop before  
his detention on charges he overstayed his student visa, was never 
charged with a terrorist act. The FBI closed its investigation in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Monday, however, the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service maintained that Kiareldeen posed a threat to national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	After the rulings in Kiareldeen's favor, the INS urged federal  
and immigration judges to keep him in jail while it appealed those 
rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the Board of Immigration Appeals had ruled Wednesday  
that Kiareldeen could be freed after paying $1,500 bond, but the 
INS won a stay until midnight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS had wanted the appeals board to stay the release until  
Friday to give it time to determine whether it will ask Reno's 
office to assume jurisdiction of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Justice Department statement issued late Monday declared  
that ``extraordinary step'' would not be taken. The INS is part of 
the Justice Department, which Reno heads. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meisner and the Justice Department  
``believe that by submitting the evidence to an immigration judge 
and (an appeals board), the process has taken its course,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-classified summaries of the secret evidence collected by the  
FBI said Kiareldeen made a ``credible threat'' to murder Reno 
because of her role in prosecuting the bombers of the World Trade 
Center and that he is a suspected member of an unnamed terrorist 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen has testified that he does not know any of the men  
convicted in the Trade Center bombing and did not know who Reno was 
until he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen's lawyers believe it is the first time a judge has  
rejected the government practice of detaining immigrants based on 
evidence it only shows to immigration judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on non-classified summaries of the secret evidence, the  
lawyers believe it stemmed from vindictive lies told to the FBI by 
Kiareldeen's ex-wife.

<HEADLINE> Pro Golfer Stewart Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- A Learjet carrying champion golfer Payne  
Stewart and at least four other people flew a ghostly journey 
halfway across the country Monday, its windows iced over and its 
occupants apparently incapacitated, before spiraling nose first 
into a grassy field. Everyone aboard was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight plan said two crewmembers and three passengers were  
on the jet, but there were reports a sixth person boarded the plane 
just before it took off from Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The chartered, twin-engine Lear 35 may have suddenly lost cabin  
pressure soon after taking off for Dallas, government officials 
said. Air traffic controllers couldn't raise anyone by radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighter jets were sent after the plane and followed it for much  
of its flight but were unable to help. The pilots drew close and 
noticed no structural damage but were unable to see into the 
Learjet because its windows were frosted over, indicating the 
temperature inside was well below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Set apparently on autopilot, the plane cruised 1,400 miles  
straight up the nation's midsection, across half a dozen states. 
Authorities say the plane was ``porpoising,'' fluctuating between 
22,000 and 51,000 feet. It presumably ran out of fuel some four 
hours after it took off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane had pretty much nosed straight into the ground,''  
said Lesley Braun, who lives two miles from the South Dakota crash 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was one of the most recognizable players in golf  
because he wore traditional knickers and a tam-o'-shanter hat. He 
won 18 tournaments, including three major championships. In June, 
he won his second U.S. Open, prevailing over Phil Mickelson with an 
astonishing 15-foot putt on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community and  
all of sports. He will always be remembered as a very special 
competitor and one who contributed enormously to the positive image 
of professional golf,'' PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said: ``I am profoundly sorry for the loss of  
Payne Stewart, who has had such a remarkable career and impact on 
his sport and a remarkable resurgence in the last couple of 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was on his way to Texas, first for a meeting on a  
proposed golf course near Dallas, then on to the Tour Championship 
in Houston for the top 30 on the PGA Tour's money list. He attended 
Southern Methodist University in Dallas and had friends in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,  
and the two pilots, identified as Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie 
Bellegarrigue, 27. The jet was operated by Sunjet Aviation Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus said Monday that he feared one of his golf course  
designers, Bruce Borland, 40, also died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland's wife, Kate, said she contacted the private jet  
terminal Monday afternoon and spoke to an employee who had greeted 
her husband and confirmed he intended to board the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities could not confirm that Borland was aboard and  
officials at the crash site said they could not tell exactly how 
many people had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am truly shocked and saddened,'' Nicklaus said in the  
statement released by Nicklaus Design. ``Our hearts go out to their 
families, as well as the families of the other victims in the 
accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six National Transportation Safety Board investigators walked  
through the crash site Monday night. They did a cursory inspection 
of the wreckage, lit by generator-powered spotlights. Bob Francis, 
NTSB vice chairman, declined to comment and said the investigators 
would be back Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized, because the  
air at altitudes above that is too thin to breathe. If a plane 
loses pressure, those aboard could slowly lose consciousness or, if 
an aircraft broke a door or window seal, perish in seconds from 
lack of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Once reaching a cruising altitude, pilots often switch on the  
autopilot. If they pass out, the plane could continue on until it 
ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Janklow, who was at the crash site, said it appeared  
Stewart's Learjet ran out of fuel because there was no fire. He 
said the plane and the bodies were obliterated. 
</P>
<P>
	Instances in which a civilian jet lost pressure in flight are  
extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Stewart crash was similar to an accident nearly 20  
years ago that took the life of Louisiana State University football 
coach Bo Rein. Rein left Shreveport, La., in 1980 in a private 
plane en route to Baton Rouge. Radio contact with the pilot was 
lost, and the plane flew off course for hundreds of miles before 
going down in the Atlantic off Virginia. Investigators think the 
plane may have lost pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The last communication from Stewart's jet was over Gainesville,  
Fla., said Tony Molinaro, an FAA spokesman in Chicago. The jet flew 
as high as 45,000 feet and the crew did not respond to repeated 
inquiries from air traffic controllers, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	A government source said the plane should have turned left at  
Gainesville on a course for Dallas. It made only a partial turn 
before heading in a straight line toward South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA routed air traffic around the Learjet and kept planes  
from flying underneath it in case it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighter jets from Florida and Oklahoma went after the plane. Two  
F-16s had to make several passes to align with the plane, which was 
flying steady in the clear blue sky but was going slowly in 
comparison with the fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Capt. Chris Hamilton said there was nothing he could  
do when his F-16 caught up with the Learjet over Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very helpless feeling to pull up alongside another  
aircraft and realize the people inside that aircraft potentially 
are unconscious or in some other way incapacitated,'' Hamilton 
said. ``And there's nothing I can do physically from my aircraft -- 
even though I'm 50 to 100 feet away -- to help them at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the military never  
considered shooting down the Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jim Henry, retired pastor for First Baptist Church of  
Orlando who used to minister to the Stewart family, was one of 
those outside the Stewart home after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a wonderful Christian who had Christ in his life and  
somehow in his death,'' Henry said. ``That brought a great sense of 
peace to his family in a difficult and tragic time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had two children, Chelsea, 13, and  
Aaron, 10.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Victims Seeking $200M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida property owners are seeking at  
least $200 million to cover damage caused by Hurricane Irene -- and 
that doesn't include crop damage that could total more than $400 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies will pay an estimated $100 million to cover  
damage by Hurricane Irene to homes and businesses, not including 
damage from flooding, an industry group reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 6,200 claims for insured flood damage -- amounting  
to another $100 million -- will be covered by the federal 
government's National Flood Insurance Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Floridians are expected to file more than 60,000 claims for  
personal and commercial property loss and auto damage related to 
the storm, according to a report from the New York-based Insurance 
Services Office Inc., which calculates loss figures for the 
insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene blew in from the Caribbean earlier this month, dumping  
more than 18 inches of rain on some parts of the state and causing 
widespread flooding in South Florida. Six people died in the storm, 
including five people in Broward County who were electrocuted by 
downed power lines submerged in flood water. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford said Monday that Irene  
destroyed an estimated 15 percent to 20 percent of the state's 
fresh citrus crop and as much as 90 percent of the winter 
vegetables growing in six counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``An early conservative estimate puts the loss of crops and farm  
infrastructure at nearly $400 million in the six counties alone,'' 
Crawford said in a letter to Gov. Jeb Bush. Crawford is seeking 
federal assistance for Florida farmers hit by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates of crop damage were still being made in the rest of  
the state. Those figures are not included in the insurance industry 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hurricane Floyd caused about $50 million in insured  
damage in Florida. That storm stayed off Florida's coast, and 
caused far more damage in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the expected $200 million in losses for Irene,  
Hurricane Andrew cost insurers $16 billion in 1992, leading many 
home insurers to flee the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hurricane Georges caused $340 million in insured  
losses.

<HEADLINE> Two Dead in Police Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A pilot and mechanic testing a police  
helicopter that was grounded over the weekend were killed Monday 
when the aircraft crashed onto a busy street just before the 
afternoon rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran pilot was called a hero by the mayor and police  
chief for avoiding people in buildings and cars on the street, 
which feeds onto an interstate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He purposely pushed the plane into the ground because it was  
his only choice to avoid the inhabitants,'' said the tearful police 
chief, Bill Lansdowne. 
</P>
<P>
	Lansdowne said the 5-year-old helicopter was grounded over the  
weekend, but he didn't know why. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot had not indicated any problems before the 3:45 p.m.  
crash about 2 miles west of the airport, police spokesman Rubens 
Dalaison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were the pilot, a San Jose police officer, and a mechanic  
who worked for the maintenance company, Dalaison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Martinez, a receptionist at Alliance for Community  
Care, said she heard the helicopter and raced outside in time to 
see the chopper heading for the street in a nosedive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like he was trying to avoid buildings,'' she said.  
The helicopter appeared to be smoking at the back as people on the 
street dashed out of the way. No one on the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage of the police department's only helicopter lay  
under a blue tarpaulin, surrounded by fire trucks as federal 
investigators began looking for clues.

<HEADLINE>  Magic Johnson To Play Game in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Magic is back, even if it is for just  
one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic Johnson will play for a Swedish League team that bears his  
nickname, Magic M7, on Tuesday against a team from Uppsala named 
Sallen after its main sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first competitive game for the 40-year-old  
Johnson since he retired from the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in Johnson's comeback is so great that the game will be  
broadcast live on one of the biggest networks in Sweden. Basketball 
is popular in Sweden, but ranks far behind soccer and ice hockey, 
and league games are almost never televised. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's team is based in Boras, a city of 110,000 in western  
Sweden. The arena seats about 3,800 and it was sold out quickly for 
Johnson's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson works out daily and in early August, he played 12  
minutes in his annual all-star game at the Forum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	So how many minutes can Johnson play in a league that is  
certainly not among the best in Europe? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to say how many minutes Earvin can play,''  
said Charles Barton, coach of Magic M7 and a former Swedish 
national team coach. ``I expect him to play a lot. He wouldn't come 
and not be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Magic M7 finished fifth in the Swedish League and  
missed the playoffs. This year, the team is off to a 6-0 start and 
hardly needs Johnson. But who could turn down one of the 
basketball's greatest players? 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players tonight after practice that they have to  
play with Earvin, not watch him,'' Barton said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, whose parents flew in from Columbus, Ohio, to see their  
son coach what will be the most memorable game of his career, 
always thought Johnson was the ultimate player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched him a lot. He could play point guard and center in  
the same game,'' Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
	So which position will Johnson play Tuesday?  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably point guard, but I have to see him in practice,''  
Barton said. ``The practice tomorrow will be more fun than the 
game, to tell one of the greatest players ever that `we want you to 
move here.' It's a tremendous challenge and honor at the same 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Haney, Magic M7's manager, said Johnson picked Sweden  
partly because of the impression the country made on him during a 
1996 tour with his all-star team made up of former NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a licensing agreement and he's an advisor and  
consultant to the team,'' Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who led Michigan State to the NCAA championship in 1979  
and the Lakers to five NBA titles in the 1980s, learned he tested 
positive for the virus that can cause AIDS in 1991, and retired for 
the first time just before the start of the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning to play on the U.S. Dream Team that won the gold  
medal in the 1992 Olympics, he made a brief NBA comeback before the 
1992-93 season, but quit again after several players expressed 
concerns about playing with him for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1996, he returned to the Lakers and played the  
remaining half of the season, retiring again, at age 37, after the 
Lakers were eliminated from the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Criticized for Essay Topic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ohio (AP) -- A high school teacher has been reprimanded  
for offering a list of possible topics for a writing assignment 
that included the question: ``If you had to assassinate one famous 
person who is alive right now, who would it be and how would you do 
it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents said they were outraged considering the string of fatal  
shootings of students and teachers at schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was in poor taste considering what's happened,''  
said Valerie Ward, whose son is a 10th-grader at Franklin High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue arose from a single-sheet list of suggested topics for  
the students to write about in their daily journals. Another 
question that upset parents asked students who they would save ``if 
you had to lose everyone you know in a tragic accident except one 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators declined to identify the teacher.  
</P>
<P>
	The school's principal, Robert Leahy, told The Cincinnati  
Enquirer that he met with the teacher and told her the 
assassination question was inappropriate. Leahy did not return 
calls to his office for additional comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators said no further action will be taken against the  
second-year teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions for the journals were distributed at the beginning of  
the school year for ninth- and 10th-grade English students. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get them thinking about how to off somebody,'' Mrs. Ward  
said. ``I hate to think that kids have to think about these kinds 
of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another parent noted that students in some schools have been  
suspended for merely talking about considering violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They mention the word gun and they're out the door,'' said  
Beth Kinzer, who has freshman and senior sons at Franklin High 
School. ``She should get the same thing the kids would get -- five 
days' suspension.''

<HEADLINE> Family of Slain ex-NFL Player Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Relatives of former NFL linebacker Demetrius  
DuBose filed a wrongful death lawsuit Monday against the city and 
two police officers, claiming excessive force was used when he was 
shot and killed during an arrest attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal civil rights lawsuit, filed in San Diego's U.S.  
District Court, seeks no specific damages for the July 24 shooting 
death, which has led to a series of protest marches and accusations 
of racial bias against the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, who was black, was shot 11 times after he scuffled with  
two white officers who suspected him of burglarizing a Mission 
Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials have said DuBose, 28, charged at the officers  
after wrangling away their nunchukas, a martial arts weapon of two 
wooden sticks joined at the ends by a short chain or rope. Officers 
had twice chased and tackled DuBose before firing their guns, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's attorney, Brian Watkins, said Monday that witnesses  
said DuBose did not pose a threat to the officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those things did not happen,'' Watkins said. ``He never  
charged at officers with nunchukas. Any force that he used was 
defensive force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed DuBose had traces of Ecstasy, cocaine and  
alcohol in his blood at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego District Attorney is investigating the shooting to  
determine if charges are merited against the officers. The officers 
have been on desk duty since the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, a native of Seattle, was a linebacker for Notre Dame.  
After graduating, he was drafted in 1993 by the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers and played with them for four seasons. His football 
career ended in 1997, and he took up beach volleyball.

<HEADLINE> McCain Accuses Bush of Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sen. John McCain accused Republican  
presidential rival George W. Bush on Monday of orchestrating a 
campaign to tarnish his image. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain said he was flattered to get such attention from the  
Texas governor, who is the front-runner for the GOP presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though sometimes it's not so pleasant, it's really  
something that should be a little encouraging, because we are 
closing on him, and that clearly has him unhappy,'' the Arizona 
senator said at a news conference here. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has gained ground on Bush in the key state of New  
Hampshire, was referring to a New York Times article on Monday that 
portrayed him as hot-tempered and engaged in a feud with Arizona's 
governor, Jane Hull, who has endorsed Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull told the newspaper that her relations with McCain were  
``not particularly warm,'' and that McCain has a short fuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed the Bush campaign for helping plant the story.  
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently the memo has gone out from the Bush campaign to  
start attacking John McCain -- something that I'd hoped wouldn't 
happen,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that these kinds of personal attacks would be  
orchestrated from the Bush campaign, but it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margita Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bush's California campaign,  
said Bush was sticking to the high road. 
</P>
<P>
	``As he has always done, Gov. Bush is running a positive,  
issue-oriented campaign based on his message of improving schools, 
strengthening our national defense and cutting taxes,'' Thompson 
said. ``As he has said before, he likes Sen. McCain as a person, 
and will treat him with respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed on whether Bush had orchestrated the story, she declined  
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he had a temper, McCain said: ``I plead guilty to  
getting angry when I see gross injustices take place such as I see 
happen quite often in the Congress of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``But do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like  
that? No, I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also assailed Bush for launching an advertising campaign  
in Iowa and New Hampshire while declining to participate in debates 
with his Republican rivals. Bush has cited scheduling conflicts as 
reasons for skipping a GOP candidates' forum last Friday in New 
Hampshire, along with one scheduled for Thursday in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's curious that he would somehow feel that people aren't  
interested enough to watch a debate, but they'll want to watch a 
campaign commercial,'' McCain said. ``I hope he'll realize that 
people really are probably more interested in debates than they are 
in paid political commercials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also apologized Monday for campaign aides who barred  
reporters from a fund-raiser earlier in the day in Napa, saying the 
incident violated his own policy of conducting such gatherings 
under news media scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Such openness is important, suggested McCain, who has made  
revamping the campaign finance system a centerpiece of his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all tainted by these allegations -- a system that causes  
us to be suspected of corruption, and that's the unfortunate part 
of it,'' McCain said. ``I have said many times that I have been 
influenced by this system as well.''

<HEADLINE> Ala. Players Doubtful for So. Miss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- The timing couldn't be worse for  
Alabama's Shaun Alexander and Andrew Zow to be hobbled with 
sprained ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	The tailback and quarterback for the 14th-ranked Crimson Tide  
were both listed as doubtful Monday to play against No. 20 Southern 
Mississippi this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaun and Andrew are better, but both are very doubtful at  
this point,'' Alabama coach Mike DuBose said. ``They'll do 
everything they can to get better, but if things stay the way they 
are, they won't start Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players laughed Monday, and Zow rolled his eyes, when told  
DuBose called them doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say doubtful,'' Zow said. ``We both feel like  
we'll be ready to play. We'll play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zow, a sophomore quarterback, sprained his right ankle late in  
the second quarter of Saturday's loss to Tennessee. He didn't start 
the second half, but eventually returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, a senior tailback, also sprained his right ankle late  
in the game. He was taken out in the fourth quarter and didn't 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	Both showed up at the athletic complex Monday with their ankles  
tightly wrapped in tape. Alexander said the swelling was down on 
his, but Zow's hadn't improved since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``His ankle is better because he's like Superman,'' Zow said,  
bristling because Alexander called him ``gimpy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who is making a bid for the Heisman Trophy, has 1,032  
rushing yards this season and 18 touchdowns. He is 207 yards shy of 
becoming Alabama's career rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Zow has started 15 straight games for Alabama. He's completed  
56.8 percent of his passes with 10 touchdowns and seven 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose said the two have been undergoing intense treatment this  
week with the goal of getting them cleared to practice by 
Wednesday, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had whirlpool, icing, worn an air boot, gel, ice cups,  
anti-inflammatory cream and a partridge and a pear tree,'' 
Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Alexander not be able to play on Saturday, he said he  
would demand to wear a headset on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say anything in it, I just want to wear one,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose said if he had to list the starters for Saturday now,  
Tyler Watts would be the quarterback and Shaun Bohanon the 
tailback. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, a redshirt freshman, was expected to challenge Zow for  
the starting job this season. The two initially rotated through 
Alabama's first few games, but Watts' role has decreased as the 
season has gone on. 
</P>
<P>
	In five games, Watts is just 5-of-14 for 89 yards and one  
interception. Zow said Watts would be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tyler's good, he's a player,'' Zow said. ``He knows the  
offense inside and out, so I think he'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bohanon, a junior, has run for 112 yards on 20 carries this  
season. In his most significant action, he ran 12 times for 95 
yards against Houston. Asked what kind of player Bohanon was, 
Alexander said to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're about to see a lot of him, and he's excited about it,''  
Alexander said. ``You never know, he might run for 291 and four 
touchdowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a sophomore against LSU, Alexander was put into the game as a  
replacement and set a school record by running for 291 yards on 20 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever plays against the Eagles will be facing a defense ranked  
27th in the nation. Against two high-powered offenses, Southern 
Miss held Nebraska to 20 points and Texas A&AMP;M to 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe, if we can't practice at all this week, we'll still be  
able to come off the bench,'' Alexander said. ``I bet we'd get the 
biggest ovation ever.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Wouldn't Shoot Down Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Air Force planes tracking the Learjet that  
flew uncontrolled nearly halfway across the country before crashing 
Monday could tell the aircraft was not headed toward a heavily 
populated area, and thus did not have to consider such drastic 
options as shooting it down, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never was an issue,'' said Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for  
Defense Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional golfer Payne Stewart was among five people aboard  
the business jet. All were killed when the plane crashed in a farm 
field in northeastern South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether downing the Learjet might have become an option if  
the plane, which was believed to be on auto pilot with no radio 
communication, had headed toward a major city, Bacon said: ``It 
never reached that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Air Force and Air National Guard fighter jets, plus an  
AWACs radar control plane, were used to help the Federal Aviation 
Administration track the Learjet and estimate when it would run out 
of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	They included F-15s from Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., F-16s  
from Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., Tulsa, Okla., and Fargo, N.D., and 
an AWACs plane on a training mission north of Chicago, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main issue was figuring out where it was going,'' Bacon  
said. Once it was determined that the Learjet was following a 
consistent path north toward the Dakotas, ``We didn't have to deal 
with other options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 12:16 p.m. EDT, about an hour before the Learjet crashed,  
military officials estimated the plane had about an hour of fuel 
remaining and could make it to the vicinity of Pierre, S.D., 
according to an Air Force chronology of the incident. At 1:16 p.m. 
an F-16 reported seeing the plane ``spiraling through clouds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Pentagon official said it was theoretically possible  
that an Air Force plane could have attempted to alter the Learjet's 
course, if necessary, by flying close enough to change the air flow 
beneath or above its wings. In any event, the military was not 
asked to suggest options, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case it is impossible to imagine that the Air Force  
would have shot down the plane because it wasn't necessary to do,'' 
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a shootdown had come into consideration, it would have been  
decided at a level of authority higher than the commander in chief 
of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which is 
responsible for the air defense of the United States and Canada, 
Bacon said. He did not say who would make such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Two armed Air Force F-16 air defense fighters were placed on  
alert at Fargo, N.D., just moments before the Learjet crashed, but 
they were never ordered to take off, Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A stronger yen helped push Japan's trade surplus  
with the world lower during the first six months of the fiscal 
year, the government said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported  
by Japan minus those imported, declined 13.6 percent to $6.03 
billion from April through September from the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1998, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 23 percent  
from the previous year to reach the second highest total ever 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in fiscal first half was largely due to the yen's  
strength against the dollar, said a ministry official briefing 
reporters on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	During the period, the dollar averaged 118.18 yen, down 14  
percent from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has gained against the dollar in recent months as  
optimism grows regarding Japan's improving economy. The country has 
been struggling to emerge from its worst economic downturn in 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen affects the the trade balance as it tends to make  
Japanese goods more expensive overseas and can thus reduce demand 
for them in foreign markets. It can also make overseas products 
more expensive in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has come under heavy pressure from the United States and  
other trading partners to rein in its trade surplus by bolstering 
the weak economy to spark demand for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry also announced that Japan's trade surplus for the  
month of September alone fell 9.7 percent to $13.1 billion from the 
same month last year, marking the sixth straight month of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors, exceeded the  
average forecast of $11.9 billion by Tokyo-based economists 
surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	The slip in September exports was partly due to a 25.8 percent  
appreciation of Japan's currency to 110.17 yen against the dollar 
compared to a year ago, said the official. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing to buck the overall trend, however, was the  
politically sensitive surplus the United States, which rose for the 
fifth straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	It increased 4.9 percent in September to $7.23 billion, the  
ministry reported. For the fiscal first half, it rose 10.2 percent 
to $35.56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, overall Japanese exports to the United States fell  
7.1 percent on year, while imports of U.S. goods to Japan tumbled 
19.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to the United States of politically sensitive Japanese  
steel products, however, plummeted 72 percent to $129.15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop comes as Japan plans to take the United States to the  
World Trade Organization over steps by Washington to impose 
anti-dumping duties on certain steel products from over twenty 
countries, including Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan says that Washington's decision to limit imports of  
hot-rolled steel products is a protectionist measure which goes 
against WTO free trade principles. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to Asian countries rose 4.3 percent in September to  
$14.97 billion as the region recovers from its economic crisis, the 
ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Lower; Dow Down 82.63 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as bond yields  
soared, offering an appealing alternative for investors seeking 
less volatile investments. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 82.63 at 10,387.62, having edged back 
from a loss of as much as 155 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators turned mixed, rebounding from early  
losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 1.90 at 1,299.75, 
and the Nasdaq composite index was up 8.54 at 2,825.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to  
6.38 percent from 6.34 percent late Friday. Bond yields are 
hovering near their highest levels since Oct. 1997, drawing some 
investors away from stocks in favor of the fixed returns available 
on bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said bond prices, which move in the opposite direction  
from yields, were hurt by a European Central Bank official's 
suggestion that the European economy is solid, but in danger of 
succumbing to rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning rang familiar with U.S. investors, who fear the  
Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to cool the robust 
growth of the U.S. economy. Fears of rising rates and higher 
inflation have kept stocks off-balance for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead, equity markets need a recovery, or a least a  
stabilization in the bond market'' before stocks can make another 
run at the record levels reached this summer, said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, several regional Fed officials including chairman  
Alan Greenspan will be on the road, delivering speeches that are 
sure to draw heavy scrutiny as investors seek guidance on the 
central bank's sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate earnings have provided the only real distraction from  
the interest rate watch, and continued to do so today. AT&AMP;T rose 1 
7/16 to 43 7/16 after reporting earnings that beat expectations by 
a penny even though revenue growth amid intense price competition 
for long-distance customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's oil companies both fell, however, despite profit  
reports that beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron fell 2 3/8 to 91 3/8 after reporting earnings of $1.07 per  
share, excluding one-time charges. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial had predicted $1.01 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon lost 2 9/16 to 74 5/16. The company earned 61 cents a  
share, above estimates of 59 cents per share, but profit margins 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks were mostly lower today, following a major leap  
on Friday after Congress neared a deal that would give banks, 
brokerages and insurance companies greater leeway in merging and 
selling each other's services. J.P. Morgan was down 4 1/16 at 121 
9/16, and American Express was down 5 at 143 5/8, the biggest 
decliners in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Those shares were also hurt by the rising bond yields and the  
fear of higher interest rates. Rising interest rates can cut into 
lending volume as it becomes more expensive to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's relative strength came from the Internet sector.  
Digital Island, a provider of network services, rose 15 13/16 to 38 
13/16 after agreeing to acquire privately held Sandpiper Networks 
Inc. for $621 million. Sandpiper provides management statistics for 
electronic commerce Web sites 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 13-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 611.37 million 
shares, well behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.46 to 417.23.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Governor Wins 2d Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Gov. Mike Foster, who became first Louisiana  
Republican governor to be elected to consecutive terms, thanked his 
supporters and then took care of some personal business. 
</P>
<P>
	The 69-year-old governor met with fans Sunday and then quickly  
excused himself, saying he had promised to shop for a motorcycle 
for his daughter before planning his next official steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can safely say the people are behind us. Now, I  
intend to shop for a motorcycle for my daughter and get back to 
work,'' the 69-year-old biker said at a brief news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster wound up with 62 percent of the vote Saturday in the  
state's unique open primary. Under the state's system any candidate 
winning more than 50 percent of the vote is declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Also good news for the GOP was the fact that most of Foster's  
legislative friends were returned to office. ``I'm generally 
pleased with the way the legislative races went,'' Foster said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the campaign, polls said the voters felt Foster's  
victory was a foregone conclusion, and there was little interest. 
Voter turnout Saturday was 44 percent, the lightest in at least 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	After the bike chore is over, the first priority will be to find  
a way to increase teacher pay without new taxes, something that 
will be difficult to achieve in light of the state's financial 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, at a Lafayette news conference Sunday, said he believes  
the Legislature can find a way to give teachers more money. The job 
may be somewhat easier since Foster will be coming off such a huge 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	With virtually all the vote counted, unofficial returns gave  
Foster 796,228 or 62 percent and Congressman William Jefferson 
379,707 or 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters chose to stay with someone they liked instead of  
someone they liked but didn't know as well,'' said Jefferson, who 
in 1990 became the first black congressman from Louisiana since 
Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Tom Greene, R-Maringouin, was third with 36,428 votes  
or 3 percent and Baton Rouge attorney Phil Preis followed with 
23,396 or 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foster's decisive victory is a harbinger of things to come for  
Republicans as we head into the critical 2000 elections,'' said Jim 
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Charge Dropped in World Cup Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESSEN, Germany (AP) -- Prosecutors dropped an attempted murder  
charge today against three of four Germans accused in the 
near-fatal beating of a French policeman during last year's World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge still applies to Andre Zawacki, who is accused of  
beating the French officer, David Nivel, several times about the 
head with a metal rod in the attack in Lens, France, where the 
German team was playing Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutality of his action shows ``that the important thing to  
him was the destruction of life,'' prosecutor Joachim Lichtinghagen 
said in his closing statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the court to convict the 28-year-old Zawacki of  
attempted murder as well as causing serious bodily harm and 
sentence him to 14 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor dropped the original attempted murder charges  
against the other three defendants, saying that while their actions 
also were brutal, an ``intent to kill'' could not be proved. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked for sentences ranging from six to eight years on the  
remaining charge of causing serious bodily harm against Tobias 
Reifschlaeger, 25; Frank Renger, 31; and Christopher Rauch, 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses testified that Renger and Reifschlaeger kicked Nivel  
hard on the head as he lay on the sidewalk. Rauch allegedly bashed 
Nivel on the head with a wooden advertising sign. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 21, 1998, attack left Nivel, 43, blind in one eye,  
speech-impaired and with difficulties concentrating, according to 
his lawyer, Harald Wostry, who also addressed the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Wostry asked the judges to convict all four of attempted murder  
and hand down sentences of at least 15 years each. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will remain a nursing case for the rest of his life,''  
Wostry said. ``The perpetrators will never be able to make up for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers were to give their closing arguments Thursday,  
and a verdict is expected Nov. 5.

<HEADLINE> US-Taliban bin Laden Talks Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Taliban militia showed what could be at  
least a flicker of interest Monday in expelling suspected terrorism 
kingpin Osama bin Laden in order to head off U.N. economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	A Taliban representative brought ``ideas'' to the State  
Department, but U.S. officials made no assertion of progress toward 
a settlement. Nor was a follow-up meeting announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say what the outcome will be,'' department spokesman  
James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideas were discussed about how to resolve this issue,'' Rubin  
told reporters after Taliban representative Abdul Hakeem Mujahid 
met with Assistant Secretary of State Karl F. Inderfurth for a 
little more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to characterize what Mujahid had proposed, Rubin said  
the simple U.S. demand was that bin Laden be sent where he could 
face trial in the bombing last year of two U.S. embassies. ``We 
don't think it's that complicated,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The militia that controls most of Afhganistan must exile bin  
Laden to stave off a threatened freeze of assets and worldwide 
boycott of the country's airline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a lot that is new here other than the fact they  
are now discussing some ideas with us obviously because there isn't 
much time left before the sanctions bite,'' the State Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at a news conference, Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, who has denounced Taliban for its ``despicable'' 
repression of women, suggested the ruling militia had a chance at 
being accorded regular treatment by nations around the world if it 
let go of bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban representative made no statement after seeing  
Inderfurth, eluding reporters by leaving through a side exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make clearer that we consider Osama bin Laden and  
his activities a threat to Americans,'' Albright said. ``He has 
made that very clear, and it is very important for the Taliban, if 
they wish to be treated with any sense of regularity, that he needs 
to be expelled to a country where he can be brought to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States suspects the Saudi multimillionaire  
masterminded the bombing of the U.S. embassies last year in 
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in which 224 people 
were killed. His organization is suspected in other attacks, as 
well, and bin Laden is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. A $5 
million reward has been offered by the State Department for 
information leading to his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan, has said it  
tried bin Laden in an Islamic court and found him innocent. The 
ruling army also has called him a guest, permitted to stay in 
Afghanistan by a previous government. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Taliban information minister, Amir Khan  
Muttaqi, said, ``We are ready to solve all the issues with America, 
including that of Osama bin Laden,'' but a week earlier Foreign 
Minister Mullah Mohammed Hassan Akhund said the Taliban would never 
give up bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	One incentive for the Taliban to submit to American demands is  
that the U.N. Security Council threatened on Oct. 15 to impose 
sanctions on the militia if bin Laden is not expelled by Nov. 14. 
The penalties would include a freeze on assets overseas and a ban 
on flights to and from Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	After Albright's news conference, spokesman Rubin cautioned  
reporters that the talks with the Taliban were not ``on the verge 
of a breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said American diplomats have met periodically with Taliban  
officials for some time. The head of the State Department's 
counterterrorism office met with Mujahid last Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, the first female secretary of state, has made women's  
rights a key element of U.S. foreign policy. She has traveled 
halfway around the world to visit young Afghan women who fled to 
Pakistan to escape the Taliban. 
</P>
<P>
	At a refugee camp at Peshawar, Pakistan, Albright assailed the  
Taliban's ``despicable treatment of women and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since gaining power several years ago, the Taliban have forced  
women from jobs, closed schools for girls and made it mandatory for 
women to wear the all-enveloping burqa. Women also are not allowed 
to travel without a male relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, at her news conference, also talked about another  
touchy subject, revealing that as Russian tanks pushed toward the 
capital of breakaway Chechnya, the Clinton administration 
admonished Moscow that it was on an ``ominous and deplorable'' 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia evidently was not heeding what Albright told  
reporters was a loud and clear message from her to Foreign Minister 
Ivan Ivanov. The tanks and troops moved closer to Grozny while 
federal jets and artillery pounded suspected rebel bases around 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright talked last week by telephone with Ivanov and again on  
Sunday after coming home from a trip to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took on board what I said,'' Albright told reporters at the  
State Department. ``But I can't say that I was particularly 
encouraged by his response.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks Postseason Pitching a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a strange coincidence that keeps  
happening to the New York Yankees in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	First it was Texas' bats that went cold. Then Boston couldn't  
get a clutch hit. Now it's the Braves who can barely generate a 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's not a coincidence after all. It might be time to give  
the Yankees' pitchers some credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two years have just been one big pitching performance  
after another,'' David Cone said Monday, a day after allowing one 
hit over seven scoreless innings to give New York a 2-0 lead over 
Atlanta in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done it against Texas the last two years, San Diego last  
year and now against the Braves. It's not just the other guys not 
hitting. We have something to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have given up just 25 runs in 10 postseason games --  
13 of those when Roger Clemens and Hideki Irabu were hammered in 
Game 3 of the AL Championship Series by the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine other games, the Yankees have held the opposition to  
three or fewer runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times did we go through the rotation with the  
efficiency we had in the postseason?'' manager Joe Torre asked. ``I 
don't think we went through a full time or two with the efficiency 
we've had lately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have barely started a rally against the Yankees,  
hitting .121 and scoring three runs in the losses to Orlando 
Hernandez and Cone, who each gave up one hit over seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the few times Atlanta has put runners on, Cone and Hernandez  
have shut them down. New York held the Braves hitless in their 
first 22 at-bats with runners on, before Greg Myers' two-out single 
in the ninth inning of Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how good they are,'' Atlanta's Ryan Klesko said.  
``We shouldn't be doing this bad. We knocked Randy Johnson out 
twice and he has the best stuff in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the formula the Yankees has used all month. They might  
let runners on base, but they won't give in. Opposing batters are 
hitting .182 against New York with runners in scoring position in 
the playoffs and .140 with runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Yankees pitchers have been so successful in the  
playoffs shouldn't come as any surprise, given their track record 
the previous three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other team, the Yankees are able to exploit the  
opposition's weaknesses. This year has been no different as they've 
silenced the free swingers on Texas, Boston and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of guys on our pitching staff who won't give  
in,'' Cone said. ``We take advantage of guys who swing at pitches 
out of the strike zone and use their aggressiveness against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees pitchers give much of the credit to the detailed  
advance reports prepared by scouting director Gene Michael. They go 
over every tendency and weakness in the opposing hitters -- what 
pitches they like and don't like, and what counts they swing on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps us approach the at-bats,'' Cone said. ``We know who  
is going to swing at first pitches and we throw breaking balls to 
them early in the count. It's just pitching backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre knows that good scouting means nothing without  
pitchers who can execute a game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't go out there without the quality pitchers and expect  
to be as successful as we have been,'' Torre said. ``It's not just 
because we picked something up or we know that he can't hit this 
particular pitch or that. It's still a matter of going from the 
hand to the catcher's mitt. That takes a lot more than knowing what 
to do.''

<HEADLINE> Golf's Minor League Now a Dot-Com  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Nike Tour is no more -- at least not by name, and certainly  
not by the amount of money that will be at stake on golf's 
developmental tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Buy.com, an Internet retailer and e-commerce portal to seven  
specialty stores, was announced Monday as the title sponsor to the 
tour that has produced such stars as David Duval, Tom Lehman and 
Jim Furyk. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said the Buy.com Tour will  
begin next year with minimum purses of $350,000 -- a 55 percent 
increase over this year with the possibility of them going even 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's time for this tour to take its own position in  
golf, not as a qualifying tour for the PGA but a force in terms of 
bringing the best golf for fans,'' Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike, meanwhile, is ending its association as title sponsor of  
the tour for the past seven years. Finchem said the company whose 
clients include Tiger Woods will stay involved in golf through 
television ads tied to the World Golf Championship events. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we hit 2000, there are a lot of things we want to do to  
fuel our growth, so we've been looking at the tour sponsorship and 
measuring what it's worth to us, as well as the PGA,'' said Nike 
spokesman Mike Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do other things with our dollars,'' he said. ``For  
example, Casey Martin just won his tour card, and we want to put 
some dollars behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who rides a cart because of a circulatory disorder in  
his right leg, was among 15 Nike Tour players who finished atop the 
money list Sunday and received their cards for the PGA Tour next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Buy.com signed a five-year deal, which includes a commitment to  
the First Tee program and a pledge by the tour to develop 
e-commerce opportunities with Buy.com. Beyond that, Finchem hopes 
the tour will become much more than a stepping stone to the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we look back on 1999, we see the Nike Tour as a series of  
golf competitions that is one of the stronger tours in the world,'' 
Finchem said. ``We already attract a good number from South Africa, 
Europe, Australia. As it (the tour) gets stronger, that will 
escalate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new sponsorship is a good fit on both sides.  
</P>
<P>
	Nike has been talking about getting out of its contract one year  
early because the company fears it's not getting enough bang for 
its buck, so Buy.com gives the PGA Tour a new five-year commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	And Buy.com figures to get plenty of exposure for a company that  
had $120 million in U.S. sales its first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a significant value to Buy.com as they position  
themselves in moving their brand among a myriad of brands emerging 
in e-commerce,'' Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The name may take getting used to. The tour was previously known  
as the Hogan Tour when Nike came along as the sponsor in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, Areaweb.com signed on as title sponsor to an LPGA  
event earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like the relationship with a dot-com,'' Finchem said. ``It  
speaks to where we are today in the technological position of golf. 
Beyond that, it sends a message to dot-coms that golf is a great 
place to invest.''

<HEADLINE> 'The Best Man' No. 1 At Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Moviegoers packed theaters for ``The Best  
Man'' as if flocking to a favorite cousin's wedding, lifting the 
comedy to a first-place debut at a crowded weekend box office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Best Man,'' starring Taye Diggs in a romantic wedding  
romp, took in $9.1 million in its opening weekend, according to 
industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead'' had a so-so opening  
weekend with $6.2 million for fourth place. ``Crazy in Alabama,'' 
directed by Antonio Banderas and starring wife Melanie Griffith, 
premiered dismally with $1 million to finish well out of the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bats,'' about swarms of killer-winged things on a rampage in a  
Texas town, opened in seventh place with $4.7 million. ``Three to 
Tango,'' a romantic comedy with Neve Campbell, Matthew Perry and 
Dylan McDermott, was eighth with $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier releases still crowded the field, cutting into business  
for new films. ``Double Jeopardy'' remained the No. 2 movie, 
grossing $7.7 million in its fifth weekend, pushing its total take 
up to $91 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend's top film, ``Fight Club,'' fell to third place  
with $6.3 million. ``The Story of Us'' was No. 5 with $5.5 million 
and ``American Beauty'' placed sixth with $5.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Double Jeopardy' is still siphoning off that mature audience  
so many of the fall films go after,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie 
ticket sales. ``It's making it tough for some of these newcomers to 
break in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Best Man'' had the broadest appeal of all the weekend's  
new movies, with universal themes about the ``hesitancy of men to 
commit and that bachelor party thing,'' Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-produced by Spike Lee and written and directed by his cousin  
Malcolm D. Lee, the movie stars Diggs as a writer who is best man 
at a friend's wedding. Bedlam breaks loose when a bridesmaid, 
played by Nia Long, obtains an advance copy of Diggs' steamy novel 
that borrows heavily from the lives of the wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend audience for ``Best Man'' was 80 percent to 85  
percent black, but ``the movie did very well across the board,'' 
said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, which 
released the film. ``It played well with the white community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film played in just 1,346 theaters and averaged $6,761 a  
screen. ``Double Jeopardy'' was on 3,002 screens and averaged 
$2,565, while ``Bringing Out the Dead'' opened in 1,936 cinemas and 
averaged $3,202. 
</P>
<P>
	Scorsese's movie drew more of a niche crowd for those who like  
their movies gritty and a bit depressing. ``Bringing Out the Dead'' 
stars Nicolas Cage and Patricia Arquette in a maniacally paced 
drama about a New York City paramedic on the verge of a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really plays strongly in urban markets, New York, Chicago,  
San Francisco, and not as strong in the smaller markets,'' said 
Wayne Lewellen, distribution president for Paramount, which 
released ``Bringing Out the Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations. Final figures 
were to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Best Man,'' $9.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $7.7 million  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Fight Club,'' $6.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' $6.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Story of Us,'' $5.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``American Beauty,'' $5.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Bats,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Three to Tango,'' $4.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $4.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Three Kings,'' $4.29 million.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq After-Hour Quotes Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors who trade stocks in the murky and  
fragmented after-hours markets got some help Monday when the Nasdaq 
Stock Market extended the hours of its price quote ticker to 6:30 
p.m. Eastern time. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension, from 5:15 p.m., could give investors easier  
access to the latest Nasdaq stock price information by providing 
that data to Web sites and TV networks from a central location. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unclear how many providers of financial information  
took advantage of the extended hours on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticker on CNBC, the financial news network, did not show the  
after-hours prices and many popular financial Web sites including 
Bloomberg.com and Yahoo. com continued to show prices as of the 
formal 4 p.m. close of the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press, which supplies data to 900 newspapers,  
planned to make the data available starting Nov. 1 in newspaper 
stock tables. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq decided to keep its ticker open later in response to  
growing pressure from alternative trading exchanges known as 
electronic communications networks (ECNs), which serve large 
institutional investors and are usually closed to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the ticker that carries stocks listed on the New York  
and American exchanges will stay open until 6:30 as well. That date 
coincides with a new after-hours floor trading session planned by 
the Chicago Stock Exchange, a regional market that trades NYSE 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the NYSE and Nasdaq markets close their regular trading  
sessions at 4 p.m., their tickers have stayed open until 5:15 p.m. 
to capture after-hours trades on regional stock exchanges and other 
trading venues. 
</P>
<P>
	While some ECNs offer trading beyond 5:15 p.m., up until now  
there has been no single place for investors to keep track of all 
these trades. That has raised worries that investors may not be 
able to find the best price for a given stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern has mounted as more and more Internet stock brokers,  
such as Datek Online and ETrade, offer after-hours trading for 
individual investors who never before were able to do so. As early 
as next month, larger firms such as Fidelity Investments, Charles 
Schwab, Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and others will begin offering 
after-hours trading for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need a central location where all the different quotes can  
be combined and viewed,'' said Tony Kafeiti online supervisor at 
Castle Online, a Freeport, N.Y., discount brokerage firm that 
processes its customers' after-hours trades on ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracey Curvey, executive vice president for Fidelity  
Investment's online brokerage service, said the move to extend the 
ticker's hours is bound to attract more investors to the extended 
hours sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	More participants means more after-hours liquidity, Curvey  
added. And additional liquidity -- or trading activity -- means 
investors are more likely to get a better price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before Nasdaq got involved, it was true fragmentation,'' said  
Brian Hyndman, president of Brass Utility LLC, one of nine 
independent ECNs that provide after-hours sessions.

<HEADLINE> Cavs' Murray Out for Four Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Cavaliers forward Lamond Murray is  
expected to miss four weeks with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured during an Oct. 16 game against the New York  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray had a second scan of his knee Monday at the Cleveland  
Clinic, and doctors didn't find any additional damage. He has 
started a rehabilitation program for his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray was acquired on Aug. 4 in a trade with the Los Angeles  
Clippers, where he played five seasons. Used primarily at small 
forward, he averaged 12.2 points last year after losing his 
starting job 13 games into the season.

<HEADLINE> UTC To Buy Dallas Aerospace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. is buying  
Dallas Aerospace Inc. from the Fairfield Corp. for about $57 
million cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced Monday, Dallas Aerospace will become  
part of Pratt &AMP; Whitney Engine Services, the engine service 
operations unit of UTC's Pratt &AMP; Whitney unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Aerospace, which had revenues last year of $78 million,  
is a Texas-based supplier of engines, engine parts and engine 
management and leasing services with facilities in Dallas and 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, UTC announced it will buy Cade Industries, a  
Michigan-based company which manufactures and repairs composite 
component parts for propulsion systems and airframes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adding Dallas and Cade will allow us to further build a global  
service and support network that meets out customers' needs,'' said 
Pratt &AMP; Whitney President Louis Chenevert. ``We will continue to 
offer innovative ways for them to reduce the total cost of owning 
and operating Pratt &AMP; Whitney engines.''

<HEADLINE> Dell Outpaces Compaq in PC Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dell Computer surpassed Houston-based Compaq as  
the biggest seller of personal computers in the United States 
during the third quarter, according to data from two leading 
research firms expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Round Rock-based computer company's third quarter sales  
increased nearly 57 percent over sales in last year's comparable 
quarter. Compaq's sales in the same time period increased only 
about 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The data indicate a turning point in the rivalry between the two  
Texas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell shipped 1,996,000 personal computers in the third quarter  
of 1999, compared with 1,780,000 personal computers shipped by 
Compaq during the same period. Dell had shipped 1,275,000 in the 
third quarter of 1998, compared with 1,426,000 shipped by the 
Houston-based Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Dell has a competitive advantage because it sells  
its PCs directly to customers, bypassing retailers and other 
middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years at the expense of  
Compaq. However, Compaq is still the largest PC maker in the world.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Rise From 7-week Lows / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures rose today in early trading on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after prices slumped to seven-week lows 
last week. Grains also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was forecast for today and Tuesday in dry planting areas of  
Brazil, the world's No. 2 soybean producer behind the United 
States. But after a 30-cent slide in soybean futures from last 
Wednesday to Friday, traders said the market may have bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
	After dipping initially today, soybean prices headed upward.  
</P>
<P>
	Corn was slightly higher in quiet dealings ahead of the weekly  
crop update by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Analysts 
expected the report to show the corn crop about 85 percent 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat advanced strongly, buoyed by Algeria's tender for 150,000  
tons of wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December early rose 2 3/4 cents to $2.60 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.00 a bushel; December oats rose 1 
cent to $1.10 a bushel; November soybeans rose 3/4 cent to $4.73 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork  
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle fell .83 cent to 68.37 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle fell .53 cent to 80.57 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs rose .30 cent to 49.55 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies fell .22 cent to 64.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Third Dragging Death Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began Monday for the last of  
three white men arrested in the dragging death of a black man, with 
a defense lawyer claiming his client is no racist and had no motive 
to commit the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Allen Berry is hoping to avoid the fate of his two white  
supremacist co-defendants. John William King and Lawrence Russell 
Brewer both were convicted earlier this year of capital murder and 
sentenced to death for the June 1998 slaying of James Byrd Jr. King 
and Brewer were members of a white supremacist prison gang, the 
Confederate Knights of America, while jailed together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shawn Berry is not a racist, was not a racist, has no racist  
writings, is not a member of any white supremacist group, has no 
racial tattoos,'' Berry's attorney, Lum Hawthorn, told 132 
potential jurors crammed into Jasper County Courthouse. ``He has no 
motive for committing a racial hate crime. And he did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Berry has  
given differing versions of the crime to authorities and to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray told jurors that at issue is ``Shawn Berry's credibility,  
what he has said compared to facts and the crime scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You will measure those statements against each other to see if  
he's truthful ... and measure those statements against known proven 
forensic facts once they're established in this courtroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, 24, is the youngest of the men accused of chaining Byrd,  
49, to the back of a pickup truck the early morning hours of June 
7, 1998, then dragging him nearly three miles over a bumpy country 
road just outside Jasper, about 125 miles northeast of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's shredded torso, minus his head, an arm and shoulder, was  
discovered after daylight, dumped at the end of a road directly 
between a black cemetery and church. The site, prosecutors said, 
was deliberate and meant to deliver a hate message. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 170 potential jurors who arrived in court Monday, 38 were  
excused quickly for medical or other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys on Tuesday were to begin individual questioning of the  
132 remaining jury prospects -- 19 of them black -- eventually 
settling on a panel of 14, including two alternates. Once testimony 
begins, the trial is expected to last eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	After jury selection Monday, the judge held a pretrial hearing  
over prosecutors' subpoena of a ``60 Minutes II'' interview with 
Berry. Prosecutors want copies of the segment, including the 
unedited outtakes, from the CBS program. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered the show's producer, Mary Mapes, to appear  
Friday morning with copies of the outtakes in her possession. 
Golden said he will rule then.

<HEADLINE> Look At Pols-Citizens Connections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOWSON, Md. (AP) -- The night began poorly for Al Gore and got  
worse. When 12 Maryland citizens, all Democrats, talked about 
politics for several intense hours, the vice president couldn't 
catch a break. 
</P>
<P>
	They decided Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, Bill  
Bradley, was genuine, soulful and interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	They found Republican George W. Bush to be an engaging fellow.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore made no human connection at all.  
</P>
<P>
	``I see only problems,'' muttered Stanley Axel, 61, a Social  
Security Administration analyst, throwing up his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Told what the group said about him, Gore was exercised. ``I  
don't know how to react to that and I don't know who they are or 
what they saw or whether they were leading questions,'' Gore said, 
pushing his chair back from the table in a brief fit of pique 
during an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Focus groups are not scientific samplings of public opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	Peter Hart, a Democratic and media pollster who brought the  
cross-section of Maryland Democrats together, remembers focus 
groups that concluded future presidents Ronald Reagan and George 
Bush would not amount to anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead these encounters gauge visceral reactions -- sometimes  
helping to identify qualities people want in a candidate. Campaigns 
use them widely, some of them treating the findings as ``sacred 
text,'' as Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan put it. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hart's session, it was easy to forget Gore is leading his  
race with Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not really presidential material,'' said Kevin Westreich, 40,  
an insurance claims examiner who arrived undecided. ``We can do 
better.'' The media watched behind one-way glass. 
</P>
<P>
	The group found itself attracted to Bradley, especially after  
watching video clips of his and Gore's Oct. 9 speeches to a 
Democratic dinner in Iowa. The seven who arrived leaning to Gore or 
undecided left thinking Bradley was their man. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley stood solemnly behind the lectern, reading glasses  
perched low on his nose and his voice barely a singsongy step above 
a monotone. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me he projects integrity,'' said Jerry Schunick, 61, a  
wedding photographer. ``That's what I see in this man. I just get 
that feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore roamed the stage and gestured.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he even has a choreographer for his hands,'' said Ruth  
Collison, 54, a homemaker and freelance artist. Reesa Luger, 53, 
who until this night supported Gore, agreed. ``I felt like he was 
acting something that someone had written for him to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said that speech and other recent ones have been well  
received, especially since he's been ``getting rid of some of the 
habits I picked up as vice president,'' including pausing before he 
speaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody and his brother and sister that I talked to who saw  
those speeches had the same reaction,'' he said, that ``what I was 
saying made sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said that in presuming Bradley would be a good leader, the  
group was grasping at ``the thinnest reeds possible,'' including 
his basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he said of Bradley, a former New Jersey senator: ``The first  
handshake he has with the American public is a pretty firm one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was surprised at the warmth shown for Bush. If he ``can  
keep it light and friendly and easy, he is going to have a major 
advantage,'' he said. ``People are comfortable with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Pew poll underscored the importance voters place on the  
human connection. 
</P>
<P>
	In it, 71 percent said a candidate's ability to relate to  
average people was of prime importance -- more important than any 
voting record, religious involvement or childhood experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Pew found that Gore's perceived personal shortcomings are a  
major reason people give for not wanting to vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's group fleshed out findings like those.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bush the Republican was the candidate these Democrats most  
wanted to spend a weekend with. ``Plenty to chat and talk about,'' 
one said. Great family, said another. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bradley weekend? ``Relaxed and low-key,'' offered Noel Sills,  
24, an account executive. ``He would want to know a lot about 
you,'' said Axel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore? ``I think it would be preprogrammed,'' said Ms. Collison.  
``You could probably get a list of your activities the Friday 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Gore's problems are correctable, several said he  
already has reinvented himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``This IS the new, revised, improved Al Gore,'' said Westreich.  
``He might have maxed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to give Bradley advice, Axel said: ``Be a little more  
impassioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep doing what you're doing because it's working,'' said  
Howard Jacobs, 44, a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Advice for Gore? Social worker Judi Dickman, 44, said: ``Find  
some sort of vision.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Security Council Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Nearly two weeks after throwing out  
Pakistan's elected government, the army on Monday announced the 
members of a new National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The five men and one women will run the country until the  
military chief decides to hold elections. So far Gen. Pervaiz 
Musharraf has refused to say when elections would be held and few 
Pakistanis seem to want elections anytime soon, preferring instead 
to see endemic corruption tackled first. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, who led the Oct. 12 bloodless coup that ousted Nawaz  
Sharif's government, will head the council of military officers and 
civilians, including a woman. He traveled to Saudi Arabia Monday on 
his first trip abroad and was not in the country for the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries to recognize  
Musharraf. 
</P>
<P>
	The military officers on the council are Air Chief Marshal  
Pervaiz Mehdi Qureshi and Naval Chief Admiral Abdul Aziz Mirza. 
</P>
<P>
	The civilians members of the team are: Sahabzada Yaqoob Ali  
Khan, a former foreign minister, Mohammed Yaqub, governor of the 
State Bank of Pakistan and Attiya Inayatullah, a social worker and 
former adviser on family planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Khan and Ms. Inayatullah served under the previous military  
regime led by Gen. Zia-ul-Haq. 
</P>
<P>
	The general died in a mysterious plane crash in 1988 paving the  
way for Pakistan's first free and fair elections in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yaqub worked for the International Monetary Fund for 20 years  
before joining Pakistan's finance ministry in 1992. He was governor 
of the State Bank of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf appointed governors of the four provinces on Thursday.  
Three of the four were retired army officers and the fourth a 
retired justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, who has a reputation as a brilliant field tactician  
and a modern Muslim, has accused ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif 
of driving the country toward ruin, destroying state institutions 
in a bid to consolidate his powers and undermining the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, however, has suspended the constitution and has so  
far refused to set a date for general elections and a return to 
democracy in Pakistan, a demand of most western governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf has promised to root out corruption, recover  
ill-gotten wealth and restore confidence in an economy that some 
observers say is verging on collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The military takeover is the fourth in Pakistan's history.  
Pakistanis have been ruled by army generals for 25 of their 52 year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers say Musharraf's rule thus far is relatively  
lenient because he has not suspended fundamental rights or imposed 
curbs on the press or judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	The military takeover has been widely accepted by Pakistanis,  
who are frustrated by years of political instability, corruption 
and religious and political violence.

<HEADLINE> Raiders QB Has Broken Bone in Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon  
softly squeezed his bandaged and splinted left wrist, and vowed a 
broken bone would not stop him from playing this coming weekend 
against the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a break in there, but it's not like something that  
needs to be casted. I can take a snap now without any support or 
anything,'' Gannon said Monday. ``I want to play. That's my goal, 
to play every game this season. Right now I anticipate playing 
against Miami this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon, a right-hander, was injured while being knocked to the  
ground after throwing the deciding touchdown pass in the Raiders' 
24-23 win Sunday over the New York Jets. The 5-yard pass to James 
Jett came with 26 seconds remaining, as Gannon rallied the Raiders 
from a 17-point deficit late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon was 26-of-51 for a career-high 352 yards against the  
Jets, and led the Raiders with 60 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland coach Jon Gruden was not as confident about Gannon being  
able to play against Miami, especially since the Raiders have a bye 
the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned. Right now he is very questionable for the  
next game. We'll see if there's a soft cast he can wear,'' Gruden 
said. ``I know the snap itself is not going to be easy 
procedurally. He's going to be sore for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Gannon cannot play, Gruden said Bobby Hoying will be the  
Raiders' starter at home against the Dolphins. Hoying, obtained in 
a trade from Philadelphia during the preseason, has not played yet 
for Oakland but made six starts for the Eagles in 1997 while Gruden 
was the offensive coordinator there. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Tyrone Wheatley, who was taken off the field on a cart  
after injuring his lower back in the third quarter of the win over 
the Jets, remained in a hospital Monday for further tests. Gruden 
said tests so far have shown no serious damage to Wheatley's back. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruden said it is unclear whether Wheatley, the Raiders' leading  
runner this season, will be available for the game against Miami.

<HEADLINE> Winfrey Runs for Cancer Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wearing No. 974, Oprah Winfrey was the center  
of attention at a fund-raising run for breast cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to pick the flattest places to run,'' joked Winfrey, who  
covered the 3.1 mile course Sunday in about 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out of shape, so it felt hard,'' she said. ``But you feel  
so good when it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey, a former Milwaukee resident, tried to redirect some of  
the attention onto women who wore pink hats that indicated they are 
breast cancer survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey cited the case of Judy Pickett of Milwaukee, a survivor  
of breast cancer who has accomplished a goal of making it to all 98 
of the Races for the Cure that have been held around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The credit goes to people like Judy Pickett,'' Winfrey said.  
``I just rolled out of bed.''

<HEADLINE> Former Stockbroker on Stewart Plane </HEADLINE>

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Van Ardan was a stockbroker before moving  
to Florida to get into the sports management business, starting out 
with motors sports and recently shifting his focus to golf at 
Leader Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	He was working with Payne Stewart at a perfect time. Stewart won  
his second U.S. Open title in June, the centerpiece to what has 
been a resurgent career. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ardan boarded Stewart's Learjet for Dallas to  
consider a golf course design project. He was among at least five 
killed when the plane crashed in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Ardan, who turned 45 on Friday, is survived by his wife, Debbie,  
and four children ranging in age from 9 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not many people who protected and loved his family  
like he did,'' said Joe Castronovo, a family friend. ``He had a 
strong Christian faith. He was the kind of man that anybody would 
have wanted for a friend. He loved his family and loved God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ardan, who was born in Washington and grew up in Maryland, had  
worked at Leader Enterprises since 1992. He was employed as an

<HEADLINE> Hershey Earnings Down in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Hershey Foods Corp. announced Monday that  
net earnings dropped $20 million, or 12 cents a share, in the third 
quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily because 
computer troubles slowed the company's deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter ended Oct. 4 was $87.6 million, or 62  
cents per share diluted, the company said. The company reported 
$107.5 million, or 74 cents per share, during the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey had said earlier this month that its earnings would be  
lower than expected because of a backlog of orders. The results 
released Monday surpassed analysts' lowered expectations of 60 
cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	``As anticipated, our third-quarter sales and earnings declined  
primarily as a result of problems encountered since the July 
start-up of new business processes in the areas of customer 
service, warehousing and order fulfillment,'' Kenneth L. Wolfe, 
Hershey's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a 
statement. ``These problems resulted in lost sales and 
significantly increased freight and warehousing costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has not met its goal of returning to normal customer  
service levels by the end of this month, Wolfe said. The company 
expects its response times to improve through the end of 1999 and 
as a new distribution center opens next year, Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales for the period were $1 billion, compared to $1.2  
billion during the same period last year, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Hershey earned $362.3 million, or  
$2.55 per share, up from $230.9 million, or $1.59 per share, in the 
same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $2.87 billion, down from $3.2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Hershey shares rose 50 cents to $50.18 3/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> News Focus Said Different for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- News media's tendency to highlight the  
personality, appearance and family life of female candidates could 
leave voters thinking they are less qualified than the males they 
run against, an analysis of news stories says. 
</P>
<P>
	The references may be subtle -- descriptions of Arizona Gov. Jane  
Hull as a ``grandmotherly redhead,'' or of Elizabeth Dole's choice 
of ``a red suit and matching red pumps'' -- but they create 
obstacles to women seeking leadership positions, said Marie Wilson 
of the Women's Leadership Fund, which released the study Monday. 
The fund promotes women for leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just female candidates who get such  
personality-oriented treatment, Wilson said. She cited a newspaper 
story that said Dole's female pollster was ``unmarried and 
childless.'' ``Would I ever see that about a man?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers reviewed 311 newspaper stories. The articles  
comprised 1,609 paragraphs, including 441 quotations, on the 
campaigns of female candidates and 1,717 paragraphs, including 450 
quotations, on male contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Journalists focused on personal characteristics of female  
candidates in 17 percent of the paragraphs written about them, 
compared with 12 percent for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reporters highlighted male candidates' positions or records on  
the issues in 31 percent of the paragraphs written about them, 
compared with 27 percent for women. 
</P>
<P>
	--62 percent of the quotations made by male candidates included  
facts, evidence or reasoning behind their statements, compared with 
56 percent for women. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also said reporters are more likely to focus on men's  
positions on issues, such as education, transportation and taxes, 
than those of women. And newspaper quotations of male candidates 
more often include fact or reasoning to support their statements, 
the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Cook Jr., editor of The Cook Political Report and  
political analyst for the National Journal Group, said female 
candidates must give well-researched answers to tough questions. If 
they're going to win, he said, they must be perceived as better 
than their male opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may not be fair, but it's true,'' said Cook.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Mitchell, chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC  
News, denounced a recent Pizza Hut television commercial that 
lampoons Hillary Rodham Clinton. In the ad, a blonde woman in a 
business suit says she knows the virtues of a ``Big New Yorker'' 
pizza because ``New York, I want to be your next senator!'' A 
police officer later exclaims: ``$9.99! What do they think this is, 
Arkansas?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be hard to imagine a national advertiser taking on a  
nationally known male candidate in the way that Hillary Clinton is 
satirized in this ad,'' Mitchell said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Airways Plans Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Olympic Airways' board of directors today  
approved a plan to restructure Greece's struggling national carrier 
and make it profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Rod Lynch said that the more than 300  
improvements outlined in the business plan guarantee an improvement 
of the company's operational and financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a systematic and steady build-up,'' Lynch said.  
``Nothing spectacular, no rush for growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has been plagued by frequent delays, a poor image  
among consumers and labor strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the measures included in the plan are an improvement in  
client service, a sale of assets including its New York offices to 
secure funds for reinvestment within the company and a complete 
renewal of a nearly 20-year-old fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline gave no estimnate of how much it expected to  
generate from asset sales or how much it will spend on rebuilding 
the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch also said he expects the company to see a profit at the  
operating level by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt-burdened Olympic is struggling to win back passengers after  
a series of strikes and other labor-related problems. It is 
currently being managed by Speedwing, a subsidiary of British 
Airways.

<HEADLINE> Dementia Guide Created for Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Facing an aging population, the nation's  
biggest physicians organization unveiled a guide Monday to help 
doctors recognize and treat dementia. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association booklet is designed as a  
practical, quick guide for primary care physicians, who will see 
greater numbers of dementia cases in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes tests for gauging dementia -- asking patients to draw  
a clock face, identify a pencil and provide the current day, month 
and year. The guide also recommends ways to prevent and respond to 
elder abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Most importantly, the guide seeks to ease the burden on family  
members, who provide most of the care to dementia sufferers, and to 
keep patients out of nursing homes for as long as possible, said 
Dr. Yank Coble Jr., a Florida endocrinologist and AMA Board of 
Trustees member. 
</P>
<P>
	Dementia patients often ``withdraw'' in institutions, and  
symptoms such as incontinence worsen, Coble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to better at home,'' said Coble, whose father and  
father-in-law both suffered from Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dementia, which can be linked to Alzheimer's, certain types of  
strokes and other physical conditions, is incurable and worsens 
progressively over years, making it hard to diagnose in early 
stages. People with the disorder eventually become unable to live 
independently. Some have trouble finding words, dressing, cooking a 
meal or performing other complex tasks.

<HEADLINE> U.N. World Climate Conference Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder opened the fifth U.N.  
World Climate Conference on Monday with an unexpected call for the 
ratification of an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases 
by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The landmark document known as the Kyoto protocol is aimed at  
reducing greenhouse gases by 5 percent from 1990 levels between 
2008 and 2012. It was agreed to in Kyoto, Japan in 1997, five years 
after 150 countries committed to the general goal of cutting 
emissions at a conference in Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive secretary of the U.N. convention on climate  
change, Michael Zammit Cutajar, called the proposed 2002 deadline 
``an encouraging goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 14 nations, all of them developing countries, have ratified  
the protocol, which must be adopted by 55 nations -- including 
industrialized nations that account for the production of 55 
percent of the world's greenhouse gases -- before it can become 
legally binding. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate, which recently failed to ratify an  
international nuclear test ban treaty, has said it won't take the 
Kyoto protocol up until there is measurable participation by 
developing nations and until costs of implementation are addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schroeder told delegates that industrialized nations need to  
set an example to encourage developing nations to become more 
involved. While developing nations are invited to ratify the 
protocol, they are not held to any binding targets. 
</P>
<P>
	One goal of the Bonn conference, which runs through Nov. 5, is  
to work out details of how to monitor compliance, focusing on 
painstaking scientific details such as how various emission 
controls should be measured. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is a political component to the discussions,  
including a controversial plan to allow industrialized nations to 
trade emissions ``credit.'' The European Union wants to limit 
credit trading so countries can't meet reduction targets without 
taking steps to clean up their air at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, however, wants no limits on emissions  
trading, saying the system provides a financial incentive to 
control harmful greenhouse gases. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations are scheduled to conclude at a November 2000  
meeting in The Hague, Netherlands, triggering the ratification 
process for the major industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In urging quick ratification, Schroeder noted that the Rio goal  
of bringing emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000 would 
not be achieved. The United Nations says that at present rate, 
emissions will actually rise to 18 percent above 1990 levels by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three countries -- Germany, Switzerland and Britain -- have  
reduced emissions in the last two years, German Environment 
Minister Juergen Trittin said in an interview with German Radio 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental group Greenpeace praised Schroeder's appeal,  
but said Germany is unlikely to meet its own legal obligation to 
reduce emissions by 21 percent by 2010 if traffic continues to 
increase at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Russia, Japan and Germany are the biggest  
emitters of greenhouse gases in the industrialized world.

	Pro Golfer Stewart Killed in Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- A Learjet carrying champion golfer Payne  
Stewart and at least four other people flew a ghostly journey 
halfway across the country Monday, its windows iced over and its 
occupants apparently incapacitated, before spiraling nose first 
into a grassy field. Everyone aboard was killed. The flight plan 
said two crewmembers and three passengers were on the jet, but 
there were reports a sixth person boarded the plane just before it 
took off from Orlando, Fla. The chartered, twin-engine Lear 35 may 
have suddenly lost cabin pressure soon after taking off for Dallas, 
government officials said.

	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Hundreds of eager Palestinians  
shouldering duffel bags and suitcases traveled 28 miles across 
Israel on Monday -- inaugurating a ``safe passage'' that for the 
first time links the areas under their control and takes them a 
step closer to statehood. The safe passage between the Erez 
Crossing in Gaza to Tarkumiya in the West Bank takes the 
Palestinians a step closer to statehood by linking the two 
autonomous areas on either side of Israel that they hope will 
eventually make up their state.

	McCain Accuses Bush of Attack

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sen. John McCain accused Republican  
presidential rival George W. Bush on Monday of orchestrating a 
campaign to tarnish his image. McCain, who has gained ground on 
Bush in the key state of New Hampshire, was referring to a New York 
Times article on Monday that portrayed him as hot-tempered and 
engaged in a feud with Arizona's governor, Jane Hull, who has 
endorsed Bush. He blamed the Bush campaign for helping plant the 
story. Margita Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bush's California 
campaign, said Bush is running a positive campaign. Pressed on 
whether Bush had orchestrated the story, she declined further 
comment.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed the $268 billion  
defense spending bill -- which includes a 4.8 percent military pay 
raise -- despite complaints that it contained money that the 
Pentagon had not requested. ``In good conscience I cannot allow our 
national security needs to be held hostage to this budget battle,'' 
he said. However, Clinton still is battling Republicans over 
spending bills to achieve his demands for hiring teachers and 
police officers, buying park land, and supporting foreign aid.

nominees. Buchanan hopes to use anti-abortion conservatism and 
anti-trade populism to forge a coalition. Also today, Donald Trump 
dropped his GOP affiliation in preparation for a potential Reform 
bid. He will decide early next year whether to challenge Buchanan.

	Mutant Genes, Leukemia Studied  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Adults who have certain mutant genes are  
far less likely to develop a form of leukemia than those with 
normal genes, according to a study released Monday. The mutant 
genes metabolize folic acid and apparently pump higher-than-normal 
amounts of the vitamin into DNA production, according to the study 
published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences. Acute lymphocytic leukemia, which destroys bone marrow, 
is often fatal and accounts for 10 percent of adult leukemia.

<HEADLINE> Mutant Genes, Leukemia Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Adults who have certain mutant genes are  
far less likely to develop a form of leukemia than those with 
normal genes, according to new research published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutant genes metabolize folic acid and apparently pump  
higher-than-normal amounts of the vitamin into DNA production, 
according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Acute lymphocytic leukemia, which destroys bone marrow, is often  
fatal and accounts for 10 percent of adult leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that people with two mutant genes were more  
than five times less likely to develop the leukemia. Even those 
with only one of the mutant genes were three to four times less 
likely to get the cancer, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also suggests that even people who do not have the  
mutant genes can reduce their risk of cancer by getting enough 
folic acid in their diet, said Martyn Smith, a toxicology professor 
at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it tells us is that folate is important in preventing  
this type of leukemia,'' said Smith. ``In the absence of this 
genetic protection, it's important to get our folate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acute lymphocytic leukemia is most common form of childhood  
leukemia. The study released Monday does not address the mutant 
genes' possible effect on children. Another study is underway to 
investigate that issue. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated one-third of adults have both mutant genes, which  
help produce the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, 
or MTHFR. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies have shown that people with one of the mutant  
genes have half the colorectal cancer risk of people without it. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 participants in the study had either acute lymphocytic  
leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. Nearly 500 were healthy. 
Researchers working in England found no correlation between mutant 
genes and development of acute myeloid leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Folic acid, one of the chemicals in the vitamin B complex, is  
found in liver, oranges and green vegetables such as spinach. 
People with the mutant genes who don't get enough folic acid may 
not receive the same protective benefits, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 28,000 adults and 5,000 children in the United States are  
diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia annually.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Could Not Stop Stewart Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- Air Force Capt. Chris Hamilton  
could only watch helplessly alongside a business jet as it flew 
uncontrolled over the nation's heartland Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who caught up with the Learjet over Memphis, Tenn.,  
had no idea golfer Payne Stewart was on the private plane that 
eventually crashed in South Dakota, killing him and at least four 
other people. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Air Force pilot from Newport News, Va., was  
flying his F-16 Fighting Falcon, call sign ``Bullet One,'' on a 
training mission over the Gulf of Mexico when he was diverted to 
try to find out what was wrong with the Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very helpless feeling to pull up alongside another  
aircraft and realize the people inside that aircraft potentially 
are unconscious or in some other way incapacitated,'' Hamilton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And there's nothing I can do physically from my aircraft --  
even though I'm 50 to 100 feet away -- to help them at all. That's 
very disheartening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine plane, which took off from Orlando, Fla., may  
have suffered a pressurization failure during its scheduled flight 
to Dallas, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, a member of the Eglin-based 40th Flight Test Squadron,  
said he observed no damage to the aircraft but was unable to see 
inside the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my position, it looked as if the front cockpit windshield  
was condensed or fogged over,'' he said. ``I could not see into the 
cockpit area of the aircraft itself. Neither could I see inside the 
passenger windows of the aircraft. Those windows just appeared 
dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton said he spent five to 10 minutes flying with the  
Learjet before having to drop to a lower altitude to conserve fuel. 
He was then directed to go to Scott Air Force Base, Ill., to 
refuel. The chase was then picked up by two Air National Guard 
F-16s from Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff Sgt. James Hicks, 34, of Orlando, was on duty as an air  
traffic controller at Eglin when he received a call from the 
Federal Aviation Administration control center in Jacksonville that 
the Learjet might be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks directed Hamilton, engaged in air-to-air combat training  
against an A-10 Thunderbolt II, to a tanker operating over Eglin's 
vast military reservation to top off his fuel and give chase to the 
Learjet. It took Hamilton, whose plane was unarmed, about 50 
minutes to close the 100-mile lead the Learjet had. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, a Lear 35 built in 1976, took off from Orlando at  
about 9:20 a.m. EDT, and the last communication came from over 
Gainesville, Fla., said Tony Molinaro, an FAA spokesman in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet had flown as high as 45,000 feet and the crew did not  
respond to repeated inquiries from air traffic controllers, said 
Paul Turk, another FAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	About four hours after takeoff, the plane crashed in a grassy  
field two miles west of Mina, S.D., in the north-central part of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Stewart, also killed were agents Robert Fraley  
and Van Ardan and the two pilots, said Bill Curry, a spokesman for 
Stewart's family. Fraley was CEO of Leader Enterprises Inc. and 
Ardan was president of the sports management company. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was one of the most recognizable players in golf  
because of his trademark clothing. He won 18 tournaments around the 
world, including three major championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, he won his second U.S. Open, prevailing over Phil  
Mickelson with a 15-foot putt, the longest putt to ever decide that 
championship on the final hole.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Suit Tossed Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge says Virgin Airways never got  
off the ground with evidence to prove British Airways monopolizes 
routes between London and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum ruled Monday that  
Virgin had failed to provide evidence that policies by British 
Airways had damaged competition on routes between London's Heathrow 
Airport and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge noted in her written opinion that British Airways'  
fares on the North Atlantic routes had dropped by 40 percent 
between 1986 and 1996 as competition grew. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said British Airways ``persuasively argues that Virgin  
has not shown that it can prove that British Airways engaged in 
predatory or otherwise anticompetitive conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph F. Wayland, a lawyer who had worked on the case for  
Virgin, said it was too early to know whether the airline would 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got it. We're still digesting it. After we've reviewed  
it, I'm sure the company will make a decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, said the airline  
was delighted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great day for everyone at British Airways,'' he said  
in a release. ``This lawsuit was a throwback to an era of 
confrontation and litigation between Virgin Atlantic Airways and 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to a continuation of spirited competition  
between the two carriers, one in which the flying public, and not 
the courts or regulators, determines the winner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin had argued that the 60-year-old British Airways relies on  
incentive agreements with travel agents and corporate customers to 
keep them on its planes flying to 94 cities from its hub at 
Heathrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin, which began flying in 1984, began operating routes  
between Heathrow and the United States in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Virgin said the airline would have more than its  
roughly dozen routes between the United States and London if 
British Airways did not monopolize the routes through its incentive 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways had argued that its routes between London and  
the United States were its most important market and its largest 
profit center and that Virgin was trying to skim off its best 
source of profits.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Crash Reminiscent of Rein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The crash of a Learjet that killed pro golfer Payne Stewart on  
Monday was very similar to an accident nearly 20 years ago that 
took the life of Louisiana State University football coach Bo Rein. 
</P>
<P>
	Rein, who had not coached a game yet for LSU, left Shreveport,  
La., on Jan. 10, 1980, in a private plane, en route to Baton Rouge, 
the home of LSU, following a recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plane, with a pilot aboard, went through a thunderstorm,  
lost radio contact and mysteriously flew off course for hundreds of 
miles before it went down in the Atlantic Ocean off the Virginia 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cessna 411 Conquest turboprop, which had a pressurized  
cabin, climbed as high as 41,000 feet as Air Force jets followed 
it. It suddenly fell into the ocean, apparently after running out 
of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force captain flying one of the chase planes, Daniel  
Zoerb, said the plane went down in an out-of-control, spinning 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lights disappeared below me ... I didn't see a fireball or  
explosion,'' Zoerb said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoerb was the last of three military pilots to try to intercept  
the plane and shake it from its wayward path. Two pilots had 
attempted to intercept the aircraft near Raleigh after being 
alerted through the national air defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Rein's body and that of the pilot were never recovered.  
Investigators were never able to determine exactly what happened, 
but speculated that the plane might have lost its pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Rein's widow, Suzanne Kay, reached an out-of-court settlement in  
1982 on a $10 million damage suit against the Cessna Aircraft Co., 
Cruise Aviation Inc., which had serviced the plane and Nichols 
Construction Co., which owned it. The amount of the settlement was 
not revealed.

<HEADLINE> Former Baptist Publicist Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A former publicist for the National Baptist  
Convention USA was sentenced Monday to nearly two years in prison 
for failing to pay taxes on more than $500,000 she received while 
working for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernice Edwards was sentenced to 21 months and must also pay  
$109,000 to the IRS and serve three years of supervised release. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards was the co-defendant in the trial of the Rev. Henry  
Lyons, a former director of the large and influential black church 
denomination now serving a 5 1/2-year sentence for embezzling $4 
million from companies doing business with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, 42, sobbed and asked U.S. District Judge Henry Lee  
Adams for leniency because she is a single mother of four children, 
including an infant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very remorseful of the acts that I pleaded to and I take  
full responsibility for it,'' Ms. Edwards said. ``I don't know how 
we can make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, of Milwaukee, faced up to 10 years in prison and  
$500,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered that Ms. Edwards undergo mental health  
treatment and not open new bank accounts or have any opened in her 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards was working as a publicist for the convention when  
she and Lyons, 57, were accused of purchasing real estate, jewelry 
and other items with money from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	She was acquitted of racketeering charges but pleaded guilty to  
tax evasion in March.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. To Grapple With Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Gov. Don Sundquist on Monday called  
state legislators into special session to consider a financial 
overhaul that could include what was once unthinkable in Tennessee 
-- an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundquist, a Republican who cannot seek a third term, opposed  
the income tax while seeking re-election last year but said his 
about-face resulted from the ``genuine and serious budget crisis'' 
that has emerged in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	While many states are enjoying big surpluses, Tennessee will be  
$382 million in the red when the new fiscal year begins July 1, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is one of nine states without an income tax. It relies  
most heavily on a 6 percent sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Income tax opponents have said that the projected deficit is  
overblown and that any shortfall can be addressed through spending 
cuts and more efficient government. This year's budget totaled 
$16.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The special session will begin next Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and the Senate are controlled by Democrats, some  
of whom oppose an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundquist's backing of an income tax has him aligned with  
Democratic leaders in the Legislature and put him at odds with his 
own party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hearing overwhelmingly from my constituents that they're  
opposed not only to an income tax but also to a tax increase of any 
kind. They want the state to get spending under control,'' 
Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The the leader of the Senate's Republicans,, Ben Atchley, said  
Sundquist does not have the votes to pass an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say that the sales tax, which is applied to groceries as  
well as other products, places an unfair burden on the poor because 
they pay the same rate as wealthy citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	A special session on taxes last spring failed to produce reform  
and ended in acrimony when the subject of an income tax came up. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundquist is thought to be leaning toward a plan that includes a  
3.75 percent income tax and reduction of the state sales tax from 6 
percent to 3.75 percent. He said he will outline his plan on 
Tuesday.

	Watch out Florida State, a few teams are gaining on you.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles (8-0) hung on to the No. 1 spot in The Associated  
Press' Top 25 college football poll, but their lead over No. 2 Penn 
State (8-0) slipped even though both teams pulled out narrow 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	And new challenger Virginia Tech (6-0), up a notch to No. 3 this  
week, is generating support even though it had the weekend off. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, which beat Clemson 17-14 and gave Bobby Bowden  
career win No. 300 in the first father vs. son coaching matchup, 
had 55 first-place votes and 1,733 points in Sunday's balloting by 
the 70 sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State, who had a tough time before beating Purdue 31-25,  
had 10 first-place votes and 1,684 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hokies moved up after Nebraska (6-1) was beaten by Texas  
24-20 and tumbled five places and into a tie at No. 8 with 
Mississippi State (8-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Florida State led Penn State in first-place votes  
62-6, with the Hokies getting the other two votes. This week, it's 
55-10 Seminoles and Virginia Tech receiving the other five 
first-place votes. Also, Florida State's point margin was reduced 
from 64 to 49 over Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	With five of last week's top 13 teams losing, there was  
significant shuffling in poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, which beat Alabama 21-7, moved up to No. 4, followed  
by No. 5 Florida, No. 6 Kansas State, No. 7 Georgia Tech, Nebraska 
and Mississippi State tied at No. 8, and No. 10 Georgia, up four 
places after a 49-34 win over Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, a 40-10 winner over Michigan State, jumped six spots  
to No. 11, followed by No. 12 Texas -- also up six places -- No. 13 
Marshall, No. 14 Alabama, No. 15 Michigan, No. 16 BYU, No. 17 East 
Carolina, No. 18 Purdue, No. 19 Michigan State and No. 20 Southern 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, a 20-17 winner over Minnesota, was up a spot to No.  
21, followed by No. 22 Texas A&AMP;M, No. 23 Miami, No. 24 Oklahoma and 
No. 25 Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama fell four spots to No. 14 after losing to the defending  
national champion Vols, Michigan tumbled six slots to No. 15 after 
a 35-29 loss to Illinois, and Michigan State fell eight places to 
No. 19 with its loss to Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners (4-2) beat Texas A&AMP;M 51-6 and returned to the Top 25  
after a one-week stay in the fifth regular-season poll. The Aggies 
tumbled nine spots to No. 22 after their worst loss in 98 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota dropped out of the poll.  
</P>
<P>
	In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were: Florida  
State, Penn State, Virginia Tech, Tennessee and Florida.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Gore Gaining Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore widened his lead  
against Democratic presidential rival Bill Bradley and gained 
ground on Republican front-runner George W. Bush in a poll released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has stretched his lead over Bradley, a former New Jersey  
senator, to 25 points -- 57 percent to 32 percent in the CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup poll. Bradley had narrowed the national margin in that 
same poll to 12 points earlier this month. He has been running even 
with Gore in recent state polls in key locations like Iowa, New 
Hampshire and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who last month moved his campaign from Washington to  
Nashville, Tenn., and shook up his campaign staff, also closed the 
gap on Bush, the poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore narrowed a head-to-head matchup from 16 points behind Bush  
earlier this month to 9 points down -- 52 percent to 43 percent. 
Bush was 15 points ahead of Bradley, 54 percent to 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pat Buchanan is included in the mix as a Reform Party  
candidate, Gore trails Bush by 6 percentage points, 48 percent to 
42 percent. Buchanan would get 5 percent of the vote in that 
hypothetical race. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan made his switch to the Reform Party official Monday. By  
a 3-1 margin, Republicans and those leaning Republican said his 
Reform candidacy would hurt the GOP rather than help them, 37 
percent to 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll asked whether people would prefer to see Pat Buchanan  
or businessman Donald Trump win the Reform Party nomination and, by 
a wide margin, Americans want Buchanan to get the nod, 48 percent 
to 29 percent. When the question is asked only of Reform Party 
supporters, Buchanan gets an even wider margin of support. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had a wide lead over his Republican rivals for the  
nomination, 66 percent to 11 percent for Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona and 7 percent for businessman Steve Forbes. The remaining 
candidates were in the low single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,005 Americans was taken Oct. 21-24 and  
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, higher 
for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Get New Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- There were still more hard hats than hockey  
helmets at the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena on Monday, 
but the Carolina Hurricanes gave their new home a thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending Southeast Division champions practiced for the  
first time in the $158 million, 18,700-seat arena that will be the 
team's permanent home as workers put the finishing touches on the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina played in the Greensboro Coliseum for two years while  
the new building was being built. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty exciting day,'' coach Paul Maurice said after  
a short practice. ``We weren't really worried about what was going 
on on the ice. It was just nice to be here. It's a beautiful 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers wiped down seats and placed floor tiles near the  
Carolina locker room, which wasn't completed yet. The team dressed 
in the visitor's locker room for Monday's practice, but nobody 
seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The building is state-of-the-art,'' said team captain Ron  
Francis. ``I like the way it's structured, with the majority of 
seating being in the lower bowl. That's a neat way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ice surface, a major concern in other arenas across the NHL  
-- especially in the South -- got mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't push it too hard,'' Maurice said. ``We felt if we  
could get 30 minutes out of it without having a flood we would be 
in good shape, and it held up well. We'll try (Tuesday) maybe a 
little harder, but there were very few ruts in it. I was very 
encouraged. The ice is not very far off at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Arturs Irbe had a different perspective.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once it got skated on for a while and we created some snow on  
the top, it crystallized and kind of got a little bit wet and froze 
on the top,'' Irbe said. ``That's what we are dealing with in every 
single arena down South. It wasn't worse than other arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing new to me,'' he added. ``I spent five years in  
San Jose and one year in Dallas, and even last year here. It has 
been my destiny to practice on ice like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the building is closed down for several days, the ice  
should get harder and firmer, Maurice said. However, it's unclear 
how a sellout crowd like the one for Friday's home opener against 
New Jersey will affect the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it becomes better, it's just a bonus,'' Irbe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Center Jeff O'Neill, the first Carolina player to skate on the  
ice, said it felt like Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ice in the South, you wonder about it sometimes,'' O'Neill  
said. ``It seemed really good out there. Everybody was anxious this 
morning, and I wanted to get out there and shoot some pucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irbe got lost taking a shortcut to the new building but said it  
was better than having to make the 160-mile round-trip drive to 
Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a little while for it to sink in,'' general  
manager Jim Rutherford said. ``I hope our team can adjust to the 
building very quickly and know that they're home.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Earnings Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.'s third  
quarter earnings rose 18 percent, excluding restructuring costs and 
legal fees related to a federal fraud investigation, as the 
nation's largest hospital chain benefitted from higher patient 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings from continuing operations were $155 million, or 27  
cents per share, compared to $131 million or 20 cents per share a 
year ago. Results beat Wall Street forecasts by two cents, 
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the one-time costs, net income in the quarter was $138  
million, or 24 cents per share, compared to $146 million, or 22 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues fell 15 percent to $3.9 billion from $4.6 billion. The  
decline reflects the sale or spin-off of about 100 hospitals and 
more than 20 ambulatory surgery centers since September 1998. 
Nashville-based Columbia now operates 214 hospitals and 84 
ambulatory surgery centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring was prompted by a federal investigation into  
allegations the company systematically overcharged government 
health programs. Columbia officials are negotiating with the 
federal government in an attempt to end the 2 1/2-year-old 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Columbia middle managers in Florida were convicted last  
summer of conspiring to defraud and defrauding several government 
health insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Same facility admissions increased a healthy 2 percent in the  
quarter -- the fourth straight quarter of such increases -- and same 
facility revenue was up 5.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia officials said earnings were depressed by lower  
Medicaid fees, increased drug costs and higher bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia shares rose 50 cents to $22.25 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Columbia earned $566  
million, or 95 cents per share, compared to $421 million, or 65 
cents per share a year ago. Revenues fell 11 percent to $12.7 
billion from $14.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Russia on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Russian tanks pushed toward the capital of  
breakaway Chechnya, the Clinton administration admonished Moscow 
that it was on an ``ominous and deplorable'' course. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia evidently is not heeding what Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright described at a news conference today as her loud 
and clear message. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanks and troops moved closer to Grozny, the capital, while  
federal jets and artillery pounded suspected rebel bases around 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright talked last week by telephone with Foreign Minister  
Igor Ivanov and again on Sunday after returning from a trip to 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took on board what I said,'' Albright told reporters at the  
State Department. ``But I can't say that I was particularly 
encouraged by his response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another touchy subject, Albright held out diplomatic  
incentives for Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army if it expels 
suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial in the bombing last 
year of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very important for the Taliban, if they wish to be  
treated with any sense of regularity, that they need to make it 
very clear that he needs to be expelled to a country where he can 
be brought to justice,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another incentive for the Taliban is that the U.N. Security  
Council is considering a resolution to impose sanctions if bin 
Laden is not expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth was due to meet  
later in the day with Abdul Hakim Mujahid, a Taliban 
representative. Michael Sheehan, head of the State Department's 
office of counterterrorism, held a similar meeting Oct. 18 in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Taliban said it was ready for open-ended talks that  
could include bin Laden. ``We are ready to solve all the issues 
with America, including that of Osama bin Laden,'' the Taliban's 
information minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	After Albright's news conference, State Department spokesman  
James P. Rubin cautioned reporters that the talks with Taliban were 
not ``on the verge of a breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another subject, Albright urged Congress to provide the  
administration with considerably more money to conduct U.S. foreign 
operations. She said it was ``crazy and embarrassing'' for the 
United States to have its overseas budget slashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a giveaway program,'' Albright said. ``This is in  
America's interest.''

<HEADLINE> Web Site Auctions Models' Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At what price beauty?  
</P>
<P>
	According to former Playboy filmmaker Ron Harris, the raw  
material could go as high as $150,000. That's the cost of an 
ovarian egg from one of his model-turned-donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, the 66-year-old brains behind the auction Web site  
www.ronsangels.com, began accepting bids Monday to help parents 
create the next generation of attractive people. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a donor you must be beautiful, healthy and between 18-30  
yrs. old,'' the site says. Two faxed pieces of photo identification 
are required, as well as a portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 5 million hits the site received by midday Monday, Harris  
said, there were four or five that included bids for the three 
models featured. At least one, for $42,000, appeared legitimate, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris is not a doctor or scientist. The Malibu resident is a  
longtime fashion photographer who has also produced the 
``Aerobicise'' and ``20 Minute Workout'' videos and directed TV 
specials for Playboy Television. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said the egg auction is an opportunity for parents to  
give their children a head start in a society that worships beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around beautiful women my whole life and I think  
they have power most of us will never understand,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet site contains glamorous photos of three women and  
boasts that the models are in excellent health. No information is 
provided about their medical history, intelligence or education. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ethicists said the egg offer sounded rotten.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is distasteful, but it can't be stopped and it shouldn't be  
stopped,'' said fertility expert Bill Handel. ``If people want to 
spend $150,000 for the eggs of a gorgeous woman who has an IQ of 
68, let them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 million Americans face infertility problems and egg  
donors are often the best chance for them to become parents. 
Federal law forbids the purchase and sale of human organs, but 
sperm and egg transactions are legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a couple advertised that they would pay  
$50,000 for eggs from an athletic student from a top college. Ads 
appeared in student newspapers at schools such as Harvard, 
Princeton and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	The coordinator of that campaign, Darlene Pinkerton of the San  
Diego law firm of Hill &AMP; Pinkerton, said the egg auction was 
``going over the line'' if it wants to help people have more 
beautiful offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris figures his site can sell up to $2 million worth of eggs  
over the next several months, with each model deciding how long the 
bidding for her eggs will go and what price she will accept. His 
take is 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to the Web site is free, but it costs $24.95 to get  
additional information on the models. The site also plans to launch 
a sperm auction, presumably with male models as donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not my intention to suggest that we make a super society  
of only beautiful people,'' an editorial on the site says. ``This 
site simply mirrors our current society, in that beauty always goes 
to the highest bidder.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Safer Sprout Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Crunchy raw sprouts are full of nutrition --  
but too often, they also carry dangerous bacteria that can cause 
food poisoning. To make sprouts safe to eat again, the government 
is ordering farmers to use new growing methods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration warned Americans last summer  
not to eat alfalfa, clover and other types of sprouts after 
confirming that at least 1,300 illnesses in recent years were 
caused by bacteria-laden sprouts. Other research, however, 
estimates that many more people -- up to 20,000 -- may have been 
sickened. 
</P>
<P>
	Even healthy people can become ill from sprouts tainted with  
salmonella or E. coli. But high-risk people -- such as children, the 
elderly and people with weakened immune systems because of cancer, 
AIDS or other conditions -- could contract life-threatening 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA senior science adviser Bob Buchanan reiterated the consumer  
warning Monday but said the government will re-examine its advice 
in a few months to see if the new growing standards, issued Monday, 
have made sprouts safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not recommending the consumption of raw sprouts'' yet,  
Buchanan said. But if the safety standards are followed, ``this 
will greatly decrease any kind of risk associated with the 
product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growers are not doing anything wrong, Buchanan stressed.  
Instead, the very conditions that cause seeds to germinate -- warm 
temperatures, with lots of water and nutrients -- also spur bacteria 
growth. Most outbreaks in sprouts have been traced to seeds laden 
with bacteria that flourish and multiply under the growing 
conditions necessary for sprouts. (When the same seeds are used for 
regular crops grown in the hot sun, the germs die off.) 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA's new standards are simple ones that some sprouts  
growers already follow voluntarily: 
</P>
<P>
	--Farmers should cultivate seed under sanitary conditions,  
including limiting the amount of manure used on crops whose seed 
will be harvested for sprouts and ensuring irrigation water is 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sprouts growers should disinfect all seed with an FDA-approved  
method such as a mild bleach solution to reduce surface bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	--The most critical step: Test the irrigation runoff after  
watering sprouts. If bacteria are present 24-48 hours after the 
seeds germinate, the germs will get in the water. So testing 
leftover water will warn growers if a batch is contaminated before 
the sprouts are sold, Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Test results take about 48 hours, but sprouts typically take  
four days to grow before harvesting. So if growers test on time, 
they will know the results before deciding whether to harvest each 
batch. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA developed the standards in conjunction with food  
scientists at several universities and the International Sprout 
Growers Association. The association did not return a call seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA is giving growers 60 days to implement the standards,  
and then will send out inspectors to ensure they are followed.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Faces Hearing on Norris Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson will have to wait a few more days to  
collect the $8.7 million he made for his aborted fight with Orlin 
Norris. And when he finally gets his check, he could find a few 
dollars missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada boxing regulators will meet Friday to discuss Tyson's  
latest antics in the ring, and decide whether to take any action 
against him for a late blow that prematurely ended his fight with 
Norris after the first round Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson could be fined for his actions, but the Nevada Athletic  
Commission is not expected to take any action to suspend Tyson from 
the ring or change the decision in the fight from a no contest to a 
disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem does not view what happened  
Saturday as serious as Tyson's biting of Evander Holyfield's ears. 
That cost Tyson $3 million and got him banned from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a disqualification it would have been a different  
ball game,'' Ghanem said. ``When he (referee Richard Steele) 
deducted two points, that means the fight could continue. That's 
the big difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's ruling in the ring that the left hook that dropped  
Norris after the bell sounded was not deliberate may help Tyson 
avoid any penalties for the late blow, which ended the fight when 
Norris dislocated his knee on the way down to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is that it was an accidental foul and that  
was the determination that was made,'' said Marc Ratner, the 
commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Nevada law, which was changed in the wake of Tyson's  
biting of Holyfield, a boxer's can be fined his entire purse for an 
infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is not expected to attend Friday's commission meeting,  
which was called in the wake of the ending that caused fans to boo 
both fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said after the fight that he did not hear the bell, even  
though it rang five times as Steele moved in to try and separate 
the fighters in the middle of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said Monday there was no dispute that Tyson hit Norris  
after the bell. But he noted that hitting after the bell is 
relatively common in fights. Felix Trinidad did the same thing to 
Oscar De La Hoya twice in the middle rounds of their welterweight 
title fight last month, and was not penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele took two points from Tyson after Norris went back to his  
corner. But the fight did not resume after Norris said he could not 
continue because of an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI showed his knee had been dislocated, and doctors said  
Norris may need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris said he did not think Tyson hit him deliberately after  
the bell. He said it was loud in the ring and hard to hear the 
bell.

<HEADLINE> Road Runners Refuse To Ban Haider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The leader of Austria's far-right Freedom Party  
will be allowed to run in the New York City Marathon despite 
protests by community leaders Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joerg Haider was approved to wear the number 5777 in the 30th  
annual marathon on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old lawyer, the son of a Nazi party member, is  
against immigration and has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler 
and praised Waffen SS veterans as ``men of character.'' His 
electoral success has alarmed Israel and neighboring countries 
because of his comments praising Hitler's ``decent employment 
policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't discriminate,'' Allan Steinfeld, president of the New  
York Road Runners Club and race director of the New York City 
Marathon. ``We are not going to change the route and we are not 
going to kick him out of the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race starts in Staten Island and winds its way through  
Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx before finishing in Central Park in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Assemblyman Dov Hikind, D-Brooklyn, said, ``His (Haider's) type  
of ugliness does not belong on the streets of Brooklyn, where many 
survivors have taken up residence after the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brooklyn will not stand by and be silent in the face of his  
treachery. He will be confronted and stopped,'' Hikind added. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for Brooklyn's large Hassidic  
community, said, ``In a letter to the New York City Marathon, I 
plead with them to show sensitivity and respect for the 
neighborhood by canceling Mr. Haider's application.''

<HEADLINE> DreamWorks, Imagine Form New Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard and their  
big-screen associates are taking their talents to the computer 
screen with an online entertainment company to produce short videos 
for the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The directors said Monday they are teaming up to form POP.com,  
which will broadcast live-action, animation and other short 
features over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	POP.com is a partnership between DreamWorks SKG, the studio  
founded by Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, and 
Imagine Entertainment, a production company started by Howard and 
producer Brian Grazer. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort is being financed by Vulcan Ventures Inc., the  
investment arm of billionaire Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder 
who owns a stake in DreamWorks. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduled to debut next spring, POP.com's Web site will feature  
short video segments, including some live Internet broadcasts, 
mostly ranging from one to six minutes long. The material will 
focus heavily on comedy, though other genres will be included, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	POP.com will solicit original programming from viewers, with the  
best of that material being aired on the Web site. Producers of the 
most popular outside submissions will be offered development 
contracts at DreamWorks and Imagine, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet offers unlimited potential as a new entertainment  
arena,'' Spielberg, whose movies include ``Saving Private Ryan'' 
and ``Schindler's List,'' said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sounds like fun to me,'' said Howard, whose films include  
``Apollo 13'' and ``Splash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While much of what we have learned throughout our careers will  
apply, I am also certain that new and unusual aesthetic values will 
quickly evolve, shaped by the medium itself, the public and the 
creative collaborations which this company will encourage,'' Howard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the rush of new entertainment Web sites, the celebrity and  
financial power of its founders may help POP.com find an audience. 
The company still will have to deliver quality entertainment in a 
medium its founders do not have much experience in, said Mark 
Hardie, senior analyst for Forrester Research, an Internet research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Howard and Spielberg shoot incredibly well for the big screen,  
but the Web requires shooting with different cameras and they have 
to limit themselves to the limitations of the technology,'' Hardie 
said. ``They've got to do the same hard work as the kids down the 
road with $20,000 in their pocket and a Sony camcorder. They still 
have to tell great stories.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Gov. Apologizes for Blackface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gov. Mel Carnahan apologized Monday  
for appearing in blackface at a minstrel show 39 years ago, and 
lashed out at Republicans for unearthing a 1960 photo of the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've grown,'' said Carnahan, a Democrat who is  
challenging Republican Sen. John Ashcroft for his Senate seat in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly regret my participation in this kind of theater,  
and I sincerely and readily apologize for my insensitivity of 39 
years ago,'' the 65-year-old governor added. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he should be judged on his record, including  
legislative sponsorship of a state civil rights law in 1965 and the 
appointment of the first black Missouri Supreme Court judge in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That judge, Ronnie White, was rejected for a federal judgeship  
on Oct. 5 after Ashcroft told the Senate that White was soft on the 
death penalty and ``pro-criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan accused Ashcroft, stung by allegations of racism for  
his role in defeating White's nomination, of responsibility for 
circulating the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Ashcroft is counting on Missourians to be unable to  
see any difference between the insensitivity captured in this 
photograph four decades ago and the polarizing acts he committed on 
the Senate floor just days ago,'' Carnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton had no comment about Carnahan's  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, who was elected governor in 1992 with substantial  
black support, said Monday that he had called black leaders to 
apologize. He would not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the Missouri GOP, John Hancock, said  
research turned up the photo in the Rolla Daily News, the 
governor's hometown paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock denied having any hand in distributing the photo. A  
glossy print of the photograph and a copy of the clipping dated 
Oct. 12, 1960, were provided to The Associated Press Sunday by a 
Republican source on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo shows Carnahan, then 26; his older brother, Bob; and  
two other men performing as a barbershop quartet at a Kiwanis Club 
fund-raiser. The menwore tuxedos and blackface makeup with 
exaggerated white circles around their eyes and mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he was ``uncomfortable'' about wearing blackface  
at the time, but was the newest member of the group and didn't 
challenge the costume. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back, that's what I wished I'd done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said the minstrel shows were a longtime tradition in  
Rolla, but he never again wore blackface after the 1960s show and 
his brother, Bob, moved to end the blackface performances after 
that show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said we ought not to be doing that sort of thing,'' Bob  
Carnahan, 73, said in telephone interview Monday. ``Obviously it 
was racial, and I told the club I couldn't participate in the 
minstrel show anymore and didn't think our quartet should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missourians interviewed at St. Louis Union Station said they  
weren't perturbed by the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so old,'' said Scott Jackson, 20, who is white.  
</P>
<P>
	Latascha Bond, 18, who is black, plans to vote for the first  
time next year and said she wasn't dissuaded from casting her 
Senate ballot for Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did this in 1960,'' she said. ``That doesn't mean he'll do  
it in 1999.''

<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan  
left the Republican Party today to run for the Reform Party 
presidential nomination, telling supporters the nation's two-party 
system has no home for them. Buchanan, who ran for the GOP 
presidential nomination in 1992 and 1996, railed against ``big 
money'' and the political party establishment, and promised to 
shake up the 2000 race. But he is not assured of winning the Reform 
Party nod and would be a longshot in the general election.

sought to tighten laws to quash it and other quasi-religious 
organizations. The government's news agency said an investigation 
by China's national police force found that Falun Gong members had 
leaked or disseminated 59 classified official documents, 20 of 
which bore the highest security classification. The report is part 
of an intensifying campaign against leading Falun Gong members. 
Scholars say authorities were having trouble finding convincing

Laotian-Americans and members of the Hmong ethnic group. All seven 
are from the Detroit area, police said. The girls disappeared from 
Wisconsin in September. When they were found days later and 
hundreds of miles away in Detroit, they said they had been 
repeatedly raped by as many as 20 men. The five defendants charged

<HEADLINE> Another Faces Dragging Death Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began today for the trial of  
the last of three white men charged with killing a black man who 
was chained and dragged to his death behind a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Allen Berry, 24, is charged in the slaying of James Byrd  
Jr. Berry's roommates, John William King and Lawrence Russell 
Brewer, were convicted of Byrd's murder and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors will be asked to decide which is the real Berry -- a  
hometown boy who was in the wrong place with the wrong people, or a 
thrill-seeking killer who got caught up in a frenzy of racist rage. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men -- suspected of having ties to the Ku Klux Klan --  
were accused of chaining Byrd, 49, to the bumper of Berry's pickup 
truck and dragging him over three miles of bumpy country road on 
June 7, 1998. Byrd's head, neck and right arm were shorn off. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 170 potential jurors crammed into Judge Joe Bob Golden's  
court today. Attorneys must choose 12 jurors and two alternates. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, whose family roots are three generations deep in Jasper,  
hoped a jury of his peers would be more sympathetic than they were 
to his co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether he is a good person at all, but I know he  
is better than those other two. He is not a racist like the 
others,'' said Betty Hamilton, a retiree who lives in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	That will make proving a racist motive difficult, prosecutors  
acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Motive in this case is either one of two things: he lived with  
these Klansmen and developed their way of thinking, or he's a 
thrill-seeker who got caught up in the killing like he was in a 
pack of dogs,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's co-defendants were easy to paint as racist killers. Both  
were ex-convicts and adorned with white-supremacist tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's tattoos, including a Playboy bunny and a four-leaf  
clover, are less threatening and there are no racist screeds to 
show the jury. Gray said he is unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be less evidence on motive in this case. The crime  
scene facts, maybe a notch or two more on this one,'' Gray said. 
``It's actually easier to try this case. This guy admits he's at 
the crime scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is DNA evidence showing Byrd's blood was on Berry's shoes,  
Gray said. Not only that, it was Berry's truck that dragged Byrd to 
his death, and the chain hooked to Byrd's ankles and the bumper was 
Berry's, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, in an interview with ``60 Minutes II,'' said he was the  
one driving when he, King and Brewer stopped to pick up Byrd, who 
was staggering home drunk from a party. He said he was unable to 
stop King and Brewer as they beat Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, has said that is  
the story Berry has told from the beginning. Hawthorn could not be 
reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said Berry's story has changed several times since he first  
began cooperating with investigators after his arrest. Berry gave 
several statements, none of which has ever been made public, and 
Gray said they differ from the story he told on television. He 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of capital murder, Berry will either be sentenced  
to death or given 40 years in prison without chance of parole. 
Berry turned down an earlier plea bargain for a life sentence, 
Hawthorn has said.

<P>
	Five hundred jurors were initially called up, and 150 to 200  
were expected to appear in state District Judge Joe Bob Golden's 
court today. Attorneys must cull a panel of 14 from the group -- 12 
jurors and two alternates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether he is a good person at all, but I know he  
is better than those other two. He is not a racist like the 
others,'' said Betty Hamilton, a retiree who lives in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	That will make proving a racist motive difficult, prosecutors  
acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Motive in this case is either one of two things: he lived with  
these Klansmen and developed their way of thinking, or he's a 
thrill-seeker who got caught up in the killing like he was in a 
pack of dogs,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's co-defendants were easy to paint as racist killers. Both  
were ex-convicts and adorned with white-supremacist tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's tattoos, including a Playboy bunny and a four-leaf  
clover, are less threatening and there are no racist screeds to 
show the jury. Gray said he is unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be less evidence on motive in this case. The crime  
scene facts, maybe a notch or two more on this one,'' Gray said. 
``It's actually easier to try this case. This guy admits he's at 
the crime scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is DNA evidence showing Byrd's blood was on Berry's shoes,  
Gray said. Not only that, it was Berry's truck that dragged Byrd to 
his death, and the chain hooked to Byrd's ankles and the bumper was 
Berry's, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, in an interview with ``60 Minutes II,'' said he was the  
one driving when he, King and Brewer stopped to pick up Byrd, who 
was staggering home drunk from a party. He said he was unable to 
stop King and Brewer as they beat Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, has said that is  
the story Berry has told from the beginning. Hawthorn could not be 
reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said Berry's story has changed several times since he first  
began cooperating with investigators after his arrest. Berry gave 
several statements, none of which has ever been made public, and 
Gray said they differ from the story he told on television. He 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of capital murder, Berry will either be sentenced  
to death or given 40 years in prison without chance of parole. 
Berry turned down an earlier plea bargain for a life sentence, 
Hawthorn has said.

<HEADLINE> Hometown Mourns Loss of Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Payne Stewart was not only the hometown  
boy who made good, he was ``simply the finest athlete that 
Springfield ever produced,'' said one family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was born 42 years ago on South Link Street, an  
appropriately named street for a golf legend in the making. He did 
most of his growing up at the nearby Hickory Hills Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played basketball and football in school and was great at  
everything he attempted to do,'' said attorney Joe Greene, a close 
friend of the Stewart family. ``When he got out on the links, it 
was more like magic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was among at least five people killed Monday when a  
LearJet he was aboard flew uncontrolled for hours and crashed in 
South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his mother, Bee, of Springfield; wife Tracey,  
whom he met while playing in Australia early in his career, and his 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time he was 3 years old I would take him to the golf  
course with me because I couldn't find a baby sitter,'' Bee Stewart 
said when reached by phone. ``It was in his blood from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf was his life, but it wasn't his whole life. His first  
love was his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other residents of this Ozark town reacted as if they had lost  
their own son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just impossible to believe, my kids are coming home from  
school in a little while and will be devastated,'' said Janis 
Auner, who said her children participated in several golf clinics 
held by Stewart for local children. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just an awesome person. He loved children and he spent  
so much time giving back to this town,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auner's husband, Tom, recalled Stewart's unique attire. While  
his trademark knickers came after Springfield, Stewart was never 
short on supply of outrageous shirts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always tried to pick out the wildest golf shirt with lots  
of floral prints. Those were great shirts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart visited Springfield this summer shortly after he won the  
U.S. Open for the second time. As he often did, he signed 
autographs and met with old friends. This time, he was flocked by 
some 500 adoring fans at the Hickory Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never turned a child down for an autograph. That man had  
style,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart lent a club from his 1999 U.S. Open to Hickory Hills to  
display in a ``Club of Champions'' exhibit alongside former Masters 
champions Horton Smith and Herman Keiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also took time to sign autographs at the Bill and Payne  
Stewart Golf Course, a public course named in honor of Stewart and 
his father in 1995 for ``everything he has done for the community 
and the sport of golf,'' said a receptionist at the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's newfound faith in God also meant a lot to the people  
of this Bible-Belt town. He said he was drawn to church through his 
children, 13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt H'Doubler attended Greenwood Laboratory School -- a  
semiprivate school -- with Stewart nearly 35 years ago. He never had 
any doubt Stewart would grow up to be such a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge tragedy. What can I say? My own son looked up  
to him as a hero,'' H'Doubler said. ``Golf has lost one of its 
better players and his family has lost a great man.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Russia on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Russian tanks pushed toward the capital of  
breakaway Chechnya, the Clinton administration admonished Moscow 
that it was on an ``ominous and deplorable'' course. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia evidently is not heeding what Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright described at a news conference today as her loud 
and clear message. 
</P>
<P>
	The tanks and troops moved closer to Grozny, the capital, while  
federal jets and artillery pounded suspected rebel bases around 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright talked last week by telephone with Foreign Minister  
Igor Ivanov and again on Sunday after returning from a trip to 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took on board what I said,'' Albright told reporters at the  
State Department. ``But I can't say that I was particularly 
encouraged by his response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another touchy subject, Albright held out diplomatic  
incentives for Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army if it expels 
suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial in the bombing last 
year of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very important for the Taliban, if they wish to be  
treated with any sense of regularity, that they need to make it 
very clear that he needs to be expelled to a country where he can 
be brought to justice,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another incentive for the Taliban is that the U.N. Security  
Council is considering a resolution to impose sanctions if bin 
Laden is not expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth was due to meet  
later in the day with Abdul Hakim Mujahid, a Taliban 
representative. Michael Sheehan, head of the State Department's 
office of counterterrorism, held a similar meeting Oct. 18 in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Taliban said it was ready for open-ended talks that  
could include bin Laden. ``We are ready to solve all the issues 
with America, including that of Osama bin Laden,'' the Taliban's 
information minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	After Albright's news conference, State Department spokesman  
James P. Rubin cautioned reporters that the talks with Taliban were 
not ``on the verge of a breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another subject, Albright urged Congress to provide the  
administration with considerably more money to conduct U.S. foreign 
operations. She said it was ``crazy and embarrassing'' for the 
United States to have its overseas budget slashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a giveaway program,'' Albright said. ``This is in  
America's interest.''

<HEADLINE> Gold Sinks Below $300 an Ounce  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures sank below $300 an ounce Monday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, raising questions about the strength of a 
sizzling autumn rally that turned the fading metal into a hot 
commodity once again. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, coffee prices leaped 7 percent on heightened  
fears a Brazilian dry spell will harm next year's crop, and 
soybeans rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	After bottoming out at a 20-year low of $255 over the summer,  
gold became precious again last month when the British Treasury put 
25 tons on the market and fetched higher-than-expected prices, 
starting a stampede of investors into the metal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold got a further lift in late September, when 15 European  
central banks announced that they would limit their combined sales 
of bullion for a total of five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold shot over $300 per troy ounce on Sept. 28 and soared as  
high as $339 on Oct. 5. But it has been spiraling downward since, 
with analysts blaming either the recent decline of U.S. stocks and 
the dollar or gold's particular supply-and-demand situation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, gold for December delivery slipped $2.80 to close at  
$300.50 an ounce after hitting a three-week low of $299. The spot 
price also fell $2.80 and closed at $299. 
</P>
<P>
	How low will it go?  
</P>
<P>
	Several analysts predicted it would fall to $295 this week as  
traders seek out a lower price to cover their short positions -- 
bets that gold prices would fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a correction mode right now following the huge runup  
we had,'' said Joe Foster, portfolio manager of the Van Eck gold 
funds in New York. ``This is not totally unexpected to see us go 
into a fairly steep correction when you consider how quickly it ran 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the longer-term outlook is bright.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fundamentally, nothing has changed,'' said Matthew Ford,  
metals analyst for U.S. Global Investors Inc. in San Antonio. ``I 
think traders are just sitting on their hands temporarily as 
traders and the mining companies themselves try to cover their 
shorts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other reasons for the decline, analysts said, include the drop  
in lease prices -- making it cheaper to borrow gold and sell to the 
futures market -- and word from Kuwait that it was willing to lend 
its gold to put on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	On New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange,  
lighter-than-anticipated weekend rains in drought-plagued Brazil 
sent coffee surging again. 
</P>
<P>
	Only scattered rain is forecast for the days ahead, renewing  
concerns of crop damage. 
</P>
<P>
	December coffee settled up 6.85 cents at 99.75 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans' surge on the Chicago Board of Trade reversed the  
commodity's direction from a 30-cent slide over last three days 
last week, with the market apparently having bottomed out after 
hitting seven-week lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were limited, however, by beneficial weather in the  
Midwest that has helped push the U.S. harvest toward completion. 
</P>
<P>
	November soybeans rose 6 cents to $4.78 3/4 a bushel, while grains  
also benefited in part from soybeans' increase. December wheat rose 
4 cents to $2.62 a bushel; December corn rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.01 3/4 a 
bushel; December oats rose 1 1/2 cents to $1.10 1/2 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Controversy Hits Tyson Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The bell rang five times.  
</P>
<P>
	Once is enough to end most rounds in boxing. But when a crowd is  
still roaring and two fighters are still tangled up the way Orlin 
Norris and Mike Tyson were at the end of Round 1, they get the 
benefit of the doubt. The place is loud, the adrenaline is flowing 
and the custom is to keep ringing the bell. 
</P>
<P>
	And so it went with this one. Once, twice ... five times in all  
-- and even then, there was a pause before the punch finally flew. 
Remember that when the Nevada State Athletic Commission gets around 
to deciding whether to let Tyson collect the $8.7 million he was 
promised for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	It's as sure a measure as any of how slow Tyson is these days,  
how far the baddest man on the planet has come back to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners are scheduled to look at a videotape of the  
fight today, hold a hearing at the end of the week and then decide 
whether to take any further action. Tyson could lose both the 
decision and his purse if the no-contest is changed to a 
disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	For that to happen, the commissioners would have to be convinced  
the late punch was flagrant. And for it to happen in Las Vegas, 
Tyson would have to be caught on videotape slipping a horseshoe 
inside his boxing glove before banging it off the side of Norris' 
head -- after ignoring repeated warnings from security guards inside 
the building to extinguish his cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	That, anyway, was the impression left by Marc Ratner, the  
commission's executive secretary. He made it sound as if the 
group's first order of business was to check the flight schedules 
from Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the punch was launched,'' Ratner said, ``is very  
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, that may be the least important detail in the whole  
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	What Saturday night proved is that Tyson is a shot fighter. What  
little credibility he had between the ropes is gone. He tried to 
break the arms of the last guy he fought, Francois Botha, and said 
just a few weeks ago that he would bite somebody again if a fight 
demanded it, but you know what? 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson isn't likely to hurt anybody again -- not inside a ring,  
anyway. Between legal troubles and self-inflicted ones, he has now 
fought only eight times in the last eight years -- just twice in the 
last 28 months -- and is no longer unpredictable so much as 
uninteresting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to fight anymore,'' Tyson said afterward. ``I'm  
tired of this crap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is not the only one.  
</P>
<P>
	All of a sudden, there is more supply than demand. That's what  
makes this a good time to disappear. Unlike Tyson's past fiascoes, 
this was as close to a victimless crime as boxing gets. Nobody will 
be screaming for his money back. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the latest accounting, after being cleaned out by  
Don King and wrung out by the Internal Revenue Service, Tyson is 
$20 million in debt. He desperately needs the $8.7 million and if 
for no other reason than his long, though not-always distinguished 
service, he should be allowed to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Norris, whose bum knee was confirmed to be just that  
Sunday after an MRI. He was in line for an $800,000 payday, but 
will be lucky to get out of town with a quarter of that. The 
commissioners said they won't tinker with Norris' share of the 
purse, but not so the IRS, or his manager, or even British promoter 
Frank Warren, who managed to get a sizable chunk frozen by filing a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no pay-per-view audience this time, and as a result  
nobody was howling for refunds. The MGM Grand Garden -- the same 
arena where he was disqualified for trying to make a snack out of 
Evander Holyfield -- was barely three-quarters full. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some howling by the few people who didn't get comped  
by the casinos and actually shelled out between $100 and $1,500 to 
see the fight in person. But so what? There aren't a half-dozen 
spots in Las Vegas where you actually enter a room without the 
expectation of leaving it a little bit lighter.

<HEADLINE> Berle, Caesar Honored by NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lights! Cameras! And action for Milton Berle and  
Sid Caesar as they were honored Monday as the first inductees in 
NBC's walk of fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The 91-year-old Uncle Miltie told a crowd: ``I think it was  
1951, I signed a lifetime contract with NBC. It expired 20 years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ba-dum-bum.  
</P>
<P>
	Berle dominated television in the 1950s with his ``Texaco Star  
Theater'' and ``The Milton Berle Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time the public will be able to step on  
Berle,'' he joked as his gold plaque was unveiled inside NBC 
Experience, the network's Manhattan store. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Caesar, a seven-time Emmy winner and the comic  
brains behind ``Your Show of Shows,'' played it straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderful, wonderful business, a terribly important  
business,'' he said. ``It sets the culture for the United States. 
It sets the culture for the world, television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC plans to add several new names each year.

<HEADLINE> Haiku Omitted From WWII Monument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A poem on the fate of Japanese-Americans  
interned during World War II will not appear on the memorial to 
them and Japanese-American veterans, a representative of the 
memorial's board of directors said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The verse reads:  
</P>
<P>
	``O, America  
</P>
<P>
	``Imperfect, stumbling, striving  
</P>
<P>
	``Lessons from the past.''  
</P>
<P>
	The poem, a haiku -- a 17-syllable Japanese verse form -- had been  
criticized as hard to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry Tsutsumida, executive director of the memorial's board,  
said the inscription will not be included because it had not been 
approved by the U.S. Fine Arts Commission. The board on Saturday 
reaffirmed that the memorial will include another inscription that 
had also been criticized. That ``Japanese-American creed'' was 
written the year before the Japanese attack on the U.S. fleet at 
Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud that I am an American of Japanese ancestry,'' the  
creed says. ``I believe in her institutions, ideals and traditions. 
I glory in her heritage; I boast of her history; I trust in her 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other inscriptions to be included on the monument are critical  
of the internment of more than 115,000 Japanese-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	At the groundbreaking for the memorial on Friday, President  
Clinton sent a message calling the internments of 
Japanese-Americans and others a ``sad chapter'' in American 
history.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mostly Down; Dow Off 120 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower today as reviving  
fears of rising interest rates distracted investors from the latest 
stream of good news about corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 120.32 at 10,349.93, having edged back from a loss 
of as much as 155 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators finished with much more modest losses.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 8.02 to 1,293.63, and the Nasdaq  
composite index fell 0.58 to 2,815.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,850 down, 1,201 up and 503 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 765.63 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
951.92 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.93 to 417.76.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose as  
high as 6.40 percent from 6.34 percent late Friday. Analysts said 
bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from yields, were 
hurt by a European Central Bank official's suggestion that the 
European economy is solid, but in danger of succumbing to rising 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning rang familiar with U.S. investors, who fear the  
Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to cool the robust 
growth of the U.S. economy. Yields on bonds, which are highly 
sensitive to inflation, have reached their highest levels since 
Oct. 1997, drawing some investors away from stocks in favor of the 
fixed returns available on bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds are providing tough competition for returns on  
equities,'' said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First 
Advisors in New York. ``That's especially true in a nervous, 
insecure market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of rising rates and higher inflation have kept stocks  
off-balance for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead, equity markets need a recovery, or a least a  
stabilization in the bond market'' before stocks can make another 
run at the record levels reached this summer, said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, several regional Fed officials including chairman  
Alan Greenspan will be on the road, delivering speeches that are 
sure to draw heavy scrutiny as investors seek guidance on the 
central bank's sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate earnings have provided the only real distraction from  
the interest rate watch, but a long list of profit reports today 
provided only a modest spark to trading. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T rose after reporting earnings that beat expectations by a  
penny even though revenue growth amid intense price competition for 
long-distance customers. Investors applauded growth in the 
company's wireless communications business, and a strong start for 
AT&AMP;T's 7-cents per minute long-distance program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's oil companies both fell, however, despite profit  
reports that beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron fell after reporting earnings of $1.07 per share,  
excluding one-time charges. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial had predicted $1.01 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon also fell. The company earned 61 cents a share, above  
estimates of 59 cents per share, but profit margins fell. Analysts 
also suggested that investors had hoped to see stronger profit 
growth given a rise in oil prices in recent months. 
</P>

	Financial stocks were mostly lower today, following a major leap

	Those shares were also hurt by the rising bond yields and the  
fear of higher interest rates. Rising interest rates can cut into

<HEADLINE> Canadiens' Corson Back on Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Still pale and five pounds underweight from a  
flare-up of ulcerous colitis, Shayne Corson was back skating with 
the Montreal Canadiens on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The left wing is not sure when he'll be able to play again,  
although it could be soon. But for now he's happy to be on his 
feet, digesting food and feeling strength come back to his body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a lot of adrenaline out there on the ice,'' said  
Corson, who missed nine games with the illness. ``I spent a lot of 
time at home, resting and tearing my hair out watching the guys 
play on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corson was first diagnosed with the disease when he was 15 and  
playing midget hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been flare-ups before in his 15-year NHL career, but  
the latest ``was a little more serious,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In ulcerous colitis, a hereditary disease, victims are unable to  
keep food in their bodies, leaving them drained of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have no energy and everything you eat goes right through  
you,'' he said. ``None of the nutrients in the food gets to you, so 
you're tired all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he first felt the latest bout coming on during the  
summer, and again during training camp, but played through it while 
doctors attempted to determine how serious it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Corson played in Montreal's season-opening loss to Toronto on  
Oct. 2 and accompanied the team on a trip to Edmonton, but had to 
fly home before the game when he began passing blood. 
</P>
<P>
	He was relieved to find it could be treated with medication. If  
his colon and large intestine were inflamed, he might have had to 
have them taken out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadiens are 3-7, partly due to several veterans out with  
injury or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Craig Rivet, who broke a cheekbone during a fight  
with Calgary's Derek Morris three games into the season, said he'll 
likely return, on schedule, for a Nov. 3 game in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been hit a lot harder than that,'' Rivet said of the  
fight. ``The punch didn't faze me. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when a guy has his hand taped like it's a cast, it doesn't  
take much. It's unfortunate, but that's the game. You have to take 
those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Jeff Hackett, who had his nagging back tested in a  
3-2 loss in Toronto on Saturday night, said he plans to play 
Wednesday night against Chicago.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Tops 3Q Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Third-quarter profits stumbled at AT&AMP;T Corp.,  
but the results topped most Wall Street forecasts, helping to 
overshadow reports of snags in the company's plans to provide 
telephone and Internet service via cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said Monday its core operations earned $1.75 billion, or 54  
cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, including the 
Tele-Communications Inc. cable television business and the IBM 
network and online services business, both acquired earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures were 4.5 percent lower than AT&AMP;T's operating  
profit of $1.84 billion, or 68 cents a share, in the same period 
last year, but slightly better than most projections, according to 
a survey of industry analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T shares gained 3 percent, rising $1.68 3/4 to $44.68 3/4 amid a  
steep slide on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in operating profits reflects the heavy expenses  
involved in absorbing a huge company like TCI, but excludes the 
losses from AT&AMP;T's ownership interests in the cable TV company 
Cablevision and the cable-Internet service ExciteAtHome, both 
acquired along with TCI. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all those factors, AT&AMP;T had a net profit of $1.63  
billion or 50 cents a share in the just-ended quarter, down from 
$2.12 billion or 78 cents a share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues totaled $16.31 billion, an increase of  
5.6 percent compared with the $15.44 billion that all of AT&AMP;T's 
businesses, including the recently-acquired ones, would have 
generated as a single company a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The report provided a forum for AT&AMP;T officials to address market  
and media speculation about possible missteps and wrinkles in the 
handling of various issues facing the company's bid to create a 
national telephone network using the cable TV wires reaching into 
most U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent obstacles have been negotiations to sell its  
new cable-telephone service on cable systems AT&AMP;T doesn't own, as 
well as demands by Internet service providers like America Online 
who want access to AT&AMP;T's cable systems to offer high-speed Web 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Monday, GTE Corp. filed a suit against AT&AMP;T, alleging  
monopolistic practices by the nation's largest cable operator in 
charging consumers extra to buy high-speed Internet access from 
companies other than ExciteAtHome. 
</P>
<P>
	During a conference call with analysts after the profit report --  
but before the GTE suit was announced -- AT&AMP;T chief executive C. 
Michael Armstrong rejected suggestions in The Wall Street Journal 
on Monday that the company has angered cable operators Time Warner 
and Cablevision Systems on both scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to refute that right out,'' Armstrong said, asserting  
that AT&AMP;T had been unable to make real progress with the Time 
Warner talks until last week, when the company received guidance 
from federal regulators regarding AT&AMP;T's proposed acquisition of 
MediaOne, a cable company that owns a quarter of Time Warner's 
cable operation. Relations also remain positive with Cablevision, 
which AT&AMP;T owns a third of through the TCI acquisition, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a talk with Chuck Dolan the other day and I don't know  
of any problems, although the newspapers seem to,'' Armstrong said, 
referring to Cablevision's founder and top executive, Charles 
Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T reported continued progress in the costly  
process of upgrading its cable systems for two-way telephone and 
Internet communications, as well as pilot programs and marketing 
efforts for the new services. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it now has 113,600 subscribers to the ExciteAtHome  
Internet access service and expects to have 175,000 by the new year 
and 275,000 by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it has begun its seventh pilot program for  
local telephone service over cable TV lines with the addition of 
Salt Lake City. So far, there are 2,100 paying phone subscribers in 
the markets where AT&AMP;T has begun charging, mostly in Fremont, 
Calif. Those customers have been averaging $30 in charges on their 
monthly bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless revenues posted the healthiest increase again among  
AT&AMP;T's various operations, rising more than 40 percent for the 
third straight quarter compared with year-earlier levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, consumer services revenues fell 4.7 percent to  
$5.61 billion, squeezed by the price war being waged in the 
long-distance calling market. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said its new 7-cents per minute offer, a counterattack to  
to new long-distance plans launched by Sprint and MCI WorldCom, 
signed up 2 million customers in the first five weeks -- about 30 
percent switching from other long-distance companies and 70 percent 
coming from other AT&AMP;T plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That represents the fastest start in any program that anyone  
around here can remember,'' John Zeglis, the head of AT&AMP;T's 
consumer operations, said in a conference call with analysts after 
Monday's earnings report.

<HEADLINE> Braves Left With Cone-Headache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- David Cone knew this might have been goodbye.  
</P>
<P>
	Turns out, the Atlanta Braves could be saying so long, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Cone befuddled the Braves on Sunday night, allowing one hit in  
seven shutout innings as the Yankees beat Atlanta 7-2 for a 2-0 
World Series lead. And then he admitted this could have been his 
final start in pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it's gone through my mind,'' he said. ``It's a  
possibility because the Yankees have some tough decisions to make, 
I put it out of my mind for now. All that matters is right here and 
right now. It's pretty unpredictable when you play for the 
Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone is the team's voice. Probably its heart, too. Whenever  
there's turmoil or trouble, he is the first one whose opinion is 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have trouble visualizing a clubhouse without David Cone,''  
Yankees manager Joe Torre said before the game. ``He means so much 
to this ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone then went out on a 49-degree night -- the type of cold  
that's supposed to harm his game -- and pitched the best of his 18 
postseason starts. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for Greg Myers' single up the middle on a 1-1 pitch  
leading off the fifth, he would have been in position to join Don 
Larsen as the only pitchers to throw postseason no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't really around the plate a lot,'' Myers said. ``He'll  
throw you anything, anytime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept the Braves off balance, pitching with no less than a  
three-run lead. After Atlanta got a runner on third in the first 
due to his throwing error, Cone retired Brian Jordan on a flyout to 
the left-field warning track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I caught a break with Jordan's ball,'' Cone said.  
``That's easily a home run on a warmer day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta didn't get another runner in scoring position until the  
seventh, when he threw a called third strike past Andruw Jones with 
runners at the corners and two outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``David kept the ball down really good tonight,'' Braves manager  
Bobby Cox said. ``He had breaking stuff. He wasn't overpowering at 
all. He didn't throw that hard, but his ball was sinking like 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He walked five and threw just 60 of 109 pitches for strikes. But  
it will be remembered as much as his start in Game 3 of the 1996 
World Series. The Yankees were down 0-2 after losing the first two 
games at home, and Cone allowed one run and four hits in six 
innings as New York beat the Braves 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walks the tightrope every once in a while,'' Torre said.  
``Why doesn't he just start out of the stretch? It looked like he 
had better rhythm out of the stretch than winding up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the big-game wins, Cone's Yankees career remains year to  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 20-7 last season, Cone didn't know whether he'd  
re-sign with the Yankees until Nov. 11, when they gave him an $8 
million, one-year deal that included $1.7 million in performance 
bonuses he wound up earning. 
</P>
<P>
	He understands the concern. He had an aneurysm near his right  
armpit in 1996 and shoulder surgery in 1997. While he went 9-4 with 
a 2.86 ERA in the first half of this season, he slumped to 3-5 with 
a 4.28 ERA in the second half, causing Torre to give him extra 
rest, thinking the 36-year-old's right arm was tired. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extra rest,'' Cone said, ``has really helped me in terms  
of putting some life back into my arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is Cone who usually puts life into the Yankees. They went  
20-11 during his starts. Now, if he only would stop worrying about 
his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things,'' Torre said, ``have a way of working themselves  
out.''

<HEADLINE> Barkley Calling it Quits -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Charles Barkley would like to be a movie  
star, make nine figures a year with his new medical supply company, 
buy an NBA team -- and a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, he'd like to become Alabama's governor and beat Michael  
Jordan in golf someday -- not necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have choices,'' Barkley said. ``I don't really  
want to work this hard after I retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, 36, announced that this would be his final NBA season  
at a halftime ceremony during the Houston Rockets' 98-96 exhibition 
victory over the Detroit Pistons on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley chose this venue to make his announcement because it's a  
short drive from his hometown of Leeds. With his trademark flare, 
he also took the opportunity to give away $3 million of his 
hard-earned money, about a third of his salary this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley announced he would give $1 million each to alma maters  
Leeds High School and Auburn University and to a program for 
inner-city Birmingham youth called Cornerstone Schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think God gave me this gift so I could play basketball  
and have $50 million in the bank and live happily ever after,'' 
Barkley said. ``I don't think that's what my life is for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined at center court by his mother, Charcey Glenn, and  
grandmother, Johnnie Mae Mickens, who raised him together. He also 
showed he isn't done with basketball, notching 13 points, nine 
rebounds and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for me to do something else,'' said Barkley, who  
consulted such luminaries as Jordan, golfer Tiger Woods and Hall of 
Famer Julius Erving about his decision. ``It's time for me to have 
some fun now. I don't think my life could get any better. But it's 
time to do something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-time All-Star has gained fame for his game -- he was named  
one of the NBA's 50 best all-time players in 1997 -- and infamy for 
his mouth. Barkley has been one of the league's most colorful 
players -- on and off the court, known for everything from 
denouncing athletes as role models to once throwing a man through a 
barroom window. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been some negative things that have happened that  
people are going to accentuate,'' Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich 
said. ``He's a really good player with a great heart. I love the 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be missed,'' added Pistons guard Grant Hill.  
``There's not going to be another Charles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Pistons guard Jerry Stackhouse: ``He was one of my  
favorite players. Still is. He hasn't won a championship, and 
that's one thing that's going to follow him around. But he still 
put up the numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley is one of only three players in NBA history with more  
than 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists. The others 
are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	He ranks 13th in career scoring (23,468) and is fourth among  
active players. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley led the Olympic Dream Team in scoring in 1992 and `96.  
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't lost his skills either, averaging 16.7 points and 12.4  
rebounds last year. Only Sacramento's Chris Webber averaged more 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley's coach at Auburn, Sonny Smith, was on hand.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was not one of those flirtations where he comes off the  
cuff and says something,'' said Smith, adding that Barkley talked 
about possibly retiring over the summer. ``This is something he's 
planned out, how he wants to go out and when he's going out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Sir Charles was thinking about his future plans  
-- as long as they don't require him to work more than a few hours a 
day. Some things on his to-do list: 
</P>
<P>
	--Running an NBA franchise, either as general manager or owner.  
``If I can get one for $200 million, I'll probably do it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Go Hollywood. Barkley, who's had parts in such movies as  
``Space Jam,'' ``He's Got Game'' and ``Hot Shots,'' said he's 
considered acting as more than an avocation over the past couple of 
years. But no sit coms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to work 12-13 hours a day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	--Become Alabama's governor. He's talked about it for years and  
did again Sunday -- and appeared extremely serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people here don't really have any pride and  
self-esteem,'' Barkley said. ``I think you've always got to want to 
excel, want to do better. There's more to life than going to high 
school and get married. My goal is more to advance people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Improve his golf game. After all, it's bad enough losing to  
Michael Jordan ON the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael's been kicking my butt for the last 5-6 years,''  
Barkley said. ``That's my only real goal in golf is to beat him, 
because he's the world's worst winner.''

<HEADLINE> Buccaneer's Zeier New Starting QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Dungy wants no part of a musical  
quarterback system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buccaneers coach benched Trent Dilfer as Tampa Bay's starter  
Monday and chose Eric Zeier as the ``long term'' replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came a day after the Buccaneers (3-3) sputtered  
offensively in a 6-3 victory over the Chicago Bears. However, 
Dilfer has been under pressure to increase his production since 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at what gives us the best chance to win,'' Dungy  
said. ``We haven't scored as many points as we'd like the last few 
weeks. It's not all the quarterback's fault, but we felt a change 
was in order right now and think it gives us the best chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer, whose streak of 70 consecutive regular-season starts  
will end when Zeier takes the first snap Sunday night at Detroit, 
was caught off-guard by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs are 27th in the NFL in total offense, and the  
sixth-year pro was just 16-for-27 for 121 yards against the Bears. 
However, he thought he recovered well enough from a season-opening 
debacle against the New York Giants to hold onto his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I absolutely disagree with the decision. I think it's the  
wrong decision. I think I should be the starting quarterback of 
this football team,'' Dilfer said, declining to elaborate on why he 
thought he deserved to remain No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth-year pro, two seasons removed from being selected for  
the Pro Bowl, has thrown three more interceptions (nine) than 
touchdown passes (six) and his quarterback rating of 66.3 ranks 
12th in the NFC. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a critical season for Dilfer because the Bucs face a  
decision this winter on whether to exercise the option on the 
remaining two years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Dungy wouldn't speculate on what the future holds for the  
quarterback. However, he did make it clear that the switch to Zeier 
is considered permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like switching quarterbacks. I didn't anticipate  
changing. And I'm not going in anticipating another change,'' the 
coach said. ``But at some point if it comes to our viewpoint that 
Eric doesn't give us the best chance, then we'll think about 
changing at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zeier, acquired in a trade last April, spent the first four  
years of his career with the old Cleveland Browns and Baltimore 
Ravens, who received a sixth-round draft pick from the Bucs. 
</P>
<P>
	He's appeared in 22 games, including 11 as a starter, and is  
familiar with the role of being the backup that fans call for when 
the regular quarterback falls into disfavor. 
</P>
<P>
	And while he's had some success, throwing for 3,231 yards with  
16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, Zeier isn't making any promises 
about turning around the league's 29th-ranked passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never just one person. I'm not going to go in and  
individually win football games for us. It's going to take 
everybody,'' Zeier said. ``My job is just to put our team in a 
position to win games, make plays and to be careful with the 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zeier replaced Dilfer in the fourth quarter of the season  
opener, but couldn't move the team as the Bucs wound up losing 
17-13 despite holding the Giants to just 107 yards and no 
touchdowns on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	New York returned an interception and a fumble by Dilfer for  
touchdowns, and also kicked a field goal after one of the 
quarterback's four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer said he would be supportive of Zeier and vowed to do  
whatever he can to help the Bucs be successful, including preparing 
to take over again if his replacement struggles or is injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing I could do right now is make a stink about  
this, and hurt this football team,'' Dilfer said. ``It's a good 
team. It's a team that has a chance to do good things, and I want 
to be part of it.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Operating Edges Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merger-related spending for AT&AMP;T Corp.'s  
aggressive foray into cable television weighed down the company's 
third-quarter profits, but the results edged past most Wall Street 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's operating profit totaled $1.75 billion, or 54 cents a  
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, including the impact of 
the cable company Tele-Communications Inc. and parts of IBM's 
Internet services business, both acquired earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a drop of 4.5 percent from AT&AMP;T's operating profit of  
$1.84 billion, or 68 cents a share, in the same period last year, 
but slightly better than most projections, according to a survey of 
industry analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating results exclude one-time factors that gave AT&AMP;T a  
net profit of $1.63 billion, or 50 cents a share, in the just-ended 
quarter, down from $2.12 billion, or 78 cents a share, in the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues totaled $16.31 billion, an increase of  
5.6 percent compared with the $15.44 billion that all of AT&AMP;T's

generated as a single company a year ago.. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless revenues grew 44.2 percent, the third straight quarter  
of better-than 40 percent gains compared with year-earlier levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, consumer services revenues fell 4.7 percent to  
$5.61 billion amid the price war beiung waged in the long-distance 
calling market. AT&AMP;T said its new 7-cents per minute program, 
introduced in August in response to new calling programs from 
Sprint and MCI WorldCom, signed up 2 million customers in the first 
five weeks, including existing subscribers switching to the new 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That represents the fastest start in any program that anyone  
around here can remember,'' said John Zeglis, the head of AT&AMP;T's 
consumer operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call after today's earnings report, AT&AMP;T chief  
executive C. Michael Armstrong rejected reports that the company is 
struggling to seal agreements with Time Warner and other cable TV 
operators to use their systems for offering local telephone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said it was hard to proceed with the Time Warner talks  
until the company received guidance from federal regulators 
regarding AT&AMP;T's proposed acquisition of MediaOne, a cable company 
that owns a quarter of Time Warner's cable operation. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T also said it is starting to advertise more aggressively  
again in the wireless market after keeping a low profile while the 
company increased network capacity for the floods of calling 
traffic it couldn't handle in key markets such as New York. Network 
capacity has been increased by an average of 60 percent since the 
start of the year, and by more than 125 percent in ``hot spots'' 
such as New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In the cable area, AT&AMP;T said it now has 113,600 subscribers to  
the ExciteAtHome Internet access service and expects to have 
175,000 by the new year and 275,000 by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced it has begun its seventh pilot  
program for local telephone service over cable TV lines with the 
addition of Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Frustrated Bengals Ready To Burst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- One player questions his teammates' ability.  
Another suggests that some don't want to play. The head coach is 
deep into damage control, urging a more positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lopsided loss has the Cincinnati Bengals at the bursting  
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrations spilled out after a 31-10 loss in Indianapolis left  
the Bengals 1-6. Several players spoke out afterwards and again on 
Monday, questioning the team's mindset and direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bruce Coslet had a message for them: stop it.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that I'm most worried about now is our morale and  
what happens for the rest of the season,'' Coslet said Monday. ``I 
challenged the players today to keep the faith, keep trying, do the 
best they can. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mentioned to them that by pointing out negative things or  
saying that it's this or it's that, all they're really saying is, 
'It's not my fault.''' 
</P>
<P>
	There's plenty of blame for another lost season. The Bengals  
have lost 102 games in the 1990s, the most in the NFL, and haven't 
had a winning record since the decade began. 
</P>
<P>
	The drubbing by the Colts showed that nothing's getting better.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's just really frustrated all the way from the top to  
the bottom,'' punter Will Brice said. ``We got beat pretty bad 
yesterday, more so than some of the games where we were 
competitive. I think that on top of being the sixth loss of the 
season, it's just starting to accumulate more and more each week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time all season, it's starting to spill out in  
rambling explanations for why this team is so bad and what it needs 
to get better. The team's brittle confidence was mentioned most. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to come out there and be scared of playing,  
worrying about the thing that you messed up on, we don't need you 
on the field,'' second-year linebacker Takeo Spikes said Monday. 
``We put too much effort in to go out and get embarrassed like that 
on Sunday. I don't want to go through that again. I hate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie quarterback Akili Smith, who was rebuked by Coslet last  
week for saying some teammates don't study enough, said Monday that 
the problems are self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to specify none of that stuff because it would  
start more problems,'' Smith said. ``Everybody pretty much knows 
what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players will mention the front office -- punter Lee  
Johnson questioned general manager Mike Brown's methods last season 
and got released and fined. 
</P>
<P>
	The most they'll do is drop frustration-coated hints about  
management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things that could have been taken care of maybe three or four  
years ago are now catching up with this team,'' offensive tackle 
Willie Anderson said. ``You have some guys on this team that are 
real good, NFL-caliber players, and you have some at certain key 
positions that maybe they're not. And it's catching up with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-year running back Corey Dillon also wondered aloud about  
some of his teammates' toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody's all right with what's going on here, something's  
wrong with him,'' Dillon said. ``I'm dead serious. There's only so 
much one person can do. I can't do it all. But at least put people 
in there that want to play. That's all I can say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet talked to Dillon about the tone of his comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts the cause when you talk like that,'' Coslet said.  
``But again, it's born out of frustration.''

<HEADLINE> Murals of Saint Defaced in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Streetside murals of the Virgin of Guadalupe  
have been defaced in a Hispanic neighborhood in recent weeks, 
disturbing those who revere the patron saint of Mexico as their 
protector. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, for example, at the El Principio market in south  
central Los Angeles, an image of the Virgin was covered with bars 
of black paint. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James Forsen of St. John the Baptist Catholic Church  
said he believes the vandalism is the work of ``someone who has 
emotional problems and thinks they're evoking God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Virgin of Guadalupe is believed to have first appeared in  
1531 to a Mexican Indian named Juan Diego in the hills outside 
Mexico City and has been revered for centuries by Roman Catholics, 
particularly Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	In modern days, the dark-skinned Virgin is typically depicted in  
a royal green robe and surrounded by a bright halo. 
</P>
<P>
	Her image is printed on T-shirts and tattooed on gang members  
seeking her protection. Business owners use the image more 
literally to protect their storefronts from vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	At Gonzalez Party Supplies, a mural of the Virgin was painted on  
the store to deter graffiti from Mexican gang members. But manager 
Elvia Partida said that about a month ago someone splashed it with 
white paint. 
</P>
<P>
	The image was restored, but the vandals struck again, covering  
the Virgin's face and using blue paint to write ``666'' and ``La 
Bestia,'' which is Spanish for the devil. 
</P>
<P>
	Partida said the vandalism started after a shawl imprinted with  
an image of the Virgin arrived for a three-month tour of Los 
Angeles-area churches.

<HEADLINE> U.N. OKs Peace Troops for E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council voted unanimously  
today to authorize the United Nations to take control of East Timor 
during its transition to independence and deploy more than 9,000 
U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations will take over the administration of East  
Timor, probably for two or three years, to rebuild its shattered 
infrastructure and set its 800,000 people on the road to democracy 
before independence from Indonesia is declared. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. troops are expected to replace a 15-nation force that the  
council dispatched to East Timor last month to restore order after 
pro-Indonesian militias went on the rampage following the 
overwhelming independence vote by the territory's people on Aug. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the dawn of a new era for both the United Nations and  
East Timor,'' said Britain's deputy U.N. ambassador, Stewart Eldon, 
whose country piloted the resolution through the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations, he said, faces a severe test of not only  
rebuilding East Timor but establishing a legal, judicial, and 
administration that it will carry into independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job must also be done right,'' Eldon said. ``That means  
that the resources of the entire U.N. system -- including the funds, 
programs and international financial institutions -- must be 
mobilized. And the East Timorese people must be fully involved in 
every step of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary-General for Peacekeeping Bernard Miyet estimated  
the first year's cost of the U.N. operation in East Timor at 
between $700 million and $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Several countries, including Japan, South Korea and Brazil  
pledged additional support for the U.N. mission, but gave no 
specific figures. China said it planned to contribute personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the council voted to send a 6,000-member U.N.  
peacekeeping force to Sierra Leone to help restore peace in the 
African nation after an eight-year civil war. That operation will 
also be costly, though no estimates have been given yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries called for the immediate deployment of the U.N.  
force in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will establish the mission as quickly as we can,''  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution authorizes a 9,150-member U.N. peacekeeping  
force, including 200 military observers, to replace the 
Australian-led international force. A 1,640-member international 
police force will also be sent to the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations sent a mission to East Timor after Indonesia  
and Portugal agreed May 5 to let the territory hold a 
U.N.-supervised ballot on its future. Indonesia invaded East Timor, 
a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, then annexed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the looting, burning and killing spree by the  
pro-Indonesian militias after the Aug. 30 ballot, all but a few 
U.N. staff left the East Timorese capital. Many have returned since 
the deployment of the mutinational force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council resolution expresses concern at reports of  
widespread human rights violations and calls on all parties to 
cooperate with investigations. It also stresses that Indonesia is 
responsible to ensure the safe return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's deputy U.N. ambassador, Makmur Widodo, said his  
government ``is deeply concerned at the exaggerated and often 
unjustified allegations of human rights violations'' in East Timor. 
He said all allegations will be investigated by an Indonesian 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Indonesia's assembly ratified the result of the  
August vote, paving the way for East Timor's official handover to 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor will have  
overall responsibility for administering East Timor and will be 
empowered to exercise all legislative and executive authority, 
including the justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	It will consult with East Timorese representatives to help  
create democratic institutions, including an independent human 
rights institution.

<HEADLINE>  Rose Back in Baseball for a Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The crowd cheered on and on, giving him the  
loudest and longest ovation: Pete Rose was back in baseball for the 
first time in 10 years, his lifetime ban lifted for a single night. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the All-Century team, ``Charlie Hustle'' was  
center stage at Turner Field before Game 2 of the World Series on 
Sunday. His was a 55-second cheer, 15 seconds longer than the 
welcome given Hank Aaron, the city's own career home run leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, Rose defiantly repeated denials that he bet  
on baseball, and even told a national television audience that he 
never would admit to ``something that didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grinning widely, Rose doffed his Cincinnati Reds cap twice, then  
turned and waved to all areas of the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans'  
voting me on the All-Century team,'' he said, going on to shake 
hands with Paul O'Neill and others near the Yankees' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In a live TV interview following the ceremony, NBC reporter Jim  
Gray repeatedly asked Rose why he wouldn't admit to betting on 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised you're bombarding me with this, I'm here to do  
an interview with you,'' Rose said during the riveting segment. 
``You're bringing up something that happened 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, refusing to change the subject, said the commissioner's  
office had strong evidence that Rose bet on baseball -- a reference 
to the 225-page Dowd report, which contains seven volumes of 
evidence alleging 52 bets on the Reds from April 8 to July 5, 1987, 
and refers to three betting sheets the FBI determined were in 
Rose's handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Show it to me, where is it?'' Rose asked.  
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Rose tried to get Gray off the subject, saying:  
``I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing about that. It's too festive 
a night to worry about it. I'm just a small part of a big deal 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours earlier, as Rose faced reporters during a 25-minute  
news conference, his 15-year-old son Tyler sitting beside him 
wearing a Yankees cap, baseball's career hits leader blurted out 
his feelings: 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, Charles Manson gets a hearing every year, doesn't  
he?'' Rose said. ``This kid thinks his dad's a monster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he went to see his other son, Pete Jr., play in Cincinnati  
in 1997, he said he sat next to owner Marge Schott and felt like a 
pariah. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're paranoid about me being at the game,'' Rose said.  
``Can you park here? Can you go into the entrance? Can you sit 
here? Can you buy a hot dog? A Diet Coke? They're all scared 
they're going to lose their jobs. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first time in my life I ever bought four tickets to  
a baseball game. I had -- they made me -- I had to buy the tickets. I 
had to buy the tickets the next night to sit up in her box. I was 
always on the pass list. My son couldn't leave me passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is balding now, the closely cropped hair noticeably  
thinner, the creases on his face deeper. He looked dapper in a 
crisp white shirt, blue jacket, hip tie and pocket square. 
</P>
<P>
	But even at 58, Rose still longs to put on a uniform and return  
to the game he loves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the best ambassador baseball has,'' he said. ``I'll be  
talking about baseball tomorrow in Florida, Wednesday in Chicago, 
Saturday back in Florida, Sunday in Los Angeles, because my name in 
synonymous with the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He named some other in the game who've been given second  
chances: Dwight Gooden, Steve Howe, George Steinbrenner and Leon 
Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think somewhere down the line, somebody's going to give  
me a second chance,'' he said. ``I won't need a third. We all know 
that baseball has a tendency to give people more than one chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997 and doesn't  
understand why commissioner Bud Selig hasn't formally decided on 
his request. As he spoke, Selig's personal lawyer stood off to the 
side behind a thick black curtain, listening. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose joked about the efforts being made to reinstate Shoeless  
Joe Jackson, banned for throwing the 1919 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``How ... are you going to review something that happened 80  
years ago? Who are they going to interview?'' he said. ``I hope 
they don't wait 'til the year 2060 to review my case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner didn't come near him during the ceremony, but  
Rose certainly was given the royal treatment. Baseball's head of 
security, Kevin Hallinan, one of the men who gathered the evidence 
on gambling that got Rose thrown out of the game, accompanied him 
in and out of the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose missed the formal news conference with the other living  
members of the All-Century team. He was at Bally's Park Place 
Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., with other members of the 
3,000-hit club, signing baseballs for $40, caps for $60 and bats 
for $75. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you can't have a 3,000-hit show if I'm not there,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others didn't share his opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing that he's there,'' said Nolan Ryan, one of  
nine pitchers on the All-Century team. ``It's something you've got 
to deal with. I think the fans look at it differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Rose remained as self-obsessed as ever,  
reciting many of his career statistics off the top of his head. And 
not just the 4,256 hits in a 24-year career ending in 1986, more 
than any other player in baseball history. Little detailed ones, 
like how he got 77 hits (actually 64) off former Brave Phil Niekro, 
his most of any pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to be on the team,'' said former Reds teammate Johnny  
Bench, who had been a critic. Bench said he wished Rose would 
apologize to better his chance for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he said that. That's a little change of tune,'' Rose  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-time All-Star and three-time batting champion, then the  
manager of the Reds, accepted a lifetime ban from baseball on Aug. 
23, 1989, following an investigation of his gambling by 
then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do anything in my power to change what has happened to  
me in the last 10 years,'' Rose said. ``But I can't change what has 
happened. You know how I feel. You know I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ban makes him ineligible for the Hall of Fame ballot, as  
divisive an issue as reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem with Pete being on the team,'' Brooks  
Robinson said. ``I have a problem with the gambling part and 
putting him in the Hall of Fame. That's the worst thing you can do. 
It undermines the whole integrity of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Pettitte, Glavine Ready For Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The trouble began with a headache and within a  
few hours, Tom Glavine was one sick pitcher, stricken with the flu 
on the eve of the opening game of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	In a career that includes two Cy Young Awards and stretches over  
a dozen seasons, Glavine had never missed a start for the Atlanta 
Braves. Until last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine stayed home for the first two games of the Series and  
the results -- a pair of losses to the New York Yankees -- hardly 
helped his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't a whole lot of fun to watch,'' he said Monday as  
the Series moved to New York. ``They couldn't make me feel worse 
than the flu. They're over and done with. Obviously, we've got to 
play better the next few times out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, about five to seven pounds lighter then he was before  
he got sick, hopes to help the Braves begin their recovery when he 
starts Game 3 Tuesday night against Andy Pettitte of the Yankees in 
a matchup of left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for Glavine is complicated by an anemic Atlanta  
attack that has produced just three runs and seven hits in the 
first two games. By comparison, the Yankees scored three runs on 
five hits in the first inning of Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that I'd ever go out there and feel like I've got  
to throw a shutout to win,'' Glavine said. ``My approach has always 
been if I hold the other team to three runs or less, I've done a 
good job and given my team a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wouldn't have been good enough in either of the first two  
games and Pettitte knows that Orlando Hernandez and David Cone set 
the bar pretty high for him to follow. Both limited the Braves to 
one hit through seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will be tough to beat, especially for me,'' Pettitte  
said. ``I don't think I went more than five innings in my career 
without giving up more than one hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Glavine and Pettitte have struggled through a difficult  
season. Each finished 14-11, Glavine with a 4.12 ERA, Pettitte with 
a 4.70. The difference was Glavine remained an integral member of 
what many believe has been the best pitching rotation in baseball, 
while Pettitte nearly got traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-handers are a baseball commodity and the Yankees had plenty  
of buyers for Pettitte but manager Joe Torre talked the front 
office out of dealing him away. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was really no tension or stress on me,'' Pettitte said.  
``I didn't put any pressure on me during that time. I knew it was 
out of my control. If the organization wanted to get rid of me, 
there was nothing else I could do. I couldn't work any harder. I 
knew it was out of my hands so I really didn't worry about it that 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pettitte enjoyed a nearly immediate turnaround after the  
trade deadline passed. He was 5-1 with a 1.76 ERA in August and 
pitched productively down the stretch. He also won Game 4 of the 
American League Championship Series against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, it was Pettitte's 1-0 shutout of Atlanta in  
Game 5 that put the Yankees in position to win that World Series. 
He followed that with seven shutout innings in the Yankees' Game 4 
clincher a year ago against San Diego and brings a string of 15 2-3 
scoreless innings into Tuesday night's start. That is the longest 
Series shutout streak since Glavine had 17 straight scoreless 
innings in 1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte was asked if that pivotal shutout of the Braves in 1996  
had changed him as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't help me this year when I was struggling for two  
months and last year when I was struggling for three months,'' he 
said. ``But it gives you confidence you can get it done in a big 
game, when you have to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Braves, trailing 2-0 and running out of room for error,  
Game 3 looms as one of those games.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Suit Settled Out of Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A sexual battery lawsuit filed against former  
heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson by a female photographer has 
been settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladywautusa Je's Superior Court complaint against Tyson was  
scheduled to go to trial Monday, but the parties settled the matter 
last Friday, according to the court clerk for Judge Paul Boland. 
</P>
<P>
	Je's attorney, Steven M. Kramer of Beverly Hills, said he wasn't  
allowed to disclose the amount of money involved, but added, ``My

	Je, who sought unspecified damages, said she posed with Tyson  
for two photographs. She claimed he pinned her against him, lifted 
her left leg ``to his middle body,'' raised her blouse and ordered 
someone to ``take a picture of this.''

<P>
	Je, who described herself in court papers as a ``well-known''  
celebrity photographer, filed the suit without an attorney, but 
later hired Kramer.

	Gregory Aldisert, the lawyer for Tyson, was involved in a trial  
in Texas and unavailable for comment on Monday, his assistant, 
Candace White, said.

<HEADLINE> Plane Owned by PGA Golfer Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A Learjet co-owned by golf champion Payne Stewart flew  
uncontrolled over the nation's heartland for hours today before 
crashing in South Dakota, apparently with five people aboard. There 
were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials feared that the U.S. Open golf champion was  
among the victims and that the plane may have suffered a 
pressurization failure. The golfer's mother, Bee Stewart, said in 
Springfield, Mo., she didn't know if her son was on the plane but 
said he was a part owner of the jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft left Orlando, Fla., this morning bound for Dallas,  
and the last communication was when the plane was over Gainesville, 
Fla., said Tony Molinaro, a Federal Aviation Administration 
spokesman in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who lives in Orlando, had been expected in Houston on  
Tuesday for practice rounds in advance of the Tour Championship, 
the PGA Tour's final tournament of the year for the top 30 players 
on its money list. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart went to SMU in Dallas and still has friends in the area.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane had flown as high as 45,000 feet and the crew did not  
respond to repeated inquiries from air traffic controllers, said 
Paul Turk, an FAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force F-16 fighter jet from Tyndall, Fla., was diverted  
from a routine training flight to check out the Learjet, Air Force 
officials said. Two F-15 fighters from Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., 
then took over to follow the Learjet, and they later handed off the 
monitoring to two Air National Guard F-16s from Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Abdallah, superintendent of the South Dakota Highway  
Patrol, confirmed that the plane had crashed about two miles west 
of Mina, S.D., in the north-central part of the state. No one 
survived, South Dakota Gov. Bill Janklow said. No one on the ground 
was hurt, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no confirmation as to the identities of those on the  
plane, but one official said authorities had information from a 
flight plan and the jet's registration number that led them to 
believe Stewart was among those on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said President Clinton was informed of the situation  
during a meeting with his economic advisers. When reporters pressed 
him for the identities of those on board, he threatened to cut 
short his daily briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that FAA officials had an unofficial roster of those on  
board, and ``until they have confirmed that there won't be any 
further information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said that two FAA officials already had been dispatched  
to the scene of the crash, as had a National Transportation Safety 
Board representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are normally pressurized,  
because passengers would have difficulty breathing the thin air 
above that altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a pressurization problem, those aboard the aircraft  
could slowly lose consciousness and, if not returned to a normal 
altitude, die. 
</P>
<P>
	Once reaching a cruise altitude, pilots often switch on the  
autopilot. If they passed out, the plane would cruise until it ran 
out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, has been one of the most recognizable players in  
golf because of his trademark knickers and tam-o'-shanter hat. He 
has won 18 tournaments around the world, including three major 
championships. In June, Stewart won his second U.S. Open over Phil 
Mickelson with a 15-foot putt, the longest putt to ever decide that 
championship on the final hole.

<HEADLINE> `Rugrats' Software Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Rugrats aren't only the result of sloppy housekeeping.  
``Rugrats,'' it turns out, is also an animated TV series on 
Nickelodeon that looks at the world from a baby's viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	(You tend to lose touch with children's TV when your kids have  
reached their 20s.) 
</P>
<P>
	The show's characters are featured in a nicely done Windows-Mac  
software package, ``The Rugrats Mystery Adventure,'' from Mattel 
Media. 
</P>
<P>
	The software offers 10 different mystery adventures involving  
the ``Rugrats'' characters. Players move through each mystery and 
solve puzzles to accumulate clues. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief character is Tommy Pickles, a self-described ``private  
defective'' who, in the opening, does a sendup of Dashiell 
Hammett's Sam Spade character, complete with echoing saxophone 
blues in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Aimed at the 6-12 set, and claiming to build ``deductive  
reasoning, problem-solving, memory and strategy skills,'' the 
software is so challenging that someone several multiples of 12 
years old was happy to have a reviewer's cheat sheet. That's good, 
since it will sustain interest for its intended audience for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
	(Software reviewers' cheat sheets were introduced a few years  
ago when software houses discovered that kids could work their 
products, but adult reviewers needed help.) 
</P>
<P>
	As you move through various environments (the park, the Home  
Heaven home-improvement store), you must interact with the 
characters you meet and solve their problems. When you do, they 
will help you with information if you come across with a Reptar bar 
collected by playing the various popup games. 
</P>
<P>
	The animation is smooth, TV-quality and the dialogue is  
humorous, at least for its target audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the software does encourage general thinking skills, it  
doesn't focus on specific curriculum skills, and so it probably 
should be considered more healthy entertainment than educational. 
</P>
<P>
	Installation was slick, smooth and quick, and included an  
uninstall module, the mark of well-bred software. Avoiding a pet 
peeve, the CD-ROM was loose in the box, not welded inside a 
cardboard prison created by some psychotic origami artist. And the 
jewel case wasn't shrink-wrapped so tightly that a Bowie knife was 
needed to open it. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements are modest, recognizing that most of us  
don't buy a new computer every year: 
</P>
<P>
	--For the PC, a 133-megahertz Pentium, 16 megabytes of RAM,  
quad-speed CD-ROM and 256-color monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	--For the Mac, a Power PC at 150 megahertz or higher, System 7.5  
or higher and same RAM and CD-ROM requirements as for the PC. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel Media products are widely available at retail.  
``Rugrats'' has a suggested price of about $30. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Rose Back in Baseball for a Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The crowd cheered on and on, giving him the  
loudest and longest ovation: Pete Rose was back in baseball for the 
first time in 10 years, his lifetime ban lifted for a single night. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the All-Century team, ``Charlie Hustle'' was  
center stage at Turner Field before Game 2 of the World Series on 
Sunday. His was a 55-second cheer, 15 seconds longer than the 
welcome given Hank Aaron, the city's own career home run leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, Rose defiantly repeated denials that he bet  
on baseball, and even told a national television audience that he 
never would admit to ``something that didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grinning widely, Rose doffed his Cincinnati Reds cap twice, then  
turned and waved to all areas of the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans'  
voting me on the All-Century team,'' he said, going on to shake 
hands with Paul O'Neill and others near the Yankees' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In a live TV interview following the ceremony, NBC reporter Jim  
Gray repeatedly asked Rose why he wouldn't admit to betting on 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised you're bombarding me with this, I'm here to do  
an interview with you,'' Rose said during the riveting segment. 
``You're bringing up something that happened 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, refusing to change the subject, said the commissioner's  
office had strong evidence that Rose bet on baseball -- a reference 
to the 225-page Dowd report, which contains seven volumes of 
evidence alleging 52 bets on the Reds from April 8 to July 5, 1987, 
and refers to three betting sheets the FBI determined were in 
Rose's handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Show it to me, where is it?'' Rose asked.  
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Rose tried to get Gray off the subject, saying:  
``I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing about that. It's too festive 
a night to worry about it. I'm just a small part of a big deal 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours earlier, as Rose faced reporters during a 25-minute  
news conference, his 15-year-old son Tyler sitting beside him 
wearing a Yankees cap, baseball's career hits leader blurted out 
his feelings: 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, Charles Manson gets a hearing every year, doesn't  
he?'' Rose said. ``This kid thinks his dad's a monster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he went to see his other son, Pete Jr., play in Cincinnati  
in 1997, he said he sat next to owner Marge Schott and felt like a 
pariah. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're paranoid about me being at the game,'' Rose said.  
``Can you park here? Can you go into the entrance? Can you sit 
here? Can you buy a hot dog? A Diet Coke? They're all scared 
they're going to lose their jobs. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first time in my life I ever bought four tickets to  
a baseball game. I had -- they made me -- I had to buy the tickets. I 
had to buy the tickets the next night to sit up in her box. I was 
always on the pass list. My son couldn't leave me passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is balding now, the closely cropped hair noticeably  
thinner, the creases on his face deeper. He looked dapper in a 
crisp white shirt, blue jacket, hip tie and pocket square. 
</P>
<P>
	But even at 58, Rose still longs to put on a uniform and return  
to the game he loves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the best ambassador baseball has,'' he said. ``I'll be  
talking about baseball tomorrow in Florida, Wednesday in Chicago, 
Saturday back in Florida, Sunday in Los Angeles, because my name in 
synonymous with the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He named some other in the game who've been given second  
chances: Dwight Gooden, Steve Howe, George Steinbrenner and Leon 
Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think somewhere down the line, somebody's going to give  
me a second chance,'' he said. ``I won't need a third. We all know 
that baseball has a tendency to give people more than one chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997 and doesn't  
understand why commissioner Bud Selig hasn't formally decided on 
his request. As he spoke, Selig's personal lawyer stood off to the 
side behind a thick black curtain, listening. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose joked about the efforts being made to reinstate Shoeless  
Joe Jackson, banned for throwing the 1919 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``How ... are you going to review something that happened 80  
years ago? Who are they going to interview?'' he said. ``I hope 
they don't wait 'til the year 2060 to review my case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner didn't come near him during the ceremony, but  
Rose certainly was given the royal treatment. Baseball's head of 
security, Kevin Hallinan, one of the men who gathered the evidence 
on gambling that got Rose thrown out of the game, accompanied him 
in and out of the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose missed the formal news conference with the other living  
members of the All-Century team. He was at Bally's Park Place 
Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., with other members of the 
3,000-hit club, signing baseballs for $40, caps for $60 and bats 
for $75. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you can't have a 3,000-hit show if I'm not there,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others didn't share his opinion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing that he's there,'' said Nolan Ryan, one of  
nine pitchers on the All-Century team. ``It's something you've got 
to deal with. I think the fans look at it differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Rose remained as self-obsessed as ever,  
reciting many of his career statistics off the top of his head. And 
not just the 4,256 hits in a 24-year career ending in 1986, more 
than any other player in baseball history. Little detailed ones, 
like how he got 77 hits (actually 64) off former Brave Phil Niekro, 
his most of any pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to be on the team,'' said former Reds teammate Johnny  
Bench, who had been a critic. Bench said he wished Rose would 
apologize to better his chance for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he said that. That's a little change of tune,'' Rose  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-time All-Star and three-time batting champion, then the  
manager of the Reds, accepted a lifetime ban from baseball on Aug. 
23, 1989, following an investigation of his gambling by 
then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do anything in my power to change what has happened to  
me in the last 10 years,'' Rose said. ``But I can't change what has 
happened. You know how I feel. You know I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ban makes him ineligible for the Hall of Fame ballot, as  
divisive an issue as reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem with Pete being on the team,'' Brooks  
Robinson said. ``I have a problem with the gambling part and 
putting him in the Hall of Fame. That's the worst thing you can do. 
It undermines the whole integrity of the game.''

<HEADLINE> $5M Set for Congressional Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a boost to Republican efforts to retain  
control of Congress, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is committing $5 
million to help pro-business candidates in competitive races next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber plans to target 35 to 40 House races and 12 Senate  
races, and spend $100,000 apiece to support favored candidates. The 
money will go to educate voters, host fund-raisers and mobilize the 
business community. They especially will reach out to the 
self-employed and small and medium-sized businesses. The chamber 
also will endorse other candidates, but not spend money to elect 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamber officials are scheduled to announce the targeted races  
Tuesday. Democrats need to pick up only five seats to recapture 
control of the House, and are being supported in their efforts by 
organized labor and trial lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``America deserves a Congress that will lower taxes, reform our  
legal system, expand free trade and reduce costly and ineffective 
regulations,'' Chamber President Tom Donohue said. ``The only way 
to get there is with a tough, results-oriented political program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the races expected to be on the list is the Virginia  
Senate contest between former Gov. George Allen, the Republican 
candidate, and incumbent Democrat Charles Robb; and Western 
Connecticut's 5th Congressional District, where Democratic Rep. Jim 
Maloney faces a rematch with Republican Mark Nielsen, endorsed by 
the chamber in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly going to help the pro-business candidates,''  
said Jill Schroeder, spokeswoman for the National Republican 
Congressional Committee. ``Every dollar is going to count next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effort will be headed by veteran Republican fund-raiser Ted  
Welch, who had been Lamar Alexander's chief money man until the 
former Tennessee governor withdrew from the GOP presidential race 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has never been a greater need for the chamber to marshal  
its resources to fight for a pro-business Congress,'' Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney announced  
that organized labor would spend $40 million on get-out-the-vote 
efforts on behalf of Democratic congressional candidates, including 
leafleting, voter registration, issues education, phone banks and 
door-to-door campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber effort will help counter the labor unions, Schroeder  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these campaigns are going to cost millions to hold on  
to because of the labor unions,'' Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, trial lawyers are ratcheting up their financial  
support of Democratic candidates. A computer analysis of 
contributions conducted for the Associated Press by the Campaign 
Study Group found trial lawyers giving $4.1 million during the 
first six months of 1999, with $3.7 million, or 90 percent, going 
to Democratic committees and candidates. During the first six 
months of 1995, the last presidential election season, trial 
lawyers contributed $2.2 million, with $1.7 million, or 77 percent, 
going to Democrats.

<HEADLINE> MSU's Cleaves Out Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves,  
the only returning All-America from last season, suffered a stress 
fracture in his right foot and will be out eight to 10 weeks, coach 
Tom Izzo announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves underwent a bone graft and had a pin inserted during  
surgery Monday evening, Dr. Herbert Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surgery couldn't have gone more perfectly,'' Ross said in  
a statement released by the university. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery lasted about 90 minutes and Cleaves was sent home.  
He was awake and resting comfortably, sports information director 
John Lewandowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves likely won't play until shortly before the Spartans  
begin the Big Ten season, Jan. 5 against Penn State. He likely will 
miss games against North Carolina, Kansas and Arizona in December. 
The Spartans play Kentucky in 8 1/2 weeks, on Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, who led the Spartans to a 33-5 record and their first  
Final Four in 20 years last season, is expected to be on crutches 
for three to four weeks. No matter how quickly he returns, it will 
take him a while longer to get in game shape, Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody comes back after four, six, eight, 10  
weeks without missing a beat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Cleaves probably injured the foot about three weeks  
ago and it got progressively worse. He complained Sunday about it 
being sore and went to the doctor Monday, Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury will give the Spartans a chance to see how good they  
are, Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we just have a program, or do we have a team. Ever since  
I've been in this game, people have told me that a program is 
bigger than one person, one player, one coach. We're about to find 
that out,'' he said. ``I don't want anybody feeling sorry for us. I 
don't want anyone changing their expectations of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said he expects Mo Peterson and Charlie Bell to take up the  
leadership void, although he said Cleaves will still attend 
practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt he's our leader by actions, he's our leader  
by words. He's going to be a very talented assistant for eight or 
10 weeks,'' Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves met with the team Monday before the surgery, Peterson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just told us that other guys are going to have to step up.  
Freshmen will have to step up and not play like freshmen,'' 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Thomas, a junior who redshirted last season, will fill in  
for Cleaves at the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a great test for myself,'' Thomas said. ``I  
expect him (Cleaves) to be on me more than Coach Izzo. Mateen's a 
great leader and he's still going to be there for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said he won't let the Spartans use Cleaves' absence as an  
excuse for not playing well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let anybody say that `Well, they would have won if  
Mateen was playing,' or `We would have won by more if Mateen had 
been there,''' he said. ``It's going to be personally insulting to 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Gannon Has Broken Bone in Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland quarterback Rich Gannon broke a  
bone in his left wrist while being knocked to the ground after 
throwing the deciding touchdown pass in the Raiders' 24-23 win over 
the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	And tailback Tyrone Wheatley, who was taken off the field on a  
cart after injuring his lower back in the third quarter of Sunday's 
game, remained in a hospital today for further tests. Raiders coach 
Jon Gruden said tests so far have shown no serious damage to 
Wheatley's back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gannon injury to his non-throwing arm came on the play he  
threw a 5-yard scoring pass to James Jett with 26 seconds 
remaining, capping a comeback from a 17-point deficit late in the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned. Right now he is very questionable for the  
next game. We'll see if there's a soft cast he can wear,'' Gruden 
said. ``I know the snap itself is not going to be easy 
procedurally. He's going to be sore for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Gannon can't play, Gruden said Bobby Hoying will be the  
Raiders' starter Sunday at home against the Miami Dolphins. Hoying, 
obtained by Oakland in a trade from Philadelphia during the 
preseason, has not played yet for the Raiders but played for the 
Eagles while Gruden was the offensive coordinator there. 
</P>
<P>
	Gruden said it is unclear whether Wheatley, the Raiders' leading  
runner this season, will be available for the game against Miami. 
The Raiders have a bye the following week.

<HEADLINE> Stewart's Plane Said Depressurized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The initial information known about the crash  
of golfer Payne Stewart's jet points to a sudden loss of 
pressurization in the ``very hostile'' environment of high-altitude 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Experienced pilots say such an occurrence is extremely rare for  
civilian aircraft -- and very unforgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	It could have been brought on by a blown door or window seal.  
Experts interviewed after Monday's crash considered that the most 
likely scenario because the two pilots and at least three 
passengers aboard Stewart's Lear 35 did not broadcast a mayday 
before the plane crashed in South Dakota. All aboard died. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers last talked to the pilots when they confirmed an  
instruction to climb to 39,000 feet as the plane flew from Orlando, 
Fla., to Love Field in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	If pressure was lost at that altitude, everyone aboard would  
have been incapacitated almost immediately. Autopsies will tell 
whether they died before the crash or from the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is smoke or some other form of contamination  
in the cabin, but experts considered that much less likely because 
the chance of someone noticing and taking some form of corrective 
action would have been greater. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are in the cabin of a Learjet, you are in a very small  
pressure vessel, quite different than a DC-10, 757 or a large 
passenger jet,'' said John Nance, a veteran airline captain and 
aviation analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost certainly something blew out. It could have been a  
window, a door seal or a duct seal. Whatever it was, it doesn't 
take much to empty the cabin (of oxygen) of a Lear because it's a 
very small cabin,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The human body has limited ability to function above 10,000  
feet. As the altitude increases, the air thins, and two things 
happen: There is less oxygen in the air; and there is less pressure 
to force that oxygen through the lungs and into the blood stream. 
</P>
<P>
	Airplane designers compensate by pressurizing the cabin area.  
Air enters the engines from outside and some of it is drawn off, 
heated, compressed and fed into the cabin. Valves at the back of 
the aircraft open and close to maintain a consistent pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the atmosphere inside a plane never feels any higher  
than 8,000 feet, despite the actual height of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	If a plane loses pressure, a warning light goes on in the  
cockpit and oxygen masks drop from the ceiling. People use them -- 
if they are able. 
</P>
<P>
	In aviation circles, there is a term known as ``time of useful  
consciousness.'' It is the measure of the time the body can cope 
without oxygen, and it diminishes quickly with altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	At 20,000 feet, the time is 10 minutes. At 26,000 feet, it is  
two minutes. At 30,000 feet, it is 30 seconds. At 40,000 feet, it 
is 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials said Stewart's plane ultimately climbed as high as  
51,000 feet during its wayward flight across the nation's 
heartland, most probably on autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Brennan, a former Navy fighter pilot and a retired Boeing  
747 captain, said that if the cabin lost proper pressure, the 
people inside would have suffered from hypoxia, decreased oxygen in 
the blood, or anoxia, a lack of oxygen in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a major depressurization, the pressure would go  
down instantly,'' Brennan said. ``Unless you had an oxygen mask 
handy, you couldn't do much about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said even a more gradual leak could have fatal consequences.  
</P>
<P>
	``Someone might have noticed that someone was not operating  
normally, but by that time, they might have not been operating 
normally themselves,'' said Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance, who was preparing to fly his own private plane on Monday,  
said most people never realize that they fly in such a precarious 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside a plane, they can watch a movie, read a book or curl up  
with a blanket. Just outside a plane's aluminum skin, the 
temperature is about 50 degrees below zero and the air too thin to 
support life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very hostile environment and you don't need to worry  
about it because everything works fine 99 percent of the time,'' he 
said. ``When something goes wrong, you have a very short time to do 
something about it.''

<HEADLINE> Court Affirms Cowboys' Suit Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- An appeals court has upheld a judge's  
dismissal of a federal lawsuit Dallas Cowboys Michael Irvin and 
Erik Williams filed against police after a woman accused the 
football players of sexually assaulting her in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief opinion, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said  
Monday it could find no reason to reverse a decision made in March 
by U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
	He had ruled the players failed to prove allegations that police  
violated their civil rights during an investigation of charges made 
by Nina Shahravan. 
</P>
<P>
	She had told police that she had been raped by Williams and an  
unidentified man while Irvin held her at gunpoint and videotaped 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, she admitted to authorities that Irvin was not  
present, and that she willingly had sex with Williams and another 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Police cleared the players later that day, and no charges were  
filed. Shahravan subsequently recanted, pleaded guilty to perjury 
and served a 90-day jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Irvin filed suit in federal court against the city  
of Dallas, then-police chief Ben Click, police spokesman Sgt. Jim 
Chandler and three officers who investigated the allegations of the 
former topless dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	After Fitzwater dismissed the case, the players appealed his  
dismissal to the 5th Circuit and also filed a similar suit in the 
court of state District Judge Jay Patterson.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Auctions Models' Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	More than a million people have logged onto a Web site where the  
eggs of eight models are being auctioned today to parents wishing 
for beautiful babies. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate tally of how many of the 1.1 million  
people who logged on to the site in the past 24 hours bid on eggs 
and how many were just curious about the controversial online 
auction, said a spokesman for fashion photographer Ron Harris, who 
launched the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, http://www.ronsangels.com, has pictures of eight models  
offering their eggs for sale. The bids start at $15,000 and can go 
as high as $150,000. Harris said the site had already received a 
serious bid of $42,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility groups have expressed disgust at the offer, saying  
it turns human life into a commodity. But said the auction is a 
reflection of American society, where beauty can be purchased by 
the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Darwin at his very best,'' Harris said Sunday.  
``(It's) the butterfly that's the prettiest that gets the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction will last up to several months, with each model  
deciding how long the bidding for her eggs will go and what price 
should be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bid is finalized, both bidders and donors will be  
required to undergo medical tests and engage legal representation 
to draw up a contract for the sale, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the offered bid, which goes to the models,  
bidders must pay Harris' organization a 20 percent service fee, 
which Harris said will be donated to children's charities. Access 
to the Web site is free, but it costs $24.95 to get additional 
information on the models. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unethical and it's distasteful,'' Sean Tipton, spokesman  
for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility specialists are increasingly concerned about putting  
a price tag on human eggs. While the typical egg donor is $2,500 to 
$5,000 for their time and inconvenience, a couple advertised 
earlier this year that they would pay $50,000 for eggs donated from 
an athletic student from a top college. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law forbids the purchase and sale of human organs, but  
trafficking in sperm and eggs is legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris is a Malibu, Calif., photographer whose work includes  
fashion photos, television directing for Playboy and exercise 
videos. He said determining who is beautiful is ``what I did all my 
life. That's my expertise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Web site boasts that the models are in excellent health and  
subject to rigorous physical examinations. No information about 
intelligence or education is provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris says an auction of male models' sperm is being planned,  
with bids from $10,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He says society's obsession with appearance has made us stronger  
and healthier, and he pitches the egg auction as a chance for 
parents to give their children a head-start in a society that 
worships beautiful people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around beautiful women my whole life and I think  
they ... have power most of us will never understand,'' said 
Harris, who is also writing a book about beauty, celebrity and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The models could not be reached for comment, but on the Web  
site, each gives reasons for selling her eggs, ranging from ``to 
not be dependent on a man,'' to ``I want to help others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Etcoff, the Cambridge, Mass.-based author of ``Survival of  
the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty,'' says it's natural to 
consider how your mate's attractiveness will be reflected in your 
children. But she said such direct marketing of beauty is a false 
promise because ``the way that we inherit features is sort of a 
genetic roll of the dice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the medical community rejecting the idea of  
selling human body parts, eBay, the world's leading Internet 
auction site, has banned the sale of eggs, sperm and human organs 
on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harris said that if he can get infertile couples together  
with good-looking women who want or need money, everyone benefits.

<HEADLINE> Trump Joins Reform Party Affiliate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Billionaire real estate developer Donald Trump  
quit the Republican Party on Monday and joined New York's wing of 
the Reform Party, setting the stage for a possible presidential 
nomination battle with Pat Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have a lot of experience,'' Trump said, ``more than  
most people, more than most candidates. ... I think I would 
represent the Reform Party very well, if I decide to do it. That's 
an 'if.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he planned to decide at the beginning of next year  
whether to seek the nomination, but the head of his exploratory 
committee said the party switch was a move in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will now begin meeting on a regular basis with Reform Party  
leaders around the country,'' Roger Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, who spoke to reporters as he arrived at his sister's  
swearing-in as a judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Newark, N.J., attacked Buchanan's contention that Germany was not a 
threat to the United States at the beginning of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's obviously in love with Adolf Hitler in some form,'' Trump  
said. ``I don't like people that admire and respect tyrants, and 
Adolf Hitler was the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan abandoned his Republican presidential campaign Monday  
to seek the Reform Party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he would consider leaving the Reform Party if  
Buchanan becomes its nominee, but predicted ``he won't do very 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a certain group of little wacky people on the very  
far right,'' Trump said. ``And I'm not even sure it's the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, a lifelong Republican, registered with the Board of  
Elections as a member of the Independence Party, New York state's 
Reform affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he believes the Reform Party can carve out a niche  
between the Republicans, who he sees as too conservative, and the 
Democrats, who he finds too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party has just moved too far to the extreme  
right,'' he said Sunday. ``The Democrats are too far to the left. I 
believe the Reform Party can be the true centrist party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone described Trump as ``a fiscal and economic conservative  
and a social liberal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real estate mogul, said to be worth about $1.6 billion, has  
doled out more than $150,000 in campaign donations across the 
political spectrum since 1996, giving money to both the Republican 
and Democratic congressional election committees, according to 
federal records. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump could face a crowded field if he chooses to seek the  
Reform Party's nomination, which will come with $12.6 million in 
federal matching funds. In addition to Buchanan, possible Reform 
candidates include Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and party founder 
Ross Perot.

<HEADLINE> Braves Falling Apart in All Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fall Classic? The Bad News Braves are giving a  
performance worthy of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	The hitters are taking horrible swings. The fielders are sloppy.  
The pitchers can't hit their spots. 
</P>
<P>
	It wouldn't be so bad if this was Florida in February. But this  
was Turner Field in October, when four victories are needed to 
secure the title as Team of the Decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, this World Series looks more like the Debacle of the  
Decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees, willing and able to take advantage of  
every mistake, are halfway home to their 25th championship, blowing 
through Atlanta like a sweep in the making. 
</P>
<P>
	New York leads 2-0 in the best-of-7 World Series after a 7-2  
rout of the Braves on Sunday night. The next three games are at 
Yankee Stadium, though two might be enough if things don't change 
dramatically for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not playing like the team that won 103 games,'' reliever  
John Rocker said. ``We haven't looked good in any area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only consolation: Atlanta is in virtually the same  
predicament that faced New York three years ago, when the Braves 
outscored the AL champs 16-1 to win the first two games at Yankee 
Stadium. New York took the title by winning the next four, 
including three in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there are just seven players on the Atlanta roster  
who played in the '96 Series, so the Braves might have to be 
content with being runnerup for the fourth time this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1996 Series has no bearing on this Series as far as I'm  
concerned,'' said Terry Mulholland, acquired in a midseason trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's hitters look downright futile against New York's wily  
pitchers, who clearly know that just about everyone except Chipper 
Jones is willing to swing at offerings beyond the limits of the 
strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe if Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez were able to play,  
things would be different. But with a revamped lineup that included 
three players -- Ozzie Guillen, Keith Lockhart and Greg Myers -- 
making their first starts of the postseason, the Braves had only 
five hits to follow up their two-hit, 4-1 loss in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest thing to a rally came in the ninth Sunday, when the  
Braves put together three hits and two meaningless runs before a 
mostly empty stadium. They are batting just .121 (7-of-58) in the 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens all the time during a 162-game schedule,'' hitting  
coach Don Baylor said. ``Right now, it's the World Series. When 
you're the last two teams playing, it becomes more magnified 
anytime you're struggling for runs. But we're not just struggling 
for runs. We're struggling for hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 was basically over after the top half of the first. Chuck  
Knoblauch led off against Kevin Millwood by lining an 0-2 pitch for 
a single. Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill followed with hits as well, 
the latter driving in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, the Braves' most consistent starter and the same guy  
who threw a one-hitter against Houston in the division series, had 
a chance to escape when Bernie Williams hit into a double play. But 
Tino Martinez singled in another run, Ricky Ledee walked and Scott 
Brosius made it 3-0 with yet another line-drive single. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third, the Yankees finished off Millwood, who suffered  
his shortest outing of the season. Williams singled, Martinez 
singled and Ledee doubled in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox walked slowly to the mound to remove Millwood,  
who had gone at least five innings in every start -- 33 in a row -- 
since lasting just 3 1-3 innings at Los Angeles on April 20. Of the 
eight hits he surrendered, five came with two strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would get ahead in the count, then throw it down the middle  
of the plate,'' Millwood said. ``You can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was time for the defense to fall apart.  
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, inserted for offense, cost a run at shortstop when he  
inexplicably dropped David Cone's soft liner in the fourth with two 
outs and a runner at third. Cox, looking on from the dugout, held 
his hands over his cap in disbelieving anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just made one mistake,'' Guillen said. ``We didn't lose the  
game because of my mistake. We lost the game because we didn't 
score any runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart contributed to the defensive woes at second base. In  
the fourth, Martinez hit a grounder that should have been an 
inning-ending double play, but Lockhart bobbled the relay throw 
from Guillen and made a hurried, off-target throw to first, 
allowing another run to score. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, some Atlanta fans already were slipping out the gates  
at Turner Field. The ample New York contingent remained to the end, 
chanting ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!''

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Earnings Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.'s third  
quarter earnings rose 18 percent, excluding restructuring costs and 
legal fees related to a federal fraud investigation, as the 
nation's largest hospital chain benefitted from higher patient 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings from continuing operations were $155 million, or 27  
cents per share, compared to $131 million or 20 cents per share a 
year ago. Results beat Wall Street forecasts by two cents, 
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the one-time costs, net income in the quarter was $138  
million, or 24 cents per share, compared to $146 million, or 22 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues fell 15 percent to $3.9 billion from $4.6 billion. The  
decline reflects the sale or spin-off of about 100 hospitals and 
more than 20 ambulatory surgery centers since September 1998. 
Nashville-based Columbia now operates 214 hospitals and 84 
ambulatory surgery centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring was prompted by a federal investigation into  
allegations the company systematically overcharged government 
health programs. Columbia officials are negotiating with the 
federal government in an attempt to end the 2 1/2-year-old 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Columbia middle managers in Florida were convicted last  
summer of conspiring to defraud and defrauding several government 
health insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Same facility admissions increased a healthy 2 percent in the  
quarter -- the fourth straight quarter of such increases -- and same 
facility revenue was up 5.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia officials said earnings were depressed by lower  
Medicaid fees, increased drug costs and higher bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia shares were unchanged at $21.75 in early trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Columbia earned $566  
million, or 95 cents per share, compared to $421 million, or 65 
cents per share a year ago. Revenues fell 11 percent to $12.7 
billion from $14.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, GOP Joust Over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today dismissed House  
Republicans' call for a scaled-back tax cut as ``a bad idea'' and 
said that it was at odds with the special interest spending that 
lawmakers have woven into federal spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, they're suggesting across the board cuts,''  
said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``Then on the 
other,... they've done a record number of earmarked pork 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed a $792 billion tax cut passed by  
Congress in September. Lockhart was reacting to a new House 
proposal for a 1.4 percent across the board cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that's a bad idea. It abdicates legislators'  
and the president's responsibility to make choices, to set 
priorities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this at a time when members have voted themselves a  
pretty significant pay raise is going to raise problems with 
Americans all across this country,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's spokesman also criticized House GOP leaders Tom  
DeLay and Dick Armey of Texas for having ``attacked this nation's 
military leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey suggested on Friday that the military could get by with a  
smaller budget if, when Pentagon officials come to brief Congress, 
``instead of having two colonels hold your paper, you'll have only 
one major.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart called Armey's comments ``insulting to the Pentagon.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He ought to think long and hard about repeating things along  
the lines that he said,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans accused the White House of holding  
hostage a bill funding the Defense Department in order to gain 
leverage for administrative initiatives, such as teacher hiring and 
funding for more community police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the $268 billion defense measure, which includes pay  
raises for the military is politically popular, a Clinton veto 
could prove difficult to override according to the top House 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to uphold these vetoes and I'm going to work very  
hard to do that,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri 
said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has signed seven of the 13 spending bills to fund the  
government in the 2000 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. He has 
vetoed two -- on foreign aid and the District of Columbia -- and has 
yet to act on three others, including the defense bill. The largest 
spending bill, dealing with education and health and social 
services, remains before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense bill, approved by wide margins in the House and  
Senate, would increase spending by $17.3 billion and raise military 
pay by 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has until Tuesday to sign the bill or veto it.  
Meanwhile, government agencies whose spending bills have not been 
signed into law are operating under stopgap legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some compromises. We don't need confrontation right  
now,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to me like Dick Gephardt is talking about  
confrontation,'' Domenici said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``He's 
telling the House members, don't help the Republicans with 
anything. He's trying to encourage the president not to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., questioned the reach of  
Gephardt's lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's been used by the left wing of his party, and  
doesn't want to get our work done,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would like to put all the appropriations bills into a big  
bundle and then spend more money. And that's what's happened over 
the years, we're just not going to do that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House economic adviser Gene Sperling defended the threat.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we can come together on that budget, then the president  
won't have to veto anything,'' Sperling said on CNN. ``We certainly 
don't want to veto the defense bill, nobody does, but we need to 
make sure we have an honest budget. Right now, there are some 
problems in that defense budget.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Advance Strongly / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grains and soybeans gained strongly Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as investors responded to the recent price 
slump by buying futures at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans' surge reversed the commodity's direction from a  
30-cent slide over last three days last week, with the market 
apparently having bottomed out after hitting seven-week lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were limited, however, by beneficial weather in the  
Midwest that has helped the U.S. harvest become nearly completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also advanced, helped by the soybean rally and  
larger-than-expected weekly export figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also increased in price, pushed higher by mounting  
concern over dryness in the U.S. winter-wheat belt and from 
Algeria's tender for wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 4 cents to $2.62 a bushel;  
December corn rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.01 3/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/2 cents to $1.10 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 6 cents to 
$4.78 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures retreated in trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle fell 1.43 cents to 67.77 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle fell 1.45 cents to 79.65 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs fell .80 cent to 48.45 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies fell 1.17 cents to 63.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Bacteria Killer Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) --For as little as a penny a burger,  
consumers could soon be certain that ground beef is free of 
food-borne bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Titan Corp. officials unveiled their new electric pasteurization  
process Monday at a test facility in Sioux City. 
</P>
<P>
	The SureBeam process, which uses electricity to process meat,  
vegetables, fruits and other foods, already has won approval from 
the Food and Drug Administration and expects acceptance from the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this does is eliminate 99.99999 percent of harmful  
bacteria, of food pathogens,'' Gene W. Ray, president, chairman and 
chief executive officer of the San Diego-based company. ``The FDA 
and USDA, they've taken all the research that has been done and 
come up with those numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate  
that 76 million people are sickened each year by food-borne 
bacteria, such as E. coli, salmonella and listeria, with 325,000 
hospitalized, and 500 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, children in five states became ill with hepatitis A  
after eating strawberries from Mexico. That same year, Hudson Food 
Co. recalled 25 million pounds of ground beef tainted with E. coli. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health estimates the annual cost of  
food-borne diseases at $5 billion to $6 billion dollars in direct 
medical expenditures and lost productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Titan already has signed contracts, pending USDA approval, with  
some of the biggest names in U.S. food processing: IBP, Emmpak, 
Cargill, ConAgra and Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Predominantly, we'll be expanding into their facilities. We'll  
be putting one of these into each production line,'' Ray said. 
``And some of these places have five or six production lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A SureBeam processor is set to go online at Hawaii Pride in  
March or April to pasteurize mangoes. Ray said that operation 
doesn't need USDA approval because it's fruit, not meat. 
</P>
<P>
	The SureBeam process has no effect on the taste or quality of  
food. Titan officials warned that electronic pasteurization does 
not lengthen a food's shelf life and that consumers should still be 
careful in handling meat as so to avoid contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology has its origins in the Cold War. The company's  
SureBeam electron accelerator originally won contracts in the 
1980s, when the Pentagon envisioned lasers zapping incoming enemy 
missiles. In 1992, though, the device was adapted to the business 
of sterilizing packaged medical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's technology works by charging an electronic beam  
that disrupts the DNA structure of the microorganisms it hits, 
rendering them sterile. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative pasteurization process now being used, called  
irradiation, exposes food to gamma rays from radioactive material, 
such as Cobalt 60. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not irradiation under another name,'' said Sen. Tom  
Harkin, D-Iowa, ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology is totally different in that you have  
radioactive material vs. electricity,'' said Dennis G. Olson, 
director of the Utilization Center for Agricultural Products at 
Iowa State University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SureBeam technology is as safe as a microwave oven,''  
Olson said. ``Since electronic pasteurization is effective on all 
types of meats, poultry, fruits, vegetables and grains -- fresh or 
frozen -- the process will revolutionize the way we safeguard our 
food supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Food processed at the Sioux City plant, including chicken and  
ground beef, will be sold in test markets beginning early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Titan has contracts with companies that produce approximately 75  
percent of the 8 to 9 billion pounds of ground beef produced in the 
United States annually. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some controversy surrounds SureBeam. The Center for  
Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in 
Washington, D.C., wants labels describing beef processed by Titan's 
technology to read ``treated by irradiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advocacy group says a nationwide poll of more than 1,000  
people it jointly conducted found that 58 percent wanted an 
irradiation label; only 15 percent preferred a label declaring 
products to have been treated by electronic pasteurization, which 
is preferred by Titan. 
</P>
<P>
	Titan provides communications and information technology to U.S.  
military and allied government agencies and commercial customers. 
For the six months ended June 30, revenues rose 20 percent to 
$168.2 million. The company has 3,100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Irradiation has been used for years on limited amounts of  
produce, spices, poultry and other foods. But only a few small 
retailers have offered irradiated products. On a space mission last 
year, John Glenn and his fellow astronauts ate irradiated food.

<HEADLINE> Packers Gets Back Into Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Less structure on defense and more  
passion on offense formed the right combination to produce the 
Green Bay Packers' first convincing win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay pounded the San Diego Chargers 31-3 on Sunday in its  
best performance during Ray Rhodes' tenure as coach. Rhodes ended 
his personal 19-game road losing streak, though he wasn't at all 
impressed with that particular achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was most pleased with how we responded to all the challenges  
we had in that game,'' Rhodes said Monday. ``We got ahead, we kept 
getting ahead, and when we had a chance to put them away a little 
bit, we did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers scaled back defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas'  
schemes before the game, and it paid off handsomely. With defensive 
players concerned more with making plays and less with remembering 
assignments, Green Bay intercepted six passes and held the Chargers 
to 3.6 yards per play. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers linebacker Brian Williams, who had six tackles in  
another outstanding game despite a sore knee, credited a sound 
performance by the team's banged-up defensive line with turning the 
game in Green Bay's favor. Defensive tackle Santana Dotson missed 
his fourth straight game with a stinger injury in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone talks about the simplicity of our defense, but nobody  
talks about the pressure we got on their quarterbacks,'' Williams 
said. ``When your line is doing as well as ours did against their 
line, all of a sudden the quarterback's under pressure and those 
interceptions come a lot more easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's offense rebounded from its horrendous performance at  
Denver and scored four touchdowns, three on passes by Brett Favre. 
Antonio Freeman's 3-yard catch late in the third quarter put the 
game away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were winless on the road this year, so it was time for us  
to re-establish ourselves,'' Freeman said. ``Our offensive line led 
us. They kept Junior (Seau) quiet for most of the day, and the rest 
was easier because of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Rhodes and several players cited the return to  
the lineup of right tackle Earl Dotson, who has had a bulging disc 
in his back all season long. Dotson, who missed the Packers' loss 
at Denver, played an outstanding game in San Diego and said he 
didn't re-injure his back doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	With his Packers firing on all cylinders again, Rhodes turned  
his attention to a week of managing his players' emotions before 
Mike Holmgren returns to Lambeau Field next Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them we just have another week against another good  
football team,'' Rhodes said. ``I'm sure it will be more emotional, 
but we have to do the same good things that got us a win on 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outstanding performance answered many questions about the  
team's desire and ability, but the Packers realize they will spend 
this week answering questions about Holmgren, who left Green Bay 
last winter to become head coach and general manager of the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's visit to Green Bay is the most anticipated game of the  
season in a town where an intrasquad scrimmage draws more than 
50,000 fans to Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fans will have a field day with him coming back,''  
Freeman said. ``We as a football team can't get caught up in that 
hype, but it's going to be exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Exercise May Reduce Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Women who exercise an hour a day or more may  
reduce their risk of breast cancer by 20 percent, according to one 
of the biggest studies ever done on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, published in Monday's Archives of Internal  
Medicine, add to the growing evidence that exercise can help 
prevent breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller 1997 study in Norway found that women who exercised at  
least four hours a week were about a third less likely to get 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the evidence suggests that there's nothing to lose by  
women being physically active,'' said Beverly Rockhill, lead author 
of the most recent study and a researcher at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe exercise may affect breast cancer because it  
lowers the level of estrogen circulating in a woman's body. 
Estrogen has been found to stimulate breast cell growth, increasing 
the chances of cancer, Rockhill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study was based on the analysis of questionnaires  
from 121,701 women nationwide who participated in the Nurses' 
Health Study, a long-term health survey of women ages 30 to 55. 
Rockhill and her colleagues looked at data from 1980 to 1994. They 
found 3,137 cases of breast cancer among the 85,364 women who 
answered questions about physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, 20 percent fewer women who exercised an average of  
once a day or more got breast cancer, compared with those who 
exercised less than an hour a week. The exercise included brisk 
walking and jogging but not things like housework or gardening. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers adjusted their data for factors such as weight  
and hormone use but not for diet and smoking, since neither factor 
appeared to be that that different among active and inactive women, 
Rockhill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Brinton, chief of the environmental epidemiology branch  
at the National Cancer Institute, said the findings are more likely 
to be accurate than some other studies because the women were asked 
about their exercise habits when they were actually exercising. 
Other studies have asked participants to remember how active they 
were in the past.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan May Not Get German Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- A German company that has been trying for months  
to get government permission to sell a $34 million Earth 
observation satellite to Taiwan will not be granted an export 
permit, a reliable source said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came as a Taiwanese newspaper reported that Taipei has  
decided to purchase the equipment from France instead. The China 
Times said the United States and other competitors in the aerospace 
market also are pushing for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hwang Jenn-tai, chairman of the Taiwanese government's National  
Science Council, which oversees the satellite project, accused the 
Chinese government of interfering to keep manufacturer Dornier 
Satellite System from getting the necessary permit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Communist China went through the German government to put  
pressure on Dornier and prevent them from obtaining the permit,'' 
Hwang told reporters in Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment on Taiwan's reported new deal with the  
French firm Aerospatiale Matra. 
</P>
<P>
	German Economics Ministry spokesman Frank Bonaldo said the  
German government's Federal Security Council had not yet ruled on 
the export permit, adding that it had until Nov. 15 to act. 
</P>
<P>
	But a reliable source in Berlin, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, told The Associated Press that Dornier would not get its 
permit. He did not elaborate on the government's reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonaldo said he did not know whether Beijing had sought to  
pressure the German government to block the deal, but he noted 
Beijing never advocates trade with Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	According to media reports in Taiwan, Beijing fears Taiwan will  
use the satellite to spy. Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 
1949, and China continues to regard the island as a breakaway 
province to be reunified by force if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dornier spokesman in Germany, Matthias Pikelj, said Dornier  
had not been informed by Taiwan that the deal for the ROCSAT-2 was 
off, although he conceded Taiwan has signaled that it was getting 
impatient and would start looking for new partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Dornier applied for the permit in February, he said, adding that  
``with every day we have to wait, it raises the chances of us 
losing the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pikelj denied that the satellite was intended for military or  
espionage usage. He said the small Earth observation satellite was 
intended for civilian applications, such as monitoring natural 
catastrophes and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Times said the French firm, Aerospatiale Matra, has  
agreed to build the satellite for the same price and meet the 
deadlines and technical conditions specified in the original 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	China has accepted French assurances that the satellite will not  
have a military capability and has not raised objections to 
Aerospatiale Matra taking on the project, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dornier is a unit of Germany's leading aerospace firm,  
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, which this month announced plans to 
merge with Aerospatiale Matra. They hope to begin joint operations 
by next June.

<HEADLINE> McKeon Unsure If He'll Manage Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jack McKeon doesn't know if he'll manage the  
Cincinnati Reds again. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon spent the weekend at his North Carolina home watching his  
grandchildren, taking in the World Series and thinking about the 
club's disappointing contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Sunday night, he hadn't decided whether to accept the  
offer of a one-year extension with a minimal raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in the next day or so,'' McKeon said, in a telephone  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	He's got a tough choice to make.  
</P>
<P>
	McKeon returned to his home in Elon College, N.C., after meeting  
with Reds managing executive John Allen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got an offer. There was no negotiating,'' McKeon said.  
``They said it was a firm offer. There was no movement at all on 
their part. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the way you look at it is: It's take it or leave it.''  
</P>
<P>
	McKeon, who turns 69 next month, is a candidate for the NL  
Manager of the Year award. He led the Reds to 96 victories -- their 
best total since 1976 -- despite a $35 million payroll last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds missed out on the playoffs by losing a one-game  
tiebreaker for the NL wild card berth to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon's one-year contract expired at the end of the season, and  
the front office had to wait until a new ownership group took over 
for Marge Schott before talking to McKeon about an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	During the season, McKeon made it clear he wanted at least a  
two-year deal and a raise that would put him on par with other 
managers. McKeon made a little more than $500,000 last season in 
base salary and incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' offer reportedly contained a pay increase of about  
$50,000 over last season. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching other recent manager hires, McKeon expected a  
much better offer. Buddy Bell recently got a three-year contract 
from Colorado reportedly worth $2.25 million, and the Detroit 
Tigers gave Phil Garner a four-year deal reportedly worth $1.2 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' McKeon said of the Reds' offer. ``I thought  
they'd have a better figure than they gave.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Prayer Helps Heart Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Heart patients who had someone praying over them  
-- without their knowledge -- suffered 10 percent fewer 
complications, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's potentially a natural explanation we don't understand  
yet. It's potentially a super- or other-than-natural mechanism,'' 
said William S. Harris, a heart researcher who was lead author of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and other researchers at the Mid America Heart Institute,  
the heart program of St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., 
studied 990 patients admitted during a year to the institute's 
coronary care unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients were randomly divided into two groups. In one,  
patients were prayed for daily by community volunteers for four 
weeks; the other patients didn't have anyone assigned to pray for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients, their families and their caregivers were not even  
told they were in a study. The volunteers were told only the first 
names of the patients and asked to pray daily for their speedy 
recovery with no complications. 
</P>
<P>
	After four weeks, the prayed-for patients had suffered about 10  
percent fewer complications, ranging from chest pain to cardiac 
arrest, researchers reported in Monday's issue of the Archives of 
Internal Medicine, published by the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest that prayer might be an effective addition  
to standard medical care, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Harris acknowledged that his study had  
limitations. Among other things, many patients in the comparison 
group undoubtedly had friends and relatives praying for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the work said the study and a similar  
1988 one in San Francisco that involved 393 heart patients had 
questionable methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Both studies tallied complications using their own scoring  
systems, which have not been proved medically valid, said the 
expert, Dr. Herbert Benson, a professor of medicine at Harvard 
Medical School and president of the Mind/Body Medical Institute at 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studies have found no apparent benefits to being prayed  
for, and in one, prayed-for patients actually fared worse, Benson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson said medical research has shown that people who believe  
in God or in prayer generally fare better than those who don't. 
What remains unproven is whether prayer itself makes a difference, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Gather at Stewart's Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDERMERE, Fla. (AP) -- Some of golf's best players gathered at  
the gated and landscaped mansion Payne Stewart called home. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors brought flowers and spoke of the man who died in a  
plane crash Monday and was one of the most recognizable players in 
his sport. 
</P>
<P>
	At the lakeside home, about 10 miles southwest of Orlando,  
police cars protected the family's privacy and reporters were kept 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	After word spread of the Learjet crash in South Dakota, some of  
golf's finest paid their respects at Stewart's home. Among them 
were Lee Janzen and his wife, Mark O'Meara, Scott Hoch and Ernie 
Els. 
</P>
<P>
	The 800-acre Isleworth community of sprawling mansions,  
bass-filled lakes and vigilant security guards is home to some of 
the biggest names in pro sports -- Stewart, O'Meara and Tiger Woods 
in golf, Ken Griffey Jr. in baseball, Penny Hardway in basketball 
and Todd Woodbridge in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and friends of Stewart's children, 13-year-old Chelsea  
and 10-year-old Aaron, recalled Payne as friendly and easygoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a straight-up nice guy,'' said 12-year-old Jonathan  
Caballero. ``He would come out here and play with the kids, all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Brown, 13, said, ``He used to play tag with us, but he  
wasn't any good at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Cooki Spears stopped by the Stewart home to deliver  
flowers with her 11-year-old son, Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne was an unbelievable person,'' a tearful Spears said. ``I  
don't know why God took him but I'm sure there's a reason. He was 
fun to be with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her son was very close with Aaron.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever my son spent the night at their house, Payne got up  
first thing in the morning and made pancakes for them. He made them 
breakfast, and he horsed around with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Curry, a family friend, read a statement outside the gates  
of the Stewart home: ``We appreciate the heartfelt love and 
kindness shown by our friends and loved ones in our loss of pain. 
We know he is with the Lord and in that we take comfort. Please 
keep the Stewart family in your prayers along with the families of 
Robert Fraley, Van Ardan, and the two pilots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning his second U.S. Open in June, the 42-year-old  
Stewart had spoken of his renewed faith and inner peace. Winner of 
three major championships and a member of five Ryder Cup teams, 
Stewart had also recently talked about trying to keep golf in 
perspective and spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jim Henry, a retired pastor for First Baptist Church of  
Orlando, used to minister to the Stewart family. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a wonderful Christian who had Christ in his life and  
somehow in his death,'' he said. ``That brought a great sense of 
peace to his family in a difficult and tragic time.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expresses Sorrow Over Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton expressed his sorrow Monday  
for the death of golf champion Payne Stewart and the others on his 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, an enthusiastic golfer himself, said at the White  
House: 
</P>
<P>
	``I am profoundly sorry for the loss of Payne Stewart, who has  
had such a remarkable career and impact on his sport and a 
remarkable resurgence in the last couple of years, and the members 
of his group, including the two pilots and two others who were with 
him. It's a very sad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also praised the work of the Federal Aviation  
Administration and the military pilots and others who monitored 
Stewart's plane and tried to make contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did everything that could humanly be done, and they were  
looking out for the safety of everyone involved, and I'm just sorry 
that it crashed and what happened happened,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> World Series Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After missing the first two games of the World  
Series to take the body of his father to Venezuela for burial, Luis 
Sojo intends to rejoin the New York Yankees on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre decided to use Sojo as a late-inning  
defensive replacement for second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who made 
26 errors during the regular season and has thrown erratically at 
times during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Sojo's father died Thursday, and New York decided to keep him on  
the active roster and play a man short in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sojo assured me he'd be here tomorrow,'' Torre said after  
Monday's workout at Yankee Stadium. ``Flight's supposed to land 
before noon.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STEWART REAX:* Chipper Jones was shocked to learn that his  
former agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, were killed Monday in 
the plane crash that also claimed the life of golfer Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley and Ardan worked with Jones when he signed his first  
professional contract in 1990 and were still associated with the 
player on marketing deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in shock right now,'' said Jones, who found out after he  
took the field for a workout at Yankee Stadium. ``It's hard to keep 
your mind on things. You're talking about two colleagues, two 
friends who've been a part of my life ever since I turned pro. I 
guess it's just one more distraction we've got to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the Braves were friendly with Stewart, one of five  
people killed when a LearJet flew uncontrolled for hours and 
crashed in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad thing,'' Game 3 starter Tom Glavine said. ``We are  
all sitting here talking about a World Series and that seems like 
the most important thing in the world right now, but it's something 
like that that makes you realize there are a whole lot more 
important things in the world than a baseball game or a sporting 
event for that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Game 4 starter John Smoltz: ``He exemplified how all of us  
want to be viewed. The only saving grace for his family is knowing 
he's in heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ADDING A BAT:* With the shift of the World Series to the  
American League ballpark, the Braves must insert a designated 
hitter into their lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither of them are power hitters, I suppose, but Jose  
Hernandez is going to DH tomorrow, and probably Keith Lockhart 
against the righties,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are happy to be home -- especially the pitchers who  
don't have to hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely a stronger team with the extra hitter in the  
lineup,'' Darryl Strawberry said. ``We don't lack anything without 
the DH. It just adds more punch when Chili (Davis), (Jim) Leyritz 
or I can have three or four at-bats.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SEVEN-MONTH SEASON:* Since Game 3 starter Andy Pettitte joined  
the Yankees in 1995, the team has made the playoffs every year and 
gone to the World Series three times: 1996, 1998 and this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just assume now that we're going to play 'til the end of  
October when the season starts,'' Pettitte said Monday. ``In '97, 
for me I had a real bitter taste in my mouth, getting knocked out 
in the first round. I lost two games in the postseason there to 
Cleveland. You always remember that stuff and games like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STREAKING:* During the past two postseasons, the Yankees are  
20-3, including 9-1 this year. They have won 16 of 17 playoff games 
overall, and 10 straight World Series contests since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's mark wasn't surprising, given New York's  
record-setting 114-48 record during the regular season. But the 
Yankees were 98-64 this year, good for first in the AL East but a 
drop of 16 wins, the most of any AL team 
</P>
<P>
	What's the difference between now and the regular season?  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the intensity level is a little higher,'' Derek  
Jeter said. ``Every pitch counts. -- I'm not saying it doesn't 
during the regular season. The fans are into it. It's an entirely 
different kind of baseball. I think that's something our team is 
good at -- focusing on that.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks Postseason Pitching a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a strange coincidence that keeps  
happening to the New York Yankees in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	First it was Texas' bats that went cold. Then Boston couldn't  
get a clutch hit. Now it's the Braves who can barely generate a 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's not a coincidence after all. It might be time to give  
the Yankees' pitchers some credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two years have just been one big pitching performance  
after another,'' David Cone said Monday, a day after allowing one 
hit over seven scoreless innings to give New York a 2-0 lead over 
Atlanta in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done it against Texas the last two years, San Diego last  
year and now against the Braves. It's not just the other guys not 
hitting. We have something to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have given up just 25 runs in 10 postseason games --  
13 of those when Roger Clemens and Hideki Irabu were hammered in 
Game 3 of the AL Championship Series by the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine other games, the Yankees have held the opposition to  
three or fewer runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times did we go through the rotation with the  
efficiency we had in the postseason?'' manager Joe Torre asked. ``I 
don't think we went through a full time or two with the efficiency 
we've had lately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have barely started a rally against the Yankees,  
hitting .121 and scoring three runs in the losses to Orlando 
Hernandez and Cone, who each gave up one hit over seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the few times Atlanta has put runners on, Cone and Hernandez  
have shut them down. New York held the Braves hitless in their 
first 22 at-bats with runners on, before Greg Myers' two-out single 
in the ninth inning of Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how good they are,'' Atlanta's Ryan Klesko said.  
``We shouldn't be doing this bad. We knocked Randy Johnson out 
twice and he has the best stuff in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the formula the Yankees has used all month. They might  
let runners on base, but they won't give in. Opposing batters are 
hitting .182 against New York with runners in scoring position in 
the playoffs and .140 with runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Yankees pitchers have been so successful in the  
playoffs shouldn't come as any surprise, given their track record 
the previous three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other team, the Yankees are able to exploit the  
opposition's weaknesses. This year has been no different as they've 
silenced the free swingers on Texas, Boston and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of guys on our pitching staff who won't give  
in,'' Cone said. ``We take advantage of guys who swing at pitches 
out of the strike zone and use their aggressiveness against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees pitchers give much of the credit to the detailed  
advance reports prepared by scouting director Gene Michael. They go 
over every tendency and weakness in the opposing hitters -- what 
pitches they like and don't like, and what counts they swing on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps us approach the at-bats,'' Cone said. ``We know who  
is going to swing at first pitches and we throw breaking balls to 
them early in the count. It's just pitching backwards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre knows that good scouting means nothing without  
pitchers who can execute a game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't go out there without the quality pitchers and expect  
to be as successful as we have been,'' Torre said. ``It's not just 
because we picked something up or we know that he can't hit this 
particular pitch or that. It's still a matter of going from the 
hand to the catcher's mitt. That takes a lot more than knowing what 
to do.''

<HEADLINE>  Senators Sign Joe Juneau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Unrestricted free agent Joe Juneau said Sunday  
night he has agreed to terms on a contract with the Ottawa 
Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	TSN, a sports cable network in Canada, reported it was a  
one-year deal for $1.7 million, with an option year. With 
incentives, Juneau could end up earning $2.2 million, says the 
Ottawa Sun, which reported Ottawa-based agent Larry Kelly as 
confirming the signing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old center is entering his ninth full NHL season. He  
previously played with Boston, Washington and Buffalo, and has 114 
goals in 482 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a very good chance to join a team that's going great, a  
team that really has a chance to go far and win the Stanley Cup,'' 
Juneau told the all-sports network. ``That's what was really 
exciting and a big reason why I'm doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau and the Senators had been negotiating for some time, but  
talks turned serious on the weekend after captain Daniel Alfredsson 
tore ligaments in his right knee 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau said he expects to be in the lineup for Saturday's game  
against the Florida Panthers, and possibly as early as Thursday 
against the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shooting for the first game,'' Juneau told the Sun.  
``Being at home I had no choice but to stay busy and work out, but 
I'm looking forward to practicing with the guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Larry I didn't care if it took until Christmas (to make  
a deal), I told him if I had to take less money it was because I 
wanted a chance to play for a team that could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, coach Jacques Martin said Shawn McEachern will be the  
Ottawa Senators' third captain this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Former captain Alexei Yashin is holding out in Switzerland and  
his replacement, Alfredsson, will be lost for eight to 10 weeks 
because the knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Van Allen will join Wade Redden as an assistant captain,  
Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Graham Tells Dole To Keep the Faith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALISBURY, N.C. (AP) -- Evangelist Billy Graham has told  
Elizabeth Dole that God is preparing her for something more 
important than being the Republican presidential candidate next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Dole on Thursday, the day after she abandoned her  
quest for the White House, Graham said, ``I have always loved and 
admired you, and felt that you would make a great leader for our 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said she must accept the outcome as God's will, and urged her  
not to be discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lord is preparing both you and Bob for something even more  
important,'' Graham wrote Dole. ``I am sure that is hard to believe 
at the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole faxed a copy of Graham's letter to her mother, 98-year-old  
Mary Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hadn't talked with me in advance,'' Mrs. Hanford said.  
``She didn't want to trouble me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hanford said her daughter, who called her after her  
televised withdrawal, had enjoyed the campaign for the Republican 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't want people to be giving their money to a losing  
cause. That's not right, and I'm real proud of her because she has 
that attitude,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Mutant Genes, Leukemia Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Adults who have certain mutant genes are  
far less likely to develop a form of leukemia than those with 
normal genes, according to a study released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutant genes metabolize folic acid and apparently pump  
higher-than-normal amounts of the vitamin into DNA production, 
according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Acute lymphocytic leukemia, which destroys bone marrow, is often  
fatal and accounts for 10 percent of adult leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found that people with two mutant genes were more  
than five times less likely to develop the leukemia. Even those 
with only one of the mutant genes were three to four times less 
likely to get the cancer, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also suggests that even people who do not have the  
mutant genes can reduce their risk of cancer by getting enough 
folic acid in their diet, said Martyn Smith, a toxicology professor 
at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it tells us is that folate is important in preventing  
this type of leukemia,'' said Smith. ``In the absence of this 
genetic protection, it's important to get our folate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acute lymphocytic leukemia is most common form of childhood  
leukemia. The study released Monday does not address the mutant 
genes' possible effect on children. Another study is underway to 
investigate that issue. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated one-third of adults have both mutant genes, which  
help produce the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, 
or MTHFR. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies have shown that people with one of the mutant  
genes have half the colorectal cancer risk of people without it. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 participants in the study had either acute lymphocytic  
leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. Nearly 500 were healthy. 
Researchers working in England found no correlation between mutant 
genes and development of acute myeloid leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Folic acid, one of the chemicals in the vitamin B complex, is  
found in liver, oranges and green vegetables such as spinach. 
People with the mutant genes who don't get enough folic acid may 
not receive the same protective benefits, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 28,000 adults and 5,000 children in the United States are  
diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia annually.

<HEADLINE> Barak Pledges To Work With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Affirming an alliance that worries the  
Arab world, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Monday pledged to 
boost military cooperation and economic ties with Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's visit, the first to Turkey by an Israeli prime minister  
in 40 years, comes amid a wave of goodwill over Israel's aid to 
Turkey in the aftermath of the August earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing Turkish-Israeli alliance has made neighbors in the  
region, especially Syria, nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak and Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit sought to  
reassure them Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between Turkey and Israel, Barak said, ``are not  
meant, God forbid, to harm any other people or country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit called the relationship ``one of peace and not of war,''  
but said he gave ``utmost importance'' to increasing defense 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengthening military ties was high on the agenda.  
</P>
<P>
	Barak, who is also defense minister, was expected to push for  
four main arms deals: the sale of short- and long-range drones, 
joint production of Popeye 2 air-to-surface missiles, the sale of 
new tanks and upgrades for old ones and a contract for fighter 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel is already upgrading Turkey's Phantom fighter jets, and  
the two countries plan joint naval maneuvers in the Mediterranean 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no  
defense deals were finalized in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also discussed developing water resources -- a  
critical subject for Israel, suffering its worst drought in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said Turkey and Israel would cooperate on regional water  
projects. The Israeli official said later that Turkey also wanted 
to sell water to the Palestinians and was discussing the 
possibilities with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has suggested selling Israel water from the Manavgat  
River, which spills fresh water into the Mediterranean Sea. The 
water could be transported by pipeline or tanker or in huge plastic 
bubbles that would be hauled over the 400 miles of sea separating 
the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries also decided to establish a joint fund for  
research and development in science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to meeting with Ecevit, Turkish President Suleyman  
Demirel and Defense Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, Barak attended 
the dedication of an Israeli-built village for survivors of the 
earthquake. Israel donated $5 million to build 132 prefabricated 
houses for about 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people have gone through a terrible disaster,'' Barak  
said of the quake survivors, but ``they have the resources and will 
to overcome it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the ceremony ended, 60 Turkish women demonstrated across from  
the still-empty houses, demanding housing for their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel played a prominent role in rescue efforts following the  
quake, setting up field hospitals and freeing survivors trapped 
under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish officials said several countries had promised to build  
temporary housing, but only Israel had followed through so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, whose visit ends Monday night, was the first Israeli  
premier to visit Turkey since David Ben-Gurion came here secretly 
in 1958.

<HEADLINE> Slaying Blamed on Drug Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Ten days after he began taking a widely  
used medicine called Adderall to control his attention deficit 
disorder and help him with his college studies, Ryan Ehlis slipped 
into a psychotic fog and killed his infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	God, he said, told him to do it.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, the 24-year-old University of North Dakota student is out  
of jail and back in school, acquitted of murder by a judge who 
ruled his psychotic state was an extremely rare side effect of 
Adderall. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts and the drug's manufacturer say that despite the  
slaying, Adderall remains a safe and effective drug for controlling 
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days after taking the medicine in January, Ehlis started  
hearing voices. He believed God was telling him to leave his body 
and bring his daughter with him to save the world, said his lawyer, 
John Thelen. 
</P>
<P>
	His conditioned worsened until, on Jan. 30, Ehlis killed his  
5-week-old daughter, Tara, with a shotgun, then shot himself in the 
abdomen. He recovered from the wound and was charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, psychiatrists testified before a judge that  
the shootings happened solely because of a psychotic state caused 
by the prescription drug. Judge Debbie Kleven agreed, ruling that 
Ehlis lacked the capacity to understand what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehlis has declined comment on the case but said he returned to  
normal days after he stopped taking the medication. He is back home 
with his common-law wife and three other children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing very well, and my family is doing pretty good, too,  
considering the circumstances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug's labeling warns that in very rare cirumstances, it can  
cause ``psychotic episodes at recommended doses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always been aware there was a very slight risk of  
psychotic side effects with this drug, but this was the most severe 
case that's ever occurred,'' said Stefan Antonsson, vice president 
of marketing for Shire Richwood Inc., the Florence, Ky., maker of 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Adderall was made available on a widespread basis in 1996,  
the company has received 10 reports of ``general psychotic events'' 
from the drug's use, Antonsson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all seemed to resolve without significant injury to the  
user or other people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a million Adderall prescriptions were written in 1997,  
Antonsson said. That figure rose to 2.3 million in 1998, and in the 
first nine months of this year the number has increased to 2.7 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During clinical trials of the drug, Antonsson said, there were  
no reported instances of psychotic disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are advised to prescribe it under close medical  
supervision. Ehlis did not seek medical attention, apparently 
because he did not realize he was having a psychotic event. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Swanson, a professor at the University of California  
at Irvine who has studied Adderall, said he was surprised to hear 
of Ehlis' violent reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that in high doses this would be a real concern, but  
not at the typical doses that are prescribed for clinical 
treatment,'' Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thelen said the drug was prescribed to Ehlis by a psychiatrist,  
and Ehlis was taking the prescribed dosage. 
</P>
<P>
	As a boy, Ehlis had been diagnosed with ADHD and had taken  
Ritalin. Adderall is considered similar to Ritalin but is thought 
to be more effective in some cases for ADHD. Ritalin also carries a 
warning about potential psychosis in extremely rare cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of 10 extreme reactions to Adderall known by the company,  
Antonsson described how a 7-year-old boy became aggressive and 
defiant. When the boy quit using the drug, he improved, Antonsson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehlis is taking no medication for his ADHD, his lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Picket Overnite Trans. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Picket lines went up in seven states at  
Overnite Transportation Co. terminals, but a company spokesman said 
that operations would not be hindered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters union set up pickets today in Illinois, Kentucky,  
New York, Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Memphis and La Vergne, Tenn. 
Overnite, one of the nation's largest trucking companies, is based 
in Richmond,. Va., and employs more than 13,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Picketers planned to follow trucks out of the Memphis terminal  
today, and ask customers not to accept deliveries, said John 
Murphy, a Teamsters organizer. Early in the day, only a few trucks 
left the premises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect them to send out a whole lot of trucks at once, to  
try and confuse us,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsidiary of Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific, Overnite  
competes in the less-than-truckload industry, in which the trucking 
company coordinates and consolidates small shipments of less than a 
truckload for pickup and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters and Overnite have been trying to negotiate a  
contract for four years for the 21 centers where the union 
represents employees. The company has 160 terminals in the United 
States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of bargaining in good faith, there has been a pattern  
of retaliation and violence against union supporters,'' John 
Murphy, a Teamsters organizer, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite spokesman Ira Rosenfeld said the strike was not  
affecting operations, and he didn't expect it to. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire network is open, and will continue to be so,''  
Rosenfeld said. ``We have a strike contingency plan. We use dock 
workers and drivers not on strike, and we also have temporary 
replacement workers. We're not anticipating any major difficulties. 
...
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is the vast number of picketers are not  
employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major issue is the pension system. Overnite wants to retain  
control while the Teamsters want to put pension money into a union 
fund. Both sides have said wages are not a major factor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Chicago suburb of Bedford Park, Overnite terminal manager  
Ray Kruger said he expected to continue operations using the strike 
contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the people scheduled to work today are working,''  
Kruger said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jeffersontown, Ky., near Louisville, picketers were marching  
Sunday night, and Teamster member Kevin Oliva said he expected 
there to be 150 protesters by today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenfeld said the Teamsters staged a similar walkout earlier  
this year that was ineffectual. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing happened.,'' he said. ``They walked out of 11  
terminals in July. Five days later they were back. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand, we have 160 terminals.''

<HEADLINE> Pat Gillick Is New GM of Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Pat Gillick, who led the Toronto Blue Jays to  
consecutive World Series titles, is the new general manager of the 
Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	At an afternoon news conference, Mariners chairman Howard  
Lincoln praised Gillick as an experienced general manager, and 
``most important, he has a history of fielding championship 
teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past five weeks, the Mariners had been interviewing  
possible replacements for GM Woody Woodward, who announced his 
resignation Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick, 62, led the Blue Jays to titles in 1992-93. He also  
served as general manager of the Baltimore Orioles from 1995 until 
his retirement after last season. He has twice been named 
baseball's Executive of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick was the first candidate interviewed by Mariners  
president Chuck Armstrong. But on Oct. 7, Gillick withdrew his 
name, saying his wife, Doris, who runs an art gallery in Toronto, 
did not want to move to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he reportedly reconsidered, and flew to Seattle last  
week to meet with Mariners officials, The Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick was with the Blue Jays from 1976 until he stepped down  
after the 1994 season.

	Golfer Stewart, 4 Others Die in Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- A Learjet carrying champion golfer Payne  
Stewart flew uncontrolled for four hours today, its windows iced 
over and its occupants apparently incapacitated, before nosediving 
into a grassy field. All five people aboard were killed. The 
chartered, twin-engine Lear 35 may have suddenly lost cabin 
pressure soon after taking off from Orlando, Fla., for Dallas, 
government officials said. Set apparently on autopilot, the plane 
cruised 1,400 miles before it presumably ran out of fuel. Two 
officials from the Federal Aviation Administration were sent to 
investigate the crash, along with a representative from the 
National Transportation Safety Board.

	US-Taliban Talks on bin Laden Advance  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Taliban militia showed what could be at  
least a flicker of interest in expelling suspected terrorism 
kingpin Osama bin Laden in order to head off U.N. economic 
sanctions. A Taliban representative brought ``ideas'' to the State 
Department, according to department spokesman James P. Rubin. The 
United States suspects bin Laden was the mastermind of the bombings 
at U.S. embassies in Africa last year. The U.N. Security Council 
has threatened a freeze on assets overseas and a ban on flights to 
and from Afghanistan if bin Laden is not expelled by Nov. 14.

	U.N. OKs Peace Troops for E. Timor  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council today gave the United  
Nations power to run East Timor during the territory's transition 
to independence -- the biggest U.N. peacekeeping operation in five 
years. Sending more than 9,000 troops, the United Nations will take 
over East Timor's administration, rebuild its infrastructure, and 
help it toward democracy after more than a quarter of a century 
under Indonesian rule.

	Buchanan Bolts GOP for Reform Party  
</P>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- Hours after billionaire Donald Trump  
joined the New York arm of the Reform Party, Republican 
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan bolted the GOP to mount his own 
third-party campaign. Trump will decide early next year whether to 
challenge Buchanan for the Reform nomination in 2000. Though low in 
polls and money, Buchanan is considered a threat by Republicans 
because of his anti-abortion conservatism.

	Sen. Chafee Draws Bipartisan Praise  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John Chafee was mourned today as a voice  
for moderation and environmental protection in a Republican Party 
that moved ever rightward during his career. The eulogies for 
Chafee, who died yesterday of heart failure, were bipartisan. He 
``always put his concern for the American people above 
partisanship,'' said President Clinton. Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln 
Almond, a Republican, has the power to appoint a successor to serve 
for the 14 months remaining in the Senate term.

	Births to High-School Girls Fall  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Births to teen-agers fell for a seventh  
straight time last year, with births to girls of high school age 
hitting a record low, the government reported. Overall, births to 
teens ages 15 to 19 dropped by 2 percent from 1997, and were down 
18 percent since 1991. Analysts point to a number of reasons for 
the drop. Surveys show fewer teens are having sex and they're using 
more reliable forms of birth control, including long-lasting 
implants and injections. Fear of AIDS has also increased use of 
condoms.

	GTE Files AT&AMP;T Antitrust Suit  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- GTE filed an antitrust suit against AT&AMP;T in a  
federal court alleging monopolistic practices by AT&AMP;T and Comcast, 
a cable company that owns an interest in ExciteAtHome -- the 
Internet service that is controlled by AT&AMP;T. The suit complains 
that AT&AMP;T and Comcast are denying consumers the right to pick their 
Internet service by forcing them to pay an access fee to 
ExciteAtHome, regardless of whether they subscribe to an Internet 
service provider such as America Online. This case could force 
federal regulators to take a more definitive stance on cable laws.

10,349.93. On the NYSE, decliners led advancers 1,850-1,201. The 
Nasdaq fell 0.58 to 2,815.94.

	Stewart's Death Felt at PGA Event  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The PGA Tour canceled tomorrow's pro-am that was  
part of Tour Championship that Payne Stewart was supposed to play 
in. Flags flew at half staff at the Champions Golf Club course 
after it was confirmed Stewart died in today's jet crash. ``It will 
be a tough week for all the players, for myself, for the wives, 
everyone. It's a tragic situation,'' said fellow pro Jeff Maggert. 
Stewart was among the sport's top 30 money winners.

<HEADLINE> ExciteAtHome Buying Blue Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- ExciteAtHome, a leading Internet destination, is  
buying the Blue Mountain Arts electronic greeting card company for 
$780 million, a deal that will broaden Excite's Web services by 
allowing visitors to send free messages customized for special 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase announced Monday was the latest salvo by a giant  
Web portal in the fight to attract more visitors and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome, the sixth largest Web destination, will take the  
No. 5 spot from Disney's Go Network with the addition of Blue 
Mountain's Internet traffic, according to the Media Metrix research 
firm. Excite also would gain exposure for its high-speed 
residential Internet access business. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Mountain Arts Publishing Co.'s Web site is ranked No. 14  
with 9.2 million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just the first step in what will be a very aggressive  
set of steps for us,'' said Excite President George Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jared Schutz, executive director of Bluemountain.com, assured  
users that the popular electronic cards, which feature dancing and 
singing characters, will remain free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome agreed to pay $350 million in cash and issue about  
$430 million in stock. The deal could include an additional payment 
of up to $270 million in Excite stock if holiday traffic to 
bluemountain.com is strong. The deal is expected to be completed by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome, based in Redwood City, Calif., was created earlier  
this year by the merger of Excite, an Internet search and directory 
service, and AtHome, which operates a network of fiber-optic 
cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Boulder, Bluemountain.com is an extension of Blue  
Mountain Arts, an alternative greeting card company begun by 
Stephen and Susan Polis Schutz, who were flower children in the 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jared Schutz, their son, took the privately held tiny company  
into the high-tech age in 1996 by launching the Web site. Traffic 
peaked in February at 12.6 million users. Bluemountain.com's 
traffic typically increases sharply around the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Goldman, Excite's chief financial officer, said  
Bluemountain.com presented a relatively inexpensive way to expand 
his company's reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Ianni, an analyst with the Jupiter Communications research  
firm, said Excite officials will have to be careful about how they 
market their high-speed Internet access to customers who are used 
to getting free products from Bluemountain.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``When someone goes to Blue Mountain Arts, they're expecting to  
send a greeting card to a friend or a loved one and they're not 
expecting to be asked about their (Internet service provider) and 
whether they want to upgrade to broadband,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mentality of the consumer is a lot different when the  
consumer is used to getting the product free,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluemountain.com has more than 65 percent of the electronic  
greeting card market, Bell said. He described the site's users as 
very loyal and more likely than other Internet users to buy items 
online.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Judge Arraigned on Drug Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A judge was released on $10,000 bail Monday  
after being arraigned on charges of drug use, including shooting 
heroin in her chambers and protecting her dealer in exchange for 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Dauer released District Judge Gigi Sullivan on  
bail, contingent on her completing a drug treatment program. 
Prosecutors had requested $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Patrick Thomassey, said Ms. Sullivan was in the  
treatment program last week when Attorney General Mike Fisher 
announced the charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that Ms. Sullivan, 38, has had ``a long history  
of prescription drug abuse,'' but made no comment about the other 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge set a preliminary hearing for Nov. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Fisher issued the charges against the judge, accusing  
her of using heroin, cocaine and prescription drugs. Fisher alleged 
that she accepted drugs in exchange for dismissing cases against 
her supplier and other dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also accused of possession of heroin and cocaine, kiting  
a $2,000 check and accepting bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, district justices sit as magistrates, holding  
preliminary hearings, ruling on minor crimes and issuing 
protection-from-abuse orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sullivan, a Democrat, is up for election to a second,  
six-year term on Nov. 2, facing Republican David Sosovicka, despite 
the fact that she has been ordered not to hear cases.

<P>
	``She's still on the ballot for district magistrate,'' Thomassey  
said. ``These are just allegations. She is not convicted. She'll 
remain on the ballot and maybe be elected. Wouldn't that be 
something?''

<HEADLINE>  Joe Juneau Joins Senators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- The Ottawa Senators are glad new forward  
Joe Juneau is a quick study. 
</P>
<P>
	They're counting on Juneau, who holds a degree in rocket science  
-- aeronautical engineering, to be precise -- to give the team an 
instant offensive boost, especially on the power play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're adding a player who has gone to the Stanley Cup final  
the last two years,'' coach Jacques Martin said. ``He definitely 
brings speed, quickness and experience. He has playmaking ability 
and a good shot. He's good with the puck and away from it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played extremely well against us in the playoffs the last  
two years with Buffalo and Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau, 31, practiced with the Senators for the first time  
Monday, after coming to terms with the club as an unrestricted free 
agent Sunday. The deal reportedly will pay him $1.7 million this 
season. Incentives could boost the contract by another $550,000, 
while the team is believed to hold a $2.5 million option for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau has been training on his own and said if practices go  
well, he might play in Ottawa's next game at home against Calgary 
on Thursday. If not, he is aiming for the following game Saturday 
against Florida at the Corel Centre. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of a handful of veteran unrestricted free agents who  
found themselves without a team as the season began. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been one of the toughest times of my career,'' Juneau  
said. ``It's the first time since I was four years old I wasn't 
playing. Some days, I was up at 5:30 a.m. to get ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over and it worked out with my number one  
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau's agent, Larry Kelly, also was talking with Washington  
and Buffalo. Juneau split last season between the Capitals and 
Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinforcements couldn't come at a better time for the Senators.  
Ottawa is down two top forwards with center Alexei Yashin holding 
out, and right wing Daniel Alfredsson expected to miss 8-10 weeks 
with ligament damage to his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the missing players, the Eastern Conference-leading  
Senators' power play has plummeted from an NHL-leading 43.8 percent 
(7-for-16) to eighth at 20 percent (9-for-35). Ottawa is 0-for-19 
with the man advantage over the past five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau has scored 42 of his 114 NHL goals on the power play.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of his greatest assets is his vision,'' forward Rob  
Zamuner said. ``On the power play, he can really thread passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Canadian Olympian was selected to the NHL's  
all-rookie team and was a finalist for rookie of the year with 
Boston in 1993, when he had a career-high 32 goals and 70 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 15 goals and 28 assists in 72 games last season, and  
three goals and 11 assists in 20 playoff games with the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Ron Tugnutt was in Washington with Juneau briefly and  
said he is a big acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been to the Cup the last two years and he says he plans  
on going again.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Has Birthday Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first lady who has everything -- except  
the title ``Senator'' -- it was the perfect birthday gift: her own 
Broadway show and a million bucks in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton and the president were among the  
headliners for an extravaganza Monday evening in honor of Mrs. 
Clinton's 52nd birthday at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was expected to raise $1 million for Mrs. Clinton's  
likely Senate campaign. All 1,820 tickets -- ranging from $250 to 
$1,000 -- were sold out. The performers -- including Chita Rivera, 
Bebe Neuwirth, Lauren Bacall and Joel Grey -- donated their time. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening act was a Hillary look-alike in a blonde wig and  
practical pumps singing ``I'll take Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten 
Island, too.'' Christine Pedi, from the cast of ``Forbidden 
Broadway,'' a spoof of Broadway shows, was accompanied by a chorus 
of 12 guys in Yankee baseball uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedi walked onto the stage wearing black pants and hot pink  
power blazer. She traded the pink blazer for a feather robe in the 
same hot pink color when she segued into the song ``New York, New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the line, ``It's up to you, New York, New York,'' became  
``Those Washington blues are washing away''. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raiser featured a 4-foot-high, red-white-and-blue  
birthday cake, the song ``My Boy Bill'' from ``Carousel'' rewritten 
as ``My Girl Hill'' -- and Rosie O'Donnell as host poking fun at 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's probable Republican opponent 
in the New York Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	In one jab at the law-and-order mayor, she said, ``The cast of  
(the musical) 'Smokey Joe's Cafe' wanted to be here, but the mayor 
had them all arrested outside the theater for loitering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the evening, Clinton and the first lady took the  
stage. The president introduced his wife with an emotional speech 
in which he reflected on the fact that his presidency is ending and 
said: ``The best gift I can give the American people now is to make 
sure they know the person I love most in the world is the ablest, 
most passionate, most committed public servant I have ever known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Y'all just relax while I get used to my new role, somewhere  
between ... the straight man for Rosie and the warm-up for 
Hillary,'' the president said. ``I'll figure out something to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton seemed touched by his tribute, and they embraced  
for several minutes on the stage while the audience applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton promised to be ``a voice for the  
children of New York, all the children of New York,'' and said that 
she brings 30 years of experience to the table in that area. 
</P>
<P>
	Some the song titles on the program sounded like memos from Mrs.  
Clinton's supporters: ``Make Them Hear You,'' ``This is the 
Moment,'' and ``If You Could See Her Through My Eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actress Mia Farrow, who has 14 children, 10 of them adopted,  
read from Mrs. Clinton's book, ``It Takes A Village and Other 
Lessons Children Teach Us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us plays a part in every child's life: It takes a  
village to raise a child,'' reads one passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Light, who stars in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Wit,''  
was chosen for a reading from the writings of Eleanor Roosevelt, 
one of Mrs. Clinton's muses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also was on the program, along with  
actor Alec Baldwin, a stalwart Democratic fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani also is using a Broadway show to raise money. His  
campaign hopes to raise $500,000 by selling 500 tickets to a Nov. 
16 performance of ``Saturday Night Fever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians using the performing arts as a way to raise money is  
nothing new. The 1962 bash at Madison Square Garden where Marilyn 
Monroe breathily crooned ``Happy Birthday'' to President Kennedy 
raised $1 million for the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, President Clinton celebrated his 50th birthday at a  
Radio City Music Hall event that raised $10 million for his party 
and featured performances by Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin and 
Shania Twain.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Dock Strike Averted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii's shipping industry and the state  
dockworkers' union reached a tentative settlement early today, 
averting a dock strike that threatened to cripple the islands' 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached at 12:20 a.m., after nearly 34 hours  
of negotiations over two days. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a strike had triggered panic buying of staples  
like rice and toilet paper in Hawaii, where 90 percent of goods 
arrive by ship. 
</P>
<P>
	International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 142 President  
Eusebio Lapenia and Tim Ho, president of the Hawaii Employers 
Council, refused to discuss details of the accord. It must be 
ratified by a majority of the union's 507 members in votes that 
have yet to be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The employers council represents four shipping companies.  
</P>
<P>
	The dockworkers union had been seeking a contract similar to the  
three-year, 8 percent wage increase West Coast dockworkers received 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although neither side discussed specific salary figures,  
published reports said that under the contract that expired June 
30, Hawaii dockworkers received anywhere from $55,000 to $150,000, 
depending on their job, hours and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ben Cayetano, who offered to mediate if a settlement could  
not be reached, had warned that a dock strike could cripple 
Hawaii's economy, which he said is finally making gains after a 
nine-year slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, dockworkers staged a work slowdown that  
created a backlog of unloaded cargo ships in Honolulu Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Cayetano predicted there would be no strike.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to go out and stock up on bags of rice and  
soap and toilet paper and all that because I feel good about what's 
happening right now,'' he said. ``I think both sides don't want the 
rest of the state to suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii's docks were shut down for five months in 1949, and for  
100 days in 1971 because of a West Coast strike.

<HEADLINE> Study: Neanderthals Lived Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Neanderthals and modern humans may have  
coexisted in central Europe for thousands of years, possibly even 
mating, according to new radiocarbon dating of bones from a cave in 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bones found in the Vindija cave site in Croatia have yielded the  
youngest dates ever, 28,000 to 29,000 years, for Neanderthal 
remains, said Fred H. Smith, said Fred H. Smith, an anthropologist 
at Northern Illinois University. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said it was the strongest evidence yet that the primitive  
Neanderthal lived at the same time and at the same place as did 
modern human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the Neanderthal specimens will be published Tuesday  
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals, a primitive hominid with prominent brow, coarse  
jaw, short lower limbs and a prominence at the back of the skull, 
are thought to have arisen in Africa more than 250,000 years ago. 
They are thought to have appeared in Europe about 100,000 years ago 
and were eventually replaced by modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Specimens for modern humans dated at 90,000 to 100,000 years  
have been found in Africa and in the Middle East. Modern human 
bones found in central Europe have been dated at about 32,000 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Neanderthal age dates are based on material removed from  
a jawbone and a skull bone found in the Croatian cave. The 
specimens had earlier been dated at 45,000 years using a gamma ray 
counter. The new dates of 28,000 to 29,000 were determined using a 
more accurate method called accelerator radiocarbon dating, which 
measures the level in the specimen of a carbon isotope. 
</P>
<P>
	The new dates for the Neanderthal, said Smith, mean ``there was  
an overlap of 3,000 to 4,000 years'' with modern humans in central 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the find strengthens the theory that Neanderthals and  
modern humans did mate and produce hybrid children that had genes 
from both species. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he and others believe that there are body features in  
bones from 30,000-year-old human specimens that suggest a 
Neanderthal contribution to the European gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Trinkaus of Washington University at St. Louis, a co-author  
of the study, said that the remains of a human child found in 
Portugal included features in the legs, arms, teeth and skull that 
resemble those of the Neanderthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Portuguese specimen shows that an admixture did occur in  
Portugal and could very well have occurred elsewhere,'' said 
Trinkaus. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixing of modern humans and Neanderthals is a controversial  
issue among anthropologists, and Clark Howell of the University of 
California, Berkeley, said not many agree with Smith and Trinkaus. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell said the new dates found by Smith and Trinkaus ``are not  
surprising'' and do prove that Neanderthals and modern humans may 
have lived in Central Europe at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there is no widely accepted evidence that the  
primitive hominids and modern humans actually mated and produced 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could argue that they lived apart in the same area and  
threw rocks at each other instead of genes,'' said Howell. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes the characteristics in the modern human  
skeletons that Trinkaus and Smith attribute to Neanderthal are 
actually within the range of normal variations for humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the issue may eventually be settled by genetic  
testing. Some DNA has been recovered from ancient bones, he said, 
and researchers in Sweden are attempting to compare gene fragments 
from Neanderthals to that of modern humans.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Security Council Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Nearly two weeks after throwing out  
Pakistan's elected government, the army on Monday announced the 
members of a new National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The five men and one women will run the country until the  
military chief decides to hold elections. So far Gen. Pervaiz 
Musharraf has refused to say when elections would be held and few 
Pakistanis seem to want elections anytime soon, preferring instead 
to see endemic corruption tackled first. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, who led the Oct. 12 bloodless coup that ousted Nawaz  
Sharif's government, will head the council of military officers and 
civilians, including a woman. He traveled to Saudi Arabia Monday on 
his first trip abroad and was not in the country for the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries to recognize  
Musharraf. 
</P>
<P>
	The military officers on the council are Air Chief Marshal  
Pervaiz Mehdi Qureshi and Naval Chief Admiral Abdul Aziz Mirza. 
</P>
<P>
	The civilians members of the team are: Sahabzada Yaqoob Ali  
Khan, a former foreign minister, Mohammed Yaqub, governor of the 
State Bank of Pakistan and Attiya Inayatullah, a social worker and 
former adviser on family planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Khan and Ms. Inayatullah served under the previous military  
regime led by Gen. Zia-ul-Haq. 
</P>
<P>
	The general died in a mysterious plane crash in 1988 paving the  
way for Pakistan's first free and fair elections in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yaqub worked for the International Monetary Fund for 20 years  
before joining Pakistan's finance ministry in 1992. He was governor 
of the State Bank of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf appointed governors of the four provinces on Thursday.  
Three of the four were retired army officers and the fourth a 
retired justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, who has a reputation as a brilliant field tactician  
and a modern Muslim, has accused ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif 
of driving the country toward ruin, destroying state institutions 
in a bid to consolidate his powers and undermining the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf, however, has suspended the constitution and has so  
far refused to set a date for general elections and a return to 
democracy in Pakistan, a demand of most western governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf has promised to root out corruption, recover  
ill-gotten wealth and restore confidence in an economy that some 
observers say is verging on collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The military takeover is the fourth in Pakistan's history.  
Pakistanis have been ruled by army generals for 25 of their 52 year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers say Musharraf's rule thus far is relatively  
lenient because he has not suspended fundamental rights or imposed 
curbs on the press or judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	The military takeover has been widely accepted by Pakistanis,  
who are frustrated by years of political instability, corruption 
and religious and political violence.

<HEADLINE> MSU's Cleaves Out Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves,  
the only returning All-America from last season, suffered a stress 
fracture in his right foot and will be out eight to 10 weeks, coach 
Tom Izzo announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves was scheduled to have a bone graft and a pin inserted  
during surgery Monday evening, Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves likely won't play until shortly before the Spartans  
begin the Big Ten season, Jan. 5 against Penn State. He likely will 
miss games against North Carolina, Kansas and Arizona in December. 
The Spartans play Kentucky in 8 1/2 weeks, on Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, who led the Spartans to a 33-5 record and their first  
Final Four in 20 years last season, is expected to be on crutches 
for three to four weeks. No matter how quickly he returns, it will 
take him a while longer to get in game shape, Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody comes back after four, six, eight, 10  
weeks without missing a beat,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Cleaves probably injured the foot about three weeks  
ago and it got progressively worse. He complained Sunday about it 
being sore and went to a doctor Monday, Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury will give the Spartans a chance to see how good they  
are, Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we just have a program, or do we have a team. Ever since  
I've been in this game, people have told me that a program is 
bigger than one person, one player, one coach. We're about to find 
that out,'' he said. ``I don't want anybody feeling sorry for us. I 
don't want anyone changing their expectations of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said he expects Mo Peterson and Charlie Bell to take up the  
leadership void, although he said Cleaves will still attend 
practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt he's our leader by actions, he's our leader  
by words. He's going to be a very talented assistant for eight or 
10 weeks,'' Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves met with the team Monday before the surgery, Peterson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just told us that other guys are going to have to step up.  
Freshmen will have to step up and not play like freshmen,'' 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Thomas, a junior who redshirted last season, will fill in  
for Cleaves at the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a great test for myself,'' Thomas said. ``I  
expect him (Cleaves) to be on me more than Coach Izzo. Mateen's a 
great leader and he's still going to be there for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said he won't let the Spartans use Cleaves' absence as an  
excuse for not playing well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let anybody say that `Well, they would have won if  
Mateen was playing,' or `We would have won by more if Mateen had 
been there,''' he said. ``It's going to be personally insulting to 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Changes Housing Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force said Monday it no longer will  
use money earmarked for day-to-day military operations to repair 
and renovate two 1930s-era homes at the Air Force Academy in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was prompted by an Air Force Audit Agency report  
that questioned the need for -- and method of payment for -- some 
renovation work last year on the 10,846-square-foot Carlton House, 
home of the academy superintendent, as well as future work planned 
for Carlton and the 11,553-square-foot Otis House, which serves as 
the residence of the academy's commandant of cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Renovations and modifications to the Carlton House did not  
always appear warranted,'' the audit said, citing as an example 
$308,000 in renovation work done last year on its restaurant-style 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1998 remodeling effort was questionable when compared to  
the documented justification,'' the auditors wrote. ``Specifically, 
the work request stated: `The area is always hot, the lighting is 
poor, the refrigerator is not functional for a family.' However, 
rather than improving the ventilation and lighting and replacing 
the refrigerator, the academy performed a complete kitchen 
renovation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The work on the 1,300-square-foot kitchen originally was  
budgeted for $151,000 but grew to $308,000, and ``some of the cost 
growth appeared avoidable,'' the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The review also found fault with the Air Force's plans for  
$125,000 in work on the Otis House, including a $40,000 project to 
move a bathroom wall to widen an adjoining bedroom by one foot. The 
planned work there also included a $14,000 conversion of the 
outdoor barbecue from charcoal to gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors also questioned the propriety of using Air Force  
operations and maintenance funds to pay for the work instead of 
money earmarked for housing repairs. If housing repair funds had 
been used, the work would have been subject to review by Congress. 
Several members of Congress said it appeared the Air Force had 
intended to avoid congressional scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors faulted the Air Force for not monitoring such  
spending closely enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force previously had defended the renovations as  
necessary to maintain historic homes that are also used heavily for 
public functions. The audit was requested by Air Force Secretary F. 
Whitten Peters.

<HEADLINE> Stewart's Plane Said Depressurized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Everything known about the crash of Payne  
Stewart's jet pointed to a sudden loss of pressurization in the 
``very hostile'' environment of high-altitude flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Experienced pilots say such an occurrence is extremely rare for  
civilian aircraft -- and extremely unforgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	It could have been brought on by a blown door or window seal.  
Experts consider that the most likely because the two pilots and 
three passengers aboard Stewart's Lear 35 did not broadcast a 
mayday before the plane crashed in South Dakota on Monday. All 
aboard died. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers last talked to the pilots when they confirmed an  
instruction to climb to 39,000 feet as the plane flew from Orlando, 
Fla., to Love Field in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	If pressure was lost at that altitude, everyone aboard would  
have been incapacitated almost immediately. Autopsies will tell if 
they died before the crash or from the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is smoke or some other form of contamination  
in the cabin, but experts considered that much less likely because 
the chance of someone noticing and taking some form of corrective 
action would have been greater. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are in the cabin of a Learjet, you are in a very small  
pressure vessel, quite different than a DC-10, 757 or a large 
passenger jet,'' said John Nance, a veteran airline captain and 
aviation analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost certainly something blew out. It could have been a  
window, a door seal or a duct seal. Whatever it was, it doesn't 
take much to empty the cabin (of oxygen) of a Lear because it's a 
very small cabin,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The human body has limited ability to function above 10,000  
feet. As the altitude increases, the air thins, and two things 
happen: There is less oxygen in the air, and there is less pressure 
to force that oxygen through the lungs and into the blood stream. 
</P>
<P>
	Airplane designers compensate by pressurizing the cabin area.  
Air enters the engines from outside and some of it is drawn off, 
heated, compressed and fed into the cabin. Valves at the back of 
the aircraft open and close to maintain a consistent pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the atmosphere inside a plane never feels any higher  
than 8,000 feet, despite the actual height of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	If a plane loses pressure, a warning light goes on in the  
cockpit and oxygen masks drop from the ceiling. People use them -- 
if they are able. 
</P>
<P>
	In aviation circles, there is a term known as ``time of useful  
consciousness.'' It is the measure of the time the body can cope 
without oxygen, and it diminishes almost quickly with altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	At 20,000 feet, the time is 10 minutes. At 26,000 feet, it is  
two minutes. At 30,000 feet, it is 30 seconds. At 40,000 feet, it 
is 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials said Stewart's plane ultimately climbed as high as  
45,000 feet during its wayward flight across the nation's 
heartland, most probably on autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Brennan, a former Navy fighter pilot and a retired Boeing  
747 captain, said that if the cabin lost proper pressure, the 
people inside would have suffered from hypoxia, decreased oxygen in 
the blood, or anoxia, a lack of oxygen in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a major depressurization, the pressure would go  
down instantly,'' Brennan said. ``Unless you had an oxygen mask 
handy, you couldn't do much about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said even a more gradual leak could have fatal consequences.  
</P>
<P>
	``Someone might have noticed that someone was not operating  
normally, but by that time, they might have not been operating 
normally themselves,'' said Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance, who was preparing to fly his own private plane on Monday,  
said most people never realize that they fly in such a precarious 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside a plane, they can watch a movie, read a book or curl up  
with a blanket. Just outside a plane's aluminum skin, the 
temperature is about 50 degrees below zero and the air too thin to 
support life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very hostile environment and you don't need to worry  
about it because everything works fine 99 percent of the time,'' he 
said. ``When something goes wrong, you have a very short time to do 
something about it.''

<HEADLINE> Machinists Reject Boeing Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Machinists union negotiators on Monday asked  
Boeing Co. to return to the bargaining table after members in 
California and Florida rejected what the company called its ``best 
and final offer'' and authorized a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers remained on the job, but leaders said a strike was not  
out of the picture for 2,171 machinists from Southern California to 
Cape Canaveral who work on projects including the International 
Space Station and the Delta rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go back to the table. We're here to negotiate a  
contract, not a strike,'' said Nick Bacon, president of the 
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers 
District 725. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if Boeing persists in its present position, we'll  
have no alternative'' but to consider a strike, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members on Sunday rejected Boeing's offer by a 95 percent  
margin. Eighty-five percent voted in favor of strike authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said he did not have exact numbers on how many workers  
turned out for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members include lathe operators, machinists, electronic  
technicians, furniture movers and part inspectors. More than 1,500 
of the workers are assigned to Boeing's Huntington Beach, 
Calif.,-based expendable launch operation, which includes 
production of the Delta rocket, and the International Space 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Others work on space and aircraft projects at Boeing facilities  
in Torrance, Calif., Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., and Cape 
Canaveral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing offered the union a competitive contract that included  
wage and pension increases, said Erin Lutz, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do consider this a best and final offer,'' she said. ``The  
company feels that this is an agreement that balances both the 
short and long-term interests of the employees, the union as well 
as the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union is seeking increases in medical and pension benefits  
and salary on par with the contract accepted recently by 44,000 
Boeing machinists in the Washington, Oregon and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Those workers, who negotiated separately from District 725,  
received bigger increases in pension contributions, said Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Seattle-area workers received a 25 percent increase  
in pension benefits to $50 per month for each year of service. 
District 725 workers were offered half that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lutz said Boeing also offered an early retirement supplement  
that would boost pension to as much as $56 per month for each year 
of service for some employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-area workers also are getting a bigger pay raise: 4  
percent cost-of-living raises in each of the first two years of the 
contract, followed by 3 percent in the final year. Boeing offered 
Southern California workers 3 percent increases in the first two 
years and 4 percent in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle workers also received a signing bonus equal to 10  
percent of the previous year's gross pay. For District 725 workers, 
Boeing offered a 2 percent bonus, said Bacon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Adviser Booed in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Protesters jeered President Clinton's chief  
adviser on drugs Monday when he went to the University of London 
with his British counterpart to launch an Internet site to combat 
drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Barry McCaffrey left the university's Goldsmith College  
with placard-waving demonstrators pursuing his car and shouting 
denunciations of his tough policy on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey came to Britain on Sunday to begin a four-nation  
European tour. He maintains cocaine is not a soft drug, and that 
Europeans should do more to block the flow of drugs of Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Transform, the group that organized the protest, said it feared  
McCaffrey's visit reflected a hardening stance by Prime Minister 
Tony Blair's government against drugs. Transform promotes what 
members call ``a sensible drug policy.'' It supports the 
legalization of marijuana, but stops short of calling for the 
decriminalization of all drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Transform spokesman Steve Rolles said the United States had the  
world's most punitive anti-drugs strategy and the world's worst 
problem with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has nothing to learn from Barry McCaffrey. They  
should not be exporting the U.S. drug policy. We should be looking 
to other far more progressive regimes,'' said Rolles. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey and Britain's Anti-Drugs Coordinator Keith Hellawell,  
whose appointment was modeled on the White House post, launched 
ResourceNet, an information Web site funded partly by the British 
government for professionals dealing with drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said every country should develop its own drug  
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dutch are remarkably civilized, homogenous people in a  
small area,'' he said of The Netherlands' relatively liberal drug 
laws. ``Their approach might not be appropriate for us. We think 
the approach we are now trying is reflected in dramatically reduced 
rates of drug abuse.''

<HEADLINE> Wonders of the African World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- We've been had.  
</P>
<P>
	Even the most progressive Americans might recognize African  
culture chiefly for its artistic flair, exotic rituals and the sort 
of rousing music made famous on ``Graceland'' by New York City 
white boy Paul Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the rest of us see Africa, in the words of Skip Gates,  
as little more than a repository of ``poverty, flies, famine, war, 
disease and maybe some big game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates wants to show us what's wrong with this picture -- a  
picture that generations of historians have blandly, misleadingly 
painted for us as ``the dark continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were raised to think that Africans were just savages  
waiting on Europeans to discover them and educate them in the 
University of Slavery,'' said the 49-year-old Gates, a black man 
whose particular upbringing was in a small town in West Virginia. 
Wrong: ``Africans have been creating civilizations for 5,000 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise known as Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr., this celebrated  
writer and Harvard University professor takes us on an eye-opening 
odyssey through Africa's neglected present and forgotten past in 
``Wonders of the African World.'' His remarkable six-part series 
airs tonight through Wednesday from 9 to 11 p.m. EDT on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is stuff that nobody knows about, other than a handful of  
academics who only talk to each other,'' he said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending himself to a general audience is Gates' multi-faceted  
mission. He has authored a companion book, ``Wonders of the African 
World,'' published by Knopf. He co-edited a CD-ROM reference, 
``Encarta Africana,'' released by Microsoft. And next month brings 
his ``Africana,'' a 2,100-page, richly illustrated encyclopedia 
published by Basic Civitas Books. 
</P>
<P>
	Now his documentary series, the product of six months' filming  
in 12 countries, offers the viewer many pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is the chance to accompany Gates to remote  
destinations such as ancient Nubia, which ruled all of Egypt in the 
8th Century B.C. and today rewards its few visitors with the sight 
of pyramids where 40 generations of black kings and queens are 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Ethiopia, where in the ancient city of Axum, a tiny  
fence-enclosed sanctuary is said to hold the Ark of the Covenant -- 
the chest containing the stones inscribed with the Ten 
Commandments. Are they really in there? Ethiopians, Gates notes, 
have fervently believed so for 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates makes his most joyous encounter in Timbuktu, site of a  
great Islamic university that flourished centuries before Harvard 
was founded. It is here that he beholds a few of some 50,000 
manuscripts stored in private collections -- books set forth in 
Arabic by countless black scholars. 
</P>
<P>
	His eyes shining bright through wire-rim glasses, Gates recalled  
for a reporter the German philosopher Hegel, who in 1790 wrote that 
Africa has no historical place in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that amazing? It's all part of this discourse designed  
to enslave Africa,'' Gates said. ``They took Africans out of 
history so they could exploit them. They took away Africans' 
humanity by saying they didn't have reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This too-familiar doctrine is an enduring wedge in the racial  
divide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even today, a lot of people believe black people are probably  
genetically inferior: better at basketball than thinking. That's 
why Timbuktu is so important.'' Gates smiled exultantly. ``In your 
face, Hegel! I've got those books on camera!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clear lesson of Gates' spirited quest is that, long before  
many others, Africans gathered in societies that would last for 
centuries. Only later were their advances arrested and obscured, in 
large part by European colonization. 
</P>
<P>
	But as he proceeds to debunk historical myths passed down from  
colonists to the present day, Gates confronts something shocking. 
He learns that blacks played a key role in the slave trade, 
capturing fellow Africans by the millions for sale to European 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier just to blame Europeans,'' Gates conceded. ``But  
the truth is, it wouldn't have happened without the Africans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, in Zanzibar, Gates meets a black woman whose  
great-great-grandfather was a prominent slave trader. He asks her 
how she feels about it. Her reply: It was just business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible,'' persists Gates, a descendant of slaves,  
``that someone in your family many, many hundreds of years ago 
purchased and sold someone in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite possible,'' she says. ``I think we should treat that as  
a sorry part of history and that chapter is closed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not likely. But they shake hands, then hug, anyway. In his  
defiantly upbeat ``Wonders,'' Gates is proposing a new chapter.

	Golfer Stewart Dies in Plane Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Golfer Payne Stewart was killed today when his  
Learjet flew uncontrolled over the nation's heartland for hours 
before crashing in South Dakota, killing everyone aboard. 
Government officials said the plane, believed to have five people 
on board, may have suffered a pressurization failure. ``It is 
difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over the death 
of Payne Stewart,'' said PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem in a 
statement issued from PGA headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. 
The aircraft left Orlando, Fla., about 9:20 a.m. EDT bound for 
Dallas, and the last communication came was when the plane was over 
Gainesville, Fla., said Tony Molinaro, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman in Chicago.

	Buchanan, Trump Leave GOP for Reform Party  
</P>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- Longtime Republican Pat Buchanan left  
the party today to seek the Reform Party's presidential nomination. 
Buchanan, who twice ran for the GOP's nod, said ``our vaunted 
two-party system has become a snare and a delusion, a fraud upon 
the nation.'' The conservative commentator, who ran for the 
Republican nomination in 1992 and 1996, pledged not to involve 
America in a foreign war ``unless our country is attacked or our 
vital interests are imperiled.'' Also today, real estate developer 
Donald Trump left the GOP for the Reform Party in a possible 
prelude to a presidential run. Trump, who yesterday called Buchanan 
``a Hitler lover,'' said Buchanan's decision had no impact on his 
move.

	Clinton To Sign Spending Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will sign a $268 billion  
Pentagon spending bill rather than face a risky effort to persuade 
Democrats in Congress to sustain a veto, his spokesman said today. 
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton still has 
concerns about the amount of special-interest spending included in 
the bill, but that he considers the measure's military pay raise a 
priority. 

</P>

	U.S. Warns Russia on Chechnya  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration warned Russia that  
the move of its troops toward the capital of Chechnya was an 
``ominous and deplorable'' course. Russian tanks are nearing Grozny 
in the breakaway republic, while jets and artillery attack outlying 
areas. Russia sent troops to Chechnya in September to wipe out 
rebels blamed for invading neighboring Dagestan and for a series of 
apartment explosions in Russia that killed 300 people.

	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Would-be parents' wishes for a beautiful  
baby may come true, for the right price as fashion photographer Ron 
Harris is offering the eggs of eight models in an online auction 
starting today. The bids start at $15,000. Harris says the Website 
has already received a serious offer of $42,000. The auction will 
last up to several months, with each model deciding how long the 
bidding for her eggs will go and what price should be accepted. The 
models receive the full amount and bidders must pay Harris' 
organization an additional 20 percent service fee, which he says 
will be donated to children's charities.

officer, authorities said. Matthew Daly, 27, wearing a bulletproof 
vest and flaunting a fake detective's shield and replica gun, 
allegedly walked up to the car of Officer Anthony Ferrone and told 
him he had run a red light. As soon as Ferrone said he was a police 
officer, Daly ran back to his car and sped off. But Ferrone soon 
chased him down, police said. Daly was being held today on charges 
of impersonating a police officer and criminal possession of a 
weapon and a bulletproof vest.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eighty percent of diners surveyed for the 2000  
edition of the Zagat New York City Restaurant Survey said they 
think men are treated better than women in restaurants. The results 
suggest that men, when dining in mixed company, are targeted as 
primary check payers by restaurant staff, who lavish better service 
their way, says the restaurant guide. The guide says women ``are

<HEADLINE> Barak Names Negotiating Team Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Six weeks after talks for a final peace deal  
were formally launched, Prime Minister Ehud Barak appointed the 
leader of the Israeli negotiating team, a spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's ambassador to Jordan, Oded Eran, will head the  
negotiations for Israel, Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment will allow the two sides to begin hashing out  
so-called final status issues, including the final borders of 
Israel and the Palestinian entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees 
and the future of contested Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians, who named their team's leader, Information  
Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo, shortly after talks were ceremonially 
resumed on September 13, had criticized Barak for delaying the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have set an ambitious February deadline to hammer  
out a framework agreement for a final peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear if Eran would have to step down  
from his post in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, both sides prepared for a summit with President  
Clinton next week that is expected to give negotiations a jump 
start. The meeting will be in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat will first meet Clinton alone and will seek American  
assistance in stopping construction of Jewish settlements in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, 
noting a letter from Clinton to Arafat calling such activity 
destructive to peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians hope to build a state in the West Bank and Gaza  
Strip and accuse Israel of prejudicing the outcome of negotiations 
by building on the disputed land. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli budget plan for 2000, which has been approved by  
Barak's Cabinet but not yet by parliament, allocates $250 million 
for roads to the settlements and increased fortifications there. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of continuing tensions between the two sides, clashes  
broke out Monday in Bethlehem after an Israeli soldier shot and 
killed a Palestinian souvenir vendor. The army said the man tried 
to stab the soldier outside the traditional burial place of the 
Biblical matriarch Rachel, an Israeli enclave in the 
Palestinian-controlled city. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldier was not injured.  
</P>
<P>
	In response to the shooting, some 150 Palestinians marched to  
the enclave and threw stones at Israeli troops who responded with 
tear gas and rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 Palestinians and two Israelis were lightly injured in  
the melee.

<HEADLINE> Braves Working on Hitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves haven't come close to  
outhitting the New York Yankees. Maybe they can outwork them. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned by a 7-of-58 plate performance in the first two games of  
the World Series, the Braves altered their routine Monday during an 
off-day workout at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, they jump in and out of the batting cage during a  
session, winding up with around 20 swings apiece. This time, most 
players spent a full five minutes in the cage during their turn, 
taking about 50 swings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went back to what was successful for us a couple of times  
during the year,'' hitting coach Don Baylor said. ``The guys were 
able to hit for longer of periods of time by themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves are thoroughly embarrassed by their performance in  
Atlanta, which left them in an 0-2 hole with the next three games -- 
if needed -- scheduled for Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Both New York starters, Orlando Hernandez and David Cone,  
allowed just one hit over seven innings. Atlanta went into the 
ninth inning of Game 2 hitting .077 as a team, then bolstered its 
average to a still paltry .121 with three hits that produced two 
meaningless runs in a 7-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how good they are,'' Braves first baseman Ryan  
Klesko said. ``We shouldn't be doing this bad. We knocked Randy 
Johnson out twice and he has the best stuff in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the Yankees are taking full advantage of the  
free-swinging Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know how pitching can stop hitting,'' New York manager Joe  
Torre said. ``And I don't care how dominant or how good the hitting 
is. ... When the pitching is good, it's very difficult to hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chipper Jones, the Braves' No. 3 hitter, is willing to be  
patient -- walking three times, striking out once, hitting .400 in 
the first two games -- but the rest of the lineup is hacking away 
against a pitching staff that knows how to leave pitches 
tantalizingly out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their pitchers are pretty good,'' Jones said. ``They  
definitely have some guys who can expose a free-swinging hitter's 
weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A slumping team becomes an impatient team. Every hitter tries to  
turn things around with one swing, instead of working deep into the 
count and trying to reach base by any means possible. 
</P>
<P>
	That's been the formula for the Yankees, who are 20-of-70 (.286)  
against the Braves' equally fine staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you swing at bad pitches, you're not going to score runs,''  
Klesko said. ``I know I've been swinging at bad pitches, balls six 
inches off the plate and in the dirt. You can't hit pitchers' 
pitches out of the park. We are an aggressive team but we can be 
patient, too. We need to be a little more patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have a team ERA of 2.30 in the postseason -- and that  
number is skewed by their only loss, a 13-1 rout by the Boston Red 
Sox in Game 3 of the AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves tried to shake things up in Game 2, giving  
left-handed hitters Ozzie Guillen, Keith Lockhart and Greg Myers 
their first starts of the postseason against Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	The radical makeover didn't help much. The newcomers went  
2-for-9, and the Braves are expected to insert right-handed 
regulars Bret Boone, Eddie Perez and Walt Weiss back into the 
lineup against Game 3 starter Andy Pettitte, a lefty. Jose 
Hernandez will serve as the DH. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their strength is they throw strikes,'' Baylor said of the  
Yankees. ``They change speeds and pitch to our weaknesses. They are 
doing what has made them successful all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have never been a big-hitting team during their run  
of eight straight postseason appearances. For instance, they batted 
just .212 (42-of-198) against Cleveland in 1995 while winning their 
only Series title of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Braves have never been this bad.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at 7-for-58, you'd think we're talking about  
pitchers (hitting),'' Baylor said. ``But it's not comical. We need 
to change it.''

<HEADLINE> Golf Mourns Death of Payne Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	His knickers and tam o'shanter cap certainly made Payne Stewart  
one of the most recognizable players in golf. His game and his 
passion made him one of the most respected. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the essence of emotion in the Ryder Cup, playing on three  
winning teams. He won 18 times around the world, but made his name 
at home with three major championships -- the last on an 
unforgettable day in June when he thrust his fist into the air to 
celebrate his second U.S. Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was among five people killed Monday when a Learjet he  
was aboard flew uncontrolled for hours and crashed in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an enormous void and emptiness I feel right now,''  
Tiger Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer called Stewart's death ``one of the most terrible  
tragedies of modern-day golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was on his way to Texas, where the Tour Championship in  
Houston awaited the top 30 on the PGA Tour's money list. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour said his spot in the field will not be replaced. A blue  
ribbon was attached to his nameplate in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over  
the death of Payne Stewart,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem 
said. ``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community 
and all of sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed in the crash were Stewart's agents Robert Fraley and  
Van Ardan and two pilots, said Bill Curry, a spokesman for 
Stewart's family. Fraley was CEO of Leader Enterprises Inc. and 
Ardan was president of the sports management company. 
</P>
<P>
	``A true sportsman on the course and a gentleman off it,'' said  
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, choking back tears. ``We have 
lost a precious man and someone who still had good years ahead of 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Strange was leaving a news conference in Palm Beach  
Gardens, Fla., where he was named Ryder Cup captain for 2001, when 
he saw the first television reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lost someone who is truly a great ambassador for the  
game,'' Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart often played practice rounds in regular pants and a hat,  
and not many people recognized him. Once the tournament started, 
however, his presence was unmistakable in traditional golfing garb 
that no one else considered wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everyone can get away with that,'' Strange said. ``He had  
a personality to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had game, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's finest moment in a 20-year professional career came on  
Father's Day at Pinehurst No. 2, the famed course in North Carolina 
that became a stage for remarkable drama in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after Stewart lost a four-stroke lead in the final round  
of the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club, he trailed Phil Mickelson by 
one stroke with three holes to play then one-putted the final three 
greens for a stunning victory. 
</P>
<P>
	His 15-foot par putt on the last hole was the longest ever to  
decide the Open in its 105-year history. Stewart thrust his fist in 
the air, an unforgettable image, let out a roar and later broke 
down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great credit to golf and to our country,'' said  
former Masters and U.S. Open champion Billy Casper. ``Golf lost a 
great man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open secured a spot in the Ryder Cup for Stewart, who  
could wear the Stars and Stripes as easily as his knickers. He 
never apologized for his patriotism, something he carried to all 
five of his Ryder Cup appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The knickers were not misleading. Stewart really was a  
traditionalist. His father taught him to dance by having him stand 
on his shoes while he waltzed around the room, and instructed the 
son to be sure to dance with every woman at the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's most cherished memory was the 1982 Quad Cities Open,  
because it was the only victory his father saw. William Stewart 
died in 1985, and when Stewart won the Bay Hill Invitational two 
years later he donated the winner's check to a hospital in his 
father's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stewart had an edge to him at times, and was especially  
surly during an eight-year slump during which he won only once, he 
never lost his respect for golf's traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	He stood up for Colin Montgomerie as the boorish Boston crowd at  
The Ryder Cup hurled vicious insults at the Scotsman. With the cup 
already decided, Stewart conceded Montgomerie's final putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a real reverence for the game,'' Peter Jacobsen said.  
``As a golfer, his record speaks for itself. He was loved by many 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jan. 30, 1957 in Springfield, Mo., Stewart went to SMU in  
Dallas. He graduated with a business degree in 1979 and spent two 
years playing around the world. He met his wife, Tracey, while 
playing in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	They had two children -- Chelsea, 13, and Aaron 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's first breakthrough came in 1989 when he won his first  
major, the PGA Championship, at Kemper Lakes outside Chicago. Two 
years later, he won the U.S. Open at Hazeltine by defeating Scott 
Simpson in an 18-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	He reflected on his career last week before the Disney Classic,  
where he missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when ... I played very poorly and I wasn't  
having fun playing golf, and I didn't want to continue,'' he said. 
``I had a wakeup call to the fact that this is what I'm good at, 
and I'm still good at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of his turnaround was a newfound faith, drawn to church  
through his children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a lot older and I'm a lot wiser. I'm more mature,'' he  
said earlier this year. ``I'm not going to blink and miss my family 
growing up. When I'm out at the golf course, I'm going to prepare 
myself to be the best I can. And when I'm home, I'm going to be a 
father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said his faith in God had blossomed. ``I'm so much more  
at peace with myself than I've ever been in my life,'' Stewart said 
after winning the Open. ``Where I was with my faith last year and 
where I am now is leaps and bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won more than $11.7 million in a PGA Tour career that  
began in 1980. He was ranked No. 8 in the world and was third on 
this year's money list with just over $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart had planned to go to Spain next week for the final World  
Golf Championship event, and still had the Grand Slam of Golf next 
month for the winners of this year's major championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is shocking. It's a tragedy. I can't even comprehend the  
scope of it,'' Woods said. ``None was us can right now.''

<HEADLINE> Pro Golfer Stewart Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- A Learjet carrying champion golfer Payne  
Stewart and at least four other people flew a ghostly journey 
halfway across the country Monday, its windows iced over and its 
occupants apparently incapacitated, before spiraling nose first 
into a grassy field. Everyone aboard was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight plan said two crewmembers and three passengers were  
on the jet, but there were reports a sixth person boarded the plane 
just before it took off from Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The chartered, twin-engine Lear 35 may have suddenly lost cabin  
pressure soon after taking off for Dallas, government officials 
said. Air traffic controllers couldn't raise anyone by radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighter jets were sent after the plane and followed it for much  
of its flight but were unable to help. The pilots drew close and 
noticed no structural damage but were unable to see into the 
Learjet because its windows were frosted over, indicating the 
temperature inside was well below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Set apparently on autopilot, the plane cruised 1,400 miles  
straight up the nation's midsection, across half a dozen states. 
Authorities say the plane was ``porpoising,'' fluctuating between 
22,000 and 51,000 feet. It presumably ran out of fuel some four 
hours after it took off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane had pretty much nosed straight into the ground,''  
said Lesley Braun, who lives two miles from the South Dakota crash 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's wife, Tracey, an Australian native, tried to reach her  
husband on his cellular phone while she followed the drama on 
television, her brother said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was trying to ring him on his mobile and couldn't raise  
him. It's just really bad for my sister to be watching it on CNN, 
knowing that it was her husband on board,'' Mike Ferguson, a 
professional golfer, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was one of the most recognizable players in golf  
because he wore traditional knickers and a tam-o'-shanter hat. He 
won 18 tournaments, including three major championships. In June, 
he won his second U.S. Open, prevailing over Phil Mickelson with an 
astonishing 15-foot putt on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community and  
all of sports. He will always be remembered as a very special 
competitor and one who contributed enormously to the positive image 
of professional golf,'' PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said: ``I am profoundly sorry for the loss of  
Payne Stewart, who has had such a remarkable career and impact on 
his sport and a remarkable resurgence in the last couple of 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was on his way to Texas, first for a meeting on a  
proposed golf course near Dallas, then on to the Tour Championship 
in Houston for the top 30 on the PGA Tour's money list. He attended 
Southern Methodist University in Dallas and had friends in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,  
and the two pilots, identified as Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie 
Bellegarrigue, 27. The jet was operated by Sunjet Aviation Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus said Monday that he feared one of his golf course  
designers, Bruce Borland, 40, also died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland's wife, Kate, said she contacted the private jet  
terminal Monday afternoon and spoke to an employee who had greeted 
her husband and confirmed he intended to board the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities could not confirm that Borland was aboard and  
officials at the crash site said they could not tell exactly how 
many people had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am truly shocked and saddened,'' Nicklaus said in the  
statement released by Nicklaus Design. ``Our hearts go out to their 
families, as well as the families of the other victims in the 
accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six National Transportation Safety Board investigators walked  
through the crash site Monday night. They did a cursory inspection 
of the wreckage, lit by generator-powered spotlights. Bob Francis, 
NTSB vice chairman, declined to comment and said the investigators 
would be back Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized, because the  
air at altitudes above that is too thin to breathe. If a plane 
loses pressure, those aboard could slowly lose consciousness or, if 
an aircraft broke a door or window seal, perish in seconds from 
lack of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Once reaching a cruising altitude, pilots often switch on the  
autopilot. If they pass out, the plane could continue on until it 
ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Janklow, who was at the crash site, said it appeared  
Stewart's Learjet ran out of fuel because there was no fire. He 
said the plane and the bodies were obliterated. 
</P>
<P>
	Instances in which a civilian jet lost pressure in flight are  
extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Stewart crash was similar to an accident nearly 20  
years ago that took the life of Louisiana State University football 
coach Bo Rein. Rein left Shreveport, La., in 1980 in a private 
plane en route to Baton Rouge. Radio contact with the pilot was 
lost, and the plane flew off course for hundreds of miles before 
going down in the Atlantic off Virginia. Investigators think the 
plane may have lost pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The last communication from Stewart's jet was over Gainesville,  
Fla., said Tony Molinaro, an FAA spokesman in Chicago. The crew did 
not respond to repeated inquiries from air traffic controllers, the 
FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	A government source said the plane should have turned left at  
Gainesville on a course for Dallas. It made only a partial turn 
before heading in a straight line toward South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA routed air traffic around the Learjet and kept planes  
from flying underneath it in case it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighter jets from Florida and Oklahoma went after the plane.  
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Capt. Chris Hamilton said there was nothing he could  
do when his F-16 caught up with the Learjet over Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very helpless feeling to pull up alongside another  
aircraft and realize the people inside that aircraft potentially 
are unconscious or in some other way incapacitated,'' Hamilton 
said. ``And there's nothing I can do physically from my aircraft -- 
even though I'm 50 to 100 feet away -- to help them at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the military never  
considered shooting down the Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jim Henry, retired pastor for First Baptist Church of  
Orlando who used to minister to the Stewart family, was one of 
those outside the Stewart home after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a wonderful Christian who had Christ in his life and  
somehow in his death,'' Henry said. ``That brought a great sense of 
peace to his family in a difficult and tragic time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and his wife had two children, Chelsea, 13, and Aaron,  
10.

<HEADLINE> Cavs' Murray Out for Four Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Cavaliers forward Lamond Murray is  
expected to miss four weeks with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He was injured during an Oct. 16 game against the New York  
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray had a second scan of his knee Monday at the Cleveland  
Clinic, and doctors didn't find any additional damage. He has 
started a rehabilitation program for his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray was acquired on Aug. 4 in a trade with the Los Angeles  
Clippers, where he played five seasons. Used primarily at small 
forward, he averaged 12.2 points last year after losing his 
starting job 13 games into the season.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Bolts GOP for Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan bolted the GOP on Monday to mount a third-party campaign 
and ``rescue God's country'' from a cultural and moral pit. ``Only 
the Reform Party offers the hope of a real debate and a true 
choice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vaunted two-party system is a snare and a delusion, a  
fraud upon the nation,'' said Buchanan, a thrice-failed GOP 
candidate whose anti-abortion conservatism and anti-trade populism 
could siphon votes from the Republican and Democratic nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	He first must win the Reform Party nomination, no small task if  
billionaire Donald Trump -- who joined the party's New York 
affiliate Monday -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura or party founder 
Ross Perot jump in the race. Buchanan is a longshot for the 
presidency: National polls suggest that no more than one in 10 
voters support him. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting down what he called ``our Patriot's Road,'' the  
pugnacious conservative had harsh words for President Clinton, 
presidential front-runner George W. Bush, the Supreme Court, the 
Education Department, leaders of both major parties, United Nations 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and ``the godless New World Order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me say to the money boys and the Beltway elites who think  
that, at long last, they have pulled up their drawbridge and locked 
us out forever: You don't know this peasant army. We have not yet 
begun to fight!'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go Pat, go!'' shouted more than 300 supporters from the ranks  
of the Republican and Reform parties, gathered at a suburban 
Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	His sound system repeatedly failing him, the former Nixon White  
House aide joked, ``Who put G. Gordon Liddy in charge of the 
microphones?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in Manchester, N.H., on Monday night, Buchanan declared  
himself ``in this fight to the end for the causes we believe in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need another Xerox copy as the Republicans and  
Democrats have become in Washington, D.C.,'' he told an 
invitation-only gathering of about 200 supporters and New Hampshire 
Reform Party members. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is the sixth person to quit the GOP nomination race,  
leaving Bush and five others. A compacted primary schedule and the 
Texas governor's record-shattering fund-raising winnowed the field 
earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan criticized Bush's education plans and delivered a  
veiled slap at the front-runner by saying both parties ``seek out 
the hollow men, the malleable men'' as candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by his campaign, Bush said, ``Pat  
Buchanan is leaving the Republican Party because Republicans 
rejected his views during his three failed attempts to earn the 
Republican Party's presidential nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were more pointed than usual from Bush. He had  
measured his words in recent weeks as others denounced Buchanan's 
views about Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential rival John McCain of Arizona, who had suggested  
that Bush was appeasing Buchanan, issued a terse statement Monday. 
``I do not mourn his departure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, whose insurgent campaigns hobbled Republican  
front-runners in 1992 and 1996, failed for eight months to break 
out of second-tier status in the Republican presidential field. 
Though low in polls and money, Republicans consider him a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime that we have these third party movements they create  
risk and why take that risk?'' Jim Nicholson, the Republican 
National Committee chairman, said on CNN's ``Inside Politics.'' 
``In our party we have the chance for the first time in 45 years to 
elect a Republican president and have a Republican Congress ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls substantiate GOP fears, although some surveys suggest  
that Buchanan would attract as many Democrats as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, who called Buchanan ``a Hitler lover,'' dropped his GOP  
affiliation Monday in preparation for a potential Reform Party bid. 
He will decide early next year whether to challenge Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the nation's highest-elected Reform Party member,  
pledged to remain governor through 2002 but may be wavering. Perot 
has not ruled out a third presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is more than $12 million in federal money earmarked for  
the Reform Party nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan hopes to forge a coalition of hard-hat Democrats,  
hard-core social conservatives and Reform Party stalwarts who 
helped Perot earn 19 percent of the vote in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of his backers are Perot allies. Ventura is urging Trump to  
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like what he has to say about trade. I can put the abortion  
stuff aside,'' said Valli Sharpe-Geisler, past chairwoman of the 
California Reform Party who attended the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan promised to protect U.S. jobs from unfair trade, fight  
against abortion, keep the nation out of foreign entanglements, 
abolish racial quotas, cut taxes, eliminate the Department of 
Education and help return America to better days. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailoring his standard speech for his new party, he also  
denounced the use of unregulated ``soft money'' in politics and 
accused both parties of writing laws ``with lobbyists looking over 
their shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two parties ``have become identical twins'' on a host of  
issues, Buchanan said. ``Neither fights today with conviction and 
courage to rescue God's country from the cultural and moral pit 
into which she has fallen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And neither party is open to dissident voices, which is why he  
was forced to leave, Buchanan said.

<HEADLINE> Illini Looking Ahead to Penn Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Never mind the huge upset over Michigan  
or the impending arrival of No. 2 Penn State. Coach Ron Turner and 
his Illinois team insist this is just another week. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for all of those phone calls. And e-mails.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten a ton of phone calls,'' Turner said at his weekly  
news conference ``After the Minnesota game, I didn't have any 
friends. My phone didn't ring. All of a sudden, I've got a lot of 
buddies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder. Winning a Big Ten game would have been big enough for  
the Illini. But they beat then-No. 9 Michigan at Michigan Stadium, 
rallying from 20 points down for a 35-29 victory. That's tough to 
do, especially for a team that was humiliated the week before by 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Illinois' first victory over a ranked team since beating  
then-No. 17 Arizona in 1995, and the Illini's first win over 
Michigan since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got e-mails, calls from family all over the place,'' said  
Kurt Kittner, who threw four touchdown passes against Michigan. 
``It's a great atmosphere around here. Everybody's really 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But forgive Turner and his team if they don't join in the  
giddiness that's sweeping the Illinois campus. They do, after all, 
have to play Penn State this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be LaVar Arrington's team, he of the infamous  
``Leap'' over the Illini's offensive line last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited about the win; it's the biggest win in my  
career,'' Kittner said. ``But we've got a lot more games left. 
We've got four games left against four good teams. You can't focus 
on a win or you're not going to be ready for the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So despite the victory, Turner had his team back in full pads  
Sunday. The full pads -- plus a team scrimmage -- were punishment 
after the Illini lost to Minnesota 37-7, but they ended up setting 
the tone for Illinois' victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Turner asked his coaches what they wanted to do Sunday,  
the answer was unanimous. No scrimmage, but full pads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to send a message that the reason we played  
well and played with the intensity we had last week was because of 
the mindset we had about what it takes to be successful,'' Turner 
said. ``We found a way to gain an edge last week, and we want to 
maintain that edge and maintain the mentality we had. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we learned a lesson ... that if you're going to win  
in this league and at this level, you've got to be ready every 
week,'' he added. ``You have to learn to get up for every game and 
have great intensity and great focus every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than that, though, it's business as usual. Instead of  
celebrating or basking in last weekend's victory, Kittner said 
he'll spend his free time in the film room. The players will 
practice like it's any other week. 
</P>
<P>
	And Turner will stick to his normal routine, arriving and  
leaving at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, when you get a win, you're doing it a little  
happier. Maybe not quite as grumpy and grouchy,'' he said. 
``There's not a whole lot of difference for me. But I'm probably in 
a little bit better mood so it makes it a little nicer for 
everybody else.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Drops Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Justice Department has dropped its  
efforts to deport a Palestinian immigrant suspected of plotting to 
kill Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision announced late Monday led to the immediate release  
of Hany Mahmoud Kiareldeen, who had been jailed for 19 months on 
the basis of allegations in secret evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration judges this month found that evidence ``unreliable''  
and a federal judge ruled last week that it was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen, 31, who managed a Passaic electronics shop before  
his detention on charges he overstayed his student visa, was never 
charged with a terrorist act. The FBI closed its investigation in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Monday, however, the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service maintained that Kiareldeen posed a threat to national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	After the rulings in Kiareldeen's favor, the INS urged federal  
and immigration judges to keep him in jail while it appealed those 
rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the Board of Immigration Appeals had ruled Wednesday  
that Kiareldeen could be freed after paying $1,500 bond, but the 
INS won a stay until midnight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS had wanted the appeals board to stay the release until  
Friday to give it time to determine whether it will ask Reno's 
office to assume jurisdiction of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Justice Department statement issued late Monday declared  
that ``extraordinary step'' would not be taken. The INS is part of 
the Justice Department, which Reno heads. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meisner and the Justice Department  
``believe that by submitting the evidence to an immigration judge 
and (an appeals board), the process has taken its course,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-classified summaries of the secret evidence collected by the  
FBI said Kiareldeen made a ``credible threat'' to murder Reno 
because of her role in prosecuting the bombers of the World Trade 
Center and that he is a suspected member of an unnamed terrorist 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen has testified that he does not know any of the men  
convicted in the Trade Center bombing and did not know who Reno was 
until he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen's lawyers believe it is the first time a judge has  
rejected the government practice of detaining immigrants based on 
evidence it only shows to immigration judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on non-classified summaries of the secret evidence, the  
lawyers believe it stemmed from vindictive lies told to the FBI by 
Kiareldeen's ex-wife.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, GOP Joust Over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today dismissed House  
Republicans' call for an across-the-board spending cut as ``a bad 
idea'' and said that it was at odds with the special interest 
spending that lawmakers have woven into federal spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, they're suggesting across the board cuts,''  
said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``Then on the 
other,... they've done a record number of earmarked pork 
spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed a $792 billion tax cut passed by  
Congress in September. Lockhart was reacting to a new House 
proposal for a 1.4 percent across the board cut in spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that's a bad idea. It abdicates legislators'  
and the president's responsibility to make choices, to set 
priorities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this at a time when members have voted themselves a  
pretty significant pay raise is going to raise problems with 
Americans all across this country,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's spokesman also criticized House GOP leaders Tom  
DeLay and Dick Armey of Texas for having ``attacked this nation's 
military leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey suggested on Friday that the military could get by with a  
smaller budget if, when Pentagon officials come to brief Congress, 
``instead of having two colonels hold your paper, you'll have only 
one major.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart called Armey's comments ``insulting to the Pentagon.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He ought to think long and hard about repeating things along  
the lines that he said,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans accused the White House of holding  
hostage a bill funding the Defense Department in order to gain 
leverage for administrative initiatives, such as teacher hiring and 
funding for more community police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the $268 billion defense measure, which includes pay  
raises for the military is politically popular, a Clinton veto 
could prove difficult to override according to the top House 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to uphold these vetoes and I'm going to work very  
hard to do that,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri 
said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has signed seven of the 13 spending bills to fund the  
government in the 2000 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. He has 
vetoed two -- on foreign aid and the District of Columbia -- and has 
yet to act on three others, including the defense bill. The largest 
spending bill, dealing with education and health and social 
services, remains before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense bill, approved by wide margins in the House and  
Senate, would increase spending by $17.3 billion and raise military 
pay by 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has until Tuesday to sign the bill or veto it.  
Meanwhile, government agencies whose spending bills have not been 
signed into law are operating under stopgap legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some compromises. We don't need confrontation right  
now,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to me like Dick Gephardt is talking about  
confrontation,'' Domenici said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``He's 
telling the House members, don't help the Republicans with 
anything. He's trying to encourage the president not to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., questioned the reach of  
Gephardt's lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's been used by the left wing of his party, and  
doesn't want to get our work done,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would like to put all the appropriations bills into a big  
bundle and then spend more money. And that's what's happened over 
the years, we're just not going to do that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House economic adviser Gene Sperling defended the threat.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we can come together on that budget, then the president  
won't have to veto anything,'' Sperling said on CNN. ``We certainly 
don't want to veto the defense bill, nobody does, but we need to 
make sure we have an honest budget. Right now, there are some 
problems in that defense budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans might pick up support from some pro-defense  
Democrats who have said they would help provide the two-thirds 
margin in both houses needed to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt denied ``strong-arming'' them or any other Democrats.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I said to my members was if the president vetoes any of  
these budget bills because they don't add up or they don't make 
sense for America, I will work hard to get enough members, both 
Republican and Democratic, to uphold those vetoes,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Spend, Win No Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Free from the $1.1 million spending limit that  
binds other GOP presidential candidates in Iowa, George W. Bush and 
Steve Forbes each poured $800,000 into the state's Republican straw 
poll, which selected no delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	With three months to go before the Iowa caucuses open the  
primary season, neither candidate has unleashed his full spending 
power. Already, Bush has been shelling out more than $4 million per 
month from his record-breaking campaign treasury and Forbes, who is 
relying on his personal wealth, has been spending $3.5 million per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	When Elizabeth Dole dropped out of the Republican race last  
week, she said it all comes down to ``money, money, money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ames, Iowa event, an early barometer of campaigns' strength,  
is a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
	The $800,000 that the Bush and Forbes campaigns each estimate  
they spent on the August straw poll is two-thirds of the total Iowa 
spending allowed for candidates who accept federal matching funds. 
Because they aren't accepting the money, Bush and Forbes don't have 
to abide by the spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush won a decisive first place with 7,418 votes, at a cost of  
about $108 for each. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes placed second with 4,921 votes, spending about $160 for  
each. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his campaign finance report, Bush spent $279,450 on  
tickets, each costing $25. Many went unused. To get voters to the 
poll, he chartered $82,532 worth of buses. He paid $43,500 for a 
prime spot near the polling place for a campaign tent, where 
supporters were fed $64,719 worth of pork barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spent $8,000 to rent his site and $81,110 on buses,  
hiring some of them from Kansas, Minnesota and Wisconsin. He spent 
$192,500 on tickets and served 9,000 barbecue meals at a cost of 
$27,589. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, conservative activist Gary Bauer, who finished  
fourth, reported spending $12,275 on tickets -- enough to cover 
about one-fourth of his 2,114 voters -- and $4,700 to rent a 
campaign site at the event. ``We had a lot of people pay their own 
way,'' Bauer campaign manager Frank Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, who spent $5,500 to rent her space and didn't report  
buying any tickets, finished third with 3,410 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and Forbes campaign officials said they got their money's  
worth in Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had to be competitive,'' Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal  
Col said. ``That's how you get your viability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, disappointing finishes in Ames contributed to two  
candidates' decisions to quit the Republican race: former Tennessee 
Gov. Lamar Alexander, who came in sixth, and former Vice President 
Dan Quayle, who was eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush needed to win to meet skyrocketing expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was an early test of our organization in the state,'' Bush  
campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. ``It showed us we were 
doing something right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the well-heeled Bush and Forbes campaigns, there were other,  
bigger expenses for the quarter that ended Sept. 30, according to 
campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush -- who has raised a record $57 million thus far this year --  
spent $2.4 million to attract more donations. It cost him $1 
million to process incoming checks. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent almost $500,000 on charter airplanes, $1.7 million on  
payroll, and $26,554 on polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also spent $1 million on TV ads that are now starting to  
air in Iowa and New Hampshire, site of the nation's first 
primaries. The campaign also produced commercials designed to look 
like an opponent's attack ads for test purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Bush spent $12.8 million over the three months, compared  
with $10.6 million spent by Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spent $1.5 million on radio and television ads, $1  
million on direct mail and telemarketing, and $264,336 on polling. 
He spent $337,431 to operate the campaign web site, which features 
simulcasts of Forbes campaign events and online chats. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the start of the campaign, Bush has spent almost $20  
million while Forbes is close behind at almost $19 million. 
Candidates who receive federal funds are limited to spending around 
$40 million through next summer.

<HEADLINE> Braves Falling Apart in All Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fall Classic? The Bad News Braves are giving a  
performance worthy of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	The hitters are taking horrible swings. The fielders are sloppy.  
The pitchers can't hit their spots. 
</P>
<P>
	It wouldn't be so bad if this was Florida in February. But this  
was Turner Field in October, when four victories are needed to 
secure the title as Team of the Decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, this World Series looks more like the Debacle of the  
Decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees, willing and able to take advantage of  
every mistake, are halfway home to their 25th championship, blowing 
through Atlanta like a sweep in the making. 
</P>
<P>
	New York leads 2-0 in the best-of-7 World Series after a 7-2  
rout of the Braves on Sunday night. The next three games are at 
Yankee Stadium, though two might be enough if things don't change 
dramatically for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not playing like the team that won 103 games,'' reliever  
John Rocker said. ``We haven't looked good in any area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only consolation: Atlanta is in virtually the same  
predicament that faced New York three years ago, when the Braves 
outscored the AL champs 16-1 to win the first two games at Yankee 
Stadium. New York took the title by winning the next four, 
including three in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there are just seven players on the Atlanta roster  
who played in the '96 Series, so the Braves might have to be 
content with being runnerup for the fourth time this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1996 Series has no bearing on this Series as far as I'm  
concerned,'' said Terry Mulholland, acquired in a midseason trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's hitters look downright futile against New York's wily  
pitchers, who clearly know that just about everyone except Chipper 
Jones is willing to swing at offerings beyond the limits of the 
strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe if Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez were able to play,  
things would be different. But with a revamped lineup that included 
three players -- Ozzie Guillen, Keith Lockhart and Greg Myers -- 
making their first starts of the postseason, the Braves had only 
five hits to follow up their two-hit, 4-1 loss in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest thing to a rally came in the ninth Sunday, when the  
Braves put together three hits and two meaningless runs before a 
mostly empty stadium. They are batting just .121 (7-of-58) in the 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens all the time during a 162-game schedule,'' hitting  
coach Don Baylor said. ``Right now, it's the World Series. When 
you're the last two teams playing, it becomes more magnified 
anytime you're struggling for runs. But we're not just struggling 
for runs. We're struggling for hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 was basically over after the top half of the first. Chuck  
Knoblauch led off against Kevin Millwood by lining an 0-2 pitch for 
a single. Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill followed with hits as well, 
the latter driving in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, the Braves' most consistent starter and the same guy  
who threw a one-hitter against Houston in the division series, had 
a chance to escape when Bernie Williams hit into a double play. But 
Tino Martinez singled in another run, Ricky Ledee walked and Scott 
Brosius made it 3-0 with yet another line-drive single. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third, the Yankees finished off Millwood, who suffered  
his shortest outing of the season. Williams singled, Martinez 
singled and Ledee doubled in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox walked slowly to the mound to remove Millwood,  
who had gone at least five innings in every start -- 33 in a row -- 
since lasting just 3 1-3 innings at Los Angeles on April 20. Of the 
eight hits he surrendered, five came with two strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would get ahead in the count, then throw it down the middle  
of the plate,'' Millwood said. ``You can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was time for the defense to fall apart.  
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, inserted for offense, cost a run at shortstop when he  
inexplicably dropped David Cone's soft liner in the fourth with two 
outs and a runner at third. Cox, looking on from the dugout, held 
his hands over his cap in disbelieving anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just made one mistake,'' Guillen said. ``We didn't lose the  
game because of my mistake. We lost the game because we didn't 
score any runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart contributed to the defensive woes at second base. In  
the fourth, Martinez hit a grounder that should have been an 
inning-ending double play, but Lockhart bobbled the relay throw 
from Guillen and made a hurried, off-target throw to first, 
allowing another run to score. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, some Atlanta fans already were slipping out the gates  
at Turner Field. The ample New York contingent remained to the end, 
chanting ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!''

<HEADLINE> Miss. Gov. Candidates Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- The two candidates running for governor  
courted voters on the crucial Gulf Coast Monday in their final 
debate before next week's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrat Ronnie Musgrove, the lieutenant governor, and former  
Republican congressman Mike Parker, both gambling opponents, talked 
about helping the industry that has transformed the face of the 
coast since riverboat gambling was legalized in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, asked about an earlier comment that gambling is a ``tax  
on the stupid,'' did not back track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not gamble. The casino owners themselves do not gamble,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove defended the failure of a proposal at the Capitol to  
allow casino classes at state universities. He said that although 
he would support courses like hotel management, he opposes the 
teaching of table games such as card dealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The WLOX-TV debate was the final stop of a hectic day of  
campaigning for the men vying to replace Gov. Kirk Fordice. With 
the election eight days away and polls showing them in a tight 
race, both sides seemed tense. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove accused Parker of being light on issues and said  
``we're not running for president of a fraternity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker lashed out at Musgrove for bringing up votes during his  
decade in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're playing a little bit of a game here Ronnie and you know  
it,'' said Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	When Parker was given a chance to ask Musgrove questions, part  
of the prearranged debate format, he declined saying he did not 
agree with ``gotcha politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of uncertainty in both camps, and they're taking  
advantage of getting before the media. It has some positives for 
both candidates, and it definitely has some positives for the 
public,'' said Marty Wiseman, a political science professor at 
Mississippi State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate will be aired by WLOX Tuesday night, but reporters  
were allowed into the taping Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiseman said Parker, a former funeral home owner who spent 10  
years in Congress, has the more relaxed demeanor in the face-offs 
while Musgrove generally has more detailed answers and attacks.

<HEADLINE> Text of Buchanan's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here is the text of Pat Buchanan's speech announcing plans to  
seek the Reform Party presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Good morning again, and happy St. Crispin's Day and let's make a  
little history. Today I am ending my lifelong membership in the 
Republican Party and my campaign for its nomination, and I'm 
declaring my intention to see the nomination of the Reform Party 
for the presidency of the United States of America. 
</P>
<P>
	This decision was not made without anguish and regret. I will  
forever cherish the memory of having been perhaps the only 
Goldwater right in the graduating class of the graduate school of 
journalism in Columbia in New York in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor will I ever regret my nine years of service to Richard  
Nixon, from his comeback campaigns of 1966 and '68 to the great 
triumph, 49 states in 1972, to the tragic final days of Watergate. 
I was with Nixon in China, and I had the high honor of being Ronald 
Reagan's second in the great Panama Canal debates, and of being at 
his side when that great president refused to give up a missile 
defense for his country and walked out of the summit at Reykjavik 
in Ronald Reagan's finest hour of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	From the thunderous reception we got at Houston in 1992, when I  
told the Buchanan Brigades we had to come home and stand beside 
George Bush, to the ovations at Ames this summer last when I faced 
off with his son, the governor, the Republican Party has been good 
to me, and I have tried to be loyal to it. But as John F. Kennedy 
said, sometimes party loyalty asks too much, and today it asks too 
much of us. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, candor compels us to admit that our vaunted two-party  
system is a snare and a delusion, a fraud upon the nation. Our two 
parties have become nothing but two wings on the same bird of prey. 
</P>
<P>
	On foreign and trade policy, open borders and centralized power,  
our Beltway parties have become identical twins. Both supported 
NAFTA and GATT and the surrender of American sovereignty to the 
World Trade Organization. Both supported the extension of nuclear 
war guarantees right up to the borders of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Both supported the illegal war on Serbia.  
</P>
<P>
	Both support IMF bailouts of corrupt and even criminal regimes.  
Both voted for MFN trade privileges for a communist China that is 
right now pointing missiles at our country, the United States of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	So let me say to the leaders of those two parties in Washington,  
D.C.: The appeasement of Beijing is a bipartisan disgrace, and we 
will not be a party to it. 
</P>
<P>
	And neither party speaks for the forgotten Americans whose jobs  
were sent overseas to finance the boom market of the 1990s that the 
rest of us enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties are addicted to soft money; both write laws with  
corporate lobbyists looking over their shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Both embrace the amoral and unprincipled politics of  
triangulation, and neither fights with conviction and courage to 
rescue God's country from the cultural and moral pit into which she 
has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	The day of the outsider is over. And the Beltway parties, the  
money men, have seen to that. Never again will our political 
establishment permit a dissident to come as close to capturing a 
nomination as we did in 1996. They have rearranged the primary 
schedules and rigged the game to protect the party favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates of ideas need not apply. As both parties--both  
parties--seek out the hollow men, the malleable men, willing to 
read from teleprompters speeches scripted by consultants and 
pollsters to whom the latest readout from the focus group is sacred 
text. So... 
</P>
<P>
	And we choose not to play our assigned walk-on role in their  
sham election. 
</P>
<P>
	We've just started going here, friends.  
</P>
<P>
	We've just started.  
</P>
<P>
	My friends, this year I believe is our last chance to save our  
Republic before she disappears into a Godless new world order that 
our elites are constructing in betrayal of everything for which the 
founding fathers fought and lived and died. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Reform Party offers a hope of a real debate and a real  
choice of destinies for our country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't go now, Pat,'' I've been told by loyalists all  
across America, ``every cause for which we have fought for seven 
years will die.'' But we can't let those causes die, because they 
are America's cause. 
</P>
<P>
	So let me say to the money boys and the Beltway elites who think  
that at long last they have pulled up the drawbridge and locked us 
out forever, you don't know this peasant army. We have not yet 
begun to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	So let me--let me lay out our patriot's road for America.  
</P>
<P>
	With the Cold War over, we shall craft a foreign policy for a  
new century rooted in the great tradition of Washington, Jefferson 
and John Quincy Adams who wrote: Wherever the standard of freedom 
and independence shall be imperiled, unfurled there will America's 
heart, her benedictions and her prayers be, but she goes not abroad 
in search of monsters to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
	I pledge to you I will never send an American army to fight in a  
foreign war unless our country is attacked or our vital interests 
are imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
	They call us isolationists. And that's one of the nicest things  
they call us. 
</P>
<P>
	They call us isolationists. Well, if they mean I intend to  
isolate America from all the bloody territorial, tribal and ethnic 
wars of the 21st century, I plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first duty of a statesman to keep his countries out of  
wars that are not his country's quarrels. And the junk yards of 
history are strewn with the wreckage of republics and empires that 
failed to heed that lesson. 
</P>
<P>
	We intend to dust off an ancient document and restore it to its  
rightful place as the altar-piece of American government. You may 
have heard of it; it is called the Constitution of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that Constitution, before America goes to war, the  
Congress must declare war. By my reading of that Constitution, the 
soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines of the United States 
are never to be the imperial troops of anybody's new world order. 
</P>
<P>
	We will bring our soldiers home, where they belong, and rebuild  
our military might and morale so no nation will dare attack 
</P>
<P>
	And the first step to restore that morale is to evict from the  
bully pulpit of the Oval Office our own Elmer Gantry, Mr. Clinton, 
whose desecration... 
</P>
<P>
	... whose desecration of the temples of our civilization and  
personal misconduct disqualify him and make him unfit to be 
commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	We Americans are a good and generous people. Our tradition of  
being first at the scene of natural disasters anywhere in the 
world, providing food and shelter for its victims, that is rooted 
deep in our hearts. That great tradition we shall maintain. But IMF 
bailouts of deadbeat dictators will end, and we must phase out 
foreign aid and start looking out for the forgotten Americans right 
here in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It is time for a new patriotism, where America's sovereignty is  
wholly and fully restored. And if, as Secretary General Kofi Annan 
has threatened us, we will lose our vote in the United Nations if 
we don't give him the $1 billion he says we owe him, I would give 
Mr. Kofi this world of advice: Sir, don't go there. 
</P>
<P>
	Because if our vote in the UN is in jeopardy, your lease on  
Turtle Bay is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	As for America's monstrous trade deficits, even Mr. Greenspan is  
now alarmed as they approach four percent of our entire economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of NAFTA and GATT, America's industrial base has been  
hollowed out. Our manufacturing workers, who have to support 
families on a single wage, have been forced to compete with 
sweatshop labor. And our country has been left dependent on imports 
for the vital necessities of it's national life. 
</P>
<P>
	We must cut out these cancerous deficits and make America a  
self-reliant nation again. 
</P>
<P>
	And to those...  
</P>
<P>
	And to those who prattle on about our obligations and debts to  
the global economy... 
</P>
<P>
	(Buchanan experiences trouble with the sound system)  
</P>
<P>
	Do you hear it now?  
</P>
<P>
	All right. Let's get back in the spirit of things. OK.  
</P>
<P>
	Let me go back and say, we're going to cut out these cancerous  
trade deficits and make America self-reliant a nation again. And to 
those who prattle on about our debts and obligations to the global 
economy, let me repeat again what I've said before: I'm not running 
for president of the world, I'm running for president of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	I tell you--and I want to tell you network fellows that what's  
been knocking out these microphones is all that applause we've been 
getting, right? 
</P>
<P>
	But of all the needs of this nation, none is greater for our  
peace and happiness than racial reconciliation. The backsliding 
toward hyphenated Americanism must end. Let us abolish quotas... 
</P>
<P>
	Let us abolish quotas and set aside these un-American devices  
that reward people based on the color of their skin or what 
continent their kinfolk came from. Let us abandon the sterile and 
futile politics of victims and villains and rediscover what brings 
us all together as one nation and one people. All of us must learn 
our English language. All of us must come to know our common 
history and heritage and American heroes so we can get our great 
American melting pot doing its magic again. Any man... 
</P>
<P>
	Let me say, any man or any woman from any continent or any  
country can be a good American. We know that. But it takes time to 
assimilate the 30 million folks who have come here in the last 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	We need time to do that. Indeed, we need a timeout on legal  
immigration to ease the downward pressure on workers wages and to 
defeat the forces of separatism that threaten us and nations all 
over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	This land is our land. It belongs to all of us--immigrant and  
native-born alike. And it would be unpardonable in gratitude if we, 
the children of pioneers and patriots of every color, creed and 
continent, lost this last best hope of Earth because we could not 
learn to live with one another or could not learn to love one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	If America stands for anything in this world, it is freedom. Yet  
today, America is among the most over-taxed, over-regulated, and 
over-governed societies in history. Our federal government collects 
a fifth of all our national wealth each year and controls almost 
half of it. Can anyone name a single regulation that has been 
repealed in the last 10 years, or a single agency that has been 
abolished? 
</P>
<P>
	Even the dismal little National Endowment for the Arts gamely  
soldiers on. 
</P>
<P>
	We need to restore the old constitutional division of labor in  
government: defense and foreign policy are the province of the 
federal government, but welfare and education are the business of 
state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
	And in children's education, parents come first, teachers come  
second, and federal judges, not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Bush down there in Texas says his Department of Education  
will write tests for fourth-grade children in Idaho. But if I am 
elected president, the bureaucrats at the Department of Education 
are not going to be testing kids, they're going to be testing the 
magic of the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	And all federal money for the schoolchildren of America will be  
sent back to the school districts of America where accountability 
begins and authority belongs. 
</P>
<P>
	We need a new Supreme Court where only constitutionalists need  
apply, a court that will respect both state's rights and human 
rights, that will begin to undo the damage done this nation by 
judicial aggressions, beginning with that abomination they call Roe 
v. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	We need a president and a Congress that will pick up the whip  
the Founding Fathers left in Article 3 of the Constitution, to 
heard the justices back into the narrow stalls to which they were 
first consigned by Hamilton and Madison. What is a... 
</P>
<P>
	... what is a self-governing people doing meekly waiting each  
week for nine jurists to tell us how we may live and how we should 
governor ourselves? 
</P>
<P>
	As our fathers threw off a tyranny of kings, let us throw off  
this tyranny of judges and let America be America again. 
</P>
<P>
	As for our IRS tax code, it is an insult to a free people, the  
product--the product of an endless series of corrupt bargains 
between legislators and lobbyists. Let us tear this weed out by its 
roots, cut taxes to the lowest levels in history, eliminate taxes 
on savers and small business and shift the burden where it belongs: 
on the backs of a global transnational elite that has no loyalty to 
any country. 
</P>
<P>
	For every tax on manufactured goods made in the U.S.A., let us  
put an equal tax on foreign goods dumped in the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
	For every--for every tariff that China puts on us, let's put an  
equal tariff on them. That way--that way, Mr. Clinton's principal 
campaign contributors down at the Chinese embassy can start help 
paying for the 7th Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends, ours is truly the best of times and the worst of times.  
With our miraculous advances in medicine, science and technology, 
none of us would want to go back to yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	But something good has been lost in those years as well: the old  
patriotism, a popular culture that undergirded the values of faith 
(inaudible) country; the idea that we Americans are one people who 
sacrifice and suffer together and go forward and progress together. 
The mutual respect, the sense of limits, the good manners--all are 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	My life has been spent in the great and good vocations of  
politics and journalism and government. None commands the respect 
it once did. All are today in disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
	I cannot think of a time since Watergate so poisoned with rancor  
and hostility. And I don't know if any president can change that 
the way Ronald Reagan infused his times with that spirit of 
confidence and unabashed love of country for which he became so 
famous. But I do know this: I will try. 
</P>
<P>
	America needs a government of national unity and reconciliation  
that draws from the best of all parties. And I promise you, I will 
create that kind of government. And if we lead, they will follow; 
and if we build it, they will come. 
</P>
<P>
	My friends, all the great empires of Europe that began our  
century so full of swagger and bombast all came crashing down in 
ruins. All are now surrendering their independence and their 
identities to a superstate in Europe that pays homage to the great 
god, mammon. 
</P>
<P>
	America, alone, yet endures, independent and free.  
</P>
<P>
	The great questions before us are these: Shall we, too, yield to  
their temptation, follow their path and suffer their fate? Forbid 
it, Almighty God. Is the call to empire irresistible? Is world 
government inevitable? Or can American remain forever a light unto 
the nations, an example to mankind of how a free people should 
govern themselves, a republic above whose sovereignty stands the 
sovereignty of God alone? 
</P>
<P>
	This is our cause. And so it is, that in the name of the  
Founding Fathers we go forward to rescue our Lady America, and will 
not quit this fight as long as there is breath within us. 
</P>
<P>
	God bless this republic and God bless America.

<HEADLINE> BankBoston Changes Name to Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The venerable bank that held Paul Revere and John  
Hancock's money is losing its identity. 
</P>
<P>
	With its recent acquisition by Fleet Financial Group, BankBoston  
will now be known simply as Fleet, the company announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the bank's first name change, but it's the first time  
in 215 years that ``Boston'' has been removed from its banner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very painful,'' said Gerard Cassidy, banking analyst for  
Tucker Anthony. ``I fully feel for the BankBoston people because 
that name has been around for 200 years. It hurts. To say it 
doesn't is baloney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Boston'' name isn't completely disappearing. It is part of  
the company's new corporate identity, FleetBoston Financial, and in 
Latin America, where the bank has a strong presence, BankBoston 
will remain in use. 
</P>
<P>
	But customers used to seeing BankBoston signs -- or before its  
acquisition of BayBank a few years earlier, Bank of Boston signs -- 
will soon only see the Fleet moniker. 
</P>
<P>
	The new financial services institution, now the country's  
eighth-largest, has assets of $185 billion and a market 
capitalization of about $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet's chairman and chief executive officer, Terrence Murray,  
acknowledged the difficulty of changing a venerable name, full of 
symbolism and emotion, but noted Fleet's own heritage went back to 
its founding as a bank in Providence, R.I., in 1791. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terry really was very understanding and wanted to adopt the  
heritage of the company,'' said BankBoston's former CEO and Fleet 
president, Charles K. Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's banking realities, however, suggested the name would be  
Fleet anyway, Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BankBoston name, which is a venerable name, has a  
phenomenal franchise value inside Route 128,'' he said. ``In 10 
years, will the name BankBoston sell in Rahway, N.J., Rochester, 
N.Y., or Waterbury, Conn.?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need a name that is unique to the company but doesn't  
retain any preference to geography,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Study Soldiers' Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remains believed to be those of four American  
servicemen killed in the Korean War were flown to an Army 
laboratory in Hawaii after being released to U.S. officials in 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains will be studied at the Central Identification  
Laboratory at Hickam Air Force Base in hopes of confirming their 
identities, possibly through the use of DNA, the Pentagon announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief repatriation ceremony on an airport runway in  
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, the four sets of remains were 
handed over to a U.S. delegation led by Robert L. Jones, deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for POW-MIA affairs. They were then 
flown to Yokota Air Base, Japan, and then to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains were recovered during a joint U.S.-North Korean  
excavation earlier this year. The Pentagon believes the four 
soldiers were killed in late November or early December 1950 in 
battles at the Chongchon River in North Korea, where the American 
8th Army suffered the brunt of China's initial entry into the war 
and lost hundreds of men. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea delayed the repatriation for months by demanding  
that it occur in Pyongyang as a strictly U.S.-North Korea event 
instead of in the Demilitarized Zone separating north and south 
Korea in the presence of United Nations Command personnel. U.S. 
officials agreed to the demand this month to get the remains back. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,200 U.S. servicemen are still listed as missing from the  
1950-53 Korean War. In the past three years, the United States has 
recovered remains believed to be those of 39 Americans. Of those, 
three have been positively identified and returned to their 
families for burial. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. recovery team is in North Korea searching for more  
remains.

<HEADLINE> Friends Remember Payne Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Through their shock and sadness, Payne Stewart's friends and  
competitors remembered him Monday as far more than just a golfer in 
funny clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	To them, he was a giant of the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``What a wonderful man. He was a great credit to golf and to our  
country,'' said Billy Casper. ``Golf lost a great man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greats of the past and present, stunned at Stewart's tragic  
death, joined to praise him both for his conquests on the course 
and the way he conducted his life off it. 
</P>
<P>
	From the quieted fairways of the Champions Golf Club in Houston  
where he was to play this weekend to the somber Orlando, Fla., 
neighborhood where Stewart lived, they offered their reflections. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an enormous void and emptiness I feel right now,''  
Tiger Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most terrible tragedies of modern day golf,'' was  
the way Arnold Palmer described it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be sorely missed by anyone who ever knew him or had  
the pleasure of watching him play,'' Jack Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day the golf world started by celebrating a new Ryder Cup  
captain and looking forward to this week's Tour Championship, it 
ended in mourning a player whose knickers and tam o'shanter hat 
made him one of the most recognizable personalities in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane crash that killed Stewart and four others quickly  
turned what had been a time of joy into one of grief for Curtis 
Strange, the new Ryder Cup captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lost someone who is truly a great ambassador for the  
game,'' Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Champions Golf Club, workers continued to tend to the  
manicured fairways and greens in preparation for the season-ending 
Tour Championship. Stewart was on his way to Texas for the 
tournament when his plane crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags flew at half staff, and there was a somber mood in the  
air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Missing him is just unbelievable,'' said course owner Jackie  
Burke, a longtime PGA member. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an irreplaceable guy,'' Duffy Waldorf said. ``I think of  
Payne Stewart and there's a guy that's going to be like Jack 
Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, a guy you want around all those 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Maggert was at the course practicing for the tournament  
when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a tough week for all the players, for myself, for  
the wives, everyone,'' Maggert said. ``It's a tragic situation'' 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour canceled the tournament's Tuesday pro-am, but the  
tournament was still scheduled to begin Thursday ``like he would 
want us to do,'' Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he should ever be replaced in this event,''  
Burke said. ``There will just be a spot there open for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jacobsen, one of Stewart's good friends on the PGA Tour  
who also played in a band with him occasionally, said Stewart's 
record, which included two U.S. Open titles, spoke for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	More than that, though, Jacobsen said Stewart's love of golf and  
its traditions should also be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a real reverence for the game,'' Jacobsen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard, who played with Stewart in a losing alternate  
shot match against Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik in the Ryder 
Cup, had to go inside and compose himself after nearly breaking 
down while hearing the news at a promotional appearance in Fort 
Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was the emotional leader of the U.S. Ryder Cup team, who  
wore his patriotism and pride to play for his country on his sleeve 
and urged his fellow players to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also Stewart who made all his teammates play ping-pong at  
night to relieve their stress and make them bond together as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tense up there. It was something that gave you a  
nice little release,'' U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw said. ``Payne was 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said Stewart was ``very much a believer in playing for  
his country, very much a patriot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't only the American players who mourned Stewart, though.  
Members of Europe's Ryder Cup team, gathered in Jerez, Spain, for 
the Volvo Masters, were also devastated by the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal fought back tears as he  
remembered Stewart as a ``true sportsman on the course and a 
gentleman off it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew what the Ryder Cup meant to him, but he never lost  
perspective on what the match was all about,'' Olazabal said. ``We 
have lost a precious man and someone who still had good years ahead 
of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France's Jean Van de Velde agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated, totally devastated. It certainly puts into  
perspective little things like missed putts,'' Van de Velde said. 
``My thoughts go to his family because he was such a family man. He 
was a wonderful sportsman and wonderful person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the golf world, there was also reaction. Stewart was a  
big Orlando Magic fan, and former Magic guard Penny Hardaway knew 
him well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the guys in Florida are devastated right now,''  
Hardaway said from Phoenix. ``I knew his family. I've been to his 
home. He's given me golf clubs. He's one of those guys you either 
love or hate, and I loved him because you always knew where he 
stood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's most indelible public image may be of his hands in the  
air in the early evening at Pinehurst earlier this year, when he 
made a 15-foot putt on the 18th green to win the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be what Crenshaw remembers most, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will always remember that smile and that laugh and that  
beautiful, graceful swing,'' he said. ``It's hard to believe we're 
not going to watch that effortless swing anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Seated in Gay Attack Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A jury that includes three university  
students was seated today to hear graphic testimony in the trial of 
a man accused of beating Matthew Shepard to death. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of 10 men and six women, including four alternates, was  
selected and will be sequestered during the trial, which is 
expected to take four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were scheduled for later this afternoon to  
give jurors enough time to return home and pack belongings for the 
hotel stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron McKinney, 22, is accused of first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery. He could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, and McKinney's father, grandparents and  
a stepsister sat on opposite sides near the back of the packed 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a 21-year-old college freshman who was gay, was found  
bloodied, comatose and tied to a fence some 18 hours after leaving 
a bar with the co-defendants. He died five days later from 18 blows 
to the face and head. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Russell Henderson's trial in April ended just  
before the jury was seated when he pleaded guilty to felony murder 
and kidnapping and received two life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea allowed Henderson to avoid the death penalty. Whether  
McKinney has been offered a similar deal has not been disclosed. 
Attorneys and court officials are under a gag order and are 
prohibited from discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say no agreement has likely been offered because  
prosecutors see McKinney as the main aggressor in the attack and 
deserving of a stiffer penalty than Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's lawyers already have said during jury selection that  
he played a role in the fatal beating on Oct. 7, 1998, but that he 
never intended or planned to kill Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Dion Custis has said the death was not a hate  
crime. He told prospective jurors that drugs and alcohol spurred 
McKinney's actions, and his client's use of those substances would 
be a core part of his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you have to decide in this case is basically a question  
of why,'' he said during jury selection last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Custis has said in court proceedings that he will try to  
persuade the jury to convict his client of the lesser offense of 
second-degree murder or manslaughter, which do not carry a possible 
death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	He must also try to prove Shepard's death did not result from a  
kidnapping or robbery because Wyoming subscribes to the 
felony-murder rule. That law allows a defendant to be convicted of 
murder for a death that results from the commission of a felony, 
even if the death is unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, even if McKinney avoids conviction on the  
individual first-degree murder charge, he could still face the 
death penalty if the jury finds Shepard died as a result of a 
robbery or kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no intent or premeditation to affect the death of  
Matthew Shepard and also this did not occur during perpetration of 
a robbery, also known as felony murder,'' Custis told prospective 
jurors earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Custis has said the case is not a hate crime, some  
analysts speculate the defense may argue that McKinney reacted 
angrily to an advance by Shepard, a so-called ``gay panic'' 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some fine line there where you could say, `I don't  
hate gays. I didn't intend to harm a gay person. When the gay 
person touched me, I lost my senses and under the influence of 
drugs attacked a gay person,''' said Andrew Cohen, a Denver legal 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the gay panic strategy has been used successfully  
before, fewer juries are accepting it these days, said Jeffrey 
Montgomery of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when it was a virtual guarantee to get an  
acquittal, but in recent years it's been much more difficult,'' he 
said. ``Juries are not as influenced by it, but it's also because 
prosecutors are much more better prepared and able to counter it.''

	Buchanan, Trump To Join Reform Party  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-time Republican presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan says he will leave the party and seek the Reform Party's 
nomination because he has been deserted by the ``Washington elite 
of the GOP.'' Buchanan is not assured of winning the Reform Party 
nod and would be a longshot in the general election, although 
Democratic and Republican operatives say he could win enough votes 
to make a mark on the 2000 elections. New York developer Donald 
Trump also says he will make the switch in a possible prelude to 
his own candidacy. Trump says the Republicans have moved too far to 
the right, while the Democrats have moved too far to the left.

died, a spokesman said. He was 77. Chafee, who had represented the 
state in the Senate for nearly 23 years, died of heart failure last

death of a black man. Two co-defendants of Shawn Allen Berry, John 
William King and Lawrence Russell Brewer, were convicted in the 
murder of James Byrd Jr. and sent to death row. The three men -- who 
have suspected ties to the Ku Klux Klan -- were accused of chaining 
Byrd to the bumper of Berry's pickup truck and dragging him over 
three miles of bumpy country road on June 7, 1998. Byrd's head, 
neck and right arm were shorn off.

the Russians were planning an attack on Grozny. The Russian 
military claimed to have destroyed an anti-aircraft gun and two 
vehicles full of militants in strikes overnight, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency said today. There was no immediate word on casualties from 
Chechen officials. Chechen government leaders have called 
repeatedly for peace talks, demanding they be held on neutral

	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii's shipping industry and the state  
dockworkers' union reached a tentative settlement early today, 
averting a statewide dock strike. The threat of a strike had 
triggered panic buying of staples like rice and toilet paper. In

<HEADLINE> Strange Is New Ryder Cup Captain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Curtis Strange, a two-time U.S. Open champion who played on five  
Ryder Cup teams, today was appointed captain of the U.S. Ryder Cup 
team that will try to retain the title in 2001 at The Belfry in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're chosen for your ability to lead, to prepare your  
players and to win back the cup,'' Strange said from the PGA of 
America headquarters in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. ``It's a daunting 
challenge, but I'm looking forward to it very much. ... It's truly 
an honor, but also a tough task.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It could be especially difficult this time given the controversy  
that followed the Americans' stunning comeback at The Country Club 
last month outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Europeans complained bitterly about insults from the gallery.  
Inside the ropes, they accused U.S. players of inciting the raucous 
fans and crossing the line of sportsmanship by charging across the 
17th green when Justin Leonard holed a 45-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal still had a 25-foot putt that would have  
kept the match alive and the cup undecided. When the cheering 
subsided, he missed, although the two-time Masters champion later 
said the celebration did not affect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be over the edge and we apologized,'' Strange said.  
``Hopefully, they accept our apology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange called the fans at Brookline, Mass., the ``greatest in  
the world,'' in part because he won the first of consecutive U.S. 
Open titles at The Country Club in 1988, beating Nick Faldo in a 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Belfry is not going to be as tough as people imagine,'' he  
said. ``They root hard for their own team, which they should. Part 
of my job is to prepare my team for the task at hand, not only to 
win the cup, to prepare for fans rooting very strongly for their 
own team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said one of his first priorities will be to talk with  
the European captain about the intensity that has been building in 
the biennial matches. Sam Torrance is considered the front-runner 
to succeed Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of what happened, and we don't expect it to happen  
again,'' Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Strange has been widely accepted by several key  
players, such as Tiger Woods and Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be neat to have him over there in that environment,''  
Woods said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange has won 17 times on the PGA Tour, but not since he  
became the first player since Ben Hogan to win back-to-back U.S. 
Opens in 1989. He has spent the past three years splitting time 
between the PGA Tour and as a golf analyst for ABC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He said all five of his Ryder Cup experiences have been a  
thrill, although not all were victorious. Strange played on only 
one winning team, in 1983 under captain Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	He last played in 1995, when he was a captain's pick of Lanny  
Wadkins and missed two par putts on the final two holes in a 
decisive match against Faldo that returned the Ryder Cup to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Strange is prepared to be under the spotlight once  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, the accolades won't go to me if we win because it's  
the players,'' Strange said. ``If we lose, it comes back to me, and 
that's OK. If you think you're good enough to win, you better have 
the guts to lose.''

<HEADLINE> Exxon, Mobil Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Exxon Corp. said today its third-quarter  
earnings rose from a year earlier because of higher crude oil 
prices, but the company said its profit growth was held back by 
competitive pricing in refined products. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar report was issued by Mobil Corp., which plans to merge  
with Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices for both companies fell. At midday, shares of Exxon  
were trading at $75.56 1/4, down $1.31 1/4 or 1.7 percent, on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Shares of Mobil were trading at $99.68 3/4, down 
$2.31 1/4 or 2.3 percent, also on the Big Board. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Exxon Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest oil company said its net income rose to  
$1.5 billion, or 61 cents a share, from $1.4 billion, or 58 cents a 
share, in the same quarter a year earlier. That beat the 59 cents 
per share estimate by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased to $33.07 billion from $28.5 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Lee R. Raymond said a roughly $8 a barrel increase in  
crude oil prices was responsible for the revenue increase, 
resulting in higher earnings in its crude exploration and 
production business. 
</P>
<P>
	But lower profits in its refining and marketing businesses,  
weaker chemicals margins and lower coal prices hurt the company's 
overall earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon said, however, it had record chemicals sales and reduced  
operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Exxon said it had net earnings of  
$3.73 billion, or $1.52 a share, compared with $4.84 billion, or 
$1.96 a share. Revenues were $89.38 billion, up from $87.83 billion 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is awaiting final regulatory  
approval of its merger with Mobil. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Mobil Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Mobil said operating income rose to $705 million, or 87 cents a  
share, from $497 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. This 
year's figure was 2 cents below the estimate of analysts surveyed 
by First Call/Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income increased to $688 million, or 85 cents a share, in  
the July-September quarter, from $509 million, or 63 cents a share, 
in the year-earlier quarter. The figure included a special charge 
of $17 million for costs related to the planned merger with Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil said revenues rose to $16.4 billion from $13.6 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Earnings benefited from lower exploration expenses and  
cost-cutting. Per-barrel operating expenses were down 6 percent for 
the year, and the company cited higher-than-expected production 
from the North Sea, Qatar, eastern Canada, Equatorial Guinea, 
Kazakhstan and Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	While crude oil and natural gas production was up, unexpected  
delays at refineries and lower profit margins on domestic sales 
hurt earnings, Mobil said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices have continued to  
improve. However, worldwide refining and marketing margins remain 
depressed,'' said chairman and CEO Lucio Noto. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first nine months was $1.9 billion, compared  
with $1.86 billion a year earlier. Revenues were $42.78 billion, up 
from $40.50 billion.

<HEADLINE> Zagat: Sexism on Menu In New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sexism is being served up at New York eateries,  
according to a survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty percent of the diners surveyed for the 2000 edition of  
the Zagat New York City Restaurant Survey said they think men are 
treated better than women in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The results suggest that men, when dining in mixed company, are  
targeted as primary check payers by restaurant staff, who lavish 
better service their way, says the restaurant guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also signals that when dining among themselves, women are  
still accorded second-class status -- poor seating, slower service, 
or worse,'' the guide says. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 19,227 diners also found they pay about $10 more  
per meal to eat in New York restaurants than their counterparts pay 
across the country. But New Yorkers don't seem to mind -- they're 
leaving bigger tips, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for a meal in a New York restaurant, including  
drink, tax and tip, was $33.17 in 1999, up from $31.68 last year, 
according to the Zagat survey, which was released to the press on 
Sunday. That's the highest price since the 1990 recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The national average for 24 cities surveyed by Zagat was $23.84  
per meal. 
</P>
<P>
	The average tip left by those who participated in Zagat's New  
York survey was 18 percent, up one percentage point from last year. 
Eight other cities and areas surveyed by Zagat's found tips 
averaging slightly less -- 17.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For all that dough, gourmets also got a few new treats. The last  
year of the 1990s brought the first restaurant to offer a free 
lunch if your meal is late, the first eatery to specialize in 
peanut butter and the first with a ``cell phone zone'' for those 
who like to chat while they munch. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual Zagat guide is based on reviews from consumers who  
fill out questionnaires rating food, decor, service and cost, then 
pick out their five favorite eateries.

<HEADLINE> Pro Golfer Stewart Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A Learjet carrying golf champion Payne Stewart and four other  
people flew uncontrolled over the nation's heartland for hours 
today before crashing in South Dakota, killing everyone aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine plane, which took off from Orlando, Fla., may  
have suffered a pressurization failure during its scheduled flight 
to Dallas, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who lived in Orlando, had been expected in Houston on  
Tuesday for practice rounds in advance of the Tour Championship, 
the PGA Tour's final tournament of the year for the top 30 players 
on its money list. Stewart, known for his trademark knickers and 
tam-o'-shanter hat, went to Southern Methodist University in Dallas 
and still had friends in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over  
the death of Payne Stewart,'' PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem 
said in a statement from PGA headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community and  
all of sports. He will always be remembered as a very special 
competitor and one who contributed enormously to the positive image 
of professional golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five people boarded before the plane left Orlando, Fla., at  
about 9:20 a.m. EDT, according to Stewart's family and Federal 
Aviation Administration officials. The identities of the other 
victims wasn't announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The last communication came was the Lear 35 was over  
Gainesville, Fla., said Tony Molinaro, an FAA spokesman in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet had flown as high as 45,000 feet and the crew did not  
respond to repeated inquiries from air traffic controllers, said 
Paul Turk, an FAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force fighter jet from Tyndall, Fla., was diverted from a  
routine training flight to check out the jet, Air Force officials 
said. Two fighters from Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., then took over 
to follow it and they later handed off the monitoring to two Air 
National Guard F-16s from Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	About four hours after takeoff, the plane crashed in a grassy  
field two miles west of Mina, S.D., in the north-central part of 
the state, said Gene Abdallah, superintendent of the South Dakota 
Highway Patrol. There were no survivors, South Dakota Gov. Bill 
Janklow said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane had pretty much nosed straight into the ground,''  
said Lesley Braun, who lives about two miles from the site. 
``There's not a lot of debris spread out a long ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her husband was among those who saw the plane coming  
down. ``They saw it nose down so they hopped in the vehicle and 
raced towards where it was going down and were the first ones on 
the scene,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the ground was hurt, White House spokesman Joe  
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was one of the most recognizable players in golf  
because of his trademark clothing. He won 18 tournaments around the 
world, including three major championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, he won his second U.S. Open, prevailing over Phil  
Mickelson with a 15-foot putt, the longest putt to ever decide that 
championship on the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of the fact that my faith in God is so much stronger  
and I'm so much more at peace with myself than I've ever been in my 
life,'' Stewart said after the win. ``Where I was with my faith 
last year and where I am now is leaps and bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, visitors, including fellow golfer Mark O'Meara, began  
arriving at Stewart's home in an exclusive Orlando community. A 
neighbor, visibly upset, jumped into a car next door. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jim Henry, retired pastor for First Baptist Church of  
Orlando who used to minister to the Stewart family, was one of 
those outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a wonderful Christian who had Christ in his life and  
somehow in his death,'' Henry said. ``That brought a great sense of 
peace to his family in a difficult and tragic time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had two children, Chelsea, 13, and  
Aaron, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, fellow golfer Duffy Waldorf, preparing to practice  
today, told KTRH-AM in Houston that he considered turning around 
and going home when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an irreplaceable guy, not just for his playing record,''  
Waldorf said, citing Stewart's unmistakable presence on the course 
and the consistency of his play. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said two FAA officials had been dispatched to the scene  
of the crash, as had a National Transportation Safety Board 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are normally pressurized,  
because passengers would have difficulty breathing the thin air 
above that altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a pressurization problem, those aboard the aircraft  
could slowly lose consciousness or, if an aircraft broke a door or 
window seal, perish in seconds from hypoxia, or oxygen deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Once reaching a cruise altitude, pilots often switch on the  
autopilot. If they passed out, the plane would cruise until it ran 
out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	John Nance, a commercial airline pilot and aviation author, said  
he can't recall an incident in which a civilian jet depressurized 
in flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we have had some incidents in military aviation that  
make this all too sadly familiar, but not in civil aviation,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine plane was made in 1976. A Lear 35 model can seat  
10 people.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Mims Faces Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers defensive end Chris Mims was  
charged with four misdemeanors Monday in an alleged attack on a man 
outside a fast food restaurant last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Attorney's office charged Mims with assault with a  
deadly weapon, battery, petty theft and urinating in public. His 
arraignment was set for Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. McKinney, 23, told police that Mims attacked him  
early on the morning of Sept. 27, some 10 hours after the Chargers 
lost their home opener to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney said the 300-pound Mims shoved his face into a wall,  
stole his tacos and struck him twice with a belt. McKinney told 
police he was attacked after he made a comment about Mims getting 
out of a limousine and then urinating in the parking lot at a 
downtown Del Taco. 
</P>
<P>
	The most serious of the charges is assault with a deadly weapon,  
which carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and/or fines up 
to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The battery charge carries a maximum fine of six months in jail  
and/or up to a $2,000 fine; the petty theft charge, six months 
and/or a $1,000 fine; and the urinating in public charge, six 
months and/or a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy city attorney Joseph Sanchez said sentences sometimes  
include a combination of fines and public service. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims wasn't in the locker room Monday during the time it was  
open to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Beathard had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know enough about the case,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mims was disciplined by the club two days after the alleged  
attack. When he met with reporters that day, Mims wouldn't discuss 
the specifics of what happened, citing legal concerns, but he did 
apologize for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims was cut on Oct. 9 to make room on the roster for a  
defensive back, but was re-signed a week later.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Changes Housing Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force said Monday it no longer will  
use money earmarked for day-to-day military operations to repair 
and renovate two 1930s-era homes at the Air Force Academy in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was prompted by an Air Force Audit Agency report  
that questioned the need for -- and method of payment for -- some 
renovation work last year on the 10,846-square-foot Carlton House, 
home of the academy superintendent, as well as future work planned 
for Carlton and the 11,553-square-foot Otis House, which serves as 
the residence of the academy's commandant of cadets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Renovations and modifications to the Carlton House did not  
always appear warranted,'' the audit said, citing as an example 
work done last year on its restaurant-style kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit also questioned the propriety of using Air Force  
operations and maintenance funds to pay for the work instead of 
money earmarked for housing repairs. If housing repair funds had 
been used, the work would have been subject to review by Congress. 
Several members of Congress said it appeared the Air Force had 
intended to avoid congressional scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors faulted the Air Force for not monitoring such  
spending closely enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force previously had defended the renovations as  
necessary to maintain historic homes that are also used heavily for 
public functions. The audit was requested by Air Force Secretary F. 
Whitten Peters.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Chain Gang Revival Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama's revival of the chain gang has  
ended after four years because the state can't spare enough guards 
for the work. 
</P>
<P>
	State prison officials quietly ended the practice of sending out  
shackled road crews under guard earlier this month, saying 
corrections officers could be put to better use behind prison 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Department of Corrections spokesman Tom Gilkeson said Monday the  
financially strapped department needs 300 additional officers 
inside its lockups and cannot spare employees to accompany 
medium-security inmates on roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have enough people for it,'' Gilkeson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The revival of chain gangs in 1995 by Republican Gov. Fob. James  
prompted Florida, Arizona, Wisconsin and Iowa -- as well as sheriffs 
in several jurisdictions -- to adopt leg-ironed work crews. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the Limestone Correctional Facility in north  
Alabama was sending out 320 medium-security inmates on 10-hour days 
to pick up litter and cut underbrush along highways. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, Alabama crews were chained in groups of five and  
connected by 8-foot leg irons. After a lawsuit challenged the 
practice, prisoners were shackled individually. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Haley, the corrections commissioner for Gov. Don  
Siegelman, a Democrat, ordered the end of the gangs, warden Ralph 
Hooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just feel the manpower can be better utilized keeping the  
medium custody squads on state property,'' Hooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooks said minimum security inmates who are not chained continue  
to be assigned to work details outside the prison, as well as in 
its agricultural and cattle operations.

<HEADLINE> Dennery Named Head of Star-Ledger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Linda Dennery, president of The  
Times-Picayune of New Orleans, has been named publisher of The 
Star-Ledger. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennery, 52, fills the position left vacant earlier this month  
with the death of longtime publisher Martin Bartner. Bartner died 
Oct. 10 at age 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennery was introduced to the newspaper's editorial staff Monday  
by Donald Newhouse, president of The Star-Ledger and chairman of 
The Associated Press board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a fantastic opportunity with Linda,'' he said. ``I've  
known her for many years. She is a great communicator, she is a 
great motivator. She's hands-on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennery said she was ``thrilled, excited, humbled and somewhat  
awed to be here. I'm delighted to be working with one of America's 
great newspapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger is New Jersey's largest newspaper with a daily  
circulation of 407,129 and a Sunday circulation of 607,006, 
according to Audit Bureau of Circulation figures for the six months 
ending Sept. 30. It is among the country's 15 biggest newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star-Ledger and The Times-Picayune are part of the Advance  
Publications group, owned by the Newhouse family. 
</P>
<P>
	Newhouse said The Star-Ledger's management structure would  
remain the same, with the publisher heading business operations 
while editor Jim Willse oversees editorial decisions and policies. 
Dennery and Willse will work together on common marketing plans and 
strategies, Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennery, who was born in Philadelphia, moved to New Orleans in  
1970 and started at The Times-Picayune as a tour guide. She worked 
her way up, becoming vice president and personnel manager in 1973. 
She left the paper to work in hospital administration in Kentucky 
but returned in 1987 and served as the newspaper's vice president 
and general manager until being named its president two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Dock Strike Averted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii dockworkers reached a tentative agreement  
on a new contract early Monday, averting a strike that could have 
crippled the islands' economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a walkout on the docks had triggered panic buying  
of rice, toilet paper, Spam and other items in Hawaii, where 90 
percent of everything arrives by ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement between the 507-member dockworkers union and four  
shipping companies came after 34 hours of negotiations over two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 142 President  
Eusebio Lapenia and Tim Ho, president of the Hawaii Employers 
Council, announced the agreement but refused to discuss details of 
the accord. It needs the approval of the union's members. No vote 
has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had been seeking a contract similar to the three-year,  
8 percent wage increase West Coast dockworkers received this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports said that under the contract that expired June  
30, Hawaii dockworkers received $55,000 to $150,000 a year, 
depending on their job, hours and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ben Cayetano, who offered to mediate if a settlement could  
not be reached, had warned that a dock strike could cripple 
Hawaii's economy, which is finally recovering after a nine-year 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, dockworkers staged a slowdown that created a  
backlog of unloaded cargo ships in Honolulu Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii's docks were shut down for five months in 1949 and 100  
days in 1971 because of strikes on the West Coast.

<HEADLINE> Poverty in Vogue on Campaign Trail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The traditionally dicey politics of poverty  
are suddenly back in vogue, with welfare reform making it safe for 
presidential candidates to talk about the poor without having to 
rail against or defend a broken system. 
</P>
<P>
	But the debate has changed. Now, even the most liberal of the  
pack is talking about programs that revolve around working, albeit 
poor, families. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Democrats Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore  
offered plans, and GOP front-runner Gov. George W. Bush made 
headlines by chastising congressional Republicans for trying to 
``balance their budget on the backs of the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that poverty is in,'' said Douglas Besharov, who  
studies welfare policy at the conservative American Enterprise 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of it is simple politics. Bradley and Gore are locked in a  
Democratic primary, where liberals hold significant sway, and 
fighting poverty is certainly popular with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Texas governor, is campaigning as a ``compassionate  
conservative'' trying to break from the harsh reputation that 
bedevils fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts suspect something deeper is afoot.  
</P>
<P>
	``I ask myself the question, is this purely political  
positioning?'' said Robert Greenstein, director of the liberal 
Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. ``I think there's 
something more fundamental going on. There seems to be a change in 
the public mood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of it can be traced to the 1996 welfare overhaul, which  
allowed states to design their own programs, required recipients to 
work and limited cash assistance to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The strict new rules, combined with a thriving economy, have  
helped drive welfare rolls to a 30-year low. And new perceptions 
are forming where welfare recipients are seen more as people 
struggling to make it than as lazy loafers milking the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading business leaders trumpet their programs to hire people  
off the rolls as they urge fellow employers to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	So while many liberals still don't really like the new rules,  
reform has created a useful new dynamic, where sticking up for poor 
people is no longer something to be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Bradley, the most liberal presidential candidate in eight  
years, does not urge rolling back welfare reform or its tough new 
rules. He doesn't advocate more training for recipients or allowing 
more people into education programs. And while he voted against the 
welfare bill when he was in the Senate, the plan he introduced last 
week would build on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of his major proposals -- increasing the minimum wage,  
putting more money into child care and boosting the earned income 
tax credit -- are aimed at the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gore is taking another post-welfare reform angle,  
focusing on the role of fathers now that the new system forces most 
mothers into the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poverty in the United States is now driven in significant  
measure by the breakup of families,'' Gore told The Associated 
Press in interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Bush has suggested new tax incentives to encourage  
Americans to contribute money to groups that fight poverty. And he 
wants religious organizations to qualify for more government 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional proposals are to come, said Stephen Goldsmith, the  
Indianapolis mayor and Bush campaign adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it (the issue) will get lost,'' he said, calling  
a Republican commitment to fighting poverty ``an extraordinary new 
dynamic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strong economy also plays a role.  
</P>
<P>
	With most voters' personal finances in decent shape, they are  
interested in helping those less fortunate, said Andrew Kohut, 
director of the Pew Center for People and the Press. His polling 
finds that a significant share of people -- 41 percent -- think it 
very important for candidates to talk about the gap between the 
rich and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Aber, director of the National Center for Children in  
Poverty at Columbia University, suggests this may be the beginning 
of a new national debate about poverty. He points to 30-year 
cycles: The settlement houses at the turn of the century, Social 
Security in 1935, the war on poverty in 1965, and now, post-welfare 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're entering a time,'' he said, ``when we will redebate  
these issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And some hope he's right.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm watching for the first time in years presidential  
candidates compete as to who can produce more to reduce child 
poverty,'' Greenstein said. ``I'm definitely feeling encouraged by 
the direction the debate is going.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Asarco Inc., the nation's third-largest copper  
producer, signed a contract Monday to be acquired by Grupo Mexico 
S.A. de C.V. for $1.24 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which was announced Oct. 15, officially severs  
Asarco's agreement to be purchased by Phelps Dodge Corp. Asarco 
will pay a $30 million breakup fee to Phelps Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of New York-based Asarco will receive $29.75 for  
each share they own. Grupo Mexico raised their offer earlier this 
month to top a rival bid from Phelps Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge, the world's largest copper producer,  
said it was unwilling to overpay for Asarco and will let its tender 
offer for Asarco shares expire at midnight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe our shareholders will understand and appreciate the  
financial discipline behind our decision,'' Douglas C. Yearley, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Phelps Dodge, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Asarco's 1 billion pounds of annual copper  
production, Grupo Mexico will become the world's third-largest 
copper company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Asarco were up 6 1/4 cents at $29.62 1/2 in afternoon  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of Phelps 
Dodge were up 68 3/4 cents at $58.75.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins's Marino Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dan Marino's arm strength is improving, but  
his availability this week is uncertain pending a visit with a 
specialist in Los Angeles, Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino will seek a second opinion Tuesday regarding the bone  
spur in his lower neck from Dr. Robert Watkins. The spur has 
hindered Marino's ability to throw for more than a week, and he 
missed Sunday's win over the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be very thorough about this, like we would with any  
player of his caliber,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins has operated on the backs of quarterbacks Troy Aikman,  
Joe Montana and Steve McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Marino could be listed as questionable again this  
week, meaning there's a 50-percent chance he'll play Sunday against 
the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's getting better and getting stronger,'' Johnson  
said. ``We won't really know until later in the week, but I think 
he's getting better.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins Buzz About Snyder Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- In the Dan Snyder era of the Washington  
Redskins, one loss was forgivable. Two? Unpardonable, especially 
when both were to the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Redskin Park was still buzzing over new owner  
Snyder's private 40-minute one-on-one with coach Norv Turner in the 
trainer's room immediately after Sunday's 38-20 loss at Texas 
Stadium. After the dressing down, which kept the locker room shut 
well past the usual post-game cooling-off period, Turner's face was 
ashen. Snyder's was red. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been around an owner that did something like  
that,'' 11-year veteran tackle Andy Heck said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the season-opening loss to Dallas, Snyder said it was just  
``one game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, having yelled himself hoarse, the first-year owner  
who asserts that jobs are on the line, said: ``I'm going to get my 
voice fixed, and then I'm going to use it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was fired or cut Monday, but that's probably because it's  
hard to replace people this time of year. Otherwise, a top 
candidate might be defensive coordinator Mike Nolan, whose defense 
is ranked 30th of 31 teams and allowed Dallas to convert 9-of-15 
third down conversions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan admitted his players weren't ``mentally sharp'' on third  
downs. The front four didn't generate a pass rush, and the 
secondary had its worst game of the season -- even 39-year-old 
Darrell Green looked his age for a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that I've been part of the discussion'' between  
Snyder and Turner, Nolan said. ``But I can't control that. At some 
point they'll take it away from me anyway. That's not my concern. 
My concern is that we play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, the Redskins (4-2) may have fallen victim to the type  
of arrogance that often accompanies a four-game winning streak. 
Players were talking trash last week, and even Snyder got caught up 
in it when he talked about a team that was going to ``dominate the 
playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were getting a little cocky,'' receiver Irving Fryar said,  
``and you don't want to do that. You want to stay focused. You want 
to make sure that you realize that you are the rabbit and not the 
fox. That's why the fox never caught the rabbit. The fox was 
running for his meal; the rabbit was running for his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Nolan, others under the gun include Darryl Pounds, who  
had another tough game as the nickel defensive back. Pounds 
committed the pass interference penalty against Alvin Harper on 
third-and-20 that kept alive a key Dallas drive in the fourth 
quarter. But since quality cornerbacks aren't readily available, 
Pounds will stay on the team and lose playing time to second-year 
player Tim Denton. 
</P>
<P>
	Special teams coach LeCharls McDaniel's units continue to  
struggle, allowing a 70-yard punt return by Deion Sanders. And 
Turner, who keeps his job only if the Redskins make the playoffs, 
is finding that his offense isn't the juggernaut it appeared to be 
in the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said he spoke to Snyder twice by phone Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's very concerned,'' Turner said. ``As I am. As our coaching  
staff is. As our players are. And rightfully so. We have our 
heights high in terms of being a good football team, and it's hard 
when you don't go out and perform at the level you'd like to. And 
now we have to go do something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner did exonerate one player, three-time Pro Bowl punter Matt  
Turk, who missed the game with a broken finger. According to 
unidentified sources cited in The Washington Post, Redskins 
officials believe Turk may have broken his finger playing 
basketball rather than in the Arizona game as he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been given no information to indicate that Matt broke  
his finger any other way than in a game,'' Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turk, in his first comments on the matter, was visibly upset. He  
said he did play basketball the day after the Cardinals loss, but 
that's not where he got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did everything by the book,'' said Turk, wearing a splint on  
his left middle finger. ``I came in Monday morning for treatment on 
a finger that I hurt Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turk's absence was costly. The Redskins signed 39-year-old Brian  
Hansen, who had considered himself retired and hadn't punted a ball 
since June. Hansen did the most dangerous thing a punter can do: He 
kicked line drives right at Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Redskins will keep Hansen around in case Turk,  
who will have his stitches removed Thursday, can't play next week 
against Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Millions Vanish from W.Va. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEYSTONE, W.Va. (AP) -- No one stopped to watch as workers  
dismantled the only bank in this southern West Virginia coal town, 
one box at a time. There is no more shock at the collapse of an 
institution that once boasted the motto ``Time Tried, Panic 
Tested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hour after hour last week, movers loaded 7,000 boxes of  
documents onto trucks headed for Dallas. Federal regulators there 
hope to discover how $515 million vanished from a prosperous bank 
in an Appalachian county where 37 percent of the residents live in 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Sept. 1, when the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of  
the Currency closed the First National Bank of Keystone amid 
allegations of ``apparent fraud,'' rumors of trouble swirled 
through this town of 627, prompting a run on the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that money didn't disappear overnight,'' said Ann Jervis,  
part owner of D&AMP;A Flea Market in nearby Northfork. ``It was worked 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 95-year-old community bank which anchored Main Street and  
advertised assets of $1.1 billion still has its supporters along 
the winding two-lane highway that connects small towns in a rugged 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought they were just as solid as anything and still don't  
know that it's not,'' said Becky Barker, an employee at the Kimball 
Light and Water Co. in nearby Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators may disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	At the top of a mountain reached by a dirt road rutted by coal  
trucks, investigators have recovered 370 boxes of bank records that 
had been buried in a 100-foot-long trench on property belonging to 
Terry Church, the bank's senior executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal magistrate ruled last week there is sufficient  
evidence that Church, 46, and Michael Graham, 49, who performed 
accounting work at the bank, interfered with a federal 
investigation by burying three truckloads of bank records. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have 30 days to seek indictments against the pair.  
Church and Graham have refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal comptroller's office said it closed the bank after a  
three-month investigation found that $515 million in loans -- nearly 
half the bank's assets -- were sold yet remained on the bank's books 
as assets. 
</P>
<P>
	First National's failure could ultimately cost the Federal  
Deposit Insurance Corp. even more as the agency tries to cover 
another $200 million in missing assets and administrative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery may place First National among the 10 costliest  
bank failures in the nation since the mid-1980s, said David Barr, a 
spokesman for the FDIC in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A civil suit filed in McDowell County Circuit Court last  
Thursday contends that hundreds of local depositors lost as much as 
$15 million. Bank customers who deposited more than the amount 
protected by the FDIC -- $100,000 for each account -- want bank 
officers to reimburse them for their uninsured losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal probe will likely focus on the bank's practice of  
paying high interest rates to attract capital from across the 
United States and selling mortgage loans to pools of investors who 
put up additional money. The practice is not uncommon, but federal 
regulators are examining the bank's aggressive marketing of 
federally backed mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Knox McConnell, a Pittsburgh banker who took over First  
National in 1977, used the Internet to advertise beyond southwest 
McDowell County to draw deposits through high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell's strategy worked, boosting assets from $17 million to  
more than $1 billion in 20 years. An industry publication, American 
Banker, once referred to his bank as the most profitable community 
bank in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell died of a heart attack in 1997 at age 69.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Ameribank Inc., which assumed Keystone's operations  
and $135 million in locally held deposits after the closing, said 
they will be more traditional in their banking style. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell's banking methods were a ``very sophisticated kind of  
financing that requires Wall Street,'' said Ameribank chairman Jim 
Sutton. ``We're country bankers. We don't have that kind of 
sophistication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First National's failure has created a $465,000 hole in  
Keystone's municipal budget, forcing officials to lay off six of 15 
employees. The bank's loss also has taken $200,000 out of McDowell 
County's annual $2.9 million budget, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Young, a manager of a medical equipment business in  
Northfork, said she fears ripple effects if Keystone bank's failure 
takes down its top two officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the town is going to be a ghost town,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Keystone Mayor Billie Cherry, a longtime friend of McConnell and  
chairwoman of First National's board of directors, said she will 
continue to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not finished,'' Cherry said. ``I don't know what I can  
do. I can't give up, though.''

                            *John Chafee    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Chafee was mourned Monday in his home  
state of Rhode Island and in the Senate where he served for nearly 
a quarter-century, recalled as an unwavering voice for moderation 
and environmental protection in a Republican Party that moved ever 
rightward during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He embodied the decent center which has carried America from  
triumph to triumph for over 200 years,'' said President Clinton, 
who added that Chafee ``always put his concern for the American 
people above partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A descendant of one of the families that helped settle Rhode  
Island, the 77-year-old Chafee fought in two wars and was a 
three-term governor before winning his Senate seat in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt ill on Sunday and was taken at mid-afternoon to Bethesda  
Naval Hospital in suburban Maryland. His office said he died a few 
hours later from heart failure, although public announcement was 
withheld until Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In life, Chafee was a leader among the Senate's dwindling band  
of GOP moderates, seeking to bridge the gaps between lawmakers in 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	He regularly drew praise from environmental groups, and  
supported abortion rights, gun control legislation and measures to 
use the power of government to expand health care coverage. Last 
winter, he voted to acquit Clinton on both articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was the first senator to die in office since Quentin  
Burdick, D-N.D., in 1992.

	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Robert Fraley, a former Alabama  
quarterback who went on to become a sports agent whose clients 
included golfer Payne Stewart, was killed Monday with Stewart when 
their jet crashed in South Dakota. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley was on the Learjet 35 with Stewart, en route to Texas,  
where Stewart was scheduled to play in the PGA Tour Championship 
this weekend in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley was nicknamed the ``Winchester rifle'' during his career  
as a quarterback at Franklin County High School. He was highly 
recruited by Alabama and enrolled there in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	After earning his law degree from Alabama in 1975, Fraley moved  
to Orlando to start a practice, eventually becoming chief executive 
officer of Leader Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Stewart, Fraley represented coaches and athletes such  
as the New York Jets' Bill Parcells, the Atlanta Falcons' Dan 
Reeves and Seattle Seahawks defensive lineman Cortez Kennedy.

	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Larry Graebner, who began a 29-year career  
at the Columbia Daily Tribune as a photographer and ended up as 
executive editor, died Thursday of lung cancer. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Graebner started his photography career during World War II by  
shooting pictures from the bay of a bomber as an aerial 
photographer with the Eighth Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	He enrolled in the University of Missouri School of Journalism  
after the war and then joined the Tribune. He worked as city 
editor, managing editor and executive editor at the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Graebner is survived by his wife, of Rocheport, two daughters  
and two sisters.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maria Ley Piscator, a theater arts teacher and  
director who co-founded a drama workshop attended by Marlon Brando 
and Harry Belafonte, died Oct. 14 at age 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Piscator, who was born in Vienna, began her theatrical  
career as a dancer in Berlin and Paris. She later turned to 
choreography. She helped stage several productions with Max 
Reinhardt, including ``A Midsummer Night's Eve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She met theatrical director Erwin Piscator, who became her third  
husband, in 1936 while studying literature at the Sorbonne. They 
moved to the United States and founded the Dramatic Workshop at the 
New School for Social Research in Manhattan. Their students 
included Belafonte, Brando and Tony Randall.

director of the ``Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson for more than 
two decades, died Thursday of cancer. He was 72.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Frank J. Rice, a veteran executive of  
Bullock's department stores and founder of a facility for mentally 
ill men, has died at 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice died Wednesday at Mt. San Antonio Gardens Retirement  
Community in Claremont, said his daughter, Jane Zeiger. He had 
suffered from Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice joined Bullock's department stores in 1942 as an  
advertising copywriter and worked his way up to vice president for 
sales promotion. But it was his move to a new position of vice 
president for community affairs that led to his work for the 
homeless mentally ill.

maverick Republican and sharp critic of affirmative action who once 
sought the Assembly speakership in a fruitless, emotional battle, 
died Monday. He was 68.

                           *Payne Stewart    	
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- His knickers and tam o'shanter cap made  
Payne Stewart one of the most recognizable players in golf. His 
game and his passion made him one of the most respected. 
</P>
<P>
	He won 18 times around the world, but made his name at home with  
three major championships -- the last on an unforgettable day in 
June when he thrust his fist into the air to celebrate his second 
U.S. Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was among at least five people killed Monday when a  
Learjet he was aboard flew uncontrolled for hours and crashed in 
South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an enormous void and emptiness I feel right now,''  
Tiger Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer called Stewart's death ``one of the most terrible  
tragedies of modern-day golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart lived in Orlando, Fla., and was on his way to Texas in  
advance of the Tour Championship, a tournament for the top 30 
players on the Professional Golfers' Association money list. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart often played practice rounds in regular pants and a hat,  
and not many people recognized him. Once the tournament started, 
however, his presence was unmistakable in traditional golfing garb 
that no one else considered wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The knickers were not misleading. Stewart really was a  
traditionalist. His father taught him to dance by having him stand 
on his shoes while he waltzed around the room, and instructed the 
son to be sure to dance with every woman at the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jan. 30, 1957 in Springfield, Mo., Stewart went to Southern  
Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won more than $11.7 million in a PGA Tour career that  
began in 1980. He was ranked No. 8 in the world and was third on 
this year's money list with just over $2 million.

last five years of his life fighting to have the Ten Commandments 
removed from the wall of a Haywood County courtroom, died Sunday at 
the age of 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Suhre, who filed a lawsuit in 1994 challenging the marble  
tablets that have been in place since the courthouse opened in 
1931, died over the weekend at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Suhre and his lawyer claimed the judge  
overseeing the case was intentionally delaying a ruling and waiting 
for Suhre to pass away. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge eventually ruled against Suhre, but the American Civil  
Liberties Union has vowed to continue Suhre's fight.

	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Bosnian writer and journalist Mladen  
Vuksanovic, who chronicled the rise of Bosnian Serb 
ultranationalism and the beginning of Serb expulsions of Muslims 
and Croats, died of heart failure in exile in Croatia, his 
publisher said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vuksanovic, 57, who had an Orthodox father and a Roman Catholic  
mother, was driven out of his native village of Pale in central 
Bosnia in 1992, when ultranationalist leader Radovan Karadzic came 
to power. 
</P>
<P>
	Karadzic has been indicted twice by the international war crimes  
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, and his Orthodox Serb followers 
were accused of the worst ethnic purges and killings of non-Serbs 
during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia. Karadzic remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Vuksanovic wrote a diary during the first 100 days of Karadzic's  
rule in Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold, and managed to smuggle 
the notes with him when he fled on a U.N. refugee bus to 
neighboring Croatia.

California. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Widoe played the children's character Colonel Caboose twice a  
day on WBAY-TV for 10 years, beginning in the mid-1950s. As Colonel 
Caboose, he dressed in bib overalls, a train engineer's cap and a 
bandana. 
</P>
<P>
	He also bought time and rented space at a commercial stations to  
air programs for use in the classroom. In the late 1960s, Widoe was 
instrumental in the creation of WPNE- TV, Channel 38, now part of 
Wisconsin Public Television.

<P>
	BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- Payne Stewart's brother-in-law said  
Tuesday that the golfer's wife, Australia native Tracey Ferguson, 
followed TV reports as her husband's plane flew out of control 
across the heartland of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Ferguson, a professional golfer and Tracey's brother, said  
he had received the news from another sister in Brisbane who had 
been talking by telephone to Tracey at her home in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was saying that basically, that Payne was in this plane  
that was traveling out of control through the airspace in America 
and she was watching it on TV, which is pretty bad,'' Ferguson told 
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was trying to ring him on his mobile and couldn't raise  
him. It's just really bad for my sister to be watching it on CNN, 
knowing that it was her husband on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was believed that the five people aboard the plane, including  
Stewart, had lost consciousness after a decompression in the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson described Stewart as a ``great guy'' and ``one of the  
best players in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracey Ferguson had met her husband while traveling in Asia and  
married him 15 years ago. They have two children, Chelsea, 14, and 
Aaron, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	It's barely a year since Tracey Ferguson had to cope with the  
death of close friend Renay Appleby, late wife of Australian 
touring pro Stuart Appleby who was killed in a accident in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was devastated because Renay and her were really close,''  
Australian golfer Robert Allenby told Australian Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both being Australian, they got on really well. She found it  
so difficult to come to terms with that and now a year later her 
husband dies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So close-knit is the Australian sports community in Orlando  
that, according to Allenby, Natasha Woodbridge, on hearing the 
news, flew back immediately from Germany, where her husband Todd 
Woodbridge is playing a tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said he had been unable to make contact with his sister  
but the family was making arrangements to attend Stewart's funeral.

<HEADLINE> Temple's Blackshear Ineligible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Temple guard Ronald Blackshear has been  
declared ineligible to participate in the 1999-00 season, school 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach John Chaney said Blackshear was initially cleared to play  
by the NCAA but based on a new test score is now considered a 
non-qualifier. Chaney said Blackshear agreed to retake the SAT 
after his first score was challenged, and was declared ineligible 
as a result of the retest. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackshear, 6-foot-4, 190 pounds, entered Temple in September.  
At Mitchell-Baker High School in Camila, Ga., he averaged 19 points 
as a sophomore and senior and 21 points as a junior, leading the 
team to the Georgia State Championship as a senior.

<HEADLINE> Tulsa Football Coach Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- The University of Tulsa fired longtime  
football coach Dave Rader on Monday, citing too many losses and too 
few improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Judy MacLeod gave Rader the news by telephone  
Monday morning. She then named defensive coordinator Pat Henderson 
as Rader's interim replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an extremely difficult decision as well as an  
extremely difficult season,'' MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to fire Rader, who was 49-80-1 in 12 seasons as  
head coach, came after the Golden Hurricane's 35-21 loss to Hawaii 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tulsa 1-6 (0-4 in the Western Athletic Conference), the  
defeat ensured another losing season and gave added impetus to an 
immediate search for a new head coach, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just felt like we wanted to begin the turnaround now,''  
MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Rader by telephone at  
his home were not immediately successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Players seemed stunned by the news, which many of them received  
while in morning classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a team, we believe in coach Rader,'' said freshman  
quarterback Josh Blankenship, who made his first collegiate start 
Saturday. ``I'm completely numb right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing coahes paid tribute.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a better man to do a better job in Tulsa, in  
America, I don't know who he is,'' said Rice coach Ken Hatfield, 
whose team beat the Golden Hurricane 20-10 earlier this month. 
``Nobody's given more love, blood, sweat and tears to that program 
than Dave Rader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State coach Bob Simmons said his profession often talks  
about graduation rates of athletes, but the bottom line comes down 
to wins and the ability to draw support. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't do those things, `We like you, but see you  
later.''' he said. ``Dave's a good person. Dave's a good coach. 
Dave's going to be fine. He's going to be all right. But is it a 
part of this profession? It is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Rader received a four-year contract extension.  
MacLeod said at the time that his coaching skills, integrity and 
treatment of athletes made him the ``best fit'' for the job. On 
Monday, she called him a ``first class'' representative, but said 
the dismissal came down to ``losing games and not seeing the 
improvement we needed to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came after weekend discussions involving MacLeod,  
University President Bob Lawless and the school's board of 
trustees. MacLeod declined to say if Rader was given a chance to 
resign, but said he had no interest in another position with the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa, with its enrollment of 4,246, demanding academic programs  
and a nearly 70-year-old football stadium, has long struggled 
against better-funded opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield predicted Tulsa will have to pay the next coach twice  
what it paid Rader, who grew up watching the Golden Hurricane and 
was the team's starring quarterback in 1977 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeod said Henderson, who spent two seasons as linebackers  
coach for the Hurricane in the mid-80s and returned to the coaching 
staff in 1997, will be a candidate for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior defensive back Spencer Braggs said the change might ``put  
a little spark'' in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very unfortunate, '' Braggs said. ``Coach Rader is the  
greatest guy you'll ever meet, but this is a business and wins 
account for more than losses.''

	Stocks End Mostly Down; Dow Off 120.32  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower today as reviving  
fears of rising interest rates distracted investors from the latest 
stream of good news about corporate profits. At the close of 
trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 
120.32 at 10,349.93, having edged back from a loss of as much as 
155 points. Broader stock indicators finished with much more modest 
losses. The Nasdaq composite index was down 0.58 at 2,815.94. 
Stocks fell after the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose as 
high as 6.40 percent from 6.34 percent late yesterday. Analysts 
said bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from yields, 
were hurt by a European Central Bank official's suggestion that the 
European economy is solid, but in danger of succumbing to rising 
inflation.

	Existing Home Sales Fall Again  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. consumers bought fewer existing homes in  
September, deterred by higher mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd. 
It was the third straight monthly decline, although such home sales 
are still heading toward a banner year. Sales of existing 
single-family homes fell by 2.1 percent last month to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 5.13 million units, the National 
Association of Realtors said today. Yet association officials said 
they expect existing homes sales this year to set a record of 5.20 
million units, up 4.8 percent over the 1998 record of 4.97 million 
units. That's because low unemployment, tame inflation and stock 
and bond market gains continue to make Americans feel wealthy and 
comfortable about making purchases, economists said. 

</P>
<P>
	European Stocks Close Lower  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed lower today with energy,  
telecommunications and utility shares leading the fall. BP Amoco, 
the biggest counter in the Dow Jones Stoxx Index, fell 18 pence, or 
3 percent, to 574.5 pence, after third-quarter profits at the 
U.S.-based Texaco were below expectations despite higher crude and 
natural gas prices. In the telecommunications sector, Vodafone Air 
Touch fell 5.25 pence to 263.5 pence. Among utilities shares, RWE 
fell 1.18 euros to 37.51 euros. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 
European companies fell 1.54 points to close at 305.21. The Dow 
Jones Euro Stoxx Index closed down 1.63 points at 321.69. London's 
FTSE 100 index fell 0.8 percent to 6009.4. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX 
index fell 0.7 percent to 5,320.40. Milan's MIBtel index fell 1.3 
percent to 32,060.

	Lower AT&AMP;T Profits Beat Expectations  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merger-related spending for AT&AMP;T Corp.'s  
aggressive foray into cable television weighed down the company's 
third-quarter profits, but the results edged past most Wall Street 
forecasts. AT&AMP;T's operating profit totaled $1.75 billion, or 54 
cents a share, including the impact of the cable company 
Tele-Communications Inc. and parts of IBM's Internet services 
business, both acquired earlier this year. That's a drop of 4.5 
percent from AT&AMP;T's operating profit of $1.84 billion, or 68 cents 
a share, in the same period last year, but slightly better than 
most projections. 

</P>
<P>
	Big Oil Company Earnings Are Up  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big oil companies said today their third-quarter  
earnings rose from a year earlier because of higher crude oil 
prices, but profit growth was held back by competitive pricing in 
refined products. Earnings at Exxon, Chevron and Arco beat 
analysts' estimates, while those at Mobil and Texaco fell short. 
All their stocks were down: Texaco, down 1 at 61 7/8; Chevron down 3 3/4 
at 90; Atlantic Richfield down 3 1/8 at 90 7/8; Exxon down 2 7/8 at 74; and 
Mobil down 4 15/16 at 97 1/16.

	Dell Passes Compaq in U.S. PC sales  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. easily surpassed  
rival Compaq Computer Corp. in U.S. personal computer sales last 
quarter -- the first time Dell has held such a commanding lead over 
its Texas rival, two research firms said today. The upcoming 
holiday season is likely to test Dell's staying power, however, as 
consumers cast their votes on whether they prefer to buy PCs over 
the Internet or from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, analysts 
said. Dell sold nearly 2 million PCs from July through September, 
grabbing a 17.1 percent share of the U.S. market, up from a 13.4 
percent in the same quarter a year ago, according to research firm 
Dataquest, a unit of Gartner Group. Compaq sold 1.78 million 
computers, giving it a 15.3 percent share of the market. Compaq's 
share a year ago was 15 percent. Dell shares were at 39 3/16, down 
11/16. Compaq was at 18 5/8, down 1/16.

	UPS Shareholders OK Going Public  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Stockholders of United Parcel Service today  
approved the company's plan for an initial public stock offering of 
109.4 million shares. The stock offering, first announced by the 
UPS board in July, represents about 10 percent of existing shares. 
Ninety percent of the votes favored the offering, the company said. 
The Atlanta-based shipping company has told the Securities and 
Exchange Commission that it expects to sell the shares for between 
$36 and $42 per share after a 2-for-1 split planned immediately 
before the initial public offering.

	American Express Profits Up 13 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express Co. said today its profits rose  
13 percent in the third quarter as travel and financial services 
posted strong results. American Express earned $648 million, or 
$1.42 a share, matching analysts' average estimate. The company 
earned $574 million, or $1.25 a share, in the third quarter last 
year. Net revenues totaled $4.9 billion vs. $4.3 billion. The New 
York-based company said its travel services division reported $413 
million in net income, up 14 percent from the year-ago period. 
Profits from the financial advisory business also were up 14 
percent to $240 million.

	Hershey Earnings Down in 3Q  
</P>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Hershey Foods Corp. said today that net  
earnings dropped $20 million, or 12 cents a share, in the third 
quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily because 
computer troubles slowed the company's deliveries. Net income for 
the quarter ended Oct. 4 was $87.6 million, or 62 cents per share 
diluted, the company said. The company reported $107.5 million, or 
74 cents per share, during the same period last year. The company 
had warned that third quarter earnings would be lower, and the 
actual earnings surpassed analysts' lowered expectations.

	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler's beleaguered Smart  
mini-car moved into the No. 1 spot for sales in its category in 
Germany last month, the company said today. It's the first time ime 
the two-seater has done so since its introduction last year. A 
report compiled monthly by a federal agency of new car 
registrations showed the Smart car knocked Renault's Twingo 
subcompact from the top spot in September. It had already surpassed 
Volkswagen's Lupo in August.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Monday, with the key indexes rising both in Tokyo and Hong Kong on 
the back of last week's rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
209.99 points, or 1.20 percent, to close at 17,648.79 points. On 
Friday, the average closed down 9.47 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong demand from the increasingly popular investment trusts  
boosted the Nikkei, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investment trusts are increasing their stock weightings amid  
expectations for growth, and individuals are giving shares another 
look,'' said Hidenori Karaki, general manager of the stock division 
at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were also helped by last week's rise on Wall Street. On  
Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 172.56 points, or 1.7 
percent, to 10,470.25 as U.S. lawmakers agreed on legislation that 
would remove barriers separating banks, insurers and securities 
brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted 105.96 yen, up  
0.52 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but slightly below its New York 
level of 105.97 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the benchmark blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose  
171.01 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at 13,034.18. On Friday, the 
index had gained 340.08 points, or 2.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said prices rose in response to the rise Friday in New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market also was buoyed by the announcement on  
Sunday that the government will sell only about 10 billion Hong 
Kong dollars (U.S. $1.2 billion) of shares in an initial public 
offering of the stocks it acquired in a controversial market 
intervention last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's shareholding is valued at about 200 billion  
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $25.6 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	The government's decision to offer only a moderate supply of  
shares eased worries of a massive fund-raising activity. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares closed sharply lower because of jitters over  
possible complications in resolving Daewoo Group's financial woes, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Daewoo's debt workout plans become known, there are concerns  
that domestic creditors may be faced with bigger losses than had 
earlier been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 20.68 points, or 2.5  
percent, to 798.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares also closed lower on concerns over the  
formation of the new Cabinet following the election of Abdurrahman 
Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri as president and vice-president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta market's Composite Index fell 7.116 points, or 1.2  
percent, to 597.068. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in New Zealand and Thailand for  
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares closed higher as investors bought up  
financial stocks amid renewed hopes of mergers in the industry. The 
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 121.24 points, or 1.60 
percent, to 7,680.87. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, pushed down by a  
broad-based selloff led by foreign funds. The Philippine Stock 
Exchange index of 30 selected companies fell 26.22 points, or 1.3 
percent, to 1,920.46. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, led by buying in  
the leading financial, media and telecommunication sectors. The All 
Ordinaries Index closed at 855.4, up 18.1 points, or 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed generally mixed. The benchmark  
Straits Times Index rose 4.98 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,022.36. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed mixed after profit-taking  
wiped out most of the market's earlier gains, dealers said. The 
main Composite Index edged up 1.41 points to close at 740.41.

<HEADLINE> Buffett Group Acquires Iowa Utility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The acquisition of MidAmerican Energy  
Holdings Co. by an investors' group led by billionaire Warren 
Buffett will provide the cash and stability needed for long-term 
growth, MidAmerican executives said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire Hathaway Inc. of Omaha, Neb., agreed to acquire  
MidAmerican Energy for $2.1 billion. Berkshire will also assume 
about $7 billion in debt in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be able to take a long-term view of where we're going  
and how we're going to get there,'' MidAmerican chairman and chief 
executive officer David L. Sokol said. ``We don't have to be 
shifting strategies based on short-term events in the 
marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition is Berkshire's first investment in the energy  
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal announced Monday, Berkshire will acquire the Des  
Moines-based utility for $35.05 per share, about 29 percent over 
Friday's closing price of $27.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of MidAmerican were trading at $33.37 1/2, up 22 percent or  
$6.12 1/2, Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We buy good companies with outstanding management and good  
growth potential at a fair price, and we're willing to wait longer 
than some investors for that potential to be realized,'' Buffett 
said in a statement. ``This investment is right in our sweet 
spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sokol said Buffett had been considering investing in the energy  
sector for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had recognized -- given the deregulation of the U.S.  
electric and gas industry is the largest deregulation that has ever 
taken place around the world, and that that's going to create 
significant opportunity -- clearly a lot of consolidation 
opportunity,'' Sokol said. 
</P>
<P>
	MidAmerican merged with the Omaha-based CalEnergy, an  
international energy company, last March. MidAmerican has about 
9,800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its retail utility subsidiaries, MidAmerican Energy in  
the U.S. and Northern Electric in the United Kingdom, the company 
provides electric service to 2.2 million customers and natural gas 
service to 1.2 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkshire will have about a 75 percent interest in MidAmerican  
Energy. The other investors, who are also based in Omaha, are 
Walter Scott, former chairman of Omaha-based Peter Kiewit Sons' 
Inc. and MidAmerican's largest individual stockholder, and certain 
Scott family interests, and Sokol. 
</P>
<P>
	MidAmerican's directors approved the deal on Sunday. The  
company's headquarters will remain in Des Moines, with the office 
of the chairman and CEO remaining in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really business as usual,'' MidAmerican president Gregory  
E. Abel said Monday in a phone interview. ``We don't anticipate any 
management or employment changes as a result of this transaction 
and I think we're all very excited with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the completion of the transaction, expected by April 2000,  
MidAmerican will become a privately owned company with publicly 
traded fixed-income securities.

<HEADLINE> GTE Files AT&AMP;T Antitrust Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than a week after an apparent victory in  
Florida, AT&AMP;T's control over providing high-speed Internet services 
through its cable TV systems is being threatened by an antitrust 
suit by telephone and Internet company GTE Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE, which is being acquired by Bell Atlantic, filed the suit in  
a federal court in Pittsburgh on Monday. The company alleges 
monopolistic practices by AT&AMP;T and Comcast, another cable company 
that owns an interest in ExciteAtHome, a cable Internet service 
that is controlled by AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit complains that AT&AMP;T and Comcast are denying consumers  
the right to pick their Internet service by forcing them to pay an 
access fee to ExciteAtHome, regardless of whether they subscribe to 
an Internet service provider such as America Online, the industry 
leader with 19 million subscribers and one of AT&AMP;T's harshest 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants are illegally exploiting their economic power  
over high-speed Internet access to deprive Americans of their right 
to choose their ISP,'' GTE said in a statement announcing the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, Americans can choose among thousands of ISPs when they  
sign up for Internet access with the telephone companies,'' said 
William P. Barr, executive vice president and general counsel of 
GTE, which has only about half a million subscribers to its 
Internet service. ``But in the high-speed Internet access world of 
(AT&AMP;T) and Comcast, consumers don't have a choice. They are forced 
to accept AtHome as their only on-ramp to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, Comcast and ExciteAtHome all issued brief statements  
attacking GTE as a hypocritical monopoly in the markets where it 
provides local telephone service. They also reiterated arguments 
that cable lines are just a new form of competition for telephone 
companies whose copper lines are the primary means by which people 
access the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overwhelming majority of customers must access the  
Internet over dial-up facilities from GTE and the other local 
telephone monopolies,'' said Jim Cicconi, AT&AMP;T general counsel, in 
a statement. ``Now that AT&AMP;T is trying to use cable facilities to 
bring choice to the monopolies' customers, GTE is using every trick 
in the book to delay that competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit could force a more definitive stance from federal  
regulators, who've largely shied away from the issue except to 
discourage efforts by local governments to intervene with their own 
cable laws. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been fighting similar battles on many other fronts  
almost since the very start of its foray into cable several months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to bypass the Baby Bell system for providing telephone  
and Internet service, AT&AMP;T is spending more than $100 billion to 
buy and upgrade a broad swath of the nation's cable systems. As 
part of its purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., one of the 
nation's two biggest cable companies, AT&AMP;T gained control of 
ExciteAtHome, which it placed at the focal point of the new cable 
Internet initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Many local governments have bristled, however, at the notion of  
allowing AT&AMP;T to completely dominate what some see as the most 
promising way -- at least in the near term -- to provide a more 
robust Internet service than is possible over regular dial-up 
connection through copper phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the governments have moved to pass laws requiring  
AT&AMP;T and other cable companies to share their lines with rivals for 
a fee in the same way that long-distance calling companies pay the 
Baby Bells to complete their calls over their local phone networks. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and other cable operators argue that they are spending  
billions of dollars to upgrade their cable systems for Internet and 
telephone service and should be allowed to recoup their 
investments. They also argue that DSL, the high-speed Internet 
connection that uses a regular phone line, is a viable alternative 
for providing Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff initially looked grim for AT&AMP;T, which has been  
trying to ease a highly public spat with AOL and is suing to 
overturn laws passed in Portland, Ore., and Broward County, Fla., 
requiring open access to cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, county commissioners for Miami-Dade County in  
Florida voted against passing similar regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the Federal Communications Commission asserted that  
it holds the ultimate authority to regulate Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, however, federal officials have opted to remain on the  
sidelines, fearful that regulatory intervention will discourage 
companies from making investments to bring these services to 
consumers quickly.

<HEADLINE> Gore Talks to Teen-Agers in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Most of those who quizzed Vice President Al  
Gore during a forum for undecided voters Monday night have years to 
make up their minds. More than half of the audience was made of 
teen-agers too young to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of them worried about school violence and Gore promised  
that, if elected president next year, he would make it harder for 
young people to get guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the number one solution to this problem is better  
parenting,'' said Gore, who is competing against former Sen. Bill 
Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also said there must be zero tolerance for guns at school,  
more effective drug abuse education and more responsibility by the 
entertainment industry to reduce violence. 
</P>
<P>
	During the two-hour campaign event, Gore promised a 13-year-old  
with diabetes that he would support more research into the disease. 
He also cracked a few jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked one teen-ager what grade he was in, which prompted  
Manish Atani, 16, to ask jokingly, ``What grade are you in?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore replied, ``I'm in the seventh year of my vice presidency,  
and I'm ready to graduate. I hope I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Brownell of Nashua asked whether he would support  
requiring candidates to set aside some of their federal campaign 
money to provide their campaign literature in forms acceptable to 
the blind. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore promised he would put out his information in large type and  
braille, and explore other ways of making it easier for the 
disabled to stay informed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ken Massey of Hudson asked whether he would veto any budget  
that used gimmicks or dipped into the Social Security fund, Gore 
said he opposed tapping Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	``You said you would oppose gimmicks. My question is, would you  
commit to vetoing that budget?'' Massey added. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore replied: ``I will vigorously oppose it if there are clearly  
outrageous gimmicks for a raid on Social Security. Yes, I will 
veto. I'm not trying to dodge the question. I am just trying to 
give the most responsible answer I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Massey said, ``I didn't find him to be wooden or unfunny.  
I found him to be very articulate. The image on TV and the image 
the print press puts out is not the image I saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Gore knocked on about a half dozen doors in  
Nashua as he searched for undecided voters, then picked up an 
endorsement from the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Hometown Mourns Loss of Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Payne Stewart was not only the hometown  
boy who made good, he was ``simply the finest athlete that 
Springfield ever produced,'' said one family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was born 42 years ago on South Link Street, an  
appropriately named street for a golf legend in the making. He did 
most of his growing up at the nearby Hickory Hills Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played basketball and football in school and was great at  
everything he attempted to do,'' said attorney Joe Greene, a close 
friend of the Stewart family. ``When he got out on the links, it 
was more like magic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was among five people killed Monday when a LearJet he  
was aboard flew uncontrolled for hours and crashed in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his mother, Bee, of Springfield; wife Tracey,  
whom he met while playing in Australia early in his career, and his 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the time he was 3 years old I would take him to the golf  
course with me because I couldn't find a baby sitter,'' Bee Stewart 
said when reached by phone. ``It was in his blood from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf was his life, but it wasn't his whole life. His first  
love was his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other residents of this Ozark town reacted as if they had lost  
their own son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just impossible to believe, my kids are coming home from  
school in a little while and will be devastated,'' said Janis 
Auner, who said her children participated in several golf clinics 
held by Stewart for local children. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just an awesome person. He loved children and he spent  
so much time giving back to this town,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auner's husband, Tom, recalled Stewart's unique attire. While  
his trademark knickers came after Springfield, Stewart was never 
short on supply of outrageous shirts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always tried to pick out the wildest golf shirt with lots  
of floral prints. Those were great shirts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart visited Springfield this summer shortly after he won the  
U.S. Open for the second time. As he often did, he signed 
autographs and met with old friends. This time, he was flocked by 
some 500 adoring fans at the Hickory Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never turned a child down for an autograph. That man had  
style,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart lent a club from his 1999 U.S. Open to Hickory Hills to  
display in a ``Club of Champions'' exhibit alongside former Masters 
champions Horton Smith and Herman Keiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also took time to sign autographs at the Bill and Payne  
Stewart Golf Course, a public course named in honor of Stewart and 
his father in 1995 for ``everything he has done for the community 
and the sport of golf,'' said a receptionist at the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's newfound faith in God also meant a lot to the people  
of this Bible-Belt town. He said he was drawn to church through his 
children, 13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt H'Doubler attended Greenwood Laboratory School -- a  
semiprivate school -- with Stewart nearly 35 years ago. He never had 
any doubt Stewart would grow up to be such a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge tragedy. What can I say? My own son looked up  
to him as a hero,'' H'Doubler said. ``Golf has lost one of its 
better players and his family has lost a great man.''

<HEADLINE> Tips for Avoiding Online Rip-Offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More and more people are shopping on the  
Internet, and with the holiday season approaching, the nation's 
largest lawyers' organization is offering advice on how to avoid 
online rip-offs. 
</P>
<P>
	People need to develop instincts for shopping online similar to  
the instinct that ``tells you you shouldn't buy a diamond ring from 
a roadside vendor,'' said Thomas Vartanian, chairman of the 
American Bar Association's cyberspace law committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA on Monday unveiled a new Web site -- www.safeshopping.org  
-- that outlines ways consumers can try to minimize their chances of 
running into trouble on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to encourage people to shop online but do so in an  
informed manner,'' said Walter Effross, chairman of an ABA panel on 
electronic commerce and an American University law professor. ``If 
you don't feel right about buying a specific product online or from 
a particular Web site ... then maybe you shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Web site's suggestions:  
</P>
<P>
	--Look for symbols indicating the Web site uses security  
technology to protect purchasers' credit card numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pay by credit card instead of a debit card or check. Using a  
credit card provides more legal protection if a dispute arises. 
</P>
<P>
	--Read the Web site's privacy policy to find out what information  
the seller is gathering from you, whether it sells the information 
to other companies, and how consumers can opt out of such 
information-sharing. People might not want to deal with a Web site 
that lists no privacy policy, the ABA site suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check the ``feedback'' areas of online auction sites, where  
customers discuss their experiences with sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Read the warranty before buying an item and check for limits on  
the company's liability if something goes wrong with the item. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make a printout of the Web page, the item being purchased, the  
warranty and any messages between the buyer and seller. If the date 
doesn't appear on the printouts, add it in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This holiday season, many consumers will go on the Net for the  
first time for shopping,'' said Gail Hillebrand of Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Online shoppers are expected to spend about $9 billion on gifts  
during the coming holiday season, according to the market research 
company Harris Interactive of Rochester, N.Y. The company said 
about one-third of all people with Internet access are expected to 
buy something online this season, compared with about 8 percent 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to security of credit card numbers, Vartanian said  
people need to be alert for ``identity theft,'' in which someone 
uses another person's identity for a variety of transactions, such 
as taking out a loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can put a cop on every computer and we still will not  
eliminate fraud in cyberspace,'' Vartanian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillebrand of Consumers Union said the vast majority of  
complaints about online transactions have been over items bought 
through Internet auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Consumers League has announced its own educational  
campaign to help people stay out of trouble while shopping over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey conducted for the group indicated that most people who  
shopped online were pleased with the result, but one in five 
reported problems including products being misrepresented, products 
not being delivered, and unauthorized charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed only 10 percent of consumers were concerned  
that a seller might be fraudulent, although the consumers league 
said that actually was a bigger danger than credit card number 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers need to check out unfamiliar companies before doing  
business with them, online or offline,'' Susan Grant of the 
consumers league said last week. ``You can't judge them simply on 
the basis of a nice-looking Web site.''

<HEADLINE> Dowd Applauds Rose Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Washington lawyer who investigated Pete  
Rose's gambling habits 10 years ago said inviting the banned player 
to the All-Century ceremony was ``like inviting Willie Sutton to a 
banker's meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Dowd, who compiled a 225-page report on Rose in 1989 along  
with seven volumes of evidence, also said Rose doesn't want to 
admit ties to mobsters and said the former player lied when he 
claimed he has never seen baseball's evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got to see it all, and then he was given a copy of  
everything,'' Dowd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before submitting the report to baseball, Dowd confronted Rose  
and his lawyers with the evidence during a meeting at a convent in 
Dayton, Ohio, on April 21-22, 1989, including evidence Rose bet on 
the Reds to win 52 times from April 8 to July 5, 1987. All that 
information was made public by an Ohio judge on June 26, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd insisted Rose is incapable of admitting guilt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he wants to talk about his relationship with the  
mob,'' Dowd said. ``If he says he bet on baseball, the next 
question leads inexorably to his debt to the mob. How much it was? 
Have you paid it off? Were you in communication with them when you 
were manager of the Cincinnati Reds? 
</P>
<P>
	``How did he come in second with the best team in baseball? I'd  
say the bookmaker makes a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd was angry that commissioner Bud Selig invited Rose to  
participate in Sunday's ceremony along with the 17 other living 
members of the 30-man All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an embarrassing night,'' Dowd said. ``It was like  
inviting Willie Sutton to a banker's meeting. It was incredible. If 
that's what the lords of baseball want to do, we all know how it 
will come out. They all kept winking in 1920.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd's references were to Sutton, a famous bank robber of the  
mid-20th century, and to the Black Sox scandal, in which eight 
Chicago White Sox players were accused of throwing the 1919 World 
Series to Cincinnati. Although they were acquitted of criminal 
charges, commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned them all for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's attorney, Gary Spicer, said Dowd's statements were  
reckless and damaging to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's frustration or desperation, it's unfortunate,''  
Spicer said. ``I think John Dowd continues to offer very malicious, 
vindictive comments that are unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti died the week after the  
agreement was signed on Aug. 23, 1989, and Rose waited until 
September 1997 to apply. Selig repeatedly has said he has no 
intention of altering the ban, while Rose says he thought Giamatti 
would have allowed him to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that Bart would have reinstated Pete is ludicrous,''  
Fay Vincent, who was Giamatti's deputy and succeeded him as 
commissioner, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent said he wouldn't have invited Rose to the ceremony but  
didn't want to be too critical of Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a great occasion for Pete to be more  
gracious and more humble, but that's not Pete,'' Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than contest Dowd's report, at a hearing before Giamatti,  
Rose signed the ban agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike Charlie Manson, he didn't come to the hearing,'' Dowd  
said, referring to Rose's statement Sunday that ``Charles Manson 
gets a hearing every year, doesn't he?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He agreed there was a factual basis and agreed the  
investigation was fair,'' Dowd said, referring to language in the 
agreement Rose signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd said Rose should never be allowed to set foot on a major  
league field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've ignored that rule. My question is what's the next rule  
we ignore?'' he said. ``Is there anybody in the game who's going to 
stand up for the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dowd revealed that the commissioner's office filed a complaint  
against him with the District of Columbia bar about 1 1/2 years ago in 
an attempt to keep him from speaking publicly about the Rose case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said I was breaching confidences,'' Dowd said. ``It was  
summarily dismissed. It's a rough crowd there these days in 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert DuPuy, baseball's executive vice president of  
administration and chief legal officer, distanced the sport from 
Dowd's views. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not solicit his comments nor do we endorse them,'' he  
said. ``We would prefer that Mr. Dowd refrain from commenting on 
his representation of the office of the commissioner. He is no 
longer engaged by this office and he has completed his work. We 
don't look for his guidance in this whatsoever.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Bolts GOP for Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- Lifelong Republican Pat Buchanan  
abandoned the GOP today to run for the Reform Party presidential 
nomination, telling supporters the nation's two-party system has no 
home for them. ``Sometimes party loyalty asks too much, and today 
it asks too much of us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our two parties have become nothing but two wings on the same  
bird of prey,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go, Pat, go,'' the crowd of at least 300 responded.  
</P>
<P>
	The repeat presidential contender railed against ``big money''  
and the political party establishment, and promised -- in the

	``Let me say to the money boys and the Beltway elite, who think  
that at long last they have pulled up the drawbridge and locked us 
out forever, you don't know this peasant army,'' Buchanan heckled. 
``We have not yet begun to fight!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative commentator's none-too-surprising announcement,  
which he'd hinted at for weeks and which was broadcast nationally 
on live television, was bedeviled at the start by a stubbornly 
faulty sound system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who put G. Gordon Liddy in charge of the microphones,''  
Buchanan cracked, drawing laughter from a crowd that responded with 
yells of ``Made in China!'' ``sabotage!'' and, ``a liberal plot!''

<HEADLINE> 49ers Are Now Just Part of the Pack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In 1951, a baseball manager named Chuck Dressen proclaimed:  
``The Giants is dead.'' That was after his Brooklyn Dodgers opened 
a 13 1/2-game lead over the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	That October, Bobby Thomson buried Dressen's Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
	It's another sport and another era, but here it is:  
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers is dead.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, not dead really, just not the 49ers other NFL teams have  
come to fear for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a team that's won 10 or more games for the last 17 full  
NFL seasons, akin to a baseball team winning 100 or more games. 
Since 1983, they've missed the playoffs only in 1991, when both 
Steve Young and Joe Montana were hurt and they still finished 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	But their hopes for a postseason appearance are slim this year,  
even if Young, who has missed the last 3 1/2 games with a concussion, 
returns in all his splendor. He might not. He might never be back. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as coach Steve Mariucci said: ``We're entering a place we've  
never been before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not never. Just not since 1980, when the 49ers finished  
6-10 in the second year of the Bill Walsh rebuilding program. A 
year later, they won the first of their five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term success is probably due to one move that Walsh  
made -- acquiring Young from Tampa Bay for second- and fourth-round 
picks in the 1987 draft plus cash. That allowed one potential Hall 
of Fame quarterback to succeed another and make San Francisco the 
only team in recent NFL history to go through a seamless on-field 
transition at the game's key position. 
</P>
<P>
	But Young's absence isn't the only reason the 49ers are 3-4  
after three straight losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Garcia wasn't good Sunday in the 40-16 loss to the Vikings,  
but the defense was worse -- it was the third time this year a team 
has scored 40 or more points against the 49ers. Three other teams 
allowed more than 40 points in regulation this year, none more than 
once. 
</P>
<P>
	With Young and Montana at quarterback, the Niners rarely if ever  
botched a 2-minute drill. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, they trailed 21-13 and were backed up on their own 14  
with 20 seconds left in the half when they called two timeouts 
instead of killing the clock. They finally passed, and John Randle 
intercepted to set up a field goal that made it 24-13. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco could still make the playoffs if Young comes back.  
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers also could win 10 games, which in the NFC this year  
would get them into the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But they probably won't.  
</P>
<P>
	They're not THE 49ERS anymore, they're the 49ers. Teams that  
used to quake at the name now regard them as just another mediocre 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get our tradition back,'' linebacker Winfred Tubbs  
said. ``We have to get our fear factor back. We're going into other 
team's places and they're thinking they can beat us without even 
playing well. The only way we can stop that is by not giving up 40 
points a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BAD BLOOD: Michael Westbrook and Albert Connell, the Redskins'  
wide receivers, yapped a lot before Sunday's game in Dallas about 
what they would do to the Cowboys. Their remarks backfired -- Dallas 
beat them 38-20. 
</P>
<P>
	Connell made the biggest mistake, bragging how he'd beat Deion  
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders set the tone on the game's first play by dumping Stephen  
Davis for a 4-yard loss, even though tackling is something Deion 
rarely bothers to do. On the second, play he delivered a forearm to 
Connell's chin, for which Westbrook and Connell claimed he should 
have been thrown out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders wasn't even penalized, but he got crunched later on a  
punt return, sat out the second and third quarters, then clinched 
things with a 70-yard punt return in the fourth quarter. Westbrook 
had three catches for 38 yards and Connell had two for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first meeting, when the Cowboys were without Sanders.  
Westbrook caught five for 159 yards and Connell four for 137. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Connell said Sanders came up to him and told him  
he loved him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't no love here,'' Connell said. ``You take cheap  
shots, you claim to be a man of God, but God doesn't like ugly. I 
just didn't appreciate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook was more contrite.  
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that the pre-game comments might have fired up  
Deion. But he thought Sanders overreacted with the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest defensive backs of all time,''  
Westbrook said. ``He ran a punt all the way for a touchdown. That 
killed us. What else can you say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say nothing.  
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	INSIDE KNOWLEDGE?: When the Bears released Erik Kramer at the  
start of training camp, they were soundly rebuked for leaving 
themselves with no experienced QBs. 
</P>
<P>
	That move looks a lot better now.  
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who signed with San Diego, threw interceptions on the  
Chargers' first four possessions of the second half against Seattle 
a week ago. But he redeemed himself by moving the team into 
position for the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday against the Packers, he threw interceptions on two of  
the first three series, making it six out of nine possessions on 
which he turned over the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	For comparison purposes, the following have fewer than six  
interceptions all season: 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Warner, Brad Johnson, Jon Kitna, Drew Bledsoe (four INTs in  
249 passes), Neil O'Donnell, Shane Matthews (who took Kramer's job 
with the Bears), Rich Gannon (five in 242), Dan Marino, Kent 
Graham, Mark Brunell, Kordell Stewart, Tim Couch and Akili Smith. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	PARITY: The Patriots are 5-2 after their 24-23 win over the  
Broncos on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw out a 12-point win over the expansion Browns and their  
four other wins (Broncos, Giants, Colts and Jets) are by a total of 
eight points; their two losses (Dolphins and Chiefs) by a total of 
three.

<HEADLINE> Rhode Island Sen. John Chafee Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Chafee was mourned Monday in his home  
state of Rhode Island and in the Senate where he served for nearly 
a quarter-century, recalled as an unwavering voice for moderation 
and environmental protection in a Republican Party that moved ever 
rightward during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He embodied the decent center which has carried America from  
triumph to triumph for over 200 years,'' said President Clinton, 
who added that Chafee ``always put his concern for the American 
people above partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A descendant of one of the families that helped settle Rhode  
Island, the 77-year-old Chafee fought in two wars and was a 
three-term governor before winning his Senate seat in 1976. He felt 
ill on Sunday and was taken at mid-afternoon to Bethesda Naval 
Hospital in suburban Maryland. His office said he died a few hours 
later from heart failure, although public announcement was withheld 
until Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In life, Chafee was a leader among the Senate's dwindling band  
of GOP moderates, seeking to bridge the gaps between lawmakers in 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	He regularly drew praise from environmental groups, and  
supported abortion rights, gun control legislation and measures to 
use the power of government to expand health care coverage. Last 
winter, he voted to acquit Clinton on both articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	In death, he left behind questions of succession both for his  
seat in the Senate and at the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, which he chaired. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Almond, a Republican, has the power to  
appoint a successor to serve for the 14 months remaining in the 
term. Chafee had announced plans to retire next year, and his son, 
Lincoln Chafee, who serves as mayor of the state's second-largest 
city, was the only Republican actively running to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	At the committee, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire would  
ordinarily ascend to the chairmanship. But Smith abandoned the 
Republican Party last summer to become an independent, leaving his 
claim on the chairmanship damaged, perhaps fatally. Next in line in 
seniority is Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was the first senator to die in office since Quentin  
Burdick, D-N.D., in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The eulogies for the Rhode Islander were bipartisan.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the Senate, we knew John as a genially independent New  
Englander, respected on both sides of the aisle, who worked to 
bring opposing sides together for a common goal,'' said Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lost my friend and mentor in the Senate,'' said James  
Jeffords of Vermont, another moderate Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., as conservative as Chafee was not,  
said, ``I never heard him speak a harsh word about anyone.'' He 
was, Helms added, ``demonstrably willing to give his life for his 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, too, praised him. ``He was kind and caring, even in  
this atmosphere of sharp-edged politics,'' said California Democrat 
Barbara Boxer. ``I appreciate all his good work on the environment, 
(abortion) and sensible gun control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One environmentalist, Greg Wetstone of the Natural Resources  
Defense Council, said Chafee played an important role in passing 
the Clean Air Act in 1990 as well as hazardous waste laws and 
legislation dealing with water and coastal issues. Wetstone also 
said Chafee helped bury legislation that the House had passed in 
1995 that environmentalists derided as a ``dirty water bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee's political career began not long after he was mustered  
out of the Marines. He was his first elected to the state 
legislature in 1956. He was three times elected governor, losing a 
bid for a fourth term in 1968. After a stint as President Nixon's 
navy secretary, Chafee's bid at a political comeback was thwarted 
in 1972 when he lost a race for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, he was successful, capitalizing on a split  
among Democrats to become the first Republican elected to the 
Senate from his state since the Great Depression. He never lost 
another race in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	He had struggles inside the Senate, though. He won a leadership  
post in 1984, but fellow Republicans pressured him to jettison one 
key aide who had formerly served a liberal Democrat. In 1990, it 
was Chafee himself who was forced out, losing his leadership post 
by a single vote in what was seen at the time as a referendum on 
his moderate political views. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee also had a reputation as a gentleman. One GOP aide  
recalled how Chafee had once invited several senators and House 
members to his office to work out final details of legislation. The 
senator's personal tea set was produced and tea and cookies were 
served before the bargaining began. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee underwent back surgery last summer and was slow to  
recover, occasionally using a wheelchair to move from one location 
to another in the Capitol complex. 
</P>
<P>
	He had returned home last March to declare an end to his career,  
in words that could have served as an epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Rhode Islanders, so many of them Democrats, who had  
voted for him time and again, he said: 
</P>
<P>
	``They seek, as I do, bipartisan solutions to problems rather  
than partisan gridlock.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart's Death Marks Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A blue ribbon marked the empty parking spot Payne  
Stewart was supposed to fill this week as one of the honored guests 
of the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was killed along with at least four others when their  
LearJet flew uncontrolled for hours Monday before crashing in South 
Dakota. He was among the sport's top 30 money winners and qualified 
for the $5 million tournament at Champions Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans and colleagues were stunned as practice began Monday, and  
the PGA Tour canceled Tuesday's pro-am that was part of Tour 
Championship 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of Payne Stewart, and there's a guy that's going to be  
like Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, a guy you want around all 
those years,'' golfer Duffy Waldorf said. ``He's such a big part of 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waldorf and fellow pro Jeff Maggert said Stewart was well-liked  
by the players and a gallery favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing on the tour for nine years and being able to share a  
passion with someone ... to play on the Ryder Cup team with him, 
it's just amazing that in a fraction of the time your world and 
your life and a lot of things can change,'' Maggert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a tough week for all the players, for myself, for  
the wives, everyone. It's a tragic situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flags flew at half staff at the golf course after it was  
confirmed Stewart was aboard the wayward jet and died in a 
nose-first crash. The mood was thoroughly somber as golfers 
practiced in the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking forward to seeing him play. He is a very  
colorful pro,'' said Vance Riley, 68, a golf fan and resident of 
the neighborhood adjacent to the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Hall, 76, spoke of Stewart's unmistakable knickers.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was very distinguished in clothing, but when you got used  
to it he didn't look right with long pants on,'' said Hall, who 
like Riley is an ex-pilot. ``You hate to see a good guy like that 
go. He's one of the good people in this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Burke, 1956 Masters champion and co-founder of Champions,  
had trouble digesting the news of Stewart's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe anything like this could happen -- a private  
aircraft going down like that,'' Burke said. ``But, I mean, missing 
him is just unbelievable.''

<HEADLINE> Stars and Stripes Penalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes  
was penalized today for a collision with another yacht from the 
United States, which led to a three-day delay in completion of the 
opening round of the challenger series for the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Conner's team is the second to be cited after a spate of  
collisions in the first round-robin of the regatta to decide who 
will take on defender New Zealand for sailing's most prized trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires took a half-point away from Conner's team for crashing  
into AmericaOne during pre-start maneuvers in their race Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief umpire Brian Willis said the ruling should send a warning  
to skippers about being too aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lesson for them to learn is that if they're going to have  
massive collisions, and put boats out of commission, we'll take 
action,'' Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Japanese team Nippon also was docked a half-point for  
causing a collision with the Spanish team in their Saturday race. 
Stars and Stripes and Nippon are tied for sixth place with 2 1/2 
points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne went on the win the race against Starts and Stripes,  
but later asked officials for the schedule break make repairs. On 
the same day, Swiss team Fast 2000 also sought a delay after a 
bulkhead tore free from the hull of its boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials delayed the last races of round-robin 1 until  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars and Stripes argued against its penalty, but the  
international jury decided Conner was at fault and had broken rule 
14 of the race guide, which instructs boats to avoid collisions at 
all cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obviously disappointed, but we are happy that this  
happened in round one, when the races are only worth one point 
each,'' Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, umpires dismissed an application to restart races  
before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's America's True said it has been unfairly  
disadvantaged by the delay, which limits the amount of time teams 
will have to make adjustments to their boats before the start of 
round-robin 2, scheduled for Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Under America's Cup rules, boats cannot be reconfigured during  
official race periods.

<HEADLINE> Casinos Denounce Sports Betting Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Banning Nevada sports books from taking bets on  
college sports events would be a ``cosmetic response to a serious 
problem,'' a casino industry lobbyist has warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fahrenkopf, president of the American Gaming Association,  
said the NCAA faces a fight if it tries to shove a ban through 
Congress. Fahrenkopf laid down the gauntlet in a letter Friday to 
NCAA President Cedric Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unfortunate and counter-productive to end up in a  
confrontation over a well-intentioned, but cosmetic response to a 
serious problem,'' Fahrenkopf wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regrettably, that is the position we will be put in should you  
pursue this proposal even though there is no logical or factual 
basis to link Nevada's legal sports books with illegal betting, 
which nationally is a problem that long preceded sports wagering in 
Nevada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of agent and gambling activities,  
said Monday his organization plans to press ahead with its lobbying 
efforts in Congress despite the casino industry's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about the NCAA versus the American Gaming  
Association,'' Saum said. ``It's nothing like that at all. It's an 
issue we've carefully examined from all sides, and we believe the 
law needs to be changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saum said it's possible a bill banning betting on college  
athletics could be introduced in the Senate before Congress 
recesses for the year next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think there are people interested in announcing authorship  
of this bill sooner than later,'' he said. ``It's a situation that 
for any number of reasons, we believe we come out on the right side 
of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  
has expressed an interest in sponsoring the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fahrenkopf said Monday it's possible a bill could be introduced  
this session, but he doubted whether any action would be taken 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they introduce a bill, then we start making our case to  
Congress,'' he said. ``This is a case of the NCAA in effect trying 
to lay off on us a problem that it really has more control over 
than any other organization in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his four-page letter to Dempsey, Fahrenkopf said the industry  
remains committed to the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA's attempts to construct a circuitous connection  
cannot withstand close scrutiny,'' he said. ``Your proposal, if 
enacted would not have a material impact on illegal sports betting 
on college campuses, would impinge on state prerogatives to 
regulate gaming and would needlessly penalize Nevada's legal sports 
books, their employees and their customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fahrenkopf said the industry agrees with the NCAA that underage  
gambling needs to be addressed on a national basis. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that the NCAA and its members are in the ``best  
position'' to attack the problem on college campuses because they 
are closest to the students. 
</P>
<P>
	Fahrenkopf urged the NCAA to concentrate more on working  
together with the industry on public education and research of 
youth gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Fahrenkopf reported that Dempsey told him  
that betting on college athletics in Nevada has the potential to 
bring down college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's push is the result of a college betting ban  
recommended in June by the National Gambling Impact Study 
Commission, a nine-member panel created by Congress to examine the 
spread of gambling in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Fahrenkopf said the commission did not intend for Congress to  
get involved in such a ban.

<HEADLINE> Chafee's Son Could Move to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- John Chafee's death could elevate his  
son Lincoln, 46-year-old mayor of Rhode Island's second-largest 
city, into his father's U.S. Senate seat -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln Chafee, the mayor of Warwick, became a candidate for the  
Senate earlier this year after his father announced he would not be 
seeking a fifth term next year. He was the only Republican actively 
running for the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, Gov. Lincoln Almond, a Republican, will appoint  
someone to fill the seat until the November 2000 election. Almond 
said Monday he would not discuss his intentions until a ``period of 
mourning'' was over. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the younger Chafee were appointed, he would have the  
advantage of running for a full term as an incumbent. A recent poll 
showed him and his main Democratic rival -- Rep. Bob Weygand -- 
virtually deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Chafee made national headlines in August when he  
admitted he had used cocaine while a student at Brown University. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating in 1975, he became a blacksmith on horse-racing  
circuits first in Kentucky and then in Canada. After returning to 
his home state, he was elected mayor of Warwick in 1992 and has 
been re-elected three times since.

<HEADLINE> Female Politicians, Media Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The way newspapers cover female candidates,  
detailing their age, marital status, appearance -- even hair color -- 
is a barrier for women seeking election to public office, said a 
study released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper stories include personal and family information about  
female candidates more often then they do about their male 
opponents, said the report by the Women's Leadership Fund. 
Reporters are more likely to highlight men's positions on issues, 
such as education, transportation and taxes, than those of women, 
it contended. 
</P>
<P>
	``News coverage is another barrier women face in running for  
executive offices, particularly governor,'' said Marie Wilson, 
president of the fund, a New York organization that promotes women 
for leadership positions. ``All too often newspapers cover women as 
personalities, not as leaders. With more reporting on female 
candidates' agendas, the public can better evaluate how women will 
govern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, ``Framing Gender on the Campaign Trail,'' analyzed  
newspaper coverage of male and female candidates in six political 
campaigns in 1998. The candidates were running in general elections 
for governor in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Rhode Island and 
for governor and attorney general in Massachusetts primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists, who discussed the study at a news conference today,  
agreed that gender bias does creep into print and broadcast 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a double standard and it persists,'' said Andrea  
Mitchell, chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News. But she 
added that the bias affects coverage of all women, not just female 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	While not defending the practice, Sam Fulwood III, a Washington  
correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, agreed, saying, ``There is 
no question that this double standard exists in our coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of their discussion centered on Elizabeth Dole, who  
recently scrapped her race for the Republican nomination for 
president. Several journalists said they thought Dole -- from the 
very beginning -- was asked about being second on the GOP ticket 
more frequently than were men running for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gwen Ifill, managing editor for ``Washington Week in  
Review'' and senior correspondent for ``The NewsHour with Jim 
Lehrer,'' said the questions about the vice presidency might not be 
all bad. It also could mean that even it she didn't get the 
nomination, she still had something to offer the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers reviewed 311 newspaper stories. The articles  
comprised 1,609 paragraphs, including 441 quotations, on the 
campaigns of female candidates and 1,717 paragraphs, including 450 
quotations, on male contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Journalists focused on personal characteristics of female  
candidates in 17 percent of the paragraphs written about them, 
compared with 12 percent for the men. One story described Arizona 
Gov. Jane Hull as a ``grandmotherly redhead dressed in a sensible 
suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Male and female candidates received equal campaign coverage. Of  
the 311 stories, 15 percent focused on female candidates, 16 
percent on the male candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reporters highlighted male candidates' positions or records on  
the issues in 31 percent of the paragraphs written about them, 
compared with 27 percent for women. 
</P>
<P>
	--62 percent of the quotations made by male candidates included  
facts, evidence or reasoning behind their statements, compared with 
56 percent for women.

<HEADLINE> Former Baptist Publicist Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A former publicist for the National Baptist  
Convention USA has been sentenced to nearly two years in prison for 
failing to pay taxes on more than $500,000 she received while 
working for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernice Edwards was sentenced Monday to 21 months and must also  
pay $109,000 to the IRS and serve three years of supervised 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards was the co-defendant in the trial of the Rev. Henry  
Lyons, a former director of the large and influential black church 
denomination now serving a 5 1/2-year sentence for embezzling $4 
million from companies doing business with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, 42, sobbed and asked U.S. District Judge Henry Lee  
Adams for leniency because she is a single mother of four children, 
including an infant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very remorseful of the acts that I pleaded to and I take  
full responsibility for it,'' Ms. Edwards said. ``I don't know how 
we can make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, of Milwaukee, faced up to 10 years in prison and  
$500,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered that Ms. Edwards undergo mental health  
treatment and not open new bank accounts or have any opened in her 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards was working as a publicist for the convention when  
she and Lyons, 57, were accused of purchasing real estate, jewelry 
and other items with money from the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	She was acquitted of racketeering charges but pleaded guilty to  
tax evasion in March.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Floods Death Toll Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- A new surge of floodwater in the  
devastated state of Tabasco has apparently killed six people, 
officials said Monday, adding to the toll of hundreds who have died 
in storms over the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 120,000 of the 465,000 residents of the  
Villahermosa area remained evacuated from their houses Monday and 
city officials said some 60 percent of the city was flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	The sun was out Monday, but almost incessant rains that began in  
mid-September have repeatedly flooded coastal communities and 
filled upstream dams to the bursting point. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials began unleashing torrents of water Saturday  
from the Penoles dam, keeping rivers flooding at historically high 
levels as they raged toward the southern Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Televised images of the city taken from helicopters made it  
appear like an island in a sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and state officials have now reported at least 404 deaths  
in the floods and mudslides that hit Mexico, though federal figures 
are somewhat lower because they omit early stages of the flooding 
and some of the states affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the those killed over the weekend were two brothers from  
Jalpa de Mendez who were swept away by floodwaters as they tried to 
rescue their corn crop, according to Juan Magana, mayor of the 
town. He said they did not know how to swim and drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	A 66-year-old man rowing through floodwaters in Cunduacan ran  
into a downed high tension wire and was electrocuted to death, 
state officials said. Two others, also brothers, were carried away 
by the Carrizal River. 
</P>
<P>
	And officials in the town of Nacajuca said a man there fell from  
a bridge Saturday and drowned, though his body had not been 
recovered.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A stronger yen helped push Japan's trade surplus  
with the world lower during the first six months of the fiscal 
year, the government said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported  
by Japan minus those imported, declined 13.6 percent to $6.03 
billion from April through September from the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1998, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 23 percent  
from the previous year to reach the second highest total ever 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in fiscal first half was largely due to the yen's  
strength against the dollar, said a ministry official briefing 
reporters on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	During the period, the dollar averaged 118.18 yen, down 14  
percent from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has gained against the dollar in recent months as  
optimism grows regarding Japan's improving economy. The country has 
been struggling to emerge from its worst economic downturn in 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen affects the the trade balance as it tends to make  
Japanese goods more expensive overseas and can thus reduce demand 
for them in foreign markets. It can also make overseas products 
more expensive in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has come under heavy pressure from the United States and  
other trading partners to rein in its trade surplus by bolstering 
the weak economy to spark demand for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry also announced that Japan's trade surplus for the  
month of September alone fell 9.7 percent to $13.1 billion from the 
same month last year, marking the sixth straight month of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors, exceeded the  
average forecast of $11.9 billion by Tokyo-based economists 
surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	The slip in September exports was partly due to a 25.8 percent  
appreciation of Japan's currency to 110.17 yen against the dollar 
compared to a year ago, said the official. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing to buck the overall trend, however, was the  
politically sensitive surplus the United States, which rose for the 
fifth straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	It increased 4.9 percent in September to $7.23 billion, the  
ministry reported. For the fiscal first half, it rose 10.2 percent 
to $35.56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, overall Japanese exports to the United States fell  
7.1 percent on year, while imports of U.S. goods to Japan tumbled 
19.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to the United States of politically sensitive Japanese  
steel products, however, plummeted 72 percent to $129.15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop comes as Japan plans to take the United States to the  
World Trade Organization over steps by Washington to impose 
anti-dumping duties on certain steel products from over twenty 
countries, including Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan says that Washington's decision to limit imports of  
hot-rolled steel products is a protectionist measure which goes 
against WTO free trade principles. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to Asian countries rose 4.3 percent in September to  
$14.97 billion as the region recovers from its economic crisis, the 
ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Electric Co. Being Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy's largest-ever privatization kicked off Monday  
with the offering of shares in the state electricity monopoly to 
the Italian public. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, ENEL's roadshow for institutional investors  
began in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	When the privatization is complete, ENEL will be the biggest  
publicly traded electric company in the world. It is the world's 
third-largest electricity producer with 29 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Early demand for shares was so enthusiastic that the government,  
which owns 100 percent of the company, said it might sell off 34.5 
percent of the stock now, rather than the 23 percent originally 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The government expected to raise about $13 billion by selling 23  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the government must divest itself of 40 percent of ENEL  
by the year 2002 to comply with European Union rules. Its 
privatization ends a three decade monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	The public offering ends Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Pick Pat Gillick as GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Pat Gillick -- with a nudge from his wife --  
decided he really did want to get back into baseball, and on Monday 
he was appointed the new general manager of the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick, who served as general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays  
and Baltimore Orioles before retiring after last season, said 
Monday his first job was to work out deals with Ken Griffey Jr. and 
Alex Rodriguez, whose contracts both run out after next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have two franchise players like they are, they have  
to take top priority,'' Gillick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick, 62, led the Blue Jays to World Series titles in 1992  
and 1993. He served as general manager of the Orioles from 1995 
until his retirement, and twice has been named baseball's Executive 
of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past five weeks, the Mariners have been interviewing  
possible replacements for Woody Woodward, who announced his 
resignation Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick was the first candidate interviewed by Mariners  
president Chuck Armstrong. But on Oct. 7, Gillick withdrew his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick said his wife, Doris, started an art gallery in Toronto  
just 18 months ago. It wasn't fair to ask her to give that up, or 
to agree to a long distance marriage, after ``I've been running 
around the country for 30 years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But his wife offered to work it out and split her time between  
Seattle and Toronto, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I withdrew, she was really the one who said, `Hey, give  
them a call back, and get yourself back in, if that's what you 
really want to do.' And that is what I really want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who said he had tried to hire Gillick after the 1988  
season, said he ``ran him through some hoops'' to make sure there 
was no lingering indecision. Gillick and his wife spent much of 
last week in Seattle, and Armstrong, Mariners chairman Howard 
Lincoln, and co-owner Chris Larson made their decision over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick will also be the Mariners' executive vice president.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, a three time All-Star shortstop, makes $4 million  
next year -- the last of a four-year, $10.5 million deal. The 
Mariners have offered him an eight-year contract worth more than 
$15 million per season. However, Rodriguez has said he first wants 
proof the team will make the moves necessary to become a contender, 
after two years of struggling to play .500 ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey's contract also runs out at the end of next season. The  
Mariners have offered the center fielder an eight-year deal 
totaling about $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Goldberg, Griffey's agent, said he discussed Gillick's  
hiring with Griffey shortly after it was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with Kenny,'' he said. ``I look at it totally as a  
positive for the Mariners. For as long as Pat was running the Blue 
Jays you don't find people that often who have that good and classy 
a reputation as he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though ``Kenny's staying or leaving is not really something Pat  
can change,'' his hiring bolsters the Mariners' commitment to 
winning, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Being in his 60s, ``I don't think Pat would want to take on a  
situation that he wouldn't be able to win right away with,'' 
Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick said he planned to speak with Griffey and Rodriguez on  
Monday and meet with them next week. Although he said he wouldn't 
negotiate through the media, ``Our desire is to keep them in 
Mariners' uniforms for a long period of time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick said the Mariners' owners want to win, as evidenced by  
Lincoln's announcement last month that he would boost the player 
payroll by about 30 percent, to more than $65 million. The team 
moved into the new Safeco Field in July, and Woodward left the 
nucleus of a strong team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of franchises and owners in baseball would like to be in  
the situation that Seattle is in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to signing Griffey and Rodriguez, Gillick said he  
wants to add a veteran pitcher as a fifth starter, find a strong 
leadoff hitter and bolster Seattle's perpetually weak bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who interviewed for the Seattle job were Bob Watson,  
former GM of the Yankees and Astros; Mike Port, former Angels GM 
and now assistant GM of the Boston Red Sox; Dan Evans, Chicago 
White Sox assistant GM; Omar Minaya and Jim Duquette, New York Mets 
assistant GMs; and Mariners vice presidents Roger Jongewaard and 
Lee Pelekoudas.

authorities scrambling to figure out what to do. A spokesman for 
the Federal Aviation Administration says he can't confirm broadcast

	Buchanan Bolts GOP for Reform Party  
</P>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- Longtime Republican Pat Buchanan left  
the party today to seek the Reform Party's presidential nomination. 
Buchanan, who twice ran for the GOP's nod, said ``our vaunted 
two-party system has become a snare and a delusion, a fraud upon 
the nation.'' The conservative commentator, whose campaigns hobbled 
Republican front-runners in 1992 and 1996, singled out the U.S. 
trade deficit and engagement with China as key irritants to him and 
his followers. He also pledged not to involve America in a foreign 
war ``unless our country is attacked or our vital interests are 
imperiled.''

Trump said he would decide early next year whether to pursue the 
Reform Party nomination. Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan left 
the GOP today to seek the Reform nod. Trump, who yesterday called 
Buchanan ``a Hitler lover,'' said the decision by the conservative 
commentator had no impact on his move.

	Rhode Island Sen. Chafee Dies

<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- John Chafee, Rhode Island's longtime  
Republican senator and former governor who earned praise even from 
Democrats for his moderate stance, has died. He was 77. Chafee died 
of heart failure last night at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, 
a spokesman said. Chafee had announced earlier this year that he 
would not seek a fifth Senate term in 2000. His son Lincoln is 
seeking the seat. There was no immediate word on who will fill his 
Senate seat. Under state law, it is up to the governor to appoint

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today dismissed House  
Republicans' call for an across-the-board spending cut as ``a bad 
idea'' and said that it was at odds with the special interest 
spending that lawmakers have woven into federal spending bills. 
President Clinton vetoed a $792 billion tax cut passed by Congress 
in September. Spokesman Joe Lockhart was reacting to a new House 
proposal for a 1.4 percent across the board cut in spending. 
Meanwhile, Republicans accused the White House of holding hostage a 
bill funding the Defense Department in order to gain leverage for 
administrative initiatives, such as teacher hiring and funding for 
more community police officers.

denunciations of McCaffrey's tough policy on drugs. McCaffrey is 
beginning a four-nation European tour. He maintains cocaine is not 
a soft drug, and that Europeans should do more to block the flow of 
drugs of Latin America. The group organizing the protest said it 
feared McCaffrey's visit reflected a hardening stance by the 
government against drugs. Transform supports the legalization of 
marijuana, but stops short of calling for the decriminalization of 
all drugs.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mostly Down; Dow Off 120 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower Monday as reviving  
fears of rising interest rates distracted investors from the latest 
stream of good news about corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 120.32 to close at  
10,349.93, having edged back from a loss of as much as 155 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators contained their slide. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 fell 8.02 to 1,293.63, and the Nasdaq composite index 
fell 0.57 to 2,815.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose as  
high as 6.40 percent from 6.34 percent late Friday. Analysts said 
bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from yields, were 
hurt by a European Central Bank official's suggestion that the 
European economy is solid, but in danger of succumbing to rising 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning rang familiar with U.S. investors, who fear the  
Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to cool the robust 
growth of the U.S. economy. Yields on bonds, which are highly 
sensitive to inflation, have reached their highest levels since 
Oct. 1997, drawing some investors away from stocks in favor of the 
fixed returns available on bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds are providing tough competition for returns on  
equities,'' said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First 
Advisors in New York. ``That's especially true in a nervous, 
insecure market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of rising rates and higher inflation have kept stocks  
off-balance for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead, equity markets need a recovery, or a least a  
stabilization in the bond market'' before stocks can make another 
run at the record levels reached this summer, said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. Bonds 
eventually made a slight recovery, bringing the yield to 6.35 
percent in late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, several regional Fed officials including chairman  
Alan Greenspan will be on the road, delivering speeches that are 
sure to draw heavy scrutiny as investors seek guidance on the 
central bank's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate earnings have been the only real distraction from the  
interest rate watch, but a long list of profit reports Monday 
provided only a modest spark to trading.

<HEADLINE> Bush Courts Hispanics in Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, touting a  
``fresh start for America,'' unveiled his initial wave of campaign 
commercials Monday, including newspaper and radio spots courting 
Hispanic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides unveiled a package of four television commercials that  
will begin airing in Iowa and New Hampshire on Tuesday, spots in 
which Bush uses folksy settings to pledge tax cuts, a focus on 
education and saving Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't mention any rivals and promises to avoid ``mud  
throwing and name calling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are sick of that kind of campaigning,'' Bush says in  
one of the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides declined ``for strategic reasons'' to disclose the amount  
being spent on the initial advertising drive, but the intensity 
level in Iowa could cost about $50,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign aides said the television campaign ``is a mid-sized  
one,'' with the average person in Iowa and New Hampshire seeing the 
spots three to five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is not an issue for Bush, because he's raised far more  
than any of his rivals and is not subject to state spending limits 
because he has declined federal matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rival Steve Forbes has been running campaign commercials for  
weeks, and also has refrained from attacking his rivals. 
Nevertheless, Bush aides are worried about the slashing assaults 
that Forbes ran in the last election cycle. The wealthy publisher 
also is unfettered by spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush television spots feature shots of Bush walking in a  
parade, speaking from the stump and mingling with children in 
school classrooms. Two of the spots close with images of Bush 
hugging his wife, Laura. 
</P>
<P>
	An underlying theme running through all is that Bush claims he  
wants to run an upbeat campaign without criticizing his rivals. One 
commercial features images of a casually dressed Bush relaxing on a 
couch and making the point that voters are tired of constant 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they want to hear is what's on people's minds and where  
the candidates' hearts are,'' said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP rival Sen. John McCain, campaigning Monday in California,  
said he found Bush's ad buy a ``bit curious'' given that Bush 
previously has said voters haven't tuned into the presidential 
campaigns as yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he'll realize that people really are probably more  
interested in debates than they are in paid political 
commercials,'' said McCain, referring to Bush's reluctance to 
debate his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the commercials would augment the organizational work  
being done in the two key early states. Iowa's leadoff precinct 
caucuses are Jan. 24, followed eight days later by the New 
Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign previewed the commercials for rank-and-file  
Republican House members in Washington, as well, at a session with 
Karl Rove, the governor's chief strategist. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was the first opportunity many Republicans had to  
talk personally with a senior campaign aide since Bush's highly 
publicized criticism of a GOP budget proposal. According to one 
lawmaker in attendance, Rove told Republicans that Bush personally 
disagreed with the approach they were contemplating with the Earned 
Income Tax Credit. Under the EITC, the working poor receive a 
government subsidy, and Republican lawmakers had considered turning 
the lump-sum payment into a series of monthly checks. 
</P>
<P>
	While a few lawmakers expressed unhappiness about Bush's public  
disagreement on the issue, others in the room emphasized that Bush 
did not make a habit of trying to undercut congressional 
Republicans, this lawmaker added. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides also unveiled a 60-second radio commercial and  
newspaper ads being run in Spanish-language publications in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a tremendous outreach,'' said media adviser  
Stuart Stevens. ``You're not going to see a campaign where we're 
running a different campaign on the ground than on the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish commercial notes ``the spotlight is on Iowa.'' It  
adds, ``And for the first time it's shining on the Latino 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanic voters make up less than 2 percent of the Iowa  
electorate, they represent 11 percent of the nation's voters, and 
an even higher percentage in California, Texas, Illinois, New York 
and Florida, the five biggest electoral states. 
</P>
<P>
	Paying attention to Hispanics in key early states isn't lost on  
voters around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Sosa, who helped produce the Spanish spots, said the  
strategists were expanding on the organizational focus in important 
early states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor can't look at every single Iowan,'' Sosa said.  
``There are too many Iowans and only one candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Banks Gets Start As Ravens' QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick  
today named Tony Banks his starting quarterback for Sunday's game 
against the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks replaces Stoney Case, who struggled in his past two games  
after leading Baltimore to two straight victories upon replacing an 
ineffective Scott Mitchell. Banks relieved Case last Thursday in 
the Ravens' embarrassing 35-8 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Case went 15-for-37 in that game and threw three interceptions,  
two of which were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks was obtained in the offseason in a trade with the St.  
Louis Rams. He began the season as the Ravens' third-string 
quarterback behind Mitchell and Case. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, who started 43 games for St. Louis in three seasons, now  
becomes Billick's third starting quarterback in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick delayed making the decision until he was certain that  
Banks would be the right quarterback to turn around a two-game skid 
that has dropped the Ravens' record to 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Case had one NFL start in four seasons before this year. He has  
yet to complete 50 percent of his passes in a game and has six 
interceptions against just three touchdown throws. His inexperience 
was on full display for a national audience Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just played terribly,'' Case admitted after the game. ``I  
want the opportunity to come back, but that's the coach's 
decision.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Gov. Apologizes for Blackface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gov. Mel Carnahan apologized Monday  
for appearing in blackface at a minstrel show 39 years ago, and 
lashed out at Republicans for unearthing a 1960 photo of the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've grown,'' said Carnahan, a Democrat who is  
challenging Republican Sen. John Ashcroft for his Senate seat in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly regret my participation in this kind of theater,  
and I sincerely and readily apologize for my insensitivity of 39 
years ago,'' the 65-year-old governor added. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he should be judged on his record, including  
legislative sponsorship of a state civil rights law in 1965 and the 
appointment of the first black Missouri Supreme Court judge in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That judge, Ronnie White, was rejected for a federal judgeship  
on Oct. 5 after Ashcroft told the Senate that White was soft on the 
death penalty and ``pro-criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan accused Ashcroft, stung by allegations of racism for  
his role in defeating White's nomination, of responsibility for 
circulating the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Ashcroft is counting on Missourians to be unable to  
see any difference between the insensitivity captured in this 
photograph four decades ago and the polarizing acts he committed on 
the Senate floor just days ago,'' Carnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton had no comment about Carnahan's  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, who was elected governor in 1992 with substantial  
black support, said Monday that he had called black leaders to 
apologize. He would not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the Missouri GOP, John Hancock, said  
research turned up the photo in the Rolla Daily News, the 
governor's hometown paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock denied having any hand in distributing the photo. A  
glossy print of the photograph and a copy of the clipping dated 
Oct. 12, 1960, were provided to The Associated Press Sunday by a 
Republican source on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo shows Carnahan, then 26; his older brother, Bob; and  
two other men performing as a barbershop quartet at a Kiwanis Club 
fund-raiser. The menwore tuxedos and blackface makeup with 
exaggerated white circles around their eyes and mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he was ``uncomfortable'' about wearing blackface  
at the time, but was the newest member of the group and didn't 
challenge the costume. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back, that's what I wished I'd done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said the minstrel shows were a longtime tradition in  
Rolla, but he never again wore blackface after the 1960s show and 
his brother, Bob, moved to end the blackface performances after 
that show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said we ought not to be doing that sort of thing,'' Bob  
Carnahan, 73, said in telephone interview Monday. ``Obviously it 
was racial, and I told the club I couldn't participate in the 
minstrel show anymore and didn't think our quartet should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missourians interviewed at St. Louis Union Station said they  
weren't perturbed by the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so old,'' said Scott Jackson, 20, who is white.  
</P>
<P>
	Latascha Bond, 18, who is black, plans to vote for the first  
time next year and said she wasn't dissuaded from casting her 
Senate ballot for Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did this in 1960,'' she said. ``That doesn't mean he'll do  
it in 1999.''

<HEADLINE> Ricky Makes Ditka Happy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Ricky Williams showed why Mike  
Ditka was willing to give up an entire draft to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka's New Orleans Saints, on the other hand, demonstrated  
Sunday why Ricky wasn't worth eight draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to see Ricky do what we want him to do,'' Ditka said  
following a 1-minute, 20-second postgame news conference after the 
Saints were routed 31-3 by the New York Giants. ``But that's about 
the only good things we got to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Sunday's game demonstrated the flawed thinking that  
went into the Saints' selection of Williams, who until Sunday had 
played hurt all season. The Saints were absolutely horrible, so was 
Ditka's coaching, and the idea expounded by Ditka that Williams was 
the missing piece of a Super Bowl puzzle seemed simply ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even an asterisk to Williams' 111 yards in 24 carries,  
his first 100-yard game as a pro for a team that's now 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty of the yards came in the second half, 30 minutes of  
garbage time after New York had taken a 24-3 lead and was perfectly 
content to play looser and let Williams run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	But had it been a close game, then what? Emmitt Smith, who has a  
lot more NFL yards than Ricky has, was held to 26 on 22 carries 
last Monday in the Giants' 13-10 win over Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was even more about Ditka and time management.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, leading Tennessee 10-0, the Saints had a  
first-and-goal with 12 seconds left until halftime and no timeouts 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of throwing into the end zone, then kicking a field goal  
if he had to, Ditka ran Williams into the middle of the line. He 
got stuffed, the clock ran out, and Ditka made an obscene gesture 
and shouted an obscenity at the fans as he walked off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he grabbed his crotch as he was heckled by fans as he  
left the field. All that got him was a $20,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of dubious coaching decisions Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the Saints' best play was an option pass on which Eddie  
Kennison got 20 yards behind the Giants defense. But the coaches 
who called it didn't do their homework -- running back Lamar Smith's 
pass was thrown into what is known as ``Death Valley'' at the 
Meadowlands because of the wind that dropped the ball 10 yards 
short of Kennison. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse was time management, or lack thereof.  
</P>
<P>
	With 1:03 left in the first half, Kent Graham threw a 27-yard  
touchdown pass to Amani Toomer to give the Giants a 17-3 lead. 
Nice, but not insurmountable, even though New York has one of the 
NFL's better defenses and the Saints had their second-string Billy 
Joe (Tolliver) at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints took the kickoff back to their 35, but ran on first  
down. Michael Strahan dropped Smith for a 5-yard loss. Instead of 
settling for a two-touchdown deficit and adjusting at halftime, 
Ditka called timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	The next two plays were incomplete passes and the Saints punted,  
pushing the Giants back to their 22. 
</P>
<P>
	With 27 seconds left, Tiki Barber went up the middle for 9 yards  
and it was third-and-1 at the Giants 31. The Saints called a 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't really going for much,'' New York coach Jim Fassel  
said. ``But when we got that timeout and it was third-and-1, we 
figured we might as well try to get into position to try a Hail 
Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guess what?  
</P>
<P>
	Graham's 4-yard quarterback sneak got the ball to the 35, an  
offside penalty on New Orleans' La'Roi Glover moved the ball to the 
40 and Graham got 7 more on a pass to Barber. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Giants tried the play that succeeds perhaps one time in  
50. It succeeded, Joe Jurevicius taking a deflection of Graham's 
bomb in stride for the TD that made it 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Game over.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK, it was my fault,'' Ditka muttered later. ``So what? Maybe  
we could have moved into field goal range. What would the score 
have been then? 31-6?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal that brought in Williams instead of a quarterback  
around whom to rebuild isn't working. The Saints are 1-5 headed for 
4-12. And Ditka seems headed back into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the word of one of the team's best players, perennial Pro  
Bowl offensive tackle William Roaf, who's been a Saints stalwart 
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of losing. So tired of losing,'' Roaf said as he sat  
on a stool in the locker room, his head hanging. 
</P>
<P>
	``My rookie year, we started 5-0 and that's about it. And you  
know what? This team has more talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear what Roaf wouldn't say next:  
</P>
<P>
	Except at coach.

<HEADLINE> U.N. OKs Peace Troops for E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council voted unanimously  
today to authorize the United Nations to take control of East Timor 
during its transition to independence and deploy more than 9,000 
U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations will take over the administration of East  
Timor, probably for two or three years, to rebuild its shattered 
infrastructure and set its 800,000 people on the road to democracy 
before independence from Indonesia is declared. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. troops are expected to replace a 15-nation force that the  
council dispatched to East Timor last month to restore order after 
pro-Indonesian militias went on the rampage following the 
overwhelming independence vote by the territory's people on Aug. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is the dawn of a new era for both the United Nations and  
East Timor,'' said Britain's deputy U.N. ambassador, Stewart Eldon, 
whose country piloted the resolution through the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations, he said, faces a severe test of not only  
rebuilding East Timor but establishing a legal, judicial, and 
administration that it will carry into independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job must also be done right,'' Eldon said. ``That means  
that the resources of the entire U.N. system -- including the funds, 
programs and international financial institutions -- must be 
mobilized. And the East Timorese people must be fully involved in 
every step of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary-General for Peacekeeping Bernard Miyet estimated  
the first year's cost of the U.N. operation in East Timor at 
between $700 million and $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Several countries, including Japan, South Korea and Brazil  
pledged additional support for the U.N. mission, but gave no 
specific figures. China said it planned to contribute personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the council voted to send a 6,000-member U.N.  
peacekeeping force to Sierra Leone to help restore peace in the 
African nation after an eight-year civil war. That operation will 
also be costly, though no estimates have been given yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries called for the immediate deployment of the U.N.  
force in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will establish the mission as quickly as we can,''  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution authorizes a 9,150-member U.N. peacekeeping  
force, including 200 military observers, to replace the 
Australian-led international force. A 1,640-member international 
police force will also be sent to the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations sent a mission to East Timor after Indonesia  
and Portugal agreed May 5 to let the territory hold a 
U.N.-supervised ballot on its future. Indonesia invaded East Timor, 
a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, then annexed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the looting, burning and killing spree by the  
pro-Indonesian militias after the Aug. 30 ballot, all but a few 
U.N. staff left the East Timorese capital. Many have returned since 
the deployment of the mutinational force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council resolution expresses concern at reports of  
widespread human rights violations and calls on all parties to 
cooperate with investigations. It also stresses that Indonesia is 
responsible to ensure the safe return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's deputy U.N. ambassador, Makmur Widodo, said his  
government ``is deeply concerned at the exaggerated and often 
unjustified allegations of human rights violations'' in East Timor. 
He said all allegations will be investigated by an Indonesian 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Indonesia's assembly ratified the result of the  
August vote, paving the way for East Timor's official handover to 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor will have  
overall responsibility for administering East Timor and will be 
empowered to exercise all legislative and executive authority, 
including the justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	It will consult with East Timorese representatives to help  
create democratic institutions, including an independent human 
rights institution.

<HEADLINE> Learjet Found Flying Out of Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- A Learjet with five people aboard flew  
over the nation's heartland today apparently without a pilot at the 
controls. Authorities scrambled to figure out what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that I can confirm is that there is a Learjet  
in distress,'' Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Tony 
Molinaro said in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The aircraft left Orlando, Fla., this morning bound for  
Dallas. The last communication we had is that it was over 
Gainesville, Fla.,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said authorities  
believe five people were on board though she wouldn't say who they 
were. The plane was believed to be over South Dakota around midday, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't speculate on what may or may not have happened,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Exercise May Reduce Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Women who exercise an hour a day or more may  
reduce their risk of breast cancer by 20 percent, according to one 
of the biggest studies ever done on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, published in Monday's Archives of Internal  
Medicine, add to the growing evidence that exercise can help 
prevent breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller 1997 study in Norway found that women who exercised at  
least four hours a week were about a third less likely to get 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the evidence suggests that there's nothing to lose by  
women being physically active,'' said Beverly Rockhill, lead author 
of the most recent study and a researcher at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe exercise may affect breast cancer because it  
lowers the level of estrogen circulating in a woman's body. 
Estrogen has been found to stimulate breast cell growth, increasing 
the chances of cancer, Rockhill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study was based on the analysis of questionnaires  
from 121,701 women nationwide who participated in the Nurses' 
Health Study, a long-term health survey of women ages 30 to 55. 
Rockhill and her colleagues looked at data from 1980 to 1994. They 
found 3,137 cases of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty percent fewer women who exercised an average of once a  
day or more got breast cancer, compared with those who exercised 
less than an hour a week. The exercise included brisk walking and 
jogging but not things like housework or gardening. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Brinton, chief of the environmental epidemiology branch  
at the National Cancer Institute, said the findings are more likely 
to be accurate than some other studies because the women were asked 
about their exercise habits when they were actually exercising. 
Other studies have asked participants to remember how active they 
were in the past.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Mitsubishi May Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Major Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  
said Tuesday it will cut 9,900 more jobs in a bid to boost 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Mitsubishi Motors's total work force will be  
reduced to 78,900 employees from 88,800 last year, for a reduction 
of 11 percent, the company said in a release. The cuts will be 
carried out by March 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The reductions will be achieved mainly through attrition,  
including reducing the number of new hires and utilizing early 
retirement programs offering special benefits, said a Mitsubishi 
spokesman who gave only his surname, Sekino. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's fourth-largest automaker,  
is the latest in a wave of corporate restructuring announced by 
some of Japan's top companies amid a long economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Sekino said the new cuts were part of an ongoing restructuring  
program. In fiscal year 1998, the company reduced 2,500 jobs. 
Tuesday's announced cuts will bring the total to 12,400, or 13.6 
percent of Mitsubishi's global work force, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with poor sales in Japan and the rest of Asia, Mitsubishi  
posted its first-ever earnings loss on a group, or consolidated, 
basis in the fiscal year ended March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company then began implementing its restructuring program.  
Mitsubishi rebounded to a slight profit the following fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Japan's second-largest automaker, Nissan  
Motor Co., announced it will trim 21,000 employees worldwide, or 14 
percent of its group work force. Earlier this year, Renault SA of 
France obtained a 36.8-percent stake in Nissan.

<HEADLINE> Braves Left With Cone-Headache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- David Cone knew this might have been goodbye.  
</P>
<P>
	Turns out, the Atlanta Braves could be saying so long, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Cone befuddled the Braves on Sunday night, allowing one hit in  
seven shutout innings as the Yankees beat Atlanta 7-2 for a 2-0 
World Series lead. And then he admitted this could have been his 
final start in pinstripes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it's gone through my mind,'' he said. ``It's a  
possibility because the Yankees have some tough decisions to make, 
I put it out of my mind for now. All that matters is right here and 
right now. It's pretty unpredictable when you play for the 
Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone is the team's voice. Probably its heart, too. Whenever  
there's turmoil or trouble, he is the first one whose opinion is 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have trouble visualizing a clubhouse without David Cone,''  
Yankees manager Joe Torre said before the game. ``He means so much 
to this ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone then went out on a 49-degree night -- the type of cold  
that's supposed to harm his game -- and pitched the best of his 18 
postseason starts. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for Greg Myers' single up the middle on a 1-1 pitch  
leading off the fifth, he would have been in position to join Don 
Larsen as the only pitchers to throw postseason no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't really around the plate a lot,'' Myers said. ``He'll  
throw you anything, anytime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept the Braves off balance, pitching with no less than a  
three-run lead. After Atlanta got a runner on third in the first 
due to his throwing error, Cone retired Brian Jordan on a flyout to 
the left-field warning track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I caught a break with Jordan's ball,'' Cone said.  
``That's easily a home run on a warmer day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta didn't get another runner in scoring position until the  
seventh, when he threw a called third strike past Andruw Jones with 
runners at the corners and two outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``David kept the ball down really good tonight,'' Braves manager  
Bobby Cox said. ``He had breaking stuff. He wasn't overpowering at 
all. He didn't throw that hard, but his ball was sinking like 
crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He walked five and threw just 60 of 109 pitches for strikes. But  
it will be remembered as much as his start in Game 3 of the 1996 
World Series. The Yankees were down 0-2 after losing the first two 
games at home, and Cone allowed one run and four hits in six 
innings as New York beat the Braves 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walks the tightrope every once in a while,'' Torre said.  
``Why doesn't he just start out of the stretch? It looked like he 
had better rhythm out of the stretch than winding up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the big-game wins, Cone's Yankees career remains year to  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 20-7 last season, Cone didn't know whether he'd  
re-sign with the Yankees until Nov. 11, when they gave him an $8 
million, one-year deal that included $1.7 million in performance 
bonuses he wound up earning. 
</P>
<P>
	He understands the concern. He had an aneurysm near his right  
armpit in 1996 and shoulder surgery in 1997. While he went 9-4 with 
a 2.86 ERA in the first half of this season, he slumped to 3-5 with 
a 4.28 ERA in the second half, causing Torre to give him extra 
rest, thinking the 36-year-old's right arm was tired. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extra rest,'' Cone said, ``has really helped me in terms  
of putting some life back into my arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is Cone who usually puts life into the Yankees. They went  
20-11 during his starts. Now, if he only would stop worrying about 
his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things,'' Torre said, ``have a way of working themselves  
out.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bond Prices End Unchanged / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices recovered from early trading losses  
attributed to interest rates worries in Europe to finish little 
changed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was barely  
changed. Its yield nudged up to 6.35 percent from 6.34 percent late 
Friday. Earlier Monday, yields rose as high as 6.40 percent, a 
level last seen two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were hurt by a European Central Bank official's  
suggestion that the European economy is solid, but in danger of 
succumbing to rising inflation, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning rang familiar with U.S. investors, who fear the  
Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to cool the robust 
growth of the U.S. economy. Yields on bonds, which are highly 
sensitive to inflation, have reached their highest levels since 
October 1997, drawing some investors away from stocks in favor of 
the fixed returns available on bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices were unchanged for short-term and  
intermediate treasury securities, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.13 percent as the  
discount rose 0.07 percentage point from Friday to 4.99 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.31 percent, as the discount rose 0.05 
percentage point to 5.10 percent. One-year yields were 5.50 percent 
as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 5.21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.18 3/4 percent from 5.06 1/4 percent on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/4 point to 108 9/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 6.15 percent from 6.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Study: Neanderthals Lived Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The youngest Neanderthal bones ever found show  
that the primitive hominid and modern humans coexisted in central 
Europe for thousands of years, a discovery supporting the theory 
that the two groups could have mated. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the Proceedings of the National  
Academy of Sciences, researchers report that radiocarbon dating of 
Neanderthal bones found in a cave in Croatia have yielded dates of 
28,000 to 29,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred H. Smith, an anthropologist at Northern Illinois  
University, said the new find is the strongest evidence yet that 
the primitive Neanderthal lived at the same time and in the same 
area in Europe as did modern human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it supports the theory advanced by some experts that  
Neanderthals and modern humans mated, producing children that 
shared genes of the two species. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals, a primitive hominid with prominent brow, coarse  
jaw, short lower limbs and a bony bun at the back of the skull, are 
thought to have arisen in Africa more than 250,000 years ago. They 
are believed to have appeared in Europe about 100,000 years ago and 
eventually were replaced by modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Specimens for modern humans dated at 90,000 to 100,000 years  
have been found in Africa and in the Middle East. Modern human 
bones found in central Europe have been dated at about 32,000 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Neanderthal age dates are based on material removed from  
a jawbone and a skull bone found in the Croatian cave. The 
specimens had earlier been dated at 45,000 years using a gamma ray 
counter. The new dates of 28,000 to 29,000 were determined using a 
more accurate method called accelerator radiocarbon dating, which 
measures the level of a carbon isotope in the specimen. 
</P>
<P>
	The new dates for the Neanderthal, said Smith, mean ``there was  
an overlap of 3,000 to 4,000 years'' with modern humans in central 
Europe and that it is likely that mating occurred and created 
hybrid children. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he and others believe that there are body features in  
bones from 30,000-year-old human specimens that suggest a 
Neanderthal contribution to the European gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Trinkaus of Washington University at St. Louis, a co-author  
of the study, said the remains of a human child found in Portugal 
included features in the legs, arms, teeth and skull that resemble 
those of the Neanderthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Portuguese specimen shows that an admixture did occur in  
Portugal and could very well have occurred elsewhere,'' said 
Trinkaus. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixing of modern humans and Neanderthals is a controversial  
issue among anthropologists, and Clark Howell of the University of 
California, Berkeley, said not many agree with Smith and Trinkaus. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell said the new dates found by Smith and Trinkaus ``are not  
surprising'' and do prove that Neanderthals and modern humans may 
have lived in Central Europe at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there is no widely accepted evidence that the  
primitive hominids and modern humans actually mated and produced 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could argue that they lived apart in the same area and  
threw rocks at each other instead of genes,'' Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes the characteristics in the modern human  
skeletons that Trinkaus and Smith attribute to Neanderthal are 
actually within the range of normal variations for humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the issue may eventually be settled by genetic  
testing. Some DNA has been recovered from ancient bones, he said, 
and researchers in Sweden are attempting to compare gene fragments 
from Neanderthals to that of modern humans.

<HEADLINE> Stewart's Wife Followed TV Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- Payne Stewart's brother-in-law said  
Tuesday that the golfer's wife, Australia native Tracey Ferguson, 
followed TV reports as her husband's plane flew out of control 
across the heartland of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Ferguson, a professional golfer and Tracey's brother, said  
he had received the news from another sister in Brisbane who had 
been talking by telephone to Tracey at her home in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was saying that basically, that Payne was in this plane  
that was traveling out of control through the airspace in America 
and she was watching it on TV, which is pretty bad,'' Ferguson told 
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was trying to ring him on his mobile and couldn't raise  
him. It's just really bad for my sister to be watching it on CNN, 
knowing that it was her husband on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was believed that the people aboard the plane, including  
Stewart, had lost consciousness after a decompression in the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson described Stewart as a ``great guy'' and ``one of the  
best players in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracey Ferguson had met her husband while traveling in Asia and  
married him 15 years ago. They have two children, Chelsea, 14, and 
Aaron, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	It's barely a year since Tracey Ferguson had to cope with the  
death of close friend Renay Appleby, late wife of Australian 
touring pro Stuart Appleby who was killed in a accident in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was devastated because Renay and her were really close,''  
Australian golfer Robert Allenby told Australian Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both being Australian, they got on really well. She found it  
so difficult to come to terms with that and now a year later her 
husband dies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So close-knit is the Australian sports community in Orlando  
that, according to Allenby, Natasha Woodbridge, on hearing the 
news, flew back immediately from Germany, where her husband Todd 
Woodbridge is playing a tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson said he had been unable to make contact with his sister  
but the family was making arrangements to attend Stewart's funeral.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Bush Ad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	An analysis of George W. Bush's package of four television  
commercials opening his advertising effort in the 2000 presidential 
campaign: 
</P>
<P>
	TITLES: ``Successful Leader,'' ``Hopeful,'' ``Priorities'' and  
``Every Child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LENGTH: 30 seconds each.  
</P>
<P>
	PRODUCER: Maverick Media.  
</P>
<P>
	AIRING: Iowa and New Hampshire.  
</P>
<P>
	SCRIPT ONE: Announcer: ``He's been hailed as the Republican  
Party's best hope to win the White House. As governor, he signed 
the two biggest tax cuts in Texas history. He reduced the growth of 
state government spending to the lowest in 40 years. He improved 
the public schools by restoring local control, raising standards 
and returning to basics. He cut welfare rolls in half, reduced junk 
lawsuits and cut juvenile crime 38 percent. George W. Bush. A 
compassionate conservative leader. A fresh start for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SCRIPT TWO: Bush: ``I think there's a lot of cynicism in America  
because of broken promises. I believe most people expect the best 
out of elected officials and when elected officials disappoint 
them, it creates a cynical environment. Secondly, I believe often 
times campaigns resort to mud throwing and name calling. And 
Americans are sick of that type of campaigning. What they want to 
hear is what's on people's minds and where the candidates' hearts 
are. I'm going to run a campaign that is hopeful and optimistic and 
very positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SCRIPT THREE: Bush: ``I believe government should do a few  
things and do them well. My top priorities will be to preserve 
Social Security and Medicare and to strengthen education and our 
military. I believe that once top priorities have been funded we 
should pass money back to the taxpayers. That's what I've done in 
Texas. I signed the two largest tax cuts in our state's history, 
and we still have no personal income tax. I believe we ought to cut 
tax rates to continue economic growth and to broaden prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SCRIPT FOUR: Bush: ``We should make this solemn commitment: That  
every child will be educated. As president, I will give states and 
local school districts more authority and flexibility, and 
encourage them to measure results for every child. I will challenge 
failure with charters and choice. And I will change Head Start to 
teach our youngest children phonics and reading. Every child must 
be educated. Because there are no second-rate children and no 
second-rate dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IMAGES: The spots dealing with negative campaigning and Social  
Security and economics feature Bush speaking directly into the 
camera, lounging casually on a couch in one and dressed more 
formally in a business suit in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other two spots, the images of Bush talking about  
education about are interspersed with scenes heavy with children, 
in classrooms, playgrounds and playing in the street. He also uses 
scenes from parades and talking on the stump in Texas, as well as 
images of seniors sitting around card tables talking. 
</P>
<P>
	ANALYSIS: The theme running through all the commercials is that  
voters want to hear candidates talk about issues and not rip into 
each other. Republican rival Steve Forbes is also running 
commercials, and has not attacked the front-running Bush, though 
some Bush strategists worry that might happen. He also sticks to 
mainstream issues popular with independent voters, such as 
bolstering education, and protecting Social Security. There's a 
clear reference to the troubles faced by President Clinton in 
running White House scandals, when one spot promises ``A fresh 
start for America.'' Two of the spots draw unspoken distinctions 
with the White House sex scandals by ending with Bush hugging his 
wife, Laura.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Judge Arraigned on Drug Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A judge has been released on $10,000 bail  
after being arraigned on charges of drug use, including shooting 
heroin in her chambers and protecting her dealer in exchange for 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Dauer released District Judge Gigi Sullivan on  
bail, contingent on her completing a drug treatment program. 
Prosecutors had requested $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Patrick Thomassey, said Ms. Sullivan was in the  
treatment program last week when Attorney General Mike Fisher 
announced the charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that Ms. Sullivan, 38, has had ``a long history  
of prescription drug abuse,'' but made no comment Monday about 
other accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge set a preliminary hearing for Nov. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Fisher issued the charges against the judge, accusing  
her of using heroin, cocaine and prescription drugs. Fisher alleged 
that she accepted drugs in exchange for dismissing cases against 
her supplier and other dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also accused of possession of heroin and cocaine, kiting  
a $2,000 check and accepting bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania, district justices sit as magistrates, holding  
preliminary hearings, ruling on minor crimes and issuing 
protection-from-abuse orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sullivan, a Democrat, is up for election to a second,  
six-year term on Nov. 2, facing Republican David Sosovicka, despite 
the fact that she has been ordered not to hear cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's still on the ballot for district magistrate,'' Thomassey  
said. ``These are just allegations. She is not convicted. She'll 
remain on the ballot and maybe be elected. Wouldn't that be 
something?''

<HEADLINE> Alliance Boosts Disabled Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Twenty-one U.S. companies, led by  
Microsoft Corp., have formed an alliance with the National Business 
and Disabilities Council to increase job opportunities for people 
with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said Monday that the companies  
taking part in the Able To Work program will share their expertise 
to promote hiring of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has also launched a Web site, Abletowork.org, to  
share information on available jobs and job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said unemployment among working-age people with  
disabilities is higher than 70 percent, making them the most 
underutilized segment of America's workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Businesses in virtually every industry, the technology  
industry not excepted, are struggling today to find enough 
qualified applicants to fill open jobs,'' Gates said in a speech to 
the NBDC annual chief executive conference, held at Microsoft's 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this in mind, and with a strong belief that accessible  
technology can be part of the solution, Microsoft conceived of Able 
To Work to raise awareness of the value in recruiting and hiring 
people with disabilities, and to provide concrete tools and 
information to help businesses understand and tap into this 
workforce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Microsoft, companies taking part include Johnson  
&AMP; Johnson, Ford, IBM, Caterpillar, MBNA, Bank of America, Safeco, 
Lucent, NCR, Merrill Lynch, AT&AMP;T and Honeywell.

	More than that, though, Jacobsen said Stewart's love of golf and  
its traditions should also be remembered.

<P>
	``He had a real reverence for the game,'' Jacobsen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard, who played with Stewart in a losing alternate  
shot match against Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik in the Ryder 
Cup, had to go inside and compose himself after nearly breaking

</P>
<P>
	Stewart was the emotional leader of the U.S. Ryder Cup team, who  
wore his patriotism and pride to play for his country on his sleeve 
and urged his fellow players to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also Stewart who made all his teammates play ping-pong at  
night to relieve their stress and make them bond together as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tense up there. It was something that gave you a  
nice little release,'' U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw said. ``Payne was 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw said Stewart was ``very much a believer in playing for  
his country, very much a patriot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't only the American players who mourned Stewart, though.  
Members of Europe's Ryder Cup team, gathered in Jerez, Spain, for 
the Volvo Masters, were also devastated by the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal fought back tears as he  
remembered Stewart as a ``true sportsman on the course and a 
gentleman off it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew what the Ryder Cup meant to him, but he never lost  
perspective on what the match was all about,'' Olazabal said. ``We 
have lost a precious man and someone who still had good years ahead 
of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France's Jean Van de Velde agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated, totally devastated. It certainly puts into  
perspective little things like missed putts,'' Van de Velde said. 
``My thoughts go to his family because he was such a family man. He 
was a wonderful sportsman and wonderful person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the golf world, there was also reaction. Stewart was a  
big Orlando Magic fan, and former Magic guard Penny Hardaway knew 
him well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the guys in Florida are devastated right now,''  
Hardaway said from Phoenix. ``I knew his family. I've been to his 
home. He's given me golf clubs. He's one of those guys you either 
love or hate, and I loved him because you always knew where he 
stood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's most indelible public image may be of his hands in the  
air in the early evening at Pinehurst earlier this year, when he 
made a 15-foot putt on the 18th green to win the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be what Crenshaw remembers most, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will always remember that smile and that laugh and that  
beautiful, graceful swing,'' he said. ``It's hard to believe we're 
not going to watch that effortless swing anymore.''

<HEADLINE>  Friends Remember Payne Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Through their shock and sadness, Payne Stewart's friends and  
competitors remembered him Monday as far more than just a golfer in 
funny clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	To them, he was a giant of the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``What a wonderful man. He was a great credit to golf and to our  
country,'' said Billy Casper. ``Golf lost a great man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greats of the past and present, stunned at Stewart's tragic  
death, joined to praise him both for his conquests on the course 
and the way he conducted his life off it.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mostly Down; Dow Off 120 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower today as reviving  
fears of rising interest rates distracted investors from the latest 
stream of good news about corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 120.32 at 10,349.93, having edged back from a loss 
of as much as 155 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators finished with much more modest losses.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 8.02 to 1,293.63, and the Nasdaq  
composite index fell 0.58 to 2,815.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,850 down, 1,201 up and 503 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 765.63 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
951.92 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.93 to 417.76.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose as  
high as 6.40 percent from 6.34 percent late Friday. Analysts said 
bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from yields, were 
hurt by a European Central Bank official's suggestion that the 
European economy is solid, but in danger of succumbing to rising 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning rang familiar with U.S. investors, who fear the  
Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to cool the robust 
growth of the U.S. economy. Yields on bonds, which are highly 
sensitive to inflation, have reached their highest levels since 
Oct. 1997, drawing some investors away from stocks in favor of the 
fixed returns available on bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds are providing tough competition for returns on  
equities,'' said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First 
Advisors in New York. ``That's especially true in a nervous, 
insecure market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of rising rates and higher inflation have kept stocks  
off-balance for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead, equity markets need a recovery, or a least a  
stabilization in the bond market'' before stocks can make another 
run at the record levels reached this summer, said John H. 
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, several regional Fed officials including chairman  
Alan Greenspan will be on the road, delivering speeches that are 
sure to draw heavy scrutiny as investors seek guidance on the 
central bank's sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate earnings have provided the only real distraction from  
the interest rate watch, but a long list of profit reports today 
provided only a modest spark to trading. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T rose after reporting earnings that beat expectations by a  
penny even though revenue growth amid intense price competition for 
long-distance customers. Investors applauded growth in the 
company's wireless communications business, and a strong start for 
AT&AMP;T's 7-cents per minute long-distance program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's oil companies both fell, however, despite profit  
reports that beat analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron fell after reporting earnings of $1.07 per share,  
excluding one-time charges. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial had predicted $1.01 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon also fell. The company earned 61 cents a share, above  
estimates of 59 cents per share, but profit margins fell. Analysts 
also suggested that investors had hoped to see stronger profit 
growth given a rise in oil prices in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks were mostly lower today, following a major leap  
on Friday after Congress neared a deal that would give banks, 
brokerages and insurance companies greater leeway in merging and 
selling each other's services. J.P. Morgan and American Express 
were among the biggest decliners in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Those shares were also hurt by the rising bond yields and the  
fear of higher interest rates. Rising interest rates can cut into 
lending volume as it becomes more expensive to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's relative strength came from the Internet sector.  
Digital Island, a provider of network services, rose sharply after 
agreeing to acquire privately held Sandpiper Networks Inc. for $621 
million. Sandpiper provides management statistics for electronic 
commerce Web sites.

<HEADLINE> Serb, Montenegrin Parties Open Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SVETI STEFAN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ultranationalist Serb allies of  
President Slobodan Milosevic and pro-Western officials of 
Montenegro failed today to agree on the future of the Yugoslav 
federation but agreed to continue discussions amid threats of a new 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have stated different concepts, but we pledged maximal  
effort to try and keep Montenegro and Serbia'' in an association, 
Montenegrin Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic said after 90 minutes of 
talks with members of the Serbian Radical Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller republic is demanding more independence from  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime, which is 
suffering international political and economic isolation after its 
18-month crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the Serb province of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro's leadership, which has called for Yugoslavia to be  
renamed and turned into a loose confederation of two autonomous 
states, has warned it will organize an independence referendum 
unless it gets more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Vujanovic said the Radicals, who are Milosevic's coalition  
partners, ``reiterated their concept of a centralized'' Yugoslavia 
at the meeting at this Montenegrin seaside resort. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if Montenegro's proposal to make Yugoslavia an  
association of ``two equal member states'' fails, Montenegro's 
parliament will have to decide on the republic's future steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomislav Nikolic, who represented the Radical Party during the  
talks, agreed that deep differences emerged but said he was 
optimistic the differences could be overcome with further 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, representatives of Milosevic's Socialist party and  
its neo-Communist allies planned to sit down with officials of 
Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists in Belgrade, the 
federal capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Vujanovic said before today's talks that Montenegro expected  
international support if Serbia rejects its proposal for redefining 
the political relationship between the two Yugoslav republics. The 
proposal would virtually eliminate Belgrade's influence over 
Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has triggered wars in the past decade to try to  
prevent other former Yugoslav republics from leaving the 
federation, and there are fears Montenegro's move could lead to 
another fight. Most recently, a violent Serb crackdown on ethnic 
Albanian separatists in Kosovo ended after NATO intervened with 78 
days of relentless bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Serb officials have said that Montenegro would be free to  
leave if its citizens vote for secession in a referendum. But 
Serbia's vice premier, ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, warned 
last weekend that Montenegro's departure from the federation would 
lead to war. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro itself is divided between pro-independence and  
pro-Serbian camps. Seselj's statement suggested the pro-Serbian 
faction might take up arms to prevent the Montenegrin government 
from declaring independence.

<HEADLINE> Devils Dealing With Elias, Morrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Restricted free-agent forwards  
Patrik Elias and Brendan Morrison abandoned their bids for $1 
million a year contracts and reached tentative agreements with the 
New Jersey Devils on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither party would disclose terms of the contracts that won't  
be signed until the players are deemed by the team to be in 
condition to play in a regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that Morrison will get a one-year deal  
worth $500,000. Elias reportedly agreed to a three-year deal worth 
$650,000 annually, double what he made last season when he had 17 
goals and 33 assists. Morrison had a base salary of about $400,000 
last year when he had 13 goals and 33 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players missed the first eight games this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Once Elias and Morrison sign, the Devils will have to clear two  
places on their 23-man roster. That presents a problem because New 
Jersey only has three players -- Scott Gomez, Brian Rafalski and 
Sergei Nemchinov -- who don't have to clear waivers to be sent to 
the minors. Gomez and Rafalski are playing well. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Elias nor Morrison wanted to say much about their  
holdouts in a telephone conference call Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were Group 2 free agents, meaning New Jersey had the right  
to match any offer they received. However, if they didn't match, 
the Devils would have received from one to five first-round draft 
picks as compensation, with the number determined by the size of 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to look at it as a win-lose situation,'' the  
24-year-old Morrison said. ``Basically all I want to say now is 
I've accepted the deal and I'm ready to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players felt they would be ready to play this weekend. New  
Jersey's next game is Wednesday at home against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't feel like saying much until I sign the  
contract,'' Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough in talks came on Sunday night when their agents  
called Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello and asked for 
face-to-face talks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamoriello met with each player individually and the tentative  
agreements were announced shortly after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Elias and Morrison played briefly in the Czech Republic in  
September in an effort to stay in shape. They have been working out 
at Montclair State University for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	A former University of Michigan player, Morrison won the Hobey  
Baker Award in 1997 as the top college player. Last season was his 
first full one in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Elias has 37 goals and 55 assists in 166 NHL games.

<HEADLINE> Golf Mourns Death of Payne Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Beneath the knickers and tam o'shanter cap that made Payne  
Stewart one of the most recognizable players in golf was a game and 
a passion that made him one of the most respected champions. 
</P>
<P>
	He embodied the spirit of the Ryder Cup, playing on three  
winning teams, yet displayed sportsmanship in the midst of a 
controversial celebration. His 18 victories around the world 
included three major championships, such as his dramatic comeback 
on the final three holes to win the U.S. Open in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was among five people killed Monday when a LearJet he  
was aboard flew uncontrolled for hours and crashed in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an enormous void and emptiness I feel right now,''  
Tiger Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer called Stewart's death ``one of the most terrible  
tragedies of modern-day golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was on his way to Texas, where the Tour Championship in  
Houston awaited the top 30 on the PGA Tour's money list. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour said his spot in the field will not be replaced. A blue  
ribbon was attached to his nameplate in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over  
the death of Payne Stewart,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem 
said. ``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community 
and all of sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart often played practice rounds in regular pants and a hat,  
and not many people recognized him. Once the tournament started, 
however, his presence was unmistakable in traditional golfing garb 
that no one else considered wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's finest moment in a 20-year professional career came on  
Father's Day at Pinehurst No. 2, the famed course in North Carolina 
that became a stage for remarkable drama in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after Stewart lost a four-stroke lead in the final round  
of the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club, he trailed Phil Mickelson by 
one stroke with three holes to play then one-putted the final three 
greens for a stunning victory. 
</P>
<P>
	His 15-foot par putt on the last hole was the longest ever to  
decide the Open in its 105-year history. Stewart thrust his fist in 
the air, an unforgettable image, let out a roar and later broke 
down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great credit to golf and to our country,'' said  
former Masters and U.S. Open champion Billy Casper. ``Golf lost a 
great man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open secured a spot in the Ryder Cup for Stewart, who  
could wear the Stars and Stripes as easily as his knickers. He 
never apologized for his patriotism, something he carried to all 
five of his Ryder Cup appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The knickers were not misleading. Stewart really was a  
traditionalist. His father taught him to dance by having him stand 
on his shoes while he waltzed around the room, and instructed the 
son to be sure to dance with every woman at the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's most cherished memory was the 1982 Quad Cities Open,  
because it was the only victory his father saw. William Stewart 
died in 1985, and when Stewart won the Bay Hill Invitational two 
years later he donated the winner's check to a hospital in his 
father's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stewart had an edge to him at times, and was especially  
surly during an eight-year slump during which he won only once, he 
never lost his respect for golf's traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jan. 30, 1957 in Springfield, Mo., Stewart went to Southern  
Methodist University in Dallas. He graduated with a business degree 
in 1979 and spent two years playing around the world. He met his 
wife, Tracey, while playing in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	They had two children -- Chelsea, 13, and Aaron 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's first breakthrough came in 1989 when he won his first  
major championship, the PGA Championship, at Kemper Lakes outside 
Chicago. Two years later, he won the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He reflected on his career last week before the Disney Classic,  
where he missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when ... I played very poorly and I wasn't  
having fun playing golf, and I didn't want to continue,'' he said. 
``I had a wakeup call to the fact that this is what I'm good at, 
and I'm still good at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of his turnaround was a newfound faith, drawn to church  
through his children. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won more than $11.7 million in a PGA Tour career that  
began in 1980. He was ranked No. 8 in the world and was third on 
this year's money list with just over $2 million.

<HEADLINE> Tips for Avoiding Online Rip-Offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers are expected to spend billions of  
dollars shopping on the Internet this holiday season, and the 
American Bar Association is offering tips on how to avoid getting 
ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to encourage people to shop online but do so in an  
informed manner,'' said Walter Effross, an American University law 
professor and chairman of an ABA panel on electronic commerce. ``If 
you don't feel right about buying a specific product online or from 
a particular Web site ... then maybe you shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA unveiled a Web site -- www.safeshopping.org -- that  
outlines ways consumers can try to minimize their chances of 
running into trouble on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the suggestions:  
</P>
<P>
	--Look for symbols indicating the Web site uses security  
technology to protect purchasers' credit card numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pay by credit card instead of a debit card or check. Using a  
credit card provides more legal protection if a dispute arises. 
</P>
<P>
	--Read the Web site's privacy policy to find out what information  
the seller is gathering from you, whether it sells the information 
to other companies, and how consumers can opt out of such 
information-sharing. People might not want to deal with a Web site 
that lists no privacy policy, the ABA site suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check the ``feedback'' areas of online auction sites, where  
customers discuss their experiences with sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Read the warranty before buying an item and check for limits on  
the company's liability if something goes wrong with the item. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make a printout of the Web page, the item being purchased, the  
warranty and any messages between the buyer and seller. If the date 
doesn't appear on the printouts, add it in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Online shoppers are expected to spend about $9 billion on gifts  
during the coming holiday season, according to the market research 
company Harris Interactive of Rochester, N.Y. The company said 
about one-third of all people with Internet access are expected to 
buy something online this season, compared with about 8 percent 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This holiday season many consumers will go on the Net for the  
first time for shopping,'' said Gail Hillebrand of Consumers Union. 
She said the vast majority of complaints about online transactions 
have been over items bought through Internet auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your instinct tells you you shouldn't buy a diamond ring from  
a roadside vendor,'' said Thomas Vartanian, chairman of the ABA's 
cyberspace law committee, adding that people need to develop the 
same kinds of instincts for shopping online. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to security of credit card numbers, he said people  
need to be alert for ``identity theft,'' in which someone uses 
another person's identity for a variety of transactions, such as 
taking out a loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can put a cop on every computer and we still will not  
eliminate fraud in cyberspace,'' Vartanian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Consumers League has announced its own educational  
campaign to help people stay out of trouble while shopping over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey conducted for the group showed that most people who  
shopped online were pleased with the result, but one in five 
reported problems including products being misrepresented, products 
not being delivered, and unauthorized charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed only 10 percent of consumers were concerned  
that a seller might be fraudulent, although the consumers league 
said that actually was a bigger danger than credit card number 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers need to check out unfamiliar companies before doing  
business with them, online or offline,'' Susan Grant of the 
consumers league said last week. ``You can't judge them simply on 
the basis of a nice-looking Web site.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Challenges Medicine Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton ordered a federal study of  
drug costs Monday, saying American senior citizens shouldn't have 
to ``get on the bus to Canada'' to buy medicine at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	He also accused the pharmaceutical industry of ``flat-out  
falsehoods'' in a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign aimed at 
killing his proposal to include voluntary prescription coverage in 
Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The president escalated an already bitter feud between the  
administration and the drug industry over the government's role in 
health care. His action also guaranteed an election-year fight 
between Democrats and Republicans over Medicare drug benefits, now 
that Clinton's prescription proposal has been shelved by the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry ads, featuring a character called Flo and her husband  
Bill, claim that Clinton's Medicare plan would put ``big government 
in our medicine cabinets'' and force all seniors into a 
government-run plan. The White House denies those charges and says 
seniors pay too much for drugs and need help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot stand by and watch the pharmaceutical industry go on  
and distort this debate,'' the president said in a speech in the 
Old Executive Office Building. ``We have to expose these deceptions 
and give the American people the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton directed that the drug study be completed within 90  
days. It will look at different prices for the most commonly used 
drugs for people with and without insurance coverage. It also will 
examine drug spending by people of different ages and incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	``No senior should have to forgo or cut back on lifesaving  
medication because of the cost,'' the president said. He said, for 
example, that a popular cholesterol-lowering drug costs $44 for 60 
pills in Canada, but $102 in New Hampshire. ``It's wrong and we 
have to deal with it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking industry claims, Clinton said, ``I wish they'd spend  
this ad money explaining why seniors have to get on the bus and go 
to Canada to buy drugs at less than half the price they can buy 
them in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan F. Holmer, president of the industry trade group, the  
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said some 
drugs may be more expensive in the United States than in Canada, 
because of Canadian or provincial government price controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view is that America has the best health care system in  
the world and we don't want to copy the Canadian system with its 
rationing of health care, its limits on access to medicines and its 
waiting lines that are often three times longer than in the U.S.,'' 
Holmer said. He also defended the accuracy of drug industry ads 
that oppose Clinton's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that 13 million older Americans have no  
prescription drug coverage and millions more have inadequate 
coverage. ``The Republicans are squandering a golden moment,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and  
Means Committee, said Medicare premiums would double for seniors 
under the president's prescription plan. Furthermore, he said a 
study conducted by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers 
estimated that 50 percent to 75 percent of employers would drop or 
limit their prescription coverage if Clinton's plan were enacted, 
eliminating drug insurance for up to 9 million beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads attacked by Clinton were sponsored by ``Citizens for  
Better Medicare,'' a coalition of industry, foundations, advocacy 
groups and taxpayer organizations. Responding to the president, 
they said prescription insurance should be expanded by extending 
private coverage instead of by enlarging Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flo and Bill commercials bore a resemblance to the ``Harry  
and Louise'' advertising campaign that helped scuttle Clinton's 
health care plan in 1994. Those commercials, sponsored by the 
Health Insurance Association of America, featured an affluent 
couple voicing fears about government control of health care and 
suggesting there ``must be a better way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bills have been sponsored in the House and Senate to allow  
pharmacists and distributors to import Food and Drug 
Administration-approved drugs from Europe and Canada, allowing 
Americans to pay less for medicine.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen early  
Tuesday amid continued uncertainty over U.S. stock prices. Japanese 
share prices opened down. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.46 yen, down 0.50 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.31 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 29.84 points,  
or 0.17 percent, to 17,618.95 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Monday, the average closed up 209.99 points, or 1.20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's slide followed a similar  
trend in New York, where the greenback slipped against the yen and 
other major currencies amid weakness Monday in U.S. stock and bond 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, equities and bonds were hit by renewed fears  
over rising interest rates. Stock traders worry that further 
increases in U.S. interest rates would reduce corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of Monday's session, the Dow Jones industrial  
average stood at 10,349.93, down 120.32 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders will be watching for signs that the U.S. economy is  
overheating, something that would prompt the Federal Reserve to 
raise interest rates. The Fed will meet next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 112.62 yen, down  
from 112.76 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices started mixed Tuesday,  
but traders said sentiment remained firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 3.58 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,530.69. 
The TOPIX closed up 20.34 points, or 1.34 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.9150 percent from Monday's finish of 1.8950 percent. Its price 
fell 0.17 point to 99.02.

<HEADLINE> Va. Trial on Web Access Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Six public college professors asked a  
federal appeals court Monday to throw out a Virginia law barring 
state employees from accessing sexually explicit materials on 
computers at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The professors claim the law impedes their ability to conduct  
legitimate academic research. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema declared the law  
unconstitutional in February 1998, but a three-judge panel of the 
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision a year 
later. The professors appealed to the full, 12-judge court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet research is not only as essential as library  
research, but often it is a substitute for library research,'' said 
Majorie Heins, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer 
representing the professors. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the law is unconstitutional because it ``singles out a  
particular category of expression the legislature decided it didn't 
like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William H. Hurd, senior counsel to Attorney General Mark Earley,  
argued that the state has a right to regulate how its equipment is 
used. He also noted that the law makes an exception for 
agency-approved research. All a professor has to do, he said, is 
get permission from his dean. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not violate any First Amendment right any professor  
may have,'' Hurd said. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Assembly passed the law in 1996 to prevent state  
workers from wasting time and taxpayer money on inappropriate 
Internet use. 
</P>
<P>
	The professors argued that under the law, it was technically  
illegal for them to do Internet research on nude portraits or 
classic literature that uses erotic language, even though the same 
material is readily available in libraries.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Down but Up Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against most other currencies  
Monday amid weakness in U.S. stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.31  
Japanese yen, down from 105.97 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4974 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4987, and 1.4719 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4767. The British 
pound rose to $1.6636 from $1.6573. 
</P>
<P>
	But the euro, the common currency of 11 European nations, edged  
lower, falling to $1.0668 from $1.0675 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar came under pressure as bond and stock prices both  
dropped during the day, which could decrease demand for dollars 
among foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stocks and bonds were hit by renewed fears about rising  
interest rates. Stock traders worry that further increases in 
interest rates would reduce corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are watching the Federal Reserve, which might raise  
interest rates for a third time this year when it meets next month. 
Traders will be watching for signs that the economy is overheating, 
something that would prompt the Fed to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8330 German 
marks, up from 1.8321; 6.1477 French francs, up from 6.1445; and 
1,814.69 Italian lire, up from 1,813.75.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Bolts GOP for Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan bolted the GOP on Monday to mount a third-party campaign 
and ``rescue God's country'' from a cultural and moral pit. ``Only 
the Reform Party offers the hope of a real debate and a true 
choice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vaunted two-party system is a snare and a delusion, a  
fraud upon the nation,'' said Buchanan, a thrice-failed GOP 
candidate whose anti-abortion conservatism and anti-trade populism 
could siphon votes from the Republican and Democratic nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	He first must win the Reform Party nomination, no small task if  
billionaire Donald Trump -- who joined the party's New York 
affiliate Monday -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura or party founder 
Ross Perot jump in the race. Buchanan is a longshot for the 
presidency: National polls suggest that no more than one in 10 
voters support him. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting down what he called ``our Patriot's Road,'' the  
pugnacious conservative had harsh words for President Clinton, 
presidential front-runner George W. Bush, the Supreme Court, the 
Education Department, leaders of both major parties, United Nations 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and ``the godless New World Order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me say to the money boys and the Beltway elites who think  
that, at long last, they have pulled up their drawbridge and locked 
us out forever: You don't know this peasant army. We have not yet 
begun to fight!'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go Pat, go!'' shouted more than 300 supporters from the ranks  
of the Republican and Reform parties, gathered at a suburban 
Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	His sound system repeatedly failing him, the former Nixon White  
House aide joked, ``Who put G. Gordon Liddy in charge of the 
microphones?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is the sixth person to quit the GOP nomination race,  
leaving Bush and five others. A compacted primary schedule and the 
Texas governor's record-shattering fund-raising winnowed the field 
earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan criticized Bush's education plans and delivered a  
veiled slap at the GOP front-runner by saying both parties ``seek 
out the hollow men, the malleable men'' as candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by his campaign, Bush said, ``Pat  
Buchanan is leaving the Republican Party because Republicans 
rejected his views during his three failed attempts to earn the 
Republican Party's presidential nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were more pointed than usual from Bush. He had  
measured his words in recent weeks as others denounced Buchanan's 
views about Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential rival John McCain of Arizona, who had suggested  
that Bush was appeasing Buchanan, issued a terse statement Monday. 
``I do not mourn his departure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, whose insurgent campaigns hobbled Republican  
front-runners in 1992 and 1996, failed for eight months to break 
out of second-tier status in the Republican presidential field. 
Though low in polls and money, Buchanan is considered a threat by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no place for conservatives to go other than to Pat,''  
said former White House chief of staff John Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls substantiate GOP fears, although some surveys suggest  
that Buchanan would attract as many Democrats as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, who called Buchanan ``a Hitler lover,'' dropped his GOP  
affiliation Monday in preparation for a potential Reform Party bid. 
He will decide early next year whether to challenge Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the nation's highest-elected Reform Party member,  
pledged to remain governor through 2002 but may be wavering. Perot 
has not ruled out a third presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is more than $12 million in federal money earmarked for  
the Reform Party nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan hopes to forge a coalition of hard-hat Democrats,  
hard-core social conservatives and Reform Party stalwarts who 
helped Perot earned 19 percent of the vote in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of his backers are Perot allies. Ventura is urging Trump to  
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like what he has to say about trade. I can put the abortion  
stuff aside,'' said Valli Sharpe-Geisler, past chairwoman of the 
California Reform Party who attended the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan promised to protect U.S. jobs from unfair trade, fight  
against abortion, keep the nation out of foreign entanglements, 
abolish racial quotas, cut taxes, eliminate the Department of 
Education and help return America to better days. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailoring his standard speech for his new party, he also  
denounced the use of unregulated ``soft money'' in politics and 
accused both parties of writing laws ``with lobbyists looking over 
their shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two parties ``have become identical twins'' on a host of  
issues, Buchanan said. ``Neither fights today with conviction and 
courage to rescue God's country from the cultural and moral pit 
into which she has fallen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And neither party is open to dissident voices, which is why he  
was forced to leave, Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton's ``squalid behavior'' with Monica Lewinsky left  
him unfit to serve as president. 
</P>
<P>
	Times are good, he said, ``but something good has been lost'' in  
recent years: ``The old patriotism; a popular culture that 
undergirded the values of faith, family and country; the idea that 
we Americans are a people who sacrifice and suffer together and go 
forward together; the mutual respect, the sense of limits, the good 
manners. All are gone.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Banana Resignations Forced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Union leaders representing workers of a  
Del Monte Fruit subsidiary have accused a local chamber of commerce 
of forcing them to resign at gunpoint in order to prevent a planned 
10-day strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales Chamber of Commerce representatives were among nearly  
200 armed men who forced workers to resign on Oct. 13, leaders of 
the Union of Banana Workers of Izabal said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The six leaders said they were forced from their homes and  
brought, along with 24 other workers, to the union headquarters in 
Morales, 150 miles east of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	After being held and threatened for eight hours, the leaders  
were forced at gunpoint to announce their resignations, unionists 
said. The declarations were read over the local radio station 
Stereo Banana, which unionists said was owned by a chamber member 
present during the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guatemalan national Chamber of Commerce, Agriculture and  
Industry published an ad Monday rejecting the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Villanueva, president of the national agriculture  
chamber, said members of the Morales chamber had acted as 
individuals and did not represent the institution's local 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the unionists from the Guatemalan Banana Development  
Company, a subsidiary of the San Francisco-based Del Monte, said 
they were so terrified that they eventually thanked their attackers 
for ``making them see the light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just spoke to break the ice. After we signed the  
resignations, I thought only death awaited us,'' leader Jorge Palma 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict began Sept. 27, when Banana Development fired 918  
workers due to production losses caused by Hurricane Mitch, recent 
flooding and high government taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The union received permission for a 10-day strike in front of  
the company's offices, but the leaders were forced to resign before 
the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers said their attackers told them Banana Development  
had said it would close its Guatemala operations because of the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Banana Development said in full-page local newspaper  
ads it would not leave the country. It also said the resignations 
were void because they were obtained against the unionists' will.

<HEADLINE> Case Won't Focus on Shepard's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Gay college student Matthew Shepard was  
pummeled to death by Aaron McKinney in a drunken, drug-induced rage 
after Shepard made a pass at him, McKinney's attorney said Monday 
as his trial began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die? No, that's ridiculous. No  
manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' Jason Tangeman said in 
opening statements. ``That's what Aaron McKinney is guilty of, 
manslaughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roofer's judgment that night was affected by alcohol,  
methamphetamines and ``some sexually traumatic and confusing events 
in his life,'' Tangeman told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked  
the nation, Russell Henderson, ended in April just before a jury 
was seated. Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and 
kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison. The plea allowed 
Henderson to avoid the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha said his case against McKinney will not  
deal with Shepard's gay lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will simply be about the pain, suffering and death of  
Matthew Shepard at the hands of the defendant, Aaron James 
McKinney,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors then called their first three witnesses: Aaron  
Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the 
neighbor who tried to help and a female Albany County deputy, 
Reggie Fluty, who told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so 
sorry this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the  
pine log fence, his hands tied to the bottom of a post. Fluty said 
it appeared Shepard had been crying. Shepard was taken to a 
hospital where he died five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed  
jurors graphic photos of the young man's badly beaten face, and 
McKinney's father William, bowed his head. McKinney barely glanced 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, McKinney and Henderson met in a Laramie bar about a  
year ago, where Shepard asked McKinney for a ride home, humiliating 
him in front of friends because McKinney believed Shepard was gay, 
Tangeman contended. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by three homosexual  
encounters that occurred when he was 7, 15 and 20. In one case, 
McKinney was forced into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully, 
Tangeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rerucha said McKinney and Henderson drove Shepard, 21, to a  
remote area, where they robbed him of $20, lashed him to the fence 
and began pistol-whipping him. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were made after a jury of 10 men and six  
women, including four alternates, was seated in McKinney's trial on 
charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	He could be sentenced to die if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	The jury includes three students at the University of Wyoming,  
where Shepard was a freshman studying human rights.

<HEADLINE> Gray Not Sorry for Rose Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite an outpouring of sympathy for Pete Rose,  
the NBC correspondent who conducted a combative interview about 
gambling with the fallen baseball star said Monday he has nothing 
to apologize for. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's Jim Gray said his questions during a prime-time show  
before Sunday's World Series game shouldn't have surprised Rose 
since other reporters had asked the same things at a news 
conference less than an hour earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't apologize,'' Gray told reporters on Monday. ``I stand  
by it and I think it was absolutely a proper line of questioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview came moments after Rose was announced as a member  
of baseball's All-Century team. He received the longest ovation of 
any baseball hero introduced at Atlanta's Turner Field -- longer 
even than Atlanta Braves legend Henry Aaron, baseball's all-time 
home run king. 
</P>
<P>
	It was another indication that fans seem willing to forgive  
Rose, banned for life from the sport for gambling. Rose has never 
admitted to gambling on baseball, and didn't again when asked by 
Gray on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose told Gray he was ``surprised you're bombarding me like  
this'' on a festive occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Switchboards at NBC affiliates across the country were bombarded  
by phone calls from people angry at Gray -- two hours nonstop at 
WLWT in Cincinnati, where Rose collected most of his Major League 
record 4,256 hits for the hometown Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail to The Associated Press, one fan wrote of being  
enraged that Rose was ``blindsided'' during what should have been a 
proud moment, and said it gives the press a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope NBC buys a collar and leash for the bulldog,'' the  
writer said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees catcher Jim Leyritz said the questioning was  
``barbaric'' and said he had confronted Gray about it. Gray said 
Leyritz never spoke to him and neither did any other Yankee, to his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pretty much all disgusted with Jim,'' said Yankees  
outfielder Darryl Strawberry. ``It was a night of celebration for 
Pete Rose. Every player who ever plays cares about Pete Rose. It 
was embarrassing. It didn't sit too well in this clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre said it was uncalled for. ``For some  
reason, we've lost sight of the word `respect.' We deal too much in 
shock value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray's colleague, NBC analyst Joe Morgan, a teammate of Rose's  
with the Cincinnati Reds, was careful not to place the blame on 
either person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cringing and hoping that Pete would have the right  
answers,'' Morgan said. ``I was just hoping the interview would be 
over the next second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But critics were tough on Gray. Phil Mushnick of the New York  
Post called it a ``mugging,'' while Bob Raissman of the New York 
Daily News said it was a case of a reporter ``trying to become the 
moment and make himself bigger than the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others leapt to Gray's defense. ``I thought it was the best TV  
interview I've ever seen,'' said Murray Chass, baseball writer for 
The New York Times. ``It was appropriate. It was not overdone. Rose 
has put himself in position to be pressed like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Dowd, the investigator whose 1989 probe of Rose led to the  
ban, said he tipped his hat to Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he had more guts than any guy I've ever seen,'' Dowd  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said Gray knows how  
overwhelming the evidence is against Rose. ``For Pete to just stand 
there and look Jim Gray in the eye and deny he bet on baseball, 
it's obviously a challenge that any interviewer can't let go. I 
recognize it was aggressive, but Rose was aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray won a Sports Emmy in 1998 for sideline reporting after his  
relentless interview of Mike Tyson following the ``Bite Fight'' 
with Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he thought it was the proper time for Rose to address  
questions about why he had been banned from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried very hard to be very fair to Pete last night and I  
think I was very fair,'' Gray said. ``The fact that he doesn't like 
it doesn't mean it wasn't fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said Rose, who he has interviewed more than 50 times in his  
career, didn't appear angry when the camera switched off, but 
remarked that he knew the interview was going to be all about 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I did my job and I did my job well but it wasn't a  
satisfying feeling to walk away from that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Returns U.S. Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- North Korea today handed over to American officials  
the bodies of four U.S. soldiers missing since the Korean War, 
media in the communist country said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert Jones accepted the  
remains in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, said the official 
Korean Central News Agency. The report was monitored in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The handover marked the first time such remains had been  
returned in North Korea. All past returns were conducted at the 
border village Panmunjom. 
</P>
<P>
	A repatriation ceremony was to be held at Yokota Air Base, a  
U.S. military facility 20 miles west of Tokyo, later today. The 
bodies were then to be flown to Hawaii for positive identification, 
a base spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my knowledge, this is the first time a repatriation  
ceremony is being held here for bodies returned from Pyongyang,'' 
said Lt. Col. Billy Birdwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokota Air Base is the headquarters for U.S. military forces in  
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea began repatriating U.S. remains in 1990. It allowed  
U.S. forensic experts to begin searching for remains in its 
territory for the first time in 1996, assisted by North Korean 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 20 sets of remains believed to be those of U.S.  
soldiers have been uncovered. Only a few have been positively 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials say that 1,000 to 3,500 sets of remains may  
be recoverable in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States led the U.N.-sanctioned war against communist  
North Korea, which invaded the South in June 1950. More than 33,000 
U.S. servicemen were killed and 8,100 are still listed as missing.

<HEADLINE> Big Oil Company Earnings Are Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Big oil companies said Monday their third-quarter earnings rose  
from a year earlier because of higher crude oil prices, but profit 
growth was held back by competitive pricing in refined products. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at Exxon, Chevron and Arco beat analysts' estimates,  
while those at Mobil and Texaco fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in all the companies fell on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Shares of Exxon traded at $74, down 3.7 percent; Mobil at 
$97.06 1/4, down 4.8 percent; Chevron at $90, down 4 percent; Texaco 
at $61.87 1/2, down 1.6 percent, and Arco at $90.87 1/2, down 3.3 
percent. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Exxon Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest oil company said its net income rose to  
$1.5 billion, or 61 cents a share, from $1.4 billion, or 58 cents a 
share, in the same quarter a year earlier. That beat the 59 cents 
per share estimate by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased to $33.07 billion from $28.5 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Lee R. Raymond said a roughly $8 a barrel increase in  
crude oil prices was responsible for the revenue increase, 
resulting in higher earnings in its crude exploration and 
production business. 
</P>
<P>
	But lower profits in its refining and marketing businesses,  
weaker chemicals margins and lower coal prices hurt the company's 
overall earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon said, however, it had record chemicals sales and reduced  
operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Exxon had net earnings of $3.73  
billion, or $1.52 a share, compared with $4.84 billion, or $1.96 a 
share. Revenues were $89.38 billion, up from $87.83 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is awaiting final regulatory  
approval of its merger with Mobil. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Mobil Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The second-largest U.S. oil company said operating income rose  
to $705 million, or 87 cents a share, from $497 million, or 61 
cents a share, a year earlier. This year's figure was 2 cents below 
the estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income increased to $688 million, or 85 cents a share, in  
the July-September quarter, from $509 million, or 63 cents a share, 
in the year-earlier quarter. The figure included a special charge 
of $17 million for costs related to the planned merger with Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va., said revenues rose to $16.4  
billion from $13.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings benefited from lower exploration expenses and  
cost-cutting. Per-barrel operating expenses were down 6 percent for 
the year, and the company cited higher-than-expected production 
from the North Sea, Qatar, eastern Canada, Equatorial Guinea, 
Kazakhstan and Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	While crude oil and natural gas production was up, unexpected  
delays at refineries and lower profit margins on domestic sales 
hurt earnings, Mobil said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worldwide crude oil and natural gas prices have continued to  
improve. However, worldwide refining and marketing margins remain 
depressed,'' said chairman and CEO Lucio Noto. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first nine months was $1.9 billion, compared  
with $1.86 billion a year earlier. Revenues were $42.78 billion, up 
from $40.50 billion. 

</P>
<P>
 *Texaco Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	Profits at the nation's third-largest oil company more than  
doubled from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income was $453 million, or 83 cents a share, compared  
with $208 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. The 
results fell a penny short of the 84 cents predicted by analysts 
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not include one-time charges, including income  
from the sale of two refineries. With those special items, net 
income rose to $387 million in the, or 71 cents a share, from $215 
million, or 38 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues at Texaco, headquartered in White Plains, N.Y., were up  
25 percent to 9.68 billion from $7.71 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, high crude prices reduced profit margins at the company's  
refining operations. Texaco said increased production -- especially 
at its fields in the Caspian region -- helped offset those low 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, net income rose to $859  
million, or $1.56 a share, from $791 million, or $1.42 a share. 
Revenues increased to $25.14 billion from $23.9 billion. 

</P>
<P>
 *Chevron Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's fourth-largest oil company credited higher crude  
oil prices and lower operating costs for an 80 percent increase in 
operating earnings to $702 million, or $1.07 per share, from $386 
million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial predicted  
earnings of $1.01 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income -- which factored in special charges, including a loss  
on the sale of Koa Oil Co. by Caltex -- was $582 million, or 88 
cents a share, up from $461 million, or 70 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $10.2 billion for the quarter, compared with $7.68  
billion a year earlier, said Chevron, which is headquartered in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Higher crude oil and natural gas prices boosted third quarter  
earnings in our exploration and production business,'' said CEO Ken 
Derr, adding that operating earnings also ``showed a solid 
improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chevron joined other oil companies in noting that  
profit margins in refining and marketing were hurt by competitive 
pricing pressures at the retail level. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, net income was $1.26 billion, or  
$1.91 a share, compared with $1.55 billion, or $2.35 a share in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $25.61 billion, up from $23.28 billion.  

</P>
<P>
 *Atlantic Richfield Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-largest U.S. oil company had earnings before one-time  
items of $511 million, or $1.55 per share, compared with $73 
million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results at the Los Angeles-based company easily beat the  
estimate of $1.23 per share of analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger earnings reflected higher crude prices as well as  
$370 million in cost-cutting measures. Such savings were expected 
to reach $500 million by the end of the year, said Mike R. Bowlin, 
Arco's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco is scheduled to merge with BP Amoco before the year's end.  
</P>
<P>
	Special items in the third quarter, including an after-tax  
charge on the sale of Algerian oil assets, reduced Arco's net 
income from to $372 million, or $1.13 per share, from $872 million, 
or 2.71 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Arco had net earnings of  
$850 million, or $2.59 per share, compared with $1.25 billion, or 
$3.81 per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $9.31 billion, up from $8.10 billion last year.

<HEADLINE> Wife of Los Lobos Singer Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The wife of the lead singer for the band Los  
Lobos was missing and her half-brother was arrested for 
investigation of kidnapping, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Ann Rosas, wife of singer-songwriter Cesar Rosas, was  
last seen by her daughters about 8:30 p.m. Saturday at the family 
home in Rowland Heights, a community east of Los Angeles, sheriff's 
Deputy Boris Nikolof said. 
</P>
<P>
	When her daughters returned home about 11 p.m., the front door  
was open, Mrs. Rosas' 1996 Chevrolet van was gone and there was 
broken glass from the vehicle in the driveway, Nikolof said. Her 
van was found in a nearby city that was not identified and 
detectives were investigating that scene, Nikolof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, detectives arrested Gabriel Gomez, 39, of  
Whittier, for investigation of kidnapping, said sheriff's Sgt. 
George Ducoulombier. Authorities did not say where he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	There was still no sign of Mrs. Rosas, said Deputy Jeff Tesdahl.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned for her safety,'' Nikolof said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Mrs. Rosas' disappearance, a daughter called her  
mother on her cellular phone, Ducoulombier said. Their conversation 
led the daughter to believe that her mother was being held against 
her will, and she heard another voice that she believed belonged to 
Gomez, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosas emerged from his home to appeal to the community for help  
in finding his wife. He said he last spoke to her at 7 p.m. 
Saturday from New Orleans, where he was with the band. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spoke and everything was cool at home,'' he said. ``I could  
hear my children in the background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosas said he could not say whether there had been any past  
trouble with Gomez because that was part of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rosas, 47, has no history of mental illness or of leaving  
home without alerting her family, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Lobos was formed in East Los Angeles in 1973 and is best  
know for its recording of several Ritchie Valens songs on the 
soundtrack ``La Bamba,'' the 1987 film about Valens' life. The band 
plays a mix of blues, country, Tex-Mex, folk and rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Rosas were unsuccessful. There were no  
published telephone numbers for his residence or for Burbank-based 
Gold Mountain, listed as Los Lobos' management company.

<HEADLINE> Last of Liberty Trees Is Cut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A bell tolled 13 times Monday -- once for  
each of the original colonies -- as a crew with chain saws began 
cutting down the last of the Liberty Trees, where American patriots 
gathered to plot against the British. 
</P>
<P>
	The 400-year-old tulip poplar fell victim to years of disease  
and decay and a final blow from the winds of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts who examined the tree on the campus of St. John's  
College said it was in danger of collapsing and had to be cut down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The liberty tree has lived a long and valiant life and has  
been on life support for a century,'' said college president 
Christopher Nelson. For 200 years, the St. John's commencement has 
been held under the tree, and Nelson said cutting it down was a sad 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Revolutionary War, Liberty Trees were meeting places  
for local chapters of the Sons of Liberty throughout the colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Historical records show that British forces destroyed trees in  
Boston and Charleston, S.C., said Edward Papenfuse, Maryland state 
archivist. He said other trees were cut down or died of disease and 
old age. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of Maryland's liberty tree was commemorated with a  
solemn ceremony on the campus of the nation's third-oldest college. 
Wreaths were laid at the base of the tree and of a 100-year-old 
offspring that stands about 100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	After the singing of the national anthem, written by St. John's  
graduate Francis Scott Key, and the tolling of a bell, a worker 
riding in a cage was pulled about two-thirds of the way up the tree 
and began cutting the first branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those watching was Gary Coleman, a University of Maryland  
scientist who is trying to clone samples of the tree's DNA taken 
about four months ago. He said it will be midwinter before he knows 
whether the effort will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, a clone will be planted at the site of the Liberty Tree  
and others will be presented to the 49 other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Claude, a 70-year-old Annapolis resident who played under  
the tree's branches as a child, recorded the cutting down ceremony 
with his camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day. It really is,'' he said. ``I thought it would  
be here as long as I was.''

	Pro Golfer Stewart Killed in Crash  
</P>
<P>
	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- A Learjet carrying golf champion Payne  
Stewart flew uncontrolled over the nation's heartland for hours 
today before crashing in South Dakota, killing everyone aboard. The 
plane, a Lear 35 that was believed to be carrying five people, had 
flown as high as 45,000 feet and the crew did not respond to 
repeated inquiries from air traffic controllers, said an FAA 
spokesman. Government officials said the plane may have suffered a 
pressurization failure. Stewart, who lived in Orlando, Fla., was 
flying to Dallas. He had been expected in Houston tomorrow for 
practice rounds in advance of the Tour Championship, the PGA's 
final tournament of the year.

	Buchanan Bolts GOP for Reform Party  
</P>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan bolted the GOP to mount a third-party campaign and 
``rescue God's country'' from a cultural and moral pit. ``Only the 
Reform Party offers the hope of a real debate and a true choice,'' 
he said. But Buchanan first must win the Reform Party nomination, 
no small task if billionaire Donald Trump -- who joined the party's 
New York affiliate today -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura or party 
founder Ross Perot jump in the race. Buchanan is a thrice-failed 
candidate whose anti-abortion conservatism and anti-trade populism 
could siphon votes from the Republican and Democratic nominees.

	EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Hundreds of eager Palestinians  
shouldering duffel bags and suitcases traveled 28 miles across 
Israel today, inaugurating a ``safe passage'' that for the first 
time links the areas under their control and takes them a step 
closer to statehood. The opening also helped boost Palestinian 
support for peacemaking and enabled residents of crowded Gaza to 
seek jobs elsewhere. In all, some 132,000 Palestinians are so far 
eligible to use the route but most are workers and business people 
who had been granted permission to enter Israel in the past.

	Clinton To Sign Spending Bill

Pentagon spending bill rather than face a risky effort to persuade

House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton still has concerns 
about the amount of special-interest spending included in the bill,

	Tips for Avoiding Online Rip-Offs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers are expected to spend about $9  
billion shopping on the Internet this holiday season, and the 
American Bar Association is offering tips on how to avoid getting 
ripped off. The ABA suggests looking for symbols that indicate Web 
sites use security technology, paying by credit card and reading 
the Web sites' privacy policies. Consumers are also advised to make 
a printout of the Web page, the item being purchased, the warranty 
and any messages between the buyer and seller. If the date doesn't 
appear on the printouts, add it in writing. The ABA's 
recommendations can be found at www.safeshopping.org.

	Models' Eggs Available for Right Price

<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Would-be parents' wishes for a beautiful  
baby may come true -- for the right price. Fashion photographer Ron 
Harris is offering the eggs of eight models in an online auction 
starting today, and he says his Web site has already received a 
serious offer of $42,000. The auction will last up to several 
months, with each model deciding how long the bidding for her eggs 
will go and what price should be accepted. The models receive the 
full amount and bidders must pay Harris' organization an additional 
20 percent service fee, which he says will be donated to children's 
charities.

	Many Offended by NBC Rose Interview

	ATLANTA (AP) -- NBC reporter Jim Gray is defending his treatment  
of Pete Rose during an interview at last night's World Series game. 
Gray, who questioned Rose about his banishment from baseball, said 
today that he thought he was being fair to Rose and giving him a 
chance to address the subjects that have kept him out of the game. 
``I don't apologize, I stand by it and I think it was absolutely a 
proper line of questioning,'' Gray said. Switchboards at network 
affiliates nationwide were swamped with telephone calls complaining 
about Gray.

<HEADLINE> Trump Joins Reform Party Affiliate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a prelude to a possible bid for the White  
House, real estate billionaire Donald Trump quit the Republican 
Party today and registered as a member of the Reform Party's New 
York affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	He filed his change-of-party papers with the Board of Elections  
as Pat Buchanan announced that he was bolting the GOP to seek the 
Reform Party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, who on Sunday called Buchanan ``a Hitler lover,'' said he  
plans to decide early next year whether to seek the Reform Party 
nomination, which will come with about $12 million in federal 
matching dollars this upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will make my decision on my own timetable -- not based on  
what Pat Buchanan or any other prospective candidate might be 
doing,'' Trump said in an earlier statement. ``I am confident that 
if I choose to run I can beat Buchanan and be the strongest 
possible nominee for the Reform Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, a lifelong Republican, registered as a member of the  
Independence Party, New York state's Reform affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes the Reform Party can carve out a niche  
between the Republicans, whom he sees as too conservative, and the 
Democrats, whom he finds too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the Reform Party can be the centrist party, which is  
in line with my beliefs,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Buchanan, a slew of celebrities and politicians  
are mentioned as possible Reform Party candidates, including 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, actress Cybill Shepherd and party 
founder Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Stone, director of Trump's presidential exploratory  
committee, said today that Trump's party switch shouldn't be linked 
to Buchanan's. 
</P>
<P>
	``These two men are changing parties for different reasons,'' he  
said. ``Pat Buchanan is changing parties to get his hands on the 
$13 million the party's entitled to. Donald Trump doesn't need the 
$13 million to communicate his ideas.''

<HEADLINE> Man Rescued After 8 Days in Alaska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A stranded man survived freezing  
temperatures for eight days after finding an uninhabited cabin 
stocked with food and a wood stove. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real happy ending to something that could have been  
real bad,'' Sgt. Sonny Sabala said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Hagstrom, 33, of Wasilla, was in good condition Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hagstrom told troopers he had set out for a drive Oct. 15 and  
headed down the Denali Highway, an unmaintained road in 
south-central Alaska, when his four-wheel-drive pickup truck got 
mired in heavy snow about 170 miles northeast of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagstrom managed to find the cabin and holed up there, waiting  
for someone to come along and help. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was lucky he knew there was a cabin there and he was able  
to get inside. He was smart enough to wait it out. He had the right 
clothing for being out there. He had the sense to get warm and stay 
put,'' Sabala said. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the area had dipped below zero at night during  
the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagstrom had been reported missing. But because he hadn't told  
anyone where he was going, no one knew where to look for him, 
Sabala said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's extremely dangerous,'' Sabala said. ``Your chances of  
being found if you get in an emergency -- you're really taking a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four snowmachiners from Fairbanks came upon Hagstrom standing by  
the highway Saturday afternoon and took him to the trooper post at 
Cantwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagstrom could not be reached for comment. He and several others  
were working Sunday to dig out his truck.

<HEADLINE> UPS Shareholders OK Going Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Stockholders of United Parcel Service today  
approved the company's plan for an initial public stock offering of 
109.4 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock offering, first announced by the UPS board in July,  
represents about 10 percent of existing shares. Ninety percent of 
the votes favored the offering, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based shipping company has told the Securities and  
Exchange Commission that it expects to sell the shares for between 
$36 and $42 per share after a 2-for-1 split planned immediately 
before the initial public offering. At $42 a share, the IPO would 
bring in $4.6 billion, the largest IPO in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees and retirees own about two-thirds of the company's  
shares. The IPO is scheduled for November, although no date has 
been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenues of  
$24.8 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS has requested to trade on the New York Stock Exchange with  
the symbol UPS.

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson To Play Game in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Magic is back, even if it is for just  
one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic Johnson will play for a Swedish League team that bears his  
nickname, Magic M7, on Tuesday against a team from Uppsala named 
Sallen after its main sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first competitive game for the 40-year-old  
Johnson since he retired from the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in Johnson's comeback is so great that the game will be  
broadcast live on one of the biggest networks in Sweden. Basketball 
is popular in Sweden, but ranks far behind soccer and ice hockey, 
and league games are almost never televised. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's team is based in Boras, a city of 110,000 in western  
Sweden. The arena seats about 3,800 and it was sold out quickly for 
Johnson's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson works out daily and in early August, he played 12  
minutes in his annual all-star game at the Forum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	So how many minutes can Johnson play in a league that is  
certainly not among the best in Europe? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to say how many minutes Earvin can play,''  
said Charles Barton, coach of Magic M7 and a former Swedish 
national team coach. ``I expect him to play a lot. He wouldn't come 
and not be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Magic M7 finished fifth in the Swedish League and  
missed the playoffs. This year, the team is off to a 6-0 start and 
hardly needs Johnson. But who could turn down one of the 
basketball's greatest players? 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players tonight after practice that they have to  
play with Earvin, not watch him,'' Barton said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton, whose parents flew in from Columbus, Ohio, to see their  
son coach what will be the most memorable game of his career, 
always thought Johnson was the ultimate player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched him a lot. He could play point guard and center in  
the same game,'' Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
	So which position will Johnson play Tuesday?  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably point guard, but I have to see him in practice,''  
Barton said. ``The practice tomorrow will be more fun than the 
game, to tell one of the greatest players ever that `we want you to 
move here.' It's a tremendous challenge and honor at the same 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Haney, Magic M7's manager, said Johnson picked Sweden  
partly because of the impression the country made on him during a 
1996 tour with his all-star team made up of former NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a licensing agreement and he's an advisor and  
consultant to the team,'' Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who led Michigan State to the NCAA championship in 1979  
and the Lakers to five NBA titles in the 1980s, learned he tested 
positive for the virus that can cause AIDS in 1991, and retired for 
the first time just before the start of the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning to play on the U.S. Dream Team that won the gold  
medal in the 1992 Olympics, he made a brief NBA comeback before the 
1992-93 season, but quit again after several players expressed 
concerns about playing with him for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1996, he returned to the Lakers and played the  
remaining half of the season, retiring again, at age 37, after the 
Lakers were eliminated from the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Japan Rejects U.S. Trade Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A top Japanese trade official has denied Tokyo is  
hampering the next round of global trade talks by attacking 
American anti-dumping measures, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hisamitsu Arai, vice minister of international trade and  
industry for international affairs, made the rebuttal in a letter 
sent last Friday to David Aaron, U.S. undersecretary of commerce 
for international trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said last week that Japan was jeopardizing the talks by  
trying to protect its fishing and lumber industries and attacking 
American laws that protect the U.S. steelmakers against a surge in 
low-cost Japanese steel. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, released on Monday by the Ministry of  
International Trade and Industry, Arai said Japan was not alone in 
its request to look at such laws in upcoming World Trade 
Organization negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Due attention should be given to the fact that over 20 members  
of the WTO, including developing countries, have proposed 
addressing anti-dumping at the next round,'' Arai wrote to Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Arai also said that the inclusion of anti-dumping measures would  
strengthen the Nov. 30-Dec. 3 talks in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe it will obstruct the process,'' he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle negotiations are aimed at achieving agreement on a  
new three-year round of negotiations among its 134 member countries 
to lower trade barriers in agriculture, services and manufactured 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been pressing for agreement that the new talks will  
revisit WTO rules on the use of anti-dumping laws, which allow a 
nation to impose high tariffs on imports if the country determines 
those goods are being sold at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States used its anti-dumping laws to put stiff  
tariffs on steel from Japan and other nations earlier this year and 
ease a surge in foreign shipments after the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said last week that the United States would never agree to  
include its anti-dumping rules in a new round of global 
negotiations. He said calls by developing countries to reopen this 
issue had been orchestrated by Japan.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Plots Course With New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Renegade Pat Buchanan is planning a  
national campaign tailored to his style now that he has abandoned 
his faltering Republican bid for president to run in the Reform 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	After two insurgent GOP campaigns that peaked and quickly faded,  
he says he chose ``not to play our assigned walk-on role'' in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said, he intends to be a national campaigner from  
now on, ``in this fight to the end for the causes we believe in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In talking about his party switch and campaign plan, Buchanan  
said he believes that as a Reform nominee he could push past 15 
percent in the national polls next fall and force his way into 
campaign debates against the Republican and Democratic nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan says he couldn't compete financially with Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush, the front-running Republican, who has raised at 
least $60 million for his campaign, so there was no point in 
trying. Better to switch to the Reform line, on which nominations 
are, effectively, determined by popular vote -- by mail, telephone 
and Internet. He told his backers he will need $4 million to $6 
million to win the nomination, which requires an effort to qualify 
for the ballots of 29 states. The Reform Party already is on the 
ballot in the remaining states because of Ross Perot's showings in 
the last two presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan told supporters he is about out of money. ``We are  
really starting our new campaign from scratch,'' he wrote potential 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Reform campaign won't cost nearly as much as the  
six-way GOP race Bush dominates. The odds are better. Nobody else 
is running, although real estate and casino executive Donald Trump 
switched his voter registration from Republican to Reform on 
Monday, too, saying he'll decide later whether to seek the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	There could be other candidates. Perot himself hasn't ruled it  
out. 
</P>
<P>
	And as a Reform candidate, Buchanan can tailor his tactics to  
fit his strengths. He figures he won't have to spend his time on 
the small-scale campaigning required in the presidential primaries, 
but can concentrate on television, his calling when he isn't 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan declared his switch Monday from the Republicans to more  
than 300 ``Go, Pat, Go'' fans in Falls Church, Va., saying the two 
major parties are lookalikes, that their nominees will be twins, 
and that a choice between them would be ``a sham election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had lagged in the shrinking Republican field, and there was  
nothing to indicate he could break out this time. In 1992, he got 
37 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire presidential primary 
against President George Bush. In 1996, he narrowly defeated Bob 
Dole. Both men eventually were nominated, then defeated by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	So Buchanan made New Hampshire the first stop in his Reform  
campaign, telling about 200 invited supporters that the major 
parties don't offer the voters a real choice because they are so 
much alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need another Xerox copy as the Republicans and  
Democrats have become in Washington, D.C.,'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, he repeated pledges to end unfair trade, foreign aid,  
overseas military entanglements, to cut taxes, rein in federal 
judges, end racial quotas and seek to ban abortion. The list of 
populist and conservative promises goes on -- he also talked of 
protecting the Panama Canal against Chinese influence after the 
United States yields control at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't have a president ... who looks out for America  
first, who will?'' Buchanan asked. ``Who will?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan was campaigning Tuesday in Michigan where his  
denunciation of trade deals he calls unfair to American workers 
could help him recruit blue-collar Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	On that and other targets, the new Reformer sounds like the old  
Republican. But not always. 
</P>
<P>
	``America needs a government of national unity and  
reconciliation that draws from the best of both parties,'' he said 
as he switched. ``I promise you I will create that kind of 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first, there's a campaign war to be waged.  
</P>
<P>
	``So let me say to the money boys and the Beltway elites who  
think that at long last they have pulled up the drawbridge and 
locked us out forever, you don't know this peasant army,'' Buchanan 
said. ``We have not yet begun to fight.''

<HEADLINE> Tips for Avoiding Online Rip-Offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers are expected to spend billions of  
dollars shopping on the Internet this holiday season, and the 
American Bar Association is offering tips on how to avoid getting 
ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to encourage people to shop online but do so in an  
informed manner,'' said Walter Effross, an American University law 
professor and chairman of an ABA panel on electronic commerce. ``If 
you don't feel right about buying a specific product online or from 
a particular Web site ... then maybe you shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA unveiled a Web site -- www.safeshopping.org -- that  
outlines ways consumers can try to minimize their chances of 
running into trouble on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the suggestions:  
</P>
<P>
	--Look for symbols indicating the Web site uses security  
technology to protect purchasers' credit card numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pay by credit card instead of a debit card or check. Using a  
credit card provides more legal protection if a dispute arises. 
</P>
<P>
	--Read the Web site's privacy policy to find out what information  
the seller is gathering from you, whether it sells the information 
to other companies, and how consumers can opt out of such 
information-sharing. People might not want to deal with a Web site 
that lists no privacy policy, the ABA site suggested.

	Online shoppers are expected to spend about $9 billion on gifts  
during the coming holiday season, according to the market research 
company Harris Interactive of Rochester, N.Y. The company said 
about one-third of all people with Internet access are expected to 
buy something online this season, compared with about 8 percent 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This holiday season many consumers will go on the Net for the  
first time for shopping,'' said Gail Hillebrand of Consumers Union. 
She said the vast majority of complaints about online transactions 
have been over items bought through Internet auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your instinct tells you you shouldn't buy a diamond ring from  
a roadside vendor,'' said Thomas Vartanian, chairman of the ABA's 
cyberspace law committee, adding that people need to develop the 
same kinds of instincts for shopping online.

<P>
	In addition to security of credit card numbers, he said people  
need to be alert for ``identity theft,'' in which someone uses 
another person's identity for a variety of transactions, such as 
taking out a loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can put a cop on every computer and we still will not  
eliminate fraud in cyberspace,'' Vartanian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Consumers League has announced its own educational  
campaign to help people stay out of trouble while shopping over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey conducted for the group showed that most people who  
shopped online were pleased with the result, but one in five 
reported problems including products being misrepresented, products 
not being delivered, and unauthorized charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed only 10 percent of consumers were concerned  
that a seller might be fraudulent, although the consumers league 
said that actually was a bigger danger than credit card number 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers need to check out unfamiliar companies before doing  
business with them, online or offline,'' Susan Grant of the 
consumers league said last week. ``You can't judge them simply on 
the basis of a nice-looking Web site.''

<HEADLINE> World Series Ratings Up 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- World Series TV ratings have rebounded through  
two games after record lows in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC posted a 15.7 overnight rating and a 24 share for Sunday  
night's Game 2 between the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves, up 
10 percent from last year's Yankees-San Diego Padres second game. 
</P>
<P>
	The average overnight mark for the two games is 15.4, an  
increase of 7 percent from a 14.4 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's World Series, a four-game sweep by the Yankees, was  
the lowest rated with a 14.1 national mark. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's ratings are down slightly from the two-game  
overnight average (15.5) for the 1996 World Series between the same 
teams. Game 2 that season had an early start of 7:17 p.m. EDT and 
went up against Monday night football. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 of the 1999 World Series earned a 15.0 overnight rating  
and a 26 share. That was up 4 percent from last year's opening game 
between the Yankees and the San Diego Padres (14.3). 
</P>
<P>
	However, a sweep by the Yankees, who are up 2-0 in the series,  
probably would result in lower ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight ratings measure the top 44 markets in the country.  
National ratings will be released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households in the  
nation tuned to a program. Each ratings point represents 994,000 
households. Share represents the percentage of sets tuned to the 
show.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Mitsubishi May Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Major Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  
reportedly will cut 10,000 jobs in a bid to boost competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will be achieved mainly through attrition, including  
reducing the number of new hires and utilizing early retirement 
programs offering special benefits, the mass-circulation Asahi 
newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asahi said that under the plan, Mitsubishi Motors's total  
group work force will be reduced to 78,900 employees from the 
current 88,800 by March 2004, for a reduction of 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's fourth-largest automaker,  
would be the latest in a wave of corporate restructuring announced 
by some of Japan's top companies amid a long economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mitsubishi Motors spokesman, who gave only his surname,  
Sekino, would not confirm the figure quoted by the Asahi. He said 
the company is planning to intensify an ongoing restructuring 
program, but the total number of jobs affected has yet to be 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Sekino said Mitsubishi was implementing a goal of reducing 1,400  
engineering and clerical jobs at the company by March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with poor sales in Japan and the rest of Asia, Mitsubishi  
posted its first-ever earnings loss on a group, or consolidated, 
basis in the fiscal year ended March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company then began implementing its restructuring program.  
Mitsubishi rebounded to a slight profit the following fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Japan's second-largest automaker, Nissan  
Motor Co., said it will trim 21,000 employees worldwide, or 14 
percent of its group work force. Earlier this year, Renault SA of 
France purchased 36.8 percent of Nissan.

<HEADLINE> US-Taliban bin Laden Talks Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Taliban militia showed what could be at  
least a flicker of interest Monday in expelling suspected terrorism 
kingpin Osama bin Laden in order to head off U.N. economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	A Taliban representative brought ``ideas'' to the State  
Department, but U.S. officials made no assertion of progress toward 
a settlement. Nor was a follow-up meeting announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say what the outcome will be,'' department spokesman  
James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideas were discussed about how to resolve this issue,'' Rubin  
told reporters after Taliban representative Abdul Hakeem Mujahid 
met with Assistant Secretary of State Karl F. Inderfurth for a 
little more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to characterize what Mujahid had proposed, Rubin said  
the simple U.S. demand was that bin Laden be sent where he could 
face trial in the bombing last year of two U.S. embassies. ``We 
don't think it's that complicated,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The militia that controls most of Afhganistan must exile bin  
Laden to stave off a threatened freeze of assets and worldwide 
boycott of the country's airline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a lot that is new here other than the fact they  
are now discussing some ideas with us obviously because there isn't 
much time left before the sanctions bite,'' the State Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at a news conference, Secretary of State Madeleine  
Albright, who has denounced Taliban for its ``despicable'' 
repression of women, suggested the ruling militia had a chance at 
being accorded regular treatment by nations around the world if it 
let go of bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban representative made no statement after seeing  
Inderfurth, eluding reporters by leaving through a side exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make clearer that we consider Osama bin Laden and  
his activities a threat to Americans,'' Albright said. ``He has 
made that very clear, and it is very important for the Taliban, if 
they wish to be treated with any sense of regularity, that he needs 
to be expelled to a country where he can be brought to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States suspects the Saudi multimillionaire  
masterminded the bombing of the U.S. embassies last year in 
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in which 224 people 
were killed. His organization is suspected in other attacks, as 
well, and bin Laden is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. A $5 
million reward has been offered by the State Department for 
information leading to his capture. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, which controls most of Afghanistan, has said it  
tried bin Laden in an Islamic court and found him innocent. The 
ruling army also has called him a guest, permitted to stay in 
Afghanistan by a previous government. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Taliban information minister, Amir Khan  
Muttaqi, said, ``We are ready to solve all the issues with America, 
including that of Osama bin Laden,'' but a week earlier Foreign 
Minister Mullah Mohammed Hassan Akhund said the Taliban would never 
give up bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	One incentive for the Taliban to submit to American demands is  
that the U.N. Security Council threatened on Oct. 15 to impose 
sanctions on the militia if bin Laden is not expelled by Nov. 14. 
The penalties would include a freeze on assets overseas and a ban 
on flights to and from Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	After Albright's news conference, spokesman Rubin cautioned  
reporters that the talks with the Taliban were not ``on the verge 
of a breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said American diplomats have met periodically with Taliban  
officials for some time. The head of the State Department's 
counterterrorism office met with Mujahid last Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, the first female secretary of state, has made women's  
rights a key element of U.S. foreign policy. She has traveled 
halfway around the world to visit young Afghan women who fled to 
Pakistan to escape the Taliban. 
</P>
<P>
	At a refugee camp at Peshawar, Pakistan, Albright assailed the  
Taliban's ``despicable treatment of women and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since gaining power several years ago, the Taliban have forced  
women from jobs, closed schools for girls and made it mandatory for 
women to wear the all-enveloping burqa. Women also are not allowed 
to travel without a male relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, at her news conference, also talked about another  
touchy subject, revealing that as Russian tanks pushed toward the 
capital of breakaway Chechnya, the Clinton administration 
admonished Moscow that it was on an ``ominous and deplorable'' 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia evidently was not heeding what Albright told  
reporters was a loud and clear message from her to Foreign Minister 
Ivan Ivanov. The tanks and troops moved closer to Grozny while 
federal jets and artillery pounded suspected rebel bases around 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright talked last week by telephone with Ivanov and again on  
Sunday after coming home from a trip to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took on board what I said,'' Albright told reporters at the  
State Department. ``But I can't say that I was particularly 
encouraged by his response.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Return of 49ers Young Looking Grim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young plans to seek at least  
one more medical opinion about his concussion problems this week 
amid more signs that his season and possibly his career are over. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looking for as much information as he can gain and Steve  
and every doctor involved is going to weigh the pros and cons, the 
whole thing,'' San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci said 
Monday. ``Certainly, he'd love to have a lot of guys say, `Fine,' 
but I don't know that he's gotten that yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't give you the exact evaluation. That's confidential.  
But Steve, he wasn't completely excited about what he's learned so 
far. He wasn't optimistic about playing in the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his radio show on KNBR earlier Monday, Young conceded the  
evaluation he received from his primary neurologist was 
``discouraging'' but continued to seek other opinions to gain some 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to have a wealth of knowledge about it,'' he said. ``I  
haven't been cleared and in the nearterm, it's probably pretty 
discouraging. But I think patience and time are my two allies right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, who has missed four games since sustaining his fourth  
concussion in three years Sept. 27 against Arizona, has failed to 
gain medical clearance to resume his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time NFL MVP who led San Francisco to its fifth Super  
Bowl win in 1994 remains sidelined indefinitely due to 
post-concussion symptoms. Though he has said he wants to play 
again, Mariucci said the 49ers do not expect to see him back on the 
field any time soon and would have serious reservations about doing 
so even if he gained clearance at some point this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Young is still having trouble with the notion that  
he might not be able to help the 49ers (3-4) on the field any more, 
especially now that they're struggling without him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels a responsibility and I think that comes from being  
the quarterback for a long period of time,'' Mariucci said. ``A lot 
of responsibility has been placed on his shoulders for us to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so, he finds it hard to change that, even though he has a  
health issue. There's a time I know when he'll realize that his 
health is more important than his responsibility to this team. But 
that's what makes him tick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a possibility that Young, who doesn't want to retire in  
the middle of the season, could be placed on injured reserve. Such 
a move could come by the end of this week and would finish Young 
for the year, giving him a prolonged period away from football to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess a lot of that will depend on some of the information  
that's found out,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added there was no timetable for Young or the club to make a  
decision on his future, though it would probably be beneficial to 
both to have a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about patience and having some time here but  
obviously, to drag it out, I don't know that it's in the team's 
best interest,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's chief neurologist, Stanford's Dr. Gary Steinberg, has  
already made a longterm recommendation to Young and the team about 
whether Young should play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg's recommendation hasn't been made public, though  
indications are that Young was told he should quit or stay away 
from football indefinitely because of the risk of permanent brain 
damage from another head blow. 
</P>
<P>
	For Young's own peace of mind, general manager Bill Walsh,  
Mariucci, and the team's chief executive, John York, who is a 
non-practicing physician, urged him to get additional opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Young flew to Provo, Utah, to seek the opinion of  
another neurologist and this week he's expected to see at least one 
more specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	A club source said once Young completes his round of visits with  
other specialists, he's expected to meet again with Steinberg, 
perhaps by the end of this week.

<HEADLINE> World Record Set At Chicago Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Red tape might be the only thing that can slow  
down Khalid Khannouchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Khannouchi shattered the world record Sunday, winning the  
LaSalle Banks Chicago Marathon in 2 hours, 5 minutes, 42 seconds. 
That was 23 seconds faster than the 2:06:05 Ronaldo da Costa of 
Brazil ran in the 1998 Berlin Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up, the Sydney Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't have a chance to run in the Olympics as an  
American, I won't run,'' said Khannouchi, whose request for 
expedited citizenship was denied in June. ``I'd prefer to wait 
another four years or maybe for the world championships. I want to 
give something back to the sport in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Khannouchi, 27, was born and raised in Morocco, but moved to the  
United States in 1993 because he wasn't getting the support he 
wanted from the Moroccan track federation. Embraced by Americans, 
he applied for citizenship in hopes of running for the United 
States in Sydney next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it was discovered the agent handling Khannouchi's case  
accepted payments from some immigrants -- Khannouchi wasn't one of 
them -- the agent's entire caseload was frozen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always positive we have chances,'' Khannouchi said.  
``We're working hard and we're not going to give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the way he ran Sunday. Though the pacers went out on a  
world-record clip through the first 13.1 miles, Khannouchi hung at 
the back of the leaders' pack, not wanting to make his move too 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't panic when two-time Boston Marathon winner Moses Tanui  
caught the leaders and charged ahead between the 17th and 18th 
miles. By the 21st mile, Tanui had a 33-second lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was too early, and I believed in myself that I could  
get him at the end,'' Khannouchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	He got some encouragement from a small group of Moroccans who  
followed him around the course, waving the Moroccan flag and 
cheering him on. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were talking to me in our language,'' Khannouchi said.  
``They were cheering for me, `Go Khalid, go get them.' Inside, I 
told them, `Just don't worry. I know what I'm doing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	By mile 24, he'd cut Tanui's lead to nine seconds. He kept  
closing, pulling ahead just before they entered a tunnel about 1 1/2 
miles from the finish line. When they emerged from the quarter-mile 
tunnel, he had a commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two miles, I ran incredible,'' he said. ``I wasn't  
able to see the mile marks because of the cold. My eyes were red 
and it was hard to see. I knew I broke the world record when I got 
to the finish line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Khannouchi crossed, he burst into tears and was wrapped in a  
bear hug by his wife, Sandra, who also is his coach and agent. He 
won a Volkswagen Beetle and $165,000, including a $100,000 bonus 
for breaking the world record. Tanui finished in 2:06:16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I confused the miles,'' Tanui said. ``I did not know which  
kilometer I was running. Today, when I started to make my move, I 
thought I was over 35 kilometers. Unfortunately, I was at about 
maybe 30 kilometers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya fell early in the  
race, but managed to edge countrywoman Margaret Okayo by a second. 
Chepchumba finished in 2:25:59 while Okayo, running in her first 
marathon, clocked 2:26:00. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Costa dropped out at the 15th mile with lower back pain.  
Catherina McKiernan, who'd won all three previous marathons she'd 
entered, had stomach cramps throughout the race and finished 12th 
in 2:35:31. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning Chicago twice in three years -- he set a world  
debut record when he won in 2:07:10 in 1997 -- and finishing second 
last year, Morocco would probably be glad to have Khannouchi. 
</P>
<P>
	No way, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still Moroccan, I still have Moroccan blood,'' said  
Khannouchi, who lives in Ossining, N.Y. ``But the federation, I 
don't want to deal with them anymore. They put me down the time 
that I needed them, and it's not worth it to go back to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Americans could use Khannouchi. Little-known David  
Morris, originally of Eagle River, Alaska, finished fourth and set 
a U.S. record of 2:09:32, beating the 2:09:35 Jerry Lawson ran in 
Chicago in 1997. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dementia Guide Created for Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Facing an aging population, the nation's  
biggest physicians organization unveiled a guide Monday to help 
doctors recognize and treat dementia. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association booklet is designed as a  
practical, quick guide for primary care physicians, who will see 
greater numbers of dementia cases in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes tests for gauging dementia -- asking patients to draw  
a clock face, identify a pencil and provide the current day, month 
and year. The guide also recommends ways to prevent and respond to 
elder abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Most importantly, the guide seeks to ease the burden on family  
members, who provide most of the care to dementia sufferers, and to 
keep patients out of nursing homes for as long as possible, said 
Dr. Yank Coble Jr., a Florida endocrinologist and AMA Board of 
Trustees member. 
</P>
<P>
	Dementia patients often ``withdraw'' in institutions, and  
symptoms such as incontinence worsen, Coble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to better at home,'' said Coble, whose father and  
father-in-law both suffered from Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dementia, which can be linked to Alzheimer's, certain types of  
strokes and other physical conditions, is incurable and worsens 
progressively over years, making it hard to diagnose in early 
stages. People with the disorder eventually become unable to live 
independently. Some have trouble finding words, dressing, cooking a 
meal or performing other complex tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	There are dozens of guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of  
dementia, but the AMA's 47-page booklet is the first to take 
doctors through the range of medical and social issues, including 
legal problems, the ``uncomfortable'' task of breaking the news to 
a patient, and the handling of pain and anxiety as the patient 
nears death, Coble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physicians should think of dementia as an illness that people  
often die of -- it just happens over years'' rather than months, 
Coble said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide is called ``Diagnosis, Management and Treatment of  
Dementia: A Practical Guide for Primary Care Physicians.''

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Banks Gets First Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Brian Billick has turned his sputtering  
offense over to Tony Banks, who becomes the Baltimore Ravens' third 
different starting quarterback in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, who started 43 games in three seasons with the St. Louis  
Rams, gets his first start with the Ravens (2-4) on Sunday against 
the Buffalo Bills. He replaces Stoney Case, who took over for Scott 
Mitchell in Week 2 but returns to the bench after successive 
15-for-37 performances against Tennessee and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why the change? It's as simple as having to provide an impetus  
to make something happen offensively,'' Billick said Monday. ``It's 
not an indictment of Stoney Case. I think Stoney Case has a future 
as a quarterback; he may have a future as quarterback with the 
Baltimore Ravens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens failed to score a touchdown against the Titans and  
did not get into the end zone against the Chiefs until Banks 
entered in the fourth quarter of a 35-8 loss. Baltimore is 
averaging 14 points a game, worst in the AFC except for the 
expansion Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, 26, was traded to the Ravens in April for two draft picks  
and entered the season as the third-string quarterback. Now he's 
the main man. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to hear. I've been waiting a long time, trying to be  
patient and stay mentally ready,'' Banks said. ``Being a backup is 
something I've never done before. I struggled with it a little 
while, but I figured I'd get my shot eventually, if not here than 
somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks made his Baltimore debut against Kansas City, going  
8-for-14 for 69 yards. He led the Ravens in the preseason in 
completions and passing yardage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely have a lot of confidence in what I do,'' Banks  
said. ``I don't think there are so many guys who throw the football 
the way I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case had one career start in four NFL seasons before this year.  
After relieving an ineffective Mitchell in a loss to Pittsburgh, he 
started the following week against Cleveland and ran for two 
touchdowns in a 17-10 victory. He then threw the game-winning 
touchdown pass in overtime against the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Case struggled mightily in his next two starts, particularly  
against the Chiefs, when his inexperience was on display before a 
national television audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I felt like Tony, with his 43 starts and experience  
in the league, is something we need right now to get us off the 
path we've taken offensively,'' Billick said. ``This team needs 
something to happen. I don't know if Tony Banks is the answer, but 
maybe he can make a difference for us. We're too close to being on 
the verge of a team that can compete for me not to try something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case did not complete 50 percent of his passes in any of his  
starts. Two of his three interceptions against Kansas City were 
returned for touchdowns, and now he's once again No. 2 on the depth 
chart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously disappointed. I don't necessarily agree with it,  
but it's the coach's decision,'' Case said. ``This won't effect my 
confidence at all. I had a bad game, made some bad decisions. I 
threw three picks, two of them went the other way. It was just a 
bad game. Life goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, the Ravens signed free agent wide receiver Marcus  
Nash, who caught four passes for 76 yards with Denver last year. He 
was the Broncos' top draft pick in the 1998 draft.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Malaysian Official in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar  
Ibrahim was rushed to hospital today with a severe headache, 
forcing the adjournment of his sodomy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in two months that Anwar, 52, has been  
taken to a hospital. Last month, he was admitted after he alleged 
he was being poisoned in prison. His condition today was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	During Anwar's testimony earlier today, the judge asked him to  
produce evidence to back his accusations that Cabinet ministers had 
plotted his ouster from government. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar testified Friday that Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin and  
other backers of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad conspired against 
him because he tried to expose their misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar is serving a six-year prison term for corruption. He is  
being tried for sodomy, a crime in this predominantly Muslim nation 
in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	He denies the charges against him, saying they are part of a  
political plot to quash his challenge to Mahathir, who fired him in 
September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar was admitted to a hospital on Sept. 10 after defense  
attorneys told the court he was being poisoned by his political 
foes. Test results from an Australian lab showed a high level of 
arsenic in his body, his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was discharged Oct. 4 and government medical tests showed he  
was not suffering from ``acute or chronic'' arsenic poisoning.

<HEADLINE> Africa Seeks Technology Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- There are fewer telephone lines on  
the entire African continent than there are in either Tokyo or 
Manhattan, and most Africans have never seen a personal computer, 
let alone surfed the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to bridge the information technology gap that separates  
Africa from the rest of the world is the goal of a four-day forum 
that began here Monday in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. The 
African Development Forum also aims to persuade investors to take 
another look at the world's largest untapped market for new 
communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has become the central feature of modern society globally  
is hardly felt in Africa other than in the elite circles of some 
capitals,'' said a report by the U.N. Economic Commission for 
Africa, which hosted the forum. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opening address Sunday night, Ethiopian Prime Minister  
Meles Zenawi told some 500 delegates that Africa will likely remain 
on the margins of the global economy unless the necessary 
conditions were created for it to share the benefits in an 
equitable fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	If Africa doesn't integrate technology into its economy, it will  
leave itself open to ``those engaged in extra-legal activities 
ranging from crime syndicates to drug-trafficking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Africa lags behind in access to information tools, the  
Internet growth there has surprised many. In the last half of 1998, 
the number of African Internet hosts grew by 38 percent, compared 
to a global average of 18 percent, said the U.N. commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 54 nations on the continent, only Libya has no Internet  
connection at all. In war-torn Somalia, where there has been no 
central government since 1991, private investors have established a 
telephone link to the rest of the world that will soon include an 
Internet host.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs $268B Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed the $268 billion  
defense spending bill Monday and averted what would have been a 
tough and risky drive to coax Democrats to uphold a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton complained the bill contained spending for projects the  
Pentagon had not requested and used budget gimmicks such as 
declaring $7 billion in base maintenance an ``emergency'' that 
would not count against spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he said, ``In good conscience I cannot allow our  
national security needs to be held hostage to this budget battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's decision leaves him battling Republicans over five  
spending bills to achieve his demands for $5 billion to $10 billion 
more for hiring teachers and police officers, buying park land, 
foreign aid and other programs. Those differences, plus 
administration opposition to provisions helping the mining, 
ranching and oil industries, seem unlikely to be resolved until 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	By signing the Pentagon measure, Clinton avoided escalating and  
prolonging the budget fight further and intensifying bitter 
feelings between the parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we'll continue to have some period of time of hard  
work, yes, I'm optimistic this makes it even that much easier'' to 
resolve the budget battle, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, Clinton had considered rejecting the measure to  
gain leverage in the budget fight by making it a bargaining chip in 
his push for more money. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the bill proved too laden with popular spending for  
a veto to be politically feasible. Costing $4.5 billion more than 
Clinton requested, the bill included money for a 4.8 percent 
military pay raise and scores of projects for lawmakers' home 
districts. Some Democrats, including the influential Rep. John 
Murtha, D-Pa., had said they would work to override the veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to round up enough Democratic votes to uphold a veto  
would have weakened Clinton's hand in budget talks and been a 
stinging foreign affairs defeat, especially after the Senate's Oct. 
13 rejection of the global nuclear test ban treaty. For his veto to 
prevail, Clinton would have needed one-third plus one of either the 
House or Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters he believed he could have won but worried  
that Democrats would be ``attacked by the Republicans for being 
against the defense budget that the Democratic Party has basically 
pursued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's signature on the bill avoided exposing Democrats to a  
traditional GOP accusation that they are soft on defense. White 
House officials also hope it will sharpen attention on Clinton's 
battle with Republicans over his budget proposals and the GOP's 
plan to cut federal agencies' spending by 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not allow Congress to raise its own pay and fund its  
own pork-barrel projects, and still make devastating 
across-the-board cuts in everything from education to child 
nutrition to the FBI,'' Clinton said Monday. ``I will not sign any 
budget that puts special interests above the national interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the insistence of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman  
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, Republicans were considering reducing the 
size of the cut in agency spending to about 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A move also is afoot by some rank-and-file Republicans to try to  
include lawmakers' salaries in the across-the-board reduction. 
Their pay, set to rise to $141,300 next year, currently would not 
be cut, because money for their salaries is not controlled by the 
spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides building up equipment depleted by the war with  
Yugoslavia, the defense bill would curtail production of the Air 
Force's F-22 ``stealth'' fighter and provide billions for weapons 
procurement that would be spent from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Included is $375 million to begin building a helicopter carrier  
in the home district of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
including electrical equipment built by Pennsylvania 
subcontractors; $275 million for five F-15 fighters to be built by 
Boeing Co. in the St. Louis area, represented by the House minority 
leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.; and electronic equipment for 
missile defense systems built in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he would sign a third, short-term measure keeping  
agencies open while spending bills are completed, saying, ``We are 
making some progress.'' The second one expires Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also vetoed a $39 billion measure financing the  
departments of Commerce, Justice and State. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill, which lacked most of the $1.3 billion Clinton  
requested to help communities hire thousands of police officers, is 
the third of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2000 that he 
has vetoed. He has threatened to veto two others, but has signed 
eight into law.

<HEADLINE> 3M Profits Rise Nearly 18 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Mining &AMP; Manufacturing on  
Monday reported a nearly 18 percent increase in third-quarter 
profits, beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	3M, which manufactures a wide range of industrial, commercial  
and health care products including Post-it Notes, Scotch tape and 
Thinsulate insulation, said earnings were helped by increased sales 
and a new line of products. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings before one-time items came to $462 million, or $1.14 a  
share, compared with $392 million, or 97 cents a share, during the 
same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings topped the $1.06-per-share expectations of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not include one-time charges for restructuring  
and litigation or one-time gains from divestiture. When those 
amounts are included, 3M reported net earnings of $459 million, or 
$1.13 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues increased 6.1 percent to $3.99 billion from $3.77  
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and CEO L.D. DeSimone said 3M's profits were also  
boosted by cutting administrative expenses and double-digit volume 
gains in the Asia-Pacific region and a 6 percent gain in European 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's consumer and office, electro and communications,  
and specialty materials businesses led sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, net income totaled $1.32 billion, or  
$3.25 per share, compared with $964 million, or $2.36 per share in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $11.63 billion, up 3.6 percent from $11.23 billion  
in the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	3M shares were rose 25 cents to $92.81 1/4 a share on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> China Wants To Pass Nuclear Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China will ratify an international treaty banning  
nuclear testing, a senior arms control negotiator was quoted as 
saying Monday, despite the U.S. Senate's rejection of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that there is no question that we will ratify the  
treaty. It is only a matter of time,'' Sha Zukang, director of the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Department of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, said in an interview with the official China Daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Sha did not give any indication of when the National People's  
Congress would ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or CTBT. 
But he noted that U.S. approval would ``facilitate'' ratification 
in China, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing has expressed regret at the U.S. Senate's rejection of  
the treaty two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sha accused the United States of sending dangerous signals that  
it will sign treaties, but not ratify them, or adopt domestic laws 
to circumvent international agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``These two messages will have serious and negative influence on  
the future multinational disarmament negotiations,'' Sha was quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Sha said that China would neither conduct tests nor carry out  
any other activities in violation of the treaty before its 
legislature ratifies it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will never adopt double standards,'' he said. ``The Chinese  
government will firmly honor its political commitment to the 
CTBT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China and the United States are two of the 44 nuclear powers who  
must ratify the treaty before it goes into force. So far only 26 
have ratified it.

Monday of issuing a public statement on the country's political 
situation, saying irresponsible conduct by ``certain leaders'' is 
threatening democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement published in the country's main newspapers, the  
armed forces warned that the only way for Ecuador's democracy to 
survive is by meeting the basic needs of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absurd and dangerous that certain leaders and political,  
economic and social groups use their power to provoke constant 
clashes, scandals and strikes without offering any significant 
strategies or objectives beyond electoral and material ones,'' the 
military statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The military said it was speaking out because of ``the grave  
political, economic and social crisis'' confronting the small 
Andean nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador is struggling with a crushing foreign debt, currency  
devaluation and 50 percent annual inflation, the highest in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad's government has been mired this past  
year in savage political infighting, and often violent 
demonstrations by students, transportation workers and rural Indian 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador last month became the first nation ever to default on  
hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign Brady bond debt when it 
missed a $44.5 million interest payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad's centrist government announced last week that it also  
would default on its Eurobond debt. Ecuador is planning to meet 
with foreign creditors Wednesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's total public debt is $13 billion and is expected to  
top 117 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A $400 million loan agreement with the International Monetary  
Fund, expected to trigger $1 billion in international aid, hinges 
on Congress approving a balanced budget for next year, ending years 
of deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad's budget proposal has been stalled for more than three  
weeks in a Congress dominated by his political rivals. Rightist 
parties oppose tax increases, while left-of-center opponents object 
to spending cuts, especially for social programs.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Rise in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest levels in more 
than 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $10 billion in three-month bills at  
a discount rate of 4.995 percent, up from 4.990 percent last week. 
An additional $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 
5.115 percent, up from 5.000 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since June 15, 1998, when  
the bills sold for 5.010 percent. The six-month rate was the 
highest since June 22, 1998, when the rate was 5.120 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 5.145 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,873.70 and 5.338 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,741.40. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.47 
percent last week from 5.42 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Banks Gets Start As Ravens' QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick  
today named Tony Banks his starting quarterback for Sunday's game 
against the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks replaces Stoney Case, who struggled in his past two games  
after leading Baltimore to two straight victories upon replacing an 
ineffective Scott Mitchell. Banks relieved Case last Thursday in 
the Ravens' embarrassing 35-8 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Case went 15-for-37 in that game and threw three interceptions,  
two of which were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks was obtained in the offseason in a trade with the St.  
Louis Rams. He began the season as the Ravens' third-string 
quarterback behind Mitchell and Case. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, who started 43 games for St. Louis in three seasons, now  
becomes Billick's third starting quarterback in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick delayed making the decision until he was certain that  
Banks would be the right quarterback to turn around a two-game skid 
that has dropped the Ravens' record to 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Case had one NFL start in four seasons before this year. He has  
yet to complete 50 percent of his passes in a game and has six 
interceptions against just three touchdown throws. His inexperience 
was on full display for a national audience Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just played terribly,'' Case admitted after the game. ``I  
want the opportunity to come back, but that's the coach's 
decision.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Gov. Apologizes for Blackface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gov. Mel Carnahan apologized Monday  
for appearing in blackface at a minstrel show 39 years ago, and 
lashed out at Republicans for unearthing a 1960 photo of the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've grown,'' said Carnahan, a Democrat who is  
challenging Republican Sen. John Ashcroft for his Senate seat in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly regret my participation in this kind of theater,  
and I sincerely and readily apologize for my insensitivity of 39 
years ago,'' the 65-year-old governor added. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he should be judged on his record, including  
legislative sponsorship of a state civil rights law in 1965 and the 
appointment of the first black Missouri Supreme Court judge in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That judge, Ronnie White, was rejected for a federal judgeship  
on Oct. 5 after Ashcroft told the Senate that White was soft on the 
death penalty and ``pro-criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan accused Ashcroft, stung by allegations of racism for  
his role in defeating White's nomination, of responsibility for 
circulating the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Ashcroft is counting on Missourians to be unable to  
see any difference between the insensitivity captured in this 
photograph four decades ago and the polarizing acts he committed on 
the Senate floor just days ago,'' Carnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton had no comment about Carnahan's  
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, who was elected governor in 1992 with substantial  
black support, said Monday that he had called black leaders to 
apologize. He would not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive director of the Missouri GOP, John Hancock, said  
research turned up the photo in the Rolla Daily News, the 
governor's hometown paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock denied having any hand in distributing the photo. A  
glossy print of the photograph and a copy of the clipping dated 
Oct. 12, 1960, were provided to The Associated Press by a 
Republican source on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo shows Carnahan, then 26; his older brother, Bob; and  
two other men performing as a barbershop quartet at a Kiwanis Club 
fund-raiser. The menwore tuxedos and blackface makeup with 
exaggerated white circles around their eyes and mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said he was ``uncomfortable'' about wearing blackface  
at the time, but was the newest member of the group and didn't 
challenge the costume. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back, that's what I wished I'd done,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said the minstrel shows were a longtime tradition in  
Rolla, but he never again wore blackface after the 1960s show and 
his brother, Bob, moved to end the blackface performances after 
that show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said we ought not to be doing that sort of thing,'' Bob  
Carnahan, 73, said in telephone interview Monday. ``Obviously it 
was racial, and I told the club I couldn't participate in the 
minstrel show anymore and didn't think our quartet should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black Missourians interviewed at St. Louis Union Station said  
they weren't perturbed by the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so old,'' said Scott Jackson, 20.  
</P>
<P>
	Latascha Bond, 18, who plans to vote for the first time next  
year, said she wasn't dissuaded from casting her Senate ballot for 
Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did this in 1960,'' she said. ``That doesn't mean he'll do  
it in 1999.''

<HEADLINE> ExciteAtHome Buying Blue Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- ExciteAtHome, the sixth most popular Web  
destination, is buying the Blue Mountain Arts electronic greeting 
card site in a $780 million deal that will greatly boost traffic to 
Excite and add a popular service to its Internet offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Mountain Arts Publishing Co.'s Web site, ranked No. 14 with  
9.2 million visitors, features free electronic cards that users 
personalize and send by e-mail, among other services. Adding its 
traffic will lift Excite's network to No. 5 in the Web rankings, 
usurping that spot from Disney's Go Network, according to the Media 
Metrix research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite is paying $350 million in cash and issuing about $430  
million in stock. The deal could include an additional payment of 
up to $270 million in Excite stock if holiday traffic to 
bluemountain.com is as strong as expected. The deal is expected to 
be completed by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder-based Blue Mountain was originally founded as an  
alternative greeting card company. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bell, president of Excite, which is based in Redwood  
City, Calif., said Blue Mountain was coveted in part because it 
drew visitors without any marketing or distribution relationships 
with other sites.

<HEADLINE> Study: Prayer Helps Heart Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Heart patients who had someone praying over them  
without their knowledge suffered 10 percent fewer complications, 
according to new research published this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's potentially a natural explanation we don't understand  
yet. It's potentially a super- or other-than-natural mechanism,'' 
said William S. Harris, a heart researcher and lead author of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and other researchers at the Mid America Heart Institute,  
the heart program of St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., 
studied 990 patients admitted during a year to the institute's 
coronary care unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients were randomly divided into two groups. In one,  
patients were prayed for daily by community volunteers for four 
weeks; the other patients didn't have anyone assigned to pray for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients, their families and their caregivers were not told  
they were in a study. The volunteers were told only the first names 
of the patients and asked to pray daily for their speedy recovery 
with no complications. 
</P>
<P>
	After four weeks, the prayed-for patients had suffered about 10  
percent fewer complications, ranging from chest pain to cardiac 
arrest, researchers reported in Monday's issue of the Archives of 
Internal Medicine, published by the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest that prayer might be an effective addition  
to standard medical care, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Harris acknowledged that his study had  
limitations. Among other things, many patients in the comparison 
group likely had friends and relatives praying for them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the work said the study and a similar  
one in 1988 in San Francisco that involved 393 heart patients had 
questionable methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Both studies tallied complications using their own scoring  
systems, which have not been proved medically valid, said the 
expert, Dr. Herbert Benson, a professor of medicine at Harvard 
Medical School and president of the Mind/Body Medical Institute at 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studies have found no apparent benefits to being prayed  
for, and in one, prayed-for patients actually fared worse, Benson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson said medical research has shown that people who believe  
in God or in prayer generally fare better than those who don't. 
What remains unproven is whether prayer itself makes a difference, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Pro Golfer Stewart Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- A Learjet carrying champion golfer Payne  
Stewart and at least four other people flew a ghostly journey 
halfway across the country Monday, its windows iced over and its 
occupants apparently incapacitated, before nosediving into a grassy 
field. Everyone aboard was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight plan said two crewmember and three passengers were on  
the jet, but there were reports a sixth person boarded the plane 
just before it took off from Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The chartered, twin-engine Lear 35 may have suddenly lost cabin  
pressure soon after taking off for Dallas, government officials 
said. Air traffic controllers couldn't raise anyone by radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighter jets were sent after the plane and followed it for much  
of its flight but were unable to help. The pilots drew close and 
noticed no structural damage but were unable to see into the 
Learjet because its windows were frosted over, indicating the 
temperature inside was well below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Set apparently on autopilot, the plane cruised at a stable  
45,000 feet or so, flying 1,400 miles straight up the nation's 
midsection, across half a dozen states, before it presumably ran 
out of fuel some four hours after it took off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane had pretty much nosed straight into the ground,''  
said Lesley Braun, who lives two miles from the South Dakota crash 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was one of the most recognizable players in golf  
because he wore traditional knickers and a tam-o'-shanter hat. He 
won 18 tournaments, including three major championships. In June, 
he won his second U.S. Open, prevailing over Phil Mickelson with an 
astonishing 15-foot putt on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community and  
all of sports. He will always be remembered as a very special 
competitor and one who contributed enormously to the positive image 
of professional golf,'' PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said: ``I am profoundly sorry for the loss of  
Payne Stewart, who has had such a remarkable career and impact on 
his sport and a remarkable resurgence in the last couple of 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart lived in Orlando and had been expected in Houston on  
Tuesday in advance of the Tour Championship, a tournament for the 
top 30 players on the Professional Golfers' Association money list. 
He attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas and had friends 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart's agents, Robert Fraley and Van Ardan,  
and the two pilots, identified as Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie 
Bellegarrigue, 27. The jet was operated by Sunjet Aviation Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus said Monday that he feared one of his golf course  
designers had also died in the crash. Bruce Borland, 40, was flying 
to Texas because he wanted to design a course with Stewart under 
the Nicklaus Design banner, Nicklaus said. The two planned to get 
to know each other during the flight, Nicklaus said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities could not confirm that Borland was on the plane and  
officials at the crash site said they could not tell exactly how 
many people had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am truly shocked and saddened,'' Nicklaus said in the  
statement. ``Our hearts go out to their families, as well as the 
families of the other victims in the accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two officials from the Federal Aviation Administration were sent  
to investigate the crash, along with a representative from the 
National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized, because the  
air is too thin to breathe at that altitude. If a plane loses 
pressure, those aboard could slowly lose consciousness or, if an 
aircraft broke a door or window seal, perish in seconds from lack 
of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Once reaching a cruising altitude, pilots often switch on the  
autopilot. If they pass out, the plane could continue on until it 
ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Janklow, who was at the crash site, said it appeared  
Stewart's Learjet ran out of fuel because there was no fire. He 
said the plane and the bodies were obliterated. 
</P>
<P>
	Instances in which a civilian jet lost pressure in flight are  
extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Stewart crash was similar to an accident nearly 20  
years ago that took the life of Louisiana State University football 
coach Bo Rein. Rein left Shreveport, La., in 1980 in a private 
plane en route to Baton Rouge. Radio contact with the pilot was 
lost, and the plane flew off course for hundreds of miles before 
going down in the Atlantic off Virginia. Investigators think the 
plane may have lost pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The last communication from Stewart's jet was over Gainesville,  
Fla., said Tony Molinaro, an FAA spokesman in Chicago. The jet flew 
as high as 45,000 feet and the crew did not respond to repeated 
inquiries from air traffic controllers, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	A government source said the plane should have turned left at  
Gainesville on a course for Dallas. It made only a partial turn 
before heading in a straight line toward South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA routed air traffic around the Learjet and kept planes  
from flying underneath it in case it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Five fighter jets from Florida and Oklahoma went after the  
plane. Two F-16s had to make several passes to align with the 
plane, which was flying steady in the clear blue sky but was going 
slowly in comparison with the fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Capt. Chris Hamilton said there was nothing he could  
do when his F-16 caught up with the Learjet over Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very helpless feeling to pull up alongside another  
aircraft and realize the people inside that aircraft potentially 
are unconscious or in some other way incapacitated,'' Hamilton 
said. ``And there's nothing I can do physically from my aircraft -- 
even though I'm 50 to 100 feet away -- to help them at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the military never  
considered shooting down the Learjet. Asked whether shooting it 
down might have become an option if it had been headed for a 
heavily populated area, Bacon said, ``It never reached that 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jim Henry, retired pastor for First Baptist Church of  
Orlando who used to minister to the Stewart family, was one of 
those outside the Stewart home after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a wonderful Christian who had Christ in his life and  
somehow in his death,'' Henry said. ``That brought a great sense of 
peace to his family in a difficult and tragic time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had two children, Chelsea, 13, and  
Aaron, 10.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Sanders Loves a Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders had a point to prove and not  
even a concussion could stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring doctors orders, Sanders slipped out of the locker room,  
onto the field and into the end zone to help the Dallas Cowboys 
finish off the Washington Redskins and their trash-talking 
receivers in a 38-20 victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was obvious from the way he played he loves a great  
challenge,'' Dallas coach Chan Gailey said Monday. ``He loves to 
have a big impact on the game, and he wants to help us win in any 
way possible. He's proven that to me, and not just Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was trying to send a message to the league in general,  
specifically Washington wideouts Albert Connell and Michael 
Westbrook. They said they weren't afraid of Sanders, so he wanted 
to remind them -- and anyone who agreed -- why they should. 
</P>
<P>
	But after showing surprising aggressiveness on the first two  
series, Sanders went to the locker room to recover from a 
head-rattling hit on a punt return. He came back without permission 
early in the third quarter, then capped his performance with a 
dazzling 70-yard punt return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Sanders told Connell he played a good game and that  
he loves him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also let him know that if he is going to hunt rabbits,  
sometimes it ain't no fun if the rabbit has a gun, too,'' Sanders 
said. ``If you're going to talk the talk, you had better be able to 
walk the walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their receivers are young, and they have a ways to go.''  
</P>
<P>
	Connell and Westbrook were feeling cocky because they combined  
for eight catches, 296 yards and two touchdowns in their 
season-opening meeting. Sanders, though, missed Dallas' 41-35 
overtime win because of a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, even though Sanders played less than two quarters,  
they had five catches for 90 yards, including a 44-yard touchdown 
by Connell. Kevin Mathis covered him on that play. 
</P>
<P>
	Connell still wasn't impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' he said. ``We weren't clicking. Deion wasn't a  
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong again, Albert.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' impact was felt from the game's first play, when he  
read a handoff to Stephen Davis, broke from his man and tackled the 
running back for a 4-yard loss. It was only his fourth tackle for a 
loss in his 11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' fire raged again on the next play as he slugged Connell  
on the elbow. Some would call it a punch; the devout defensive back 
called it ``laying hands on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't called for a penalty and Sanders probably didn't  
consider it a sin because he had absolved himself in a pre-game 
conversation with Redskins receiver Irvin Fryar, an ordained 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to please excuse me for what I'm about to do,''  
Sanders said. ``I knew I was going out there to fight a little and 
crank it up a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after, Sanders got cranked by two Washington defenders  
during a punt return. Doctors said Sanders suffered a concussion 
and sent him to the locker room to recover. Gailey was told not to 
expect him back. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Washington finished its fourth play of the third quarter,  
No. 21 came trotting out of the tunnel. Seeing a break in action, 
he ran to his spot on the far side of the field in time for the 
next snap. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd barely had time to react, and the Redskins might not  
have either. They had six snaps the rest of that drive and didn't 
test him once. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the doctors weren't going to let me go out there, so I  
ran in straight from the tunnel,'' Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Connell's touchdown got the Redskins within four points, but the  
Cowboys answered with a touchdown that put them up 31-20. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington was forced to punt on its next possession, and that's  
when Sanders came up with the victory-sealing touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	While celebrating the score, someone told Gailey that Sanders  
wasn't even supposed to be playing. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippoussis, Chang Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Mark Philippoussis, playing only his  
fifth match since knee surgery in July, beat Gianluca Pozzi 6-4, 
4-6, 7-5 Monday to advance to the second round of the Eurocard 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis injured his knee in a quarterfinal match against  
Pete Sampras in Wimbledon. He tried to come back in August, losing 
in the first round in Indianapolis, and did not play again until 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to come back too soon, I definitely wasn't ready,''  
said Philippoussis, who was a U.S. Open finalist in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am definitely ready now,'' the Australian said after  
dispatching Pozzi, an Italian qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next round, Philippoussis plays top-ranked Andre Agassi.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I play good tennis, it's going to be tough for him. It's  
also going to be tough for me, but I'm looking forward to it,'' 
said Philippoussis, who is 3-2 since his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been training extremely hard, feeling physically great.  
It does take a couple of matches, just playing those tough points. 
I played the tough points extremely well today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi and all other seeded players had a bye into the second  
round. Apart from Sampras, Patrick Rafter and Carlos Moya, who are 
injured, all other top ranked players are at the $2.45 million 
tournament, one of the so-called Super 9 series. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matches, two Americans advanced. Michael Chang beat  
Rainer Schuettler 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 and Chris Woodruff defeated 
Francisco Clavet 6-1, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Former Ala. QB Killed With Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Robert Fraley's association with sports  
in college was as a quarterback for Alabama. On the professional 
level he represented some of the biggest names in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his clients were NFL coaches Bill Parcells, Bill Cowher,  
Dan Reeves and Joe Gibbs. There was Seattle Seahawks defensive 
tackle Cortez Kennedy and New York Mets pitcher Orel Hershiser. 
From golf there was Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley, 46, was aboard Stewart's Learjet 35 when it crashed  
Monday. They were killed along with another agent and two pilots en 
route to Texas, where Stewart was scheduled to play in the PGA Tour 
Championship this weekend in Houston. The plane crashed after 
flying uncontrolled and off course. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley's father, Charles, said his son and Stewart were good  
friends who often golfed together and at one time lived near each 
other in the same Orlando, Fla., subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were real close. In fact, Robert was godfather to his  
children,'' Charles Fraley said in a phone interview from his 
Winchester, Tenn., home. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Fraley knew his son was traveling Monday to Dallas,  
and when he heard news reports, he immediately called 
daughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just figured it out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Charles Fraley said he would remember his son as ``a straight  
fellow'' who had accomplished much in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells declined comment on Fraley's death. They were friends  
since 1983, when Parcells became a client of Fraley's. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley was nicknamed the ``Winchester Rifle'' during his career  
as a quarterback at Franklin County High School. He enrolled at 
Alabama in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	But shortly after Fraley arrived, coach Bear Bryant switched to  
the run-oriented wishbone offense. That, combined with a shoulder 
injury that required three surgeries, hindered his Alabama career. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always a real competitor, and very smart,'' said Mal  
Moore, Fraley's position coach at Alabama. ``He would have had a 
great career, if not for the injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the fourth-string quarterback in 1974, Fraley saw game action  
against Tennessee when the other three Tide quarterbacks were 
injured. Gary Rutledge and Richard Todd were on the sidelines in 
street clothes and Jack O'Rear was injured in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley took over and led the Crimson Tide to a 28-6 win in front  
of a hometown crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``My memories of him will be of our friendship and of seeing him  
coming off the field after that Tennessee game,'' Moore said. ``How 
happy and proud he was, I'll always remember it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He started the next week against TCU, throwing for two  
touchdowns and running for another in a 41-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama coach Mike DuBose, a teammate of Fraley's, said he also  
remembered the Tennessee game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a leader,'' he said. ``I vividly remember that game in  
Knoxville when he led us to victory. His passing is a tremendous 
loss for the Alabama family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After earning his law degree from Alabama in 1975, Fraley moved  
to Orlando to start a practice, eventually becoming chief executive 
officer of Leader Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He also represented several Alabama coaches, including Ray  
Perkins, Bill Curry, Steve Sloan and Wimp Sanderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a tremendously bright, talented young man,'' said  
Alabama interim athletic director Finus Gaston, who was a football 
manager when Fraley played. ``It's a tragedy both personally and in 
the world of athletics.''

<HEADLINE> Charged Principal Led Double Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Over the past six years, Principal Margaret  
Loder-Healy has earned distinction for helping her small-town New 
Hampshire elementary school become the state's best. 
</P>
<P>
	But she was leading what authorities say was a double life,  
making early morning trips to a methadone clinic, shoplifting and 
getting busted in connection with a heroin ring. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 46-year-old mother of two appeared in a  
Massachusetts court and pleaded innocent to a misdemeanor drug 
possession charge filed in connection with a heroin ring. 
Loder-Healy was released on her own recognizance. She declined to 
talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Elliot Lobel declined to discuss the  
allegations, but said, ``The charges are extremely upsetting to 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Loder-Healy would face up to a year in jail, a  
fine of up to $100,000 and up to a year of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say she was both a role model to hundreds of  
children and a desperate woman whose battle with addictions and 
brushes with the law remained hidden until federal agents 
implicated her in the drug ring after an undercover investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Loder-Healy, who lives in Merrimac, near the New Hampshire line,  
has been principal at Memorial Elementary School in Newton, N.H., a 
town of about 4,000, for six years. In 1997, a committee of New 
Hampshire educators named it the state's best elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	That image is at odds with Loder-Healy's alleged involvement in  
a drug network that yielded nearly a kilogram of heroin after an 
eight-month probe by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	She is accused of possessing heroin on April 27 in North  
Andover. Authorities have not elaborated on her alleged role. 
</P>
<P>
	When the school district learned of the charges earlier this  
month, Loder-Healy was placed on administrative leave with pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is hard for people to believe, but we really had  
no idea,'' said Nancy Ouellette, a receptionist for the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't Loder-Healy's first brush with the law.  
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, she was arrested in January after  
walking out of a Sears store with $209 worth of baby clothes and 
other merchandise. She pleaded guilty to shoplifting in March and 
was fined $200. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, North Andover police were called to the Butcher Boy,  
where a woman had tried to take $40 worth of meat but fled when 
confronted by employees. Police traced the registration of the 
escaping car to Loder-Healy, who was summoned to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Before school, Loder-Healy often visited Habit Management  
Institute in Lawrence, a methadone clinic for recovering heroin 
addicts, sources familiar with the clinic told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the allegations, HMI released a statement  
saying in part: ``Whether public servant, cooperative leader or 
stay-at-home parent, heroin addiction and its recovery affects all 
citizens equally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School Superintendent James Weiss said parents are getting  
weekly updates on the case and that students have reacted with 
``curiosity and confusion'' to the arrest of their principal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about how Mrs. Healy is accused of something  
that is a bad thing,'' he said. ``All we can do is tell them the 
difference between rumor and fact, and that she's innocent until 
proven guilty.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Name Provider Can't Be Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A company that registers Internet domain  
names can't be sued for approving the name of a ``cybersquatter'' 
that violates another firm's trademark, a federal appeals court 
ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions Inc., the principal registrar of names ending  
in .com, doesn't control or monitor the millions of names it 
approves and is not legally responsible when the approval results 
in a trademark infringement, said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling recognizes the need for speedy, high-volume  
registrations of domain names, said Ronald L. Johnston, lawyer for 
Network Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the government office that takes a year or more to review  
and approve trademarks, ``Network Solutions doesn't review the 
names that people are trying to register,'' Johnston said. ``This 
is critical to the growth of the commercial Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the latest of several recent rulings on cybersquatters,  
who take advantage of first-come, first-served Internet domain 
registration by claiming prominent names in hopes of getting 
companies to pay large sums for them. The court, which oversees 
federal courts in California and eight other Western states, has 
generally rejected major companies' claims of broad legal rights to 
protect their trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's case involved a suit by Lockheed Martin Corp., whose  
well-known Skunk Works laboratory in Palmdale designs aircraft for 
the government. Network Solutions, one of several companies that 
register domain names after screening for duplications, has 
registered a dozen names containing some variation of ``skunk 
works,'' a phrase previously trademarked by Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., sued Network Solutions  
in 1996 after getting no response to its request to cancel the 
registrations. The suit sought damages for trademark infringement 
and an order barring all such domain names except Lockheed's. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson of Los Angeles dismissed the  
suit and was upheld by the appeals court in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions exercises no more control over the domain  
names it registers than the U.S. Postal Services provides when it 
sends mail to a street address, said the opinion by Judge Stephen 
Trott. He said a company accused of taking part in trademark 
infringement is responsible only if it performed ``direct control 
and monitoring'' of the infringing action. 
</P>
<P>
	David Quinto, lawyer for Lockheed Martin, said Network Solutions  
was performing the same role as the trademark office and should be 
judged by the same rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not asking NSI to screen every domain name, but once we  
come to NSI and tell them about an infringing domain name, NSI 
should be liable'' for failing to act, he said.

<HEADLINE> Fake Policeman Pulls Over Real Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man pretending to be a detective was arrested  
after he pulled over a motorist who turned out to be a police 
officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Daly, 27, flicked on a flashing red police light in his  
white Nissan and pulled over a car at 34th Street and Madison 
Avenue in Manhattan about 2:45 p.m. Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly -- wearing a bulletproof vest and flaunting a fake  
detective's shield and replica gun -- then allegedly walked up to 
the car of Officer Anthony Ferrone and told him he had run a red 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Ferrone said he was a police officer, Daly ran back  
to his car and sped off. But Ferrone soon chased him down, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was being held today on charges of impersonating a police  
officer and criminal possession of a weapon and a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to jail,'' said Officer Kevin Tyrrell, a police  
department spokesman. ``You can't let the guy who thinks he's a cop 
go. He'll go back to being a cop again.''

<HEADLINE> Murals of Saint Defaced in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- About a dozen streetside murals of the Virgin  
of Guadalupe have been defaced in a Hispanic neighborhood in recent 
weeks, disturbing those who revere the patron saint of Mexico as 
their protector. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, for example, at the El Principio market in South  
Central Los Angeles, an image of the Virgin was covered with bars 
of black paint. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James Forsen of St. John the Baptist Catholic Church  
said he believes the vandalism is the work of ``someone who has 
emotional problems and thinks they're evoking God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Virgin of Guadalupe is believed to have first appeared in  
1531 to a Mexican Indian named Juan Diego in the hills outside 
Mexico City and has been revered for centuries by Roman Catholics, 
particularly Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	In modern days, the dark-skinned Virgin is typically depicted in  
a royal green robe and surrounded by a bright halo. 
</P>
<P>
	Her image is printed on T-shirts and tattooed on gang members  
seeking her protection. Business owners use the image more 
literally to protect their storefronts from vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these businesses paint it because 80 percent of our  
kids here who would be responsible for graffiti are gangsters and 
they are not going to disrespect her like that,'' police Officer 
Cathy Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Gonzalez Party Supplies, a mural of the Virgin was painted on  
the store to deter graffiti from ``cholos,'' or Mexican gang 
members. But manager Elvia Partida said that about a month ago 
someone splashed it with white paint. 
</P>
<P>
	The image was restored, but the vandals struck again, covering  
the Virgin's face and using blue paint to write ``666'' and ``La 
Bestia,'' which is Spanish for the devil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somebody who doesn't believe in her, I guess,'' Partida  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Partida said the vandalism started after a shawl imprinted with  
an image of the Virgin arrived for a three-month tour of Los 
Angeles-area churches.

<HEADLINE> Sen. John Chafee Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- John Chafee, Rhode Island's longtime  
Republican senator and former governor who earned praise even from 
Democrats for his moderate stance on issues, has died. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee died of heart failure Sunday night at Bethesda Naval  
Hospital in Maryland, spokesman John Goodman said. He had fallen 
ill and gone to the hospital earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee had announced earlier this year that he would not seek a  
fifth Senate term in 2000. His son Lincoln is seeking the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on who will fill his Senate seat.  
Under state law, it is up to the governor to appoint someone to 
temporarily fill the vacancy until next year's general election. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag flying above the White House was lowered to half-staff  
after news of Chafee's death arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rhode Island and America have lost a great leader and a fine  
human being,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Chafee proved that politics can be an honorable  
profession,'' Clinton said. ``He embodied the decent center which 
has carried America from triumph to triumph for over 200 years.'' 
At a time of increasing partisan acrimony, the president lauded the 
Republican Chafee as a model legislator who ``always put his 
concern for the American people above partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A scion of one of Rhode Island's most powerful families, Chafee  
was perhaps the most popular Republican in the history of this 
overwhelmingly Democratic state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great loss,'' said Rep. Robert Weygand, D-R.I.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was my best friend in the Senate. I will miss him dearly,''  
said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to terms in the senate, he served six years as  
governor, 3 1/2 years as secretary of the Navy and six years as a 
state representative, including four as House minority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered one of the Senate's most liberal Republicans, Chafee  
earned high praise from both the American Civil Liberties Union and 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Republican Party's point man on health care and  
drafted several proposals in the 1990s designed to provide coverage 
to all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	His death creates a vacancy at the head of the Senate Public  
Works and Environment Committee. The senator in line to replace him 
by seniority, Bob Smith of New Hampshire, is a 
Republican-turned-independent, and presumably would have difficulty 
persuading the GOP to install him as chairman. The next senior 
Republican is Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee played a large role for a minority member in the passage  
of the 1988 law against ocean dumping, the 1989 oil spill law and 
the 1990 Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	He also backed the Rio treaties on global climate change and  
biodiversity. Environmentalists often were among the biggest 
contributors to his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Representing a state with a large Roman Catholic constituency,  
Chafee also was an adamant advocate of abortion rights and opposed 
the ``gag rule,'' which prohibited doctors at federally funded 
clinics from discussing abortion with their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	He supported an end to the ban on gays in the military and  
angered conservatives when he pushed for a ban on the manufacture, 
sale and possession of handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chafee proved to be a stubborn partisan on votes against  
President Clinton's budget in 1993 and for George Bush's 1991 
nomination of Clarence Thomas to be a Supreme Court associate 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee also joined the filibuster against Clinton's 1993  
stimulus package and he backed the North American Free Trade 
Agreement to the disappointment of Rhode Island's unions. 
</P>
<P>
	His liberal leanings, however, cost Chafee his post as chairman  
of the Senate Republican Conference -- the No. 3 position in the GOP 
leadership -- in 1990. Thad Cochran of Mississippi defeated Chafee 
22-21 in a GOP election. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chafee announced in March that he wouldn't run for a fifth  
term in 2000, his voice broke as he told a news conference, ``I 
want to come home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked the predominantly Democratic electorate who  
consistently sent him to Washington. ``They seek, as I do, 
bipartisan solutions to problems, rather than partisan gridlock,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln Chafee, mayor of Warwick, launched his own bid for his  
father's Senate seat shortly after his father's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on Oct. 22, 1922, Chafee lived in Rhode Island for much of  
his life. The Chafee family has long been one of the five most 
influential in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee served in the Marine Corps during World War II and took  
part in the invasion of Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomon 
Islands in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	After his military service, Chafee attended Yale University  
where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1947. He then earned a law 
degree at Harvard in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was recalled to active military duty in 1951 and  
commanded a rifle company in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a practicing attorney from 1952 through 1962 and spent  
the last six of those years as a member of Rhode Island's part-time 
legislature. From 1959 through 1962, Chafee was House minority 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, he was elected governor by 398 votes. He then was  
re-elected in 1964 and 1966, both by the largest margins in state 
history at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was defeated when he sought a fourth term in 1968. The  
following year, he became secretary of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	He held that post until 1972, when he made an unsuccessful  
Senate bid, losing to Democrat Claiborne Pell. But Chafee came back 
to win an open Senate seat in 1976 and won re-election in 1982, 
1988 and 1994.

<P>
	Representing a state with a large Roman Catholic constituency,  
Chafee also was an adamant advocate of abortion rights and opposed 
the ``gag rule,'' which prohibited doctors at federally funded 
clinics from discussing abortion with their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	He supported an end to the ban on gays in the military and  
angered conservatives when he pushed for a ban on the manufacture, 
sale and possession of handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chafee proved to be a stubborn partisan on votes against  
President Clinton's budget in 1993 and for George Bush's 1991 
nomination of Clarence Thomas to be a Supreme Court associate 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee also joined the filibuster against Clinton's 1993  
stimulus package and he backed the North American Free Trade 
Agreement to the disappointment of Rhode Island's unions. 
</P>
<P>
	His liberal leanings, however, cost Chafee his post as chairman  
of the Senate Republican Conference -- the No. 3 position in the GOP 
leadership -- in 1990. Thad Cochran of Mississippi defeated Chafee 
22-21 in a GOP election. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chafee announced in March that he wouldn't run for a fifth  
term in 2000, his voice broke as he told a news conference, ``I 
want to come home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked the predominantly Democratic electorate who  
consistently sent him to Washington. ``They seek, as I do, 
bipartisan solutions to problems, rather than partisan gridlock,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, President Clinton praised him as a ``tireless  
champion of the environment'' and cited his work to expand health 
care to women and children and improving services for the disabled. 
``It is truly a rich legacy for America,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln Chafee, mayor of Warwick, launched his own bid for his  
father's Senate seat shortly after his father's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on Oct. 22, 1922, Chafee lived in Rhode Island for much of  
his life. The Chafee family has long been one of the five most 
influential in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee served in the Marine Corps during World War II and took  
part in the invasion of Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomon 
Islands in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	After his military service, Chafee attended Yale University  
where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1947. He then earned a law 
degree at Harvard in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was recalled to active military duty in 1951 and  
commanded a rifle company in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a practicing attorney from 1952 through 1962 and spent  
the last six of those years as a member of Rhode Island's part-time 
legislature. From 1959 through 1962, Chafee was House minority 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, he was elected governor by 398 votes. He then was  
re-elected in 1964 and 1966, both by the largest margins in state 
history at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was defeated when he sought a fourth term in 1968. The  
following year, he became secretary of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	He held that post until 1972, when he made an unsuccessful  
Senate bid, losing to Democrat Claiborne Pell. But Chafee came back 
to win an open Senate seat in 1976 and won re-election in 1982, 
1988 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Chief Seeks Forgiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a surprisingly conciliatory speech,  
defense chief Gen. Wiranto asked for forgiveness today for brutal 
crackdowns on dissent in Indonesia and said divisions between the 
military and the people must be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiranto spoke to 10,000 soldiers and riot police who safeguarded  
Indonesia's legislative assembly as it held its first free and open 
session this year after decades of rubber-stamping authoritarian 
leaders' decisions. The security forces were involved in several 
clashes with protesters, mostly students, that left dozens injured 
and several dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sorry for the victims, and we will pray for them,''  
said Wiranto, who was dressed in fatigues. ``We ask for forgiveness 
from people who feel we did wrong, from the victims, from the 
students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers and police gathered in a soccer stadium near  
parliament had been boisterous. But they sat quietly as Wiranto 
asked for forgiveness, then bowed their heads as Wiranto prayed for 
the victims and led 30 seconds of silence for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful military has long had strong influence in the  
political process -- an influence critics say should be curtailed. 
In addition to violence against protesters, the military has been 
blamed for supporting pro-Jakarta militias that went on a rampage 
in East Timor after the territory voted to break away from 
Indonesia. But the military has been largely unapologetic for its 
past actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiranto had been considered a top candidate for the vice  
presidency, but he dropped out shortly before Indonesia's top 
legislative body elected Megawati Sukarnoputri to the No. 2 post 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear if he made a deal for a top position in exchange  
for his withdrawal. But there is speculation he will not retain his 
defense post when new President Abdurrahman Wahid announces his 
Cabinet in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, would not  
comment on his prospects today, telling reporters after his speech: 
``The best man will hold the post.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the speech, Wiranto called for internal reform within the  
military and the police force and said they must join together with 
the people to work toward developing poverty-stricken Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The national reform process, which followed the ouster of  
President Suharto in May 1998 after 32 years of autocratic rule, 
has been successful so far, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is the reform process for?'' he said. ``The reform process  
is for the people, not for the president, not for the head of the 
military, but for the people only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He warned the security forces not to take inappropriate actions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't do wrong. Our people, our constitution, our law must be  
protected,'' he said. ``A gun for the enemy, not for the people.''

<HEADLINE> Existing Home Sales Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans bought fewer existing homes in  
September, deterred by higher mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd. 
It was the third straight monthly decline, although such home sales 
are still heading toward a banner year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of existing single-family homes fell by 2.1 percent last  
month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.13 million units, 
the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Yet association 
officials said they expect existing homes sales this year to set a 
new record of 5.20 million units, up 4.8 percent over the 1998 
record of 4.97 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decline will not hurt the potential for a record year in  
home sales,'' said James Smith, the association's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because low unemployment, tame inflation and stock and  
bond market gains continue to make Americans feel wealthy and 
comfortable about making purchases, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	September's 5.13 million annual rate of existing home sales is  
3.4 percent higher than the level a year earlier, the association 
said. September's sales marked the 11th straight month in which 
existing home sales were above the 5-million annual rate level. 
</P>
<P>
	The bite in September sales came mainly from rising mortgage  
rates, association officials and private economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much clearer now that higher mortgage rates are taking  
their toll on existing housing activity,'' said Richard Yamarone, 
senior economist with Argus Research Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate was 7.82 percent in  
September, up from 6.72 percent a year earlier, but lower than 
August's 7.94 percent rate, the association said, citing figures 
from Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans' borrowing costs rose when the Federal Reserve bumped  
up short-term interest rates in June and August to slow the economy 
and keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd, which raked the East Coast in September, also  
helped depress sales, private economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	September's performance was the worst showing since May, when 5  
million units were sold. Sales fell 4 percent in July and 3 percent 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	September's 5.13 million annual rate was 8.9 percent lower than  
in June, when sales hit an all-time high annual rate of 5.63 
million units, said Merrill Lynch economist Karen Dexter. ``We 
expect to see a further decline,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the Northeast took the biggest hit, falling 15.5  
percent to an annual rate of 600,000 units. Sales were down in the 
Midwest by 5.1 percent to an annual rate of 1.12 million units, 
while sales in the South dropped 2 percent to an annual rate of 
1.99 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the West rose 8.33 percent to an annual rate of 1.43  
million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates and the storm also caused a 3.2 percent decrease in  
new home and apartment construction in September, the second 
monthly decline, the government said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The national median sales price for existing homes, meanwhile,  
rose 3.9 percent to $134,500 in September over the same month a 
year ago, the association said. The median is the point at which 
half the homes sell for less and half sell for more. However, 
September's median price was 2.1 percent lower than August's median 
price.

<HEADLINE> Winfrey Runs for Cancer Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wearing No. 974, Oprah Winfrey was the center  
of attention at a fund-raising run for breast cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to pick the flattest places to run,'' joked Winfrey, who  
covered the 3.1 mile course Sunday in about 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm out of shape, so it felt hard,'' she said. ``But you feel  
so good when it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey, a former Milwaukee resident, tried to redirect some of  
the attention onto women who wore pink hats that indicated they are 
breast cancer survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey cited the case of Judy Pickett of Milwaukee, a survivor  
of breast cancer who has accomplished a goal of making it to all 98 
of the Races for the Cure that have been held around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The credit goes to people like Judy Pickett,'' Winfrey said.  
``I just rolled out of bed.''

<HEADLINE> American Express Profits Up 13 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express Co. said Monday its profits  
rose 13 percent in the third quarter as travel and financial 
services posted strong results. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express earned $648 million, or $1.42 a share, matching  
analysts' average estimate, according to a survey by First Call 
Corp. The company earned $574 million, or $1.25 a share, in the 
third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenues totaled $4.9 billion vs. $4.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company said its travel services division  
reported $413 million in net income, up 14 percent from the 
year-ago period. Profits from the financial advisory business also 
were up 14 percent to $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of American Express fell $5.25 to $143.37 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, American Express reported  
net income of $1.9 billion, or $4.09 a share, up from $1.6 billion, 
or $3.47 a share, for the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue totaled $10.8 billion vs. $9.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Receives Soldiers' Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remains believed to be those of four American  
servicemen killed in the Korean War were flown to an Army 
laboratory in Hawaii on Monday after being released to U.S. 
officials in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains will be studied at the Central Identification  
Laboratory at Hickam Air Force Base in hopes of confirming their 
identities, possibly through the use of mitochondrial DNA, the 
Pentagon announced. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief repatriation ceremony at the airport in Pyongyang,  
the North Korean capital, the four sets of remains were handed over 
to a U.S. delegation led by Robert L. Jones, deputy assistant 
secretary of defense for POW-MIA affairs. They were flown to Yokota 
Air Base, Japan, and then to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The repatriation had been delayed for months by North Korea's  
insistence that instead of handing over the remains in the 
Demilitarized Zone that separates north and south Korea in the 
presence of United Nations Command personnel, the exchange be done 
in Pyongyang as a strictly U.S.-North Korean event. U.S. officials 
earlier this month agreed to that demand in order to get the 
remains back. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,200 U.S. servicemen are still listed as missing from the  
1950-53 Korean War. In the past three years, the United States has 
recovered the remains believed to be those of 39 Americans. Of 
those, three have been positively identified and returned to their 
families for U.S. burial. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. recovery team is currently in North Korea searching for  
more remains. 
</P>
<P>
	The four sets of remains turned over in Pyongyang on Monday were  
recovered during a joint U.S.-North Korean excavation earlier this 
year. The Pentagon believes the four soldiers were killed in late 
November or early December 1950 in battles at the Chongchon River 
in North Korea, where the American 8th Army suffered the brunt of 
China's initial entry into the war and lost hundreds of men.

<HEADLINE> Serbs, Montenegrins Discuss Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ultranationalist Serb officials and  
leaders of Yugoslavia's other republic -- pro-Western Montenegro -- 
failed Monday to agree on the federation's future. 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate meeting with the U.S. Balkan envoy in Hungary, a  
former Yugoslav premier called for more Western help for Serbia's 
democratic opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan Panic said after meeting with U.S. Balkan envoy James  
Dobbins that if Washington wants President Slobodan Milosevic out 
of power, U.S. troops should go get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Serb speaking,'' Panic said. ``I know this is  
internationally unacceptable, but if you want him so bad, don't 
punish me, I am hungry, take him out, get him out, force him out, 
do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Kemp, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Budapest, confirmed  
the meeting and said Dobbins ``encouraged full cooperation'' among 
the divided opposition movement and ``expressed full U.S. support 
for their efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No agreement was reached at the start of two days of talks  
between the Montenegrin and Serb ruling parties on how to overcome 
a rift between the two republics that could lead to Montenegro's 
secession. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, representatives of Milosevic's Socialist party and  
its neo-Communist allies planned to meet in the Yugoslav capital 
with officials of Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of 
Socialists to continue the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro is demanding more independence from Milosevic's  
autocratic regime, which is suffering under stringent international 
political and economic isolation following a violent 18-month 
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the separatist Serb province of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro's leadership has warned it will organize an  
independence referendum unless Milosevic and Serbia democratize and 
allow it more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	After 90 minutes of talks at the Montenegrin seaside resort of  
Sveti Stefan, the Montenegrins and members of the Serbian 
ultranationalist Radical Party admitted they had ``completely 
different'' stands on the future of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro has called for Yugoslavia to be renamed and turned  
into a loose confederation of two autonomous states -- virtually 
eliminating Belgrade's influence over the smaller republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Serb officials have said Montenegro would be free to leave  
if its citizens vote for secession. But Serbia's vice premier, 
ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj warned last weekend that 
Montenegro's departure from the federation would lead to a bloody 
war.

<HEADLINE> Dell Passes Compaq in U.S. PC sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp. easily surpassed  
rival Compaq Computer Corp. in U.S. personal computer sales last 
quarter -- the first time Dell has held such a commanding lead over 
its Texas rival, two research firms said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The upcoming holiday season is likely to test Dell's staying  
power, however, as consumers cast their votes on whether they 
prefer to buy PCs over the Internet or from traditional 
brick-and-mortar stores, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq traditionally has had an edge in the fourth quarter  
because it's in retail,'' said John Brown, research director at 
International Data Corp. ``What you see is a lot easier to buy than 
what you don't see. Dell usually doesn't get much of a kick because 
they're on the Internet, but consumers more and more are looking at 
both and weighing their options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, sold nearly 2 million PCs from  
July through September, grabbing a 17.1 percent share of the U.S. 
market, up from a 13.4 percent in the same quarter a year ago, 
according to research firm Dataquest, a unit of Gartner Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, based in Houston, sold 1.78 million computers, giving it  
a 15.3 percent share of the market. Compaq's share a year ago was 
15 percent. IDC also said Dell finished ahead of Compaq in the 
July-September period. 
</P>
<P>
	IDC had reported that Dell squeaked past Compaq in the second  
quarter by one-tenth of a percentage in terms of marketshare, 
though Dataquest said the third quarter was the first time Dell was 
on top. Both noted, though, that Compaq continued to hold the lead 
for global sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going forward, it's going to be a neck-and-neck race. Unless  
somebody slips up, they're going to be going at each other's 
throats in Texas for months to come,'' Brown said. ``That should be 
good for consumers ... because value is probably going to be one of 
the single-most important factors in choosing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell is in a position of strength because its direct sales model  
reduces costs by being more efficient, said Charles Smulders, 
principal analyst for Dataquest's worldwide PC program. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's strategy of providing made-to-order computers is  
generating more than $30 million in sales a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies that keep large inventories on hand are forced  
to pass on some of those storage costs to consumers or suffer from 
weaker earnings, Smulders added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dell now is moving on to what we call the next generation of  
PC market economics ... which focuses on driving down the cost per 
sale. One way to do that is to drive down internal costs.'' 
Smulders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway also is moving toward the next generation model, he  
said, a reason its sales jumped 40 percent in the quarter. That 
boosted the direct seller, with its more than 200 Gateway Country 
stores, to third place with a 9.3 percent U.S. market share, up 
from 8.2 percent a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide PC shipments rose 23.2 percent to 28.6 million units  
in the third quarter amid strong U.S. sales and rebounding demand 
in Asia, Dataquest said. IDC reported global PC sales jumped 25 
percent to 27.9 million units. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is benefiting from the surge in sales. IBM Corp.  
saw its share of the U.S. market fall to 7.6 percent from 8.9 
percent, while its worldwide share fell even more sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the numbers reinforce problems IBM has had selling  
its money-losing Aptiva line. IBM, now in fifth place domestically 
and third globally, announced last week that beginning next year it 
would sell Aptivas only over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq and Hewlett-Packard Co., which landed in fourth place,  
suffered because recent changes in corporate leadership now have 
executives at those firms focusing more on profitability than 
market share, Smulders said.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Auctions Models' Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Beautiful models offered their eggs for sale  
in an Internet auction Monday, touching off a fierce debate over 
the ethics of what is being called ``Darwin at his very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronsangels.com, a Web site run by fashion photographer and  
Arabian horse breeder Ron Harris, is aimed at parents who want 
good-looking babies -- and who would pay up to $150,000 for the 
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is distasteful, but it can't be stopped and it shouldn't be  
stopped. If people want to spend $150,000 for the eggs of a 
gorgeous woman who has an IQ of 68, let them,'' fertility expert 
Bill Handel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 5 million hits the site received by midday Monday, there  
were four or five bids for the three models featured, Harris said. 
At least one bid, for $42,000, appeared legitimate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site contains glamorous photos of the women and boasts  
that the models are in excellent health. But no information about 
their intelligence, education or medical history was provided. Two 
of the models said they were single, one said she was married with 
a 5-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris contends that being beautiful can lead to a successful  
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Darwin at his very best. It's the butterfly that's the  
prettiest that gets the guys,'' said the 66-year-old father of 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	Others took issue with the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unethical and it's distasteful,'' said Sean Tipton of the  
American Society of Reproductive Medicine. ``I think this Web site 
is mostly going to attract adolescent boys. It's not hard for 
13-year-old boys to make bids on these eggs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a crapshoot anyway. Just because you have an egg from a  
beautiful woman doesn't mean you'll have a beautiful kid,'' said 
Handel, founder of the Beverly Hills-based Center for Surrogate 
Parenting Inc. and Egg Donation Inc. His firm has 350 women in its 
database and they get $2,500 to $3,000 for an egg. 
</P>
<P>
	Handel said his donors want to help couples become parents and  
the money is for the inconvenience. He said families seeking his 
help are concerned about the egg donor's intelligence and genetic 
and disease history. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility specialists are increasingly concerned about putting  
a price tag on human eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the Repository for Germinal Choice's ``Nobel sperm  
bank'' opened in Escondido. Its founder believed that intelligence 
could be bred and originally accepted sperm only from Nobel Prize 
winners. Later the center accepted sperm from nonscientists whose 
IQ was at least 140. The bank took credit for fathering more than 
200 children. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a couple advertised that they would pay  
$50,000 for eggs from an athletic student from a top college. Ads 
appeared in student newspapers at schools such as Harvard, 
Princeton and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6 million Americans face infertility problems and egg  
donors are often the best chance for them to become parents. 
Federal law forbids the purchase and sale of human organs, but 
sperm and egg transactions are legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris is not a doctor or scientist. The Malibu resident is a  
longtime fashion photographer who has also produced the 
``Aerobicise'' and ``20 Minute Workout'' videos and directed TV 
specials for Playboy Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction will last up to several months, with each model  
deciding how long the bidding for her eggs will go and what price 
she will accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said the egg auction is an opportunity for parents to  
give their children a head start in a society that worships beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been around beautiful women my whole life and I think  
they have power most of us will never understand,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	He figures his site can sell up to $2 million worth of eggs. His  
take: 20 percent, or $400,000.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Season Reaches New Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints have set the standard  
for low points over their 33 seasons in the NFL. There have been 
years of losing and a 1-15 season. They are the only NFL team to 
never win a playoff game and once had a losing streak that reduced 
a tearful coach to quitting in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Could things get even worse?  
</P>
<P>
	``This is about my lowest point,'' coach Mike Ditka said Monday.  
``I can't let it get me any lower. I'm carrying a weight right now 
of this football team and this organization. I'm carrying the 
weight of people's aspirations and ambitions and right now we're 
not doing a very good job of carrying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints' 31-3 loss to the New York Giants may have been their  
most embarrassing of the season. After all, New York (4-3), had 
been limited to 84 points, which included 21 by the defense and 
special teams, before New Orleans turned so generous. That's six 
offensive touchdowns in the first six games -- four against the 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Saints' fifth consecutive loss and their ninth  
straight on the road under Ditka, who is 13-25 in New Orleans, 4-15 
in the last 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints (1-5) have scored only once in the fourth quarter  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't do anything right,'' tackle William Roaf said. ``You  
build up to a game, then you go out and nothing happens. You can't 
hold a lead late. You fall behind, and you can't catch up. Is this 
my lowest time as a Saint? I can't think of a lower one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roaf, a five-time Pro Bowl starter, said he would welcome a  
trade after consecutive 6-10 seasons and this year's start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love New Orleans,'' said Roaf, who has four years left on  
his contract worth approximately $13.9 million. ``But I don't plan 
to play football much longer anyway. A few more years. It's too 
much ego and politics. We have to deal with trying to play 
football, and then you have to deal with the egos involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roaf will finish his career in New Orleans, Ditka said Monday,  
adding the outburst is just another sign of the mounting pressure 
on everyone with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's frustration,'' Ditka said. ``And everybody is  
frustrated. It's no fun, gang, as you know and the fans know and 
everybody else knows. It's no fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Williams, who has gone from the most prolific rusher in  
college history to averaging just 67 yards a game in the NFL, 
finally had a big game, gaining 111 yards on 24 carries. But 80 of 
the yards came in the second half, 30 minutes of garbage time after 
New York had taken a 24-3 lead and was perfectly content to play 
looser and let Williams run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	It also looked as if Williams would have his first NFL  
touchdown, but a 6-yard scoring run was negated by a holding 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sickening,'' said quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, who  
threw three interceptions in the loss. ``Losing makes you want to 
puke.''

<HEADLINE> Maryland Bids Liberty Tree Adieu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Several hundred people gathered in a  
solemn ceremony today as crews began cutting down the last of the 
Liberty Trees -- where American colonists once incited rebellion 
against the British. 
</P>
<P>
	The 400-year-old tulip poplar on the campus of St. John's  
College, already heavily decayed, was irreversibly damaged by 
Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Wreaths were laid at the base of the tree and at the base of a  
100-year-old offspring that stands about a hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel a great sense of sadness over the duty we must  
perform today,'' said college president Christopher Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said a crack opened by Hurricane Floyd continues to widen  
and nothing could be done to save the tree. It also had suffered 
damage from lightning and earlier hurricanes over the years, and 
was largely held together by concrete and metal cables. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bell tolled 13 times for each of the original colonies,  
crews went to work with chain saws. It was expected to take several 
days to bring down the whole tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said the wood from the tree would be used to make  
mementos for St. John's students and alumni. Cuttings already had 
been taken to start new trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the American Revolution, local chapters of the Sons of  
Liberty met beneath trees in most if not all of the 13 colonies to 
plot resistance to British rule. The trees became a potent 
Revolutionary War symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two were destroyed by British forces, said Edward  
Papenfuse, Maryland state archivist. Others were cut down or lost 
to disease or old age, he said.

<HEADLINE> Smart Car Pulls Ahead in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler's beleaguered Smart  
mini-car moved into the No. 1 spot for sales in its category in 
Germany last month, the first time the two-seater has done so since 
its introduction last year, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A report compiled monthly by a federal agency of new car  
registrations showed the Smart car knocked Renault's Twingo 
subcompact from the top spot in September. It had already surpassed 
Volkswagen's Lupo in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartoonish-looking Smart car, sold only in Europe, is aimed  
at young city-dwellers who have to deal with narrow streets and 
tight parking. But it was plagued early on by technical problems -- 
flipping over during driving tests and skidding on snow -- that 
forced DaimlerChrysler to delay its introduction and make 
additional modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Some buyers also were reportedly put off by the lack of a rear  
seat, which the competition offered in their subcompacts for the 
same price or even less than the Smart. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, DaimlerChrysler lowered its original 1999 Europe-wide  
sales goal of 120,000 units to 80,000, while reaffirming its 
commitment to stick with the project and promising new models. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said it expected to sell 30,000 Smart cars this  
year in Germany alone.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Sign $268B Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After considering rejecting it, President  
Clinton will sign a $268 billion Pentagon spending bill rather than 
face a risky effort to persuade Democrats in Congress to sustain a 
veto, his spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton still has  
concerns about the amount of special-interest spending included in 
the bill, but that he considers the measure's military pay raise a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the president is the one who stood for increasing the  
defense budget, and it's very important that we meet our 
commitments to our national security and our service members at 
home and around the world,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's spokesman said Clinton would veto the  
appropriations bill funding the Commerce, Justice and State 
departments. Administration officials have complained that it 
offered too little for their anti-crime initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said White House officials were confident they could  
have mustered the votes to support a veto of the defense bill, but 
indicated they didn't want a debate that distracted from the 
education and crime issues they have been promoting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving to a debate that is about putting teachers in  
the classroom, that is about putting cops on the street, that is 
about protecting the environment,'' Lockhart said. ``The right 
thing to do is sign this and move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Constitution's 10-day time limit, Clinton had until  
Tuesday to veto the bill or let it automatically become law. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and other Democrats  
in Congress and the administration had urged Clinton to veto the 
measure in an effort to gain leverage in his budget fight with 
Republicans. Two weeks ago, Gephardt had predicted Democrats would 
uphold a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent days, it became unclear whether the White House  
could sustain a veto. That raised the possibility of an 
embarrassing setback for Clinton or a tough lobbying effort that 
could have distracted from the president's overall budget fight 
with the GOP, which focuses on domestic spending priorities and 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's ability to make a veto stick was undermined by  
continued support for the defense bill by Rep. John Murtha of 
Pennsylvania, one of the House's most stalwart pro-defense 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there was reluctance by many Democrats to oppose a  
measure that includes a 4.8 percent pay raise for members of the 
military plus scores of projects for lawmakers' home districts. 
</P>
<P>
		   Earlier today, Lockhart dismissed House Republicans' call for an  
across-the-board spending cut as ``a bad idea'' and said that it 
was at odds with the special interest provisions that lawmakers 
have woven into federal spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, they're suggesting across-the-board cuts,''  
he said. ``Then on the other ... they've done a record number of 
earmarked pork spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders want to impose a 1.4 percent  
across-the-board cut in spending to avoid using Social Security tax 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something that's a bad idea. It abdicates legislators'  
and the president's responsibility to make choices, to set 
priorities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has signed seven of the 13 spending bills to fund the  
government in the 2000 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. He has 
vetoed two -- on foreign aid and the District of Columbia -- and has 
yet to act on three others, including the defense bill. The largest 
spending bill, dealing with education and health and social 
services, remains before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense bill, approved by wide margins in the House and  
Senate, would increase spending by $17.3 billion and raise military 
pay by 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, government agencies whose spending bills have not  
been signed into law are operating under stopgap legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need some compromises. We don't need confrontation right  
now,'' Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget 
Committee, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to me like Dick Gephardt is talking about  
confrontation,'' Domenici said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``He's 
telling the House members, don't help the Republicans with 
anything. He's trying to encourage the president not to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., questioned the reach of  
Gephardt's lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's been used by the left wing of his party, and  
doesn't want to get our work done,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would like to put all the appropriations bills into a big  
bundle and then spend more money. And that's what's happened over 
the years, we're just not going to do that again.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Accuses Bush of Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sen. John McCain accused Republican  
presidential rival George W. Bush on Monday of orchestrating a 
campaign to tarnish his image. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain said he was flattered to get such attention from the  
Texas governor, who is the front-runner for the GOP presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though sometimes it's not so pleasant, it's really  
something that should be a little encouraging, because we are 
closing on him, and that clearly has him unhappy,'' the Arizona 
senator said at a news conference here. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who has gained ground on Bush in the key state of New  
Hampshire, was referring to a New York Times article on Monday that 
portrayed him as hot-tempered and engaged in a feud with Arizona's 
governor, Jane Hull, who has endorsed Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull told the newspaper that her relations with McCain were  
``not particularly warm,'' and that McCain has a short fuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed the Bush campaign for helping plant the story.  
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently the memo has gone out from the Bush campaign to  
start attacking John McCain -- something that I'd hoped wouldn't 
happen,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that these kinds of personal attacks would be  
orchestrated from the Bush campaign, but it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margita Thompson, a spokeswoman for Bush's California campaign,  
said Bush was sticking to the high road. 
</P>
<P>
	``As he has always done, Gov. Bush is running a positive,  
issue-oriented campaign based on his message of improving schools, 
strengthening our national defense and cutting taxes,'' Thompson 
said. ``As he has said before, he likes Sen. McCain as a person, 
and will treat him with respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed on whether Bush had orchestrated the story, she declined  
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he had a temper, McCain said: ``I plead guilty to  
getting angry when I see gross injustices take place such as I see 
happen quite often in the Congress of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``But do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like  
that? No, I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also assailed Bush for launching an advertising campaign  
in Iowa and New Hampshire while declining to participate in debates 
with his Republican rivals. Bush has cited scheduling conflicts as 
reasons for skipping a GOP candidates' forum last Friday in New 
Hampshire, along with one scheduled for Thursday in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's curious that he would somehow feel that people aren't  
interested enough to watch a debate, but they'll want to watch a 
campaign commercial,'' McCain said. ``I hope he'll realize that 
people really are probably more interested in debates than they are 
in paid political commercials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also apologized Monday for campaign aides who barred  
reporters from a fund-raiser earlier in the day in Napa, saying the 
incident violated his own policy of conducting such gatherings 
under news media scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Such openness is important, suggested McCain, who has made  
revamping the campaign finance system a centerpiece of his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all tainted by these allegations -- a system that causes  
us to be suspected of corruption, and that's the unfortunate part 
of it,'' McCain said. ``I have said many times that I have been 
influenced by this system as well.''

<HEADLINE> Pro Golfer Stewart Killed in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A Learjet carrying golf champion Payne Stewart and four other  
people flew uncontrolled over the nation's heartland for hours 
today before crashing in South Dakota, killing everyone aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine plane, which took off from Orlando, Fla., may  
have suffered a pressurization failure during its scheduled flight 
to Dallas, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who lived in Orlando, had been expected in Houston on  
Tuesday for practice rounds in advance of the Tour Championship, 
the PGA Tour's final tournament of the year for the top 30 players 
on its money list. Stewart, known for his trademark knickers and 
tam-o'-shanter hat, went to Southern Methodist University in Dallas 
and still had friends in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to express our sense of shock and sadness over  
the death of Payne Stewart,'' PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem 
said in a statement from PGA headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous loss for the entire golfing community and  
all of sports. He will always be remembered as a very special 
competitor and one who contributed enormously to the positive image 
of professional golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were Stewart agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan and  
the two pilots, said Bill Curry, a spokesman for Stewart's family. 
Fraley was CEO of Leader Enterprises Inc. and Ardan was president 
of the sports management company. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, a Lear 35 built in 1976, took off from Orlando, Fla.,  
at about 9:20 a.m. EDT, and the last communication came was it was 
over Gainesville, Fla., said Tony Molinaro, a Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet had flown as high as 45,000 feet and the crew did not  
respond to repeated inquiries from air traffic controllers, said 
Paul Turk, an FAA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force fighter jet from Tyndall, Fla., was diverted from a  
routine training flight to check out the jet, Air Force officials 
said. Two fighters from Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., then took over 
to follow it and they later handed off the monitoring to two Air 
National Guard F-16s from Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	About four hours after takeoff, the plane crashed in a grassy  
field two miles west of Mina, S.D., in the north-central part of 
the state, said Gene Abdallah, superintendent of the South Dakota 
Highway Patrol. There were no survivors, South Dakota Gov. Bill 
Janklow said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane had pretty much nosed straight into the ground,''  
said Lesley Braun, who lives about two miles from the site. 
``There's not a lot of debris spread out a long ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her husband was among those who saw the plane coming  
down. ``They saw it nose down so they hopped in the vehicle and 
raced towards where it was going down and were the first ones on 
the scene,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one on the ground was hurt, White House spokesman Joe  
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was one of the most recognizable players in golf  
because of his trademark clothing. He won 18 tournaments around the 
world, including three major championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, he won his second U.S. Open, prevailing over Phil  
Mickelson with a 15-foot putt, the longest putt to ever decide that 
championship on the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of the fact that my faith in God is so much stronger  
and I'm so much more at peace with myself than I've ever been in my 
life,'' Stewart said after the win. ``Where I was with my faith 
last year and where I am now is leaps and bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, visitors, including fellow golfer Mark O'Meara, began  
arriving at Stewart's home in an exclusive Orlando community. A 
neighbor, visibly upset, jumped into a car next door. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Jim Henry, retired pastor for First Baptist Church of  
Orlando who used to minister to the Stewart family, was one of 
those outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a wonderful Christian who had Christ in his life and  
somehow in his death,'' Henry said. ``That brought a great sense of 
peace to his family in a difficult and tragic time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and his wife, Tracey, had two children, Chelsea, 13, and  
Aaron, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, fellow golfer Duffy Waldorf, preparing to practice  
today, told KTRH-AM in Houston that he considered turning around 
and going home when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an irreplaceable guy, not just for his playing record,''  
Waldorf said, citing Stewart's unmistakable presence on the course 
and the consistency of his play. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said two FAA officials had been dispatched to the scene  
of the crash, as had a National Transportation Safety Board 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are normally pressurized,  
because passengers would have difficulty breathing the thin air 
above that altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a pressurization problem, those aboard the aircraft  
could slowly lose consciousness or, if an aircraft broke a door or 
window seal, perish in seconds from hypoxia, or oxygen deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Once reaching a cruise altitude, pilots often switch on the  
autopilot. If they passed out, the plane would cruise until it ran 
out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	John Nance, a commercial airline pilot and aviation author, said  
he can't recall an incident in which a civilian jet depressurized 
in flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we have had some incidents in military aviation that  
make this all too sadly familiar, but not in civil aviation,'' he 
said.

                         *Jessie Lee Foveaux    	
</P>
<P>
	MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Jessie Lee Foveaux, whose autobiography  
brought her fame at the age of 98, died Saturday. She was 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Foveaux wrote ``Any Given Day: The Life and Times of Jessie Lee  
Brown Foveaux,'' which began as a memoir that was intended only for 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal about the  
plainspoken tale sparked a bidding war for a book by Foveaux. New 
York-based Warner Books paid Foveaux a seven-figure sum for the 
book in 1998. 
</P>

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- H. Stuart Hughes, peace activist who ran  
against Edward M. Kennedy for the Senate in 1962 to publicize his 
goal of nuclear disarmament, died in San Diego on Thursday. He was 
83. 
</P>
<P>
	The author, historian and political thinker was a professor  
emeritus of the University of California at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes spoke out against American military involvement in  
Vietnam and was vocal about disarmament while a history professor 
at Harvard University in the 1960s. Along with Dr. Benjamin Spock, 
he co-chaired the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy and 
later became chairman of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962's Senate campaign, he ran as an independent with little  
hope for victory, but the campaign allowed him to air his views to 
a wider audience. That was the year Kennedy won the seat for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes wrote eight history books, three collections of essays  
and an autobiography, ``Gentleman Rebel: The Memoirs of H. Stuart 
Hughes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His grandfather was Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maria Ley Piscator, a theater arts teacher and  
director who co-founded a drama workshop attended by Marlon Brando 
and Harry Belafonte, died Oct. 14. She was 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Piscator began her theatrical career as a dancer in Berlin  
and Paris. She later turned to choreography and helped stage 
several productions with Max Reinhardt, including ``A Midsummer 
Night's Eve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She met theatrical director Erwin Piscator, who became her third  
husband, in 1936 while studying literature at the Sorbonne. They 
moved to the United States and founded the Dramatic Workshop at the 
New School for Social Research in Manhattan. Their students 
included Belafonte, Brando and Tony Randall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Piscator directed theatrical productions off-Broadway and  
in Europe. She was the director and founder of small theater 
programs in New York for the elderly, children and others.

of Australia's most influential 20th century artists, died of heart 
disease Saturday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker was among a group of artists in the 1940s and '50s who  
abandoned academic realism in favor of a more raw, internal 
imagery. In 1957, his paintings became the first works by an 
Australian artist to be purchased by New York's Museum of Modern 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Churcher, former director of the National Gallery of  
Australia, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that Tucker's 
surreal wartime works of Melbourne's nightlife revealed a deep 
anger at the effect World War II had on the city.

Cilla Black, died Saturday. He was 57 and had been diagnosed with 
cancer of the lungs and liver.

	Willis was being treated for pneumonia at the time of his death.  
</P>
<P>
	Willis met Miss Black when she was a 15-year-old waitress in

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Push Markets Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spreading a message that every American should  
share in good economic times, President Clinton will travel to four 
states next week to speak on his ``New Markets'' initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton traveled in July from Appalachia to the Mississippi  
Delta, and from the Pine Ridge Indian reservation to inner city Los 
Angeles, to draw attention to pockets of poverty in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of the upcoming tour was how corporations can boost  
local communities, with a special emphasis on encouraging sports 
teams to support the cities where they play. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said a bipartisan  
delegation would accompany Clinton on his trip to Newark, N.J.; 
Hartford, Conn.; Hermitage, Ark.; and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of the first trip was to introduce the private sector  
to the broad range of opportunities in underserved markets around 
the country. The second New Market tour will focus not only on 
where to find that potential, but how to turn that potential into 
long-term partnerships,'' Lockhart said. ``We will focus on a 
number of existing partnerships, including in Newark with local 
sports organizations, throughout the trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton alluded to his plans during the last speech of his July  
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fall we're going to take another tour,'' he told a  
gathering of executives who were discussing ways to open more 
high-tech jobs up to at-risk youths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to start in Newark to challenge the owners of  
professional sports teams and professional athletes to follow the 
example set by the owners of the New Jersey Nets ... who set up the 
ownership of the Nets in a way that 35 percent of the profits of 
the franchise are reinvested in downtown Newark,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip is slated for Nov. 4-5.  
</P>
<P>
	Another example of the partnerships the trip will highlight is a  
tomato cooperative that in 1996 signed an agreement to provide the 
tomatoes used for Burger King sandwiches. The deal not only steered 
Burger King business into a neglected region, but ensured a steady 
supply of tomatoes for the fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's initiative, which he introduced earlier in the year  
before a group of corporate leaders hosted by Jesse Jackson, has 
been gaining momentum. Last week, funding for the linchpin of the 
project was included in the spending bill covering the Housing and 
Urban Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Although neither the House nor the Senate included the funding  
in its original bill, the final version included $20 million to 
establish American Private Investment Companies, which will 
leverage investment in overlooked communities.

<HEADLINE> U.N. World Climate Conference Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder opened the fifth U.N.  
World Climate Conference on Monday with an unexpected call for the 
ratification of an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases 
by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The landmark document known as the Kyoto protocol is aimed at  
reducing greenhouse gases by 5 percent from 1990 levels between 
2008 and 2012. It was agreed to in Kyoto, Japan in 1997, five years 
after 150 countries committed to the general goal of cutting 
emissions at a conference in Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive secretary of the U.N. convention on climate  
change, Michael Zammit Cutajar, called the proposed 2002 deadline 
``an encouraging goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 14 nations, all of them developing countries, have ratified  
the protocol, which must be adopted by 55 nations -- including 
industrialized nations that account for the production of 55 
percent of the world's greenhouse gases -- before it can become 
legally binding. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate, which recently failed to ratify an  
international nuclear test ban treaty, has said it won't take the 
Kyoto protocol up until there is measurable participation by 
developing nations and until costs of implementation are addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schroeder told delegates that industrialized nations need to  
set an example to encourage developing nations to become more 
involved. While developing nations are invited to ratify the 
protocol, they are not held to any binding targets. 
</P>
<P>
	One goal of the Bonn conference, which runs through Nov. 5, is  
to work out details of how to monitor compliance, focusing on 
painstaking scientific details such as how various emission 
controls should be measured. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is a political component to the discussions,  
including a controversial plan to allow industrialized nations to 
trade emissions ``credit.'' The European Union wants to limit 
credit trading so countries can't meet reduction targets without 
taking steps to clean up their air at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, however, wants no limits on emissions  
trading, saying the system provides a financial incentive to 
control harmful greenhouse gases. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations are scheduled to conclude at a November 2000  
meeting in The Hague, Netherlands, triggering the ratification 
process for the major industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In urging quick ratification, Schroeder noted that the Rio goal  
of bringing emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000 would 
not be achieved. The United Nations says that at present rate, 
emissions will actually rise to 18 percent above 1990 levels by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three countries -- Germany, Switzerland and Britain -- have  
reduced emissions in the last two years, German Environment 
Minister Juergen Trittin said in an interview with German Radio 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental group Greenpeace praised Schroeder's appeal,  
but said Germany is unlikely to meet its own legal obligation to 
reduce emissions by 21 percent by 2010 if traffic continues to 
increase at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Russia, Japan and Germany are the biggest  
emitters of greenhouse gases in the industrialized world.

<HEADLINE> GOP Shows Photo of Gov. in Blackface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Furious over accusations of racism leveled at  
Sen. John Ashcroft, Missouri Republicans contend that a 39-year-old 
newspaper photograph of Gov. Mel Carnahan in blackface shows 
Carnahan is not the progressive Democrat he claims to be. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1960 photo unearthed by the state GOP shows Carnahan, who is  
challenging Ashcroft for his Senate seat in 2000, as part of a 
white quartet wearing black makeup in a minstrel show. 
</P>
<P>
	The race issue emerged after Ashcroft successfully led efforts  
in the Senate on Oct. 5 to reject the nomination of Ronnie White, 
the first black member of the Missouri Supreme Court, to a federal 
judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
	White's supporters say race was a factor, while Ashcroft  
maintains his concern was White's fitness for office, mainly his 
record in death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Research turned up the photo in the Rolla Daily News, the  
governor's hometown paper, Missouri GOP executive director John 
Hancock said in an interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A glossy print of the photograph and a copy of the clipping  
dated Oct. 12, 1960, were provided to The Associated Press by a 
Republican source on condition of anonymity. It shows Carnahan, 
then 26; his brother, Bob; and two other men performing at a 
Kiwanis Club fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan released a statement today, apologizing for what he  
called ``my insensitivity of 39 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also said, ``John Ashcroft has reached back almost  
four decades to try to find something to imply that I might harbor 
racist attitudes or would knowingly polarize our state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Ashcroft's innuendoes notwithstanding, I'm proud of my  
long public record of fighting racial injustice, a public record 
that began almost four decades ago and continues through today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said minstrel shows were offensive and ``just plain  
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonetheless, 40 years ago, these shows were far too common,''  
the statement said. ``In those days, most white Americans -- even 
many of us who support the cause of civil rights -- failed to 
recognize the offensive nature of these performances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock denied a hand in the distribution of the picture. ``A  
lot of people know about it,'' he said. ``I'm guessing somebody 
might have had enough. I've had it e-mailed to me. It's out on the 
Internet. It's a shocking photo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a little bit about it, because I'm a ragtime pianist  
and a historian of that whole era,'' he said. ``Minstrelsy isn't 
lighthearted. It's one of the most degrading, derogatory mockeries 
of an entire race of people that has ever existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me when they inject race into politics, where it  
doesn't belong, when their own leader has this kind of sorry, sorry 
record,'' Hancock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Temple, Carnahan's campaign adviser and executive director  
of the Missouri Democratic Party, said the picture represents the 
last time such a show was performed for the Kiwanis Club. At the 
urging of Carnahan's brother, he said, the civic service group in 
1961 abandoned the minstrel performance in favor of a variety show. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, Carnahan's father had become the first U.S.  
ambassador to the new African nation of Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	Racial sensitivity in Missouri has progressed vastly since 1960,  
Temple said. ``To put it in context, there were people like Frank 
Sinatra and Bob Hope doing these things in the major entertainment 
media,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Ashcroft can't defend what he did to Ronnie White, so  
he's trying to attack Mel Carnahan,'' Temple added.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq After-Hour Quotes Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors who trade stocks in the murky and  
fragmented after-hours markets got some help Monday when the Nasdaq 
Stock Market extended the hours of its price quote ticker to 6:30 
p.m. Eastern time. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension, from 5:15 p.m., could give investors easier  
access to the latest Nasdaq stock price information by providing 
that data to Web sites and TV networks from a central location. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unclear how many providers of financial information  
took advantage of the extended hours on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticker on CNBC, the financial news network, did not show the  
after-hours prices and many popular financial Web sites including 
Bloomberg.com and Yahoo. com continued to show prices as of the 
formal 4 p.m. close of the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press, which supplies data to 900 newspapers,  
planned to make the data available starting Nov. 1 in newspaper 
stock tables. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq decided to keep its ticker open later in response to  
growing pressure from alternative trading exchanges known as 
electronic communications networks (ECNs), which serve large 
institutional investors and are usually closed to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the ticker that carries stocks listed on the New York  
and American exchanges will stay open until 6:30 as well. That date 
coincides with a new after-hours floor trading session planned by 
the Chicago Stock Exchange, a regional market that trades NYSE 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the NYSE and Nasdaq markets close their regular trading  
sessions at 4 p.m., their tickers have stayed open until 5:15 p.m. 
to capture after-hours trades on regional stock exchanges and other 
trading venues. 
</P>
<P>
	While some ECNs offer trading beyond 5:15 p.m., up until now  
there has been no single place for investors to keep track of all 
these trades. That has raised worries that investors may not be 
able to find the best price for a given stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern has mounted as more and more Internet stock brokers,  
such as Datek Online and ETrade, offer after-hours trading for 
individual investors who never before were able to do so. As early 
as next month, larger firms such as Fidelity Investments, Charles 
Schwab, Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and others will begin offering 
after-hours trading for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need a central location where all the different quotes can  
be combined and viewed,'' said Tony Kafeiti online supervisor at 
Castle Online, a Freeport, N.Y., discount brokerage firm that 
processes its customers' after-hours trades on ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracey Curvey, executive vice president for Fidelity  
Investment's online brokerage service, said the move to extend the 
ticker's hours is bound to attract more investors to the extended 
hours sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	More participants means more after-hours liquidity, Curvey  
added. And additional liquidity -- or trading activity -- means 
investors are more likely to get a better price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before Nasdaq got involved, it was true fragmentation,'' said  
Brian Hyndman, president of Brass Utility LLC, one of nine 
independent ECNs that provide after-hours sessions.

<HEADLINE> NTT Considering Major Cut in Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese telecommunications company Nippon  
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. is considering cutting its staff by 
20,000 people, a company spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is also studying a plan to reduce annual capital  
spending by $2.8 billion from the $26 billion it plans to spend in 
the current fiscal year through March 2000, spokesman Kenya 
Nakatsuka said. 
</P>
<P>
	The personnel reduction would bring NTT's total workforce to  
just over 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	NTT is considering including these plans in a three-year  
business reform program that it is currently compiling, and both 
would take effect by March 2003, Nakatsuka said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, NTT split its business operations into two regional  
telephone companies and one long-distance and international phone 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The splitup was part of a major overhaul in Japan's once highly  
regulated phone and communications industry. NTT is the world's 
second largest telecommunications company after AT&AMP;T Corp. of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A cut in the huge labor costs at the regional carriers is  
reportedly one of the biggest issues facing the company since 
reorganization. The planned personnel reduction is expected to 
focus on the two companies.

<HEADLINE> Exercise May Reduce Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Women who exercise at least an hour a day may  
reduce their risk of breast cancer by 20 percent, according to one 
of the largest studies ever done on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, published in Monday's Archives of Internal  
Medicine, add to the growing evidence that exercise can help 
prevent breast cancer. A smaller 1997 study in Norway found that 
women who exercised at least four hours a week were about a third 
less likely to get breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the evidence suggests that there's nothing to lose by  
women being physically active,'' said Beverly Rockhill, lead author 
of the latest study and a researcher at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe exercise may affect breast cancer because it  
lowers the level of estrogen circulating in a woman's body. 
Estrogen has been found to stimulate breast cell growth, increasing 
the chances of cancer, Rockhill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study was based on the analysis of questionnaires  
from 121,701 women nationwide who participated in the Nurses' 
Health Study, a long-term health survey of women ages 30 to 55. 
Rockhill and her colleagues looked at data from 1980 to 1994. They 
found 3,137 cases of breast cancer among the 85,364 women who 
answered questions about physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, 20 percent fewer women who exercised an average of  
once a day or more got breast cancer, compared with those who 
exercised less than an hour a week. The exercise included brisk 
walking and jogging but not things like housework or gardening. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers adjusted their data for factors such as weight  
and hormone use but not for diet and smoking, since neither factor 
appeared to be that that different among active and inactive women, 
Rockhill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Brinton, chief of the environmental epidemiology branch  
at the National Cancer Institute, said the findings are more likely 
to be accurate than some other studies because the women were asked 
about their exercise habits when they were actually exercising. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studies have asked participants to remember how active  
they were in the past.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Criticized for Essay Topic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Ohio (AP) -- A high school teacher was reprimanded for  
offering a list of possible topics for a writing assignment that 
included the question: ``If you had to assassinate one famous 
person who is alive right now, who would it be and how would you do 
it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents said they were outraged considering the string of fatal  
shootings of students and teachers at schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was in poor taste considering what's happened,''  
said Valerie Ward, whose son is a 10th-grader at Franklin High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue arose from a single-sheet list of suggested topics for  
the students to write about in their daily journals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another question that upset parents asked students who they  
would save ``if you had to lose everyone you know in a tragic 
accident except one person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators declined to identify the teacher in this  
community, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's principal, Robert Leahy, told The Cincinnati  
Enquirer for a story Monday that he met with the teacher and told 
her the assassination question was inappropriate. Leahy did not

<HEADLINE> Older Americans Pay More for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Average U.S. prices for the five brand-name drugs with the  
biggest dollar sales to older Americans in 1998 are higher than 
what consumers in Canada and Mexico pay. Prices quoted below 
reflect retail pharmacy charges for the most common prescription 
counts and dosages. People with insurance coverage may pay less 
because of bulk discounts negotiated by their health plans:

<HEADLINE> Dell Outpaces Compaq in PC Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dell Computer surpassed Houston-based Compaq as  
the biggest seller of personal computers in the United States 
during the third quarter, according to data from two leading 
research firms expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Round Rock-based computer company's third quarter sales  
increased nearly 57 percent over sales in last year's comparable 
quarter. Compaq's sales in the same time period increased only 
about 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The data indicate a turning point in the rivalry between the two  
Texas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell shipped 1,996,000 personal computers in the third quarter  
of 1999, compared with 1,780,000 personal computers shipped by 
Compaq during the same period. Dell had shipped 1,275,000 in the 
third quarter of 1998, compared with 1,426,000 shipped by the 
Houston-based Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Dell has a competitive advantage because it sells  
its PCs directly to customers, bypassing retailers and other 
middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years at the expense of  
Compaq. However, Compaq is still the largest PC maker in the world.
