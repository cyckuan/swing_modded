<HEADLINE> UCLA Dominates Gymnastics Meet  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- UCLA coach Valorie Kondos said earlier this
week the Bruins had the talent to dominate the NCAA women's
gymnastics meet. All they needed was to hit their routines.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't boasting. Her prediction was right on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins scored 197.3 points Friday night, turning in strong
team efforts on the floor, the vault and the beam to win their
second national title in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Utah surged late in the meet on the vault to place second at
196.875, almost half a point behind the Bruins. Georgia was third
at 196.8, followed by Nebraska (196.725) and Alabama (196.5).
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, which came into the meet expecting to challenge UCLA
for the title, had two early beam falls and never recovered,
placing sixth at 195.725.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins never fell at any station and locked up the title
before they started their final event, the beam. Lena Degteva got a
9.850 and Mohini Bhardwaj followed with a 9.875 on the beam to
complete the victory.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA started on the floor, its most consistent event all season,
and set the tone right away. Malia Jones and Kristin Parker opened
with 9.85s and Bhardwaj and Heidi Moneymaker each added 9.9s.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins then moved to the vault, where Parker, Degteva,
Bhardwaj and Moneymaker all delivered 9.9s. UCLA was steady on the
bars, with Bhardwaj leading the way with a 9.95 and Moneymaker
adding a 9.85.
</P>
<P>
   While Degteva and Moneymaker, both seniors, and Bhardwaj, a
junior, led the way, Kondos credited freshmen Jones, Parker, Doni
Thompson and Amy Young for the second straight night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody performed like I expected, and the freshmen carried
us for the second night in a row,'' Kondos said. ''That's a lot to
ask for kids that young.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong UCLA roster included four gymnasts -- Bhardwaj,
Thompson, Young and Onnie Willis -- with ties to the U.S. national
team. Degteva was a Canadian team alternate at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Utah capped an injury-plagued season, surging to second place
with its final event, the vault. Ashley Keever started with a 9.7,
but it turned out that mark would be the one the Utes dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Allan and Theresa Wolf hit 9.9s, Angelika Schatton scored a
9.85, Denise Jones added another 9.9 and Deidra Graham finished
with a 9.85. It made up for several earlier injuries, including one
that ended the season for defending NCAA all-around champion
Theresa Kulikowski.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the best vaulting set we've had all year,'' Utah coach
Greg Marsden said. ''We knew we could do the other events well, but
in the vault we really sucked it up and had the meet of our life.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Kristi Lichey had a meet highlight, hitting a 10 on
the vault that attracted applause from fans on every side of the
Boise State Pavilion.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives said Friday that the boy would
be psychologically harmed if he were turned over immediately to his father.
Relatives said they were willing to bring Elian to a meeting with his father,
but only within close driving distance of Miami so as not to traumatize him. The
U.S. government had asked a federal appeals panel to order Elian's great-uncle
to turn the 6-year-old Cuban refugee over to his father. The Justice Department
said Lazaro Gonzalez should receive no help from a court until he surrenders the
boy.

   ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republicans Friday of shortchanging

about $100 of the surplus on tax cuts for every $1 you spend on education,''
Clinton told reporters, university spokesmen and others at a gathering of the
Education Writers Association. The House and Senate approved a $1.83 trillion
package yesterday that includes big tax cuts as well as reductions in many
domestic programs.

Report: Bungled Nurse Still Working

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nurse bungled the care of at least six patients --
including two who died -- but is still working at a Veterans Affairs hospital in
Phoenix, according to a VA report that was sent to the White House and Congress
this week. VA investigators said nurse anesthetist David T. Polner removed
breathing tubes too early and made other errors in the care of the six patients
between 1993 and 1999. The VA concluded that Polner's actions did not kill the
two patients who died, although reviewers cited problems with incomplete records
in both cases and said no other cause could be found for one man's death.

<HEADLINE> Albany Med does first heart transplant in northeastern New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Albany Medical Center's first heart
transplant patient remained in critical condition late Friday night
with doctors saying they had high hopes his new heart will take
hold.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-member surgical team performed the five-hour operation on
56-year-old William Van Benschoten of the Dutchess County town of
Pleasant Valley Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new heart is very vigorous and 100 times better than the
old one,'' said Dr. Charles Canver, head of the surgical team and
director of the Heart Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The technical aspects of the operation went very smoothly and
the heart has good pressure, good rhythm and is working very
well,'' Canver said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Benschoten, one of five patients on the medical center's
heart transplant waiting list, was admitted to the hospital on
April 4. The donated heart came from a 28-year-old unidentified man
in northern New York, who had suffered a fatal stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Van Benschoten's family members publicly thanked the donor's
family at a news conference held at the hospital Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's ready to live the rest of his life,'' daughter Rebecca
Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany Medical Center Heart Institute received state Health
Department approval to perform heart transplants last May, after
starting the application process in June 1998. Hospital officials
said they hope to perform a dozen transplants by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester received state approval at
the same time but has not performed a transplant yet.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the closest transplant centers for patients from
northeastern New York were in New York City and Boston. Buffalo
General Hospital also had a heart transplant center, but it
discontinued its program in January. Albany Medical Center will now
serve patients in 25 counties in New York and Western New England.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's transplantation procedure got under way around 10 p.m.
Wednesday when a potential donor was identified. Albany Medical
Center's transplant coordinators assisted the family of the donor
after the decision to donate organs was made.
</P>
<P>
   Canver and Dr. Mike Hill, an Albany surgical resident, traveled
to the donor hospital before dawn Friday, removed the heart, and
returned to Albany by 5 a.m. The transplantation started at 5:50
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Canver performed approximately 200 heart transplants before
coming to Albany Medical Center in late 1998. He was previously
director of the heart transplant program at the University of
Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics.

<HEADLINE> Assembly speaker, City Council speaker bicker over budget  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The two most powerful ''speakers'' in New
York government -- state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and New
York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone -- are bickering over how
fairly the city is being treated in the new state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats, often allied on fiscal and policy questions,
are at odds over how the $78 billion spending plan which state
legislators expect to pass next week will affect the city.
</P>
<P>
   A letter Vallone sent Assembly members from New York City and
other lawmakers expressed ''great dismay'' at budget provisions
''which will threaten the city's fiscal health in future years.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver, rebutting this, accused the speaker Friday of
disparaging the work of New York City Democrats in the Assembly
''for your own personal benefit.'' A Silver aide said that referred
to what Silver sees as Vallone's sometimes-too-close relationship
with Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is eyeing a possible run for mayor in 2001 when
Giuliani's current term ends. Giuliani is running for the U.S.
Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton this year. Because of the
city's term limits, he cannot seek a third term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Vallone objected to a decision by legislative
leaders and Gov. George Pataki to maintain New York City's
revenue-sharing aid at $328 million, while raising it by 5 percent
for localities outside the city. Vallone said that deprives the
city of almost $28 million in the next state fiscal year, and $16.5
million annually in years after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''But more than the loss in revenues, the exclusion of New York
City from consideration for additional revenue-sharing funds sets a
dangerous precedent,'' Vallone said. ''The New York City Council
cannot stay silent while our fundamental eligibility for increased
revenue-sharing funds is ceded to others.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Silver was blasting Vallone Friday, the city
council speaker was holding a City Hall news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Albany is executing another squeeze play on New York City,''
Vallone complained in a reference to last year's decision by the
Legislature and governor to rescind the city's income tax on
commuters; a decision made without city officials' assent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to revenue-sharing aid to municipalities, Vallone
also said the city will lose out when the state reinstitutes
revenue-sharing aid to counties -- but not New York City -- in the
next budget to help them pay for a new health care program for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Silver shot back that New York City already gets more than its
share of aid under the revenue-sharing program, which the Assembly
speaker said ''was intended to be primarily population-based.'' New
York City has 41 percent of the state's population, but receives
more than 57 percent of revenue-sharing aid, Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver also took issue with Vallone's contention that the city's
eligibility for revenue is being ''ceded'' to other municipalities.
While New York City enjoys a $2 billion-plus surplus, Silver said,
several upstate cities are facing deficits and are in ''desperate
need of cash assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Several upstate cities have not only not reaped the benefits
of the current economic boom but in fact face substantial budget
deficits, which are likely to be recurring in nature,'' Silver
said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's biggest cities outside of New York City will get
special infusions of aid in the new state budget: Buffalo ($22
million-plus), Rochester ($15 million), Yonkers ($15 million),
Syracuse ($10 million) and Albany ($4.5 million). Buffalo, in fact,
makes out especially well since its money comes besides a
previously announced grant of $50 million for Adelphia
Communications to build a new office tower, and $25 million to
forgive an existing state loan given to construct HSBC Arena, home
of the Buffalo Sabres. Adelphia inherited the debt when it
purchased the team.
</P>
<P>
   Silver also outlined a series of bills, many passed recently at
New York City's request, which have saved the city substantial
sums.

<HEADLINE> Maryland company building New York's first commercial wind powerstation  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, N.Y. (AP) -- Calling wind energy the ''future of
America,'' U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson headed a
groundbreaking for New York state's first commercial wind energy
station on a hilltop in Madison County.
</P>
<P>
   The seven turbine, 11.5-megawatt Madison Wind Project will the
be the largest wind-powered generating facility in the eastern
United States when it begins operation in September, 45 miles
southeast of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest message that we should have gotten from the OPEC
issue and the high price of gasoline is that we have got to
concentrate on renewable energy. Like wind. Like solar. Like
biomass. This is really the future,'' the secretary told a crowd of
200.
</P>
<P>
   The wind station is being built by Bethesda, Md.-based PG&AMP;E, one
of the nation's largest independent power producers with nearly $21
billion in revenues and operations in 27 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''That one of the leading energy companies in the country is
taking this kind of initiative is a strong sign of wind power's
feasibility,'' Richardson told reporters after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Using the most advanced technology, each 220-foot-tall,
three-bladed windmill generates up to 1.65 megawatts of power.
Collectively, the Madison wind station would provide enough
electricity to supply about 5,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   However, PG&AMP;E wants to sell its wind power to commercial or
industrial companies, to energy marketing companies, or to
utilities. It does not expect to sell directly to residential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most U.S. wind plants have been built under contract to
supply utilities obligated to buy the power rather than in the
competitive wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. noted that energy generated by
windmills reduces the need for fossil fuel-burning, which pumps
pollutants into the air.
</P>
<P>
   In an average wind year, the Madison station will spare the
environment up to 12,000 tons of carbon dioxide, 65 tons of sulfur
dioxide and 19 tons of nitrogen oxides, Glynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Wind power also presents itself as a ''21st-century cash crop''
for farmers, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Madison wind turbines occupy fields leased from dairy
farmers Carl and Jim Stone and their neighbors, Harley and Brenda
Mason. The farmers will be able to plant corn and alfalfa around
the turbines next year. Lease payments will help pay the farms'
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if you've heard or not, but dairy farming is not
real good,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Several wind resource facilities are being planned elsewhere in
the state, including one just a few miles down the road in Fenner.
There, Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp. of Washington, D.C., is
planning to build a 10- to 15-megawatt wind farm. Atlantic helped
develop the Madison project before selling its interest to PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic also has a plan in the works for a 100-megawatt wind
farm in Lewis County where Niagara Mohawk conducted a pilot project
with a .7 megawatt station from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Vestas-American Wind Technology Inc. has plans to develop a
Wyoming County wind farm with a capacity between 4.6 and 9.2
megawatts. The New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority also has a wind farm planned and is presently negotiating
financing for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now has a more than 2,500 megawatts of wind
power generating capacity, about one-fifth of the world's total,
according to the American Wind Energy Association. Much of the U.S.
capacity is located in California and the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the energy department's goal is to double that
capacity by 2005 and double it again by 2010. Wind power can
eventually provide as much as 20 percent of the nation's energy
needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It already is the world's fastest-growing energy source,
increasing from 25 percent to 30 percent yearly. More than $4
billion was invested into wind power projects worldwide last year,
the AWEA said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's winds are modest compared with those that blow across
the Great Plains. But they are still considerable, according to
industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   The American Wind Energy Association ranks New York 14th
nationally in wind resources with a capacity of up to
23,000-megawatts. Most of the best sites are in central and western
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the PG&AMP;E wind station may depend on which way the
economic winds blow.
</P>
<P>
   Wind power is still relatively costly compared with conventional
power sources. It's sold mainly to customers who want to promote
the use of a nonpolluting, renewable source.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of wind power has dropped dramatically in recent
years -- from 50 cents a kilowatt-hour in 1980 to a current range of
3 to 6 cents a kilowatt-hour, according to the U.S. Department of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   The current wholesale price of conventional power is about 2.5
cents to 3 cents a kilowatt-hour.

<HEADLINE> Long-serving assemblywoman won't seek re-election  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- After more than a quarter century in office,
Assemblywoman Elizabeth Connelly says she will step down when her
term expires in December to spend more time with her family.
</P>
<P>
   The longest-serving woman in the history of the New York state
Legislature said Friday she will not seek re-election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just felt that after 27 years that it was time,'' Connelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old Democrat cited the long, tiring commute between
her Staten Island district and Albany as well as the
unpredictability of the Legislature schedule as other factors
leading to her decision. She also said she's been so busy that she
could not get to her physical therapist to address the back pain
she has suffered since Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But Connelly said leaving her Assembly seat doesn't necessarily
mean political retirement. She said county Democrats have courted
her as a possible candidate for borough president, a position
currently held by Republican Guy Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm leaving the door open,'' she said. ''I would never rule
anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly currently serves as speaker pro tempore, usually
presiding from the podium in the sometimes raucous 150-member
house. As temporary speaker -- the real speaker, Sheldon Silver,
rarely presides -- she recognizes speakers during debates and makes
decisions on parliamentary questions, all the while pleading for
quiet and order in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The position is also the highest-ranking leadership post ever
held by a woman in Assembly history.
</P>
<P>
   She was a homemaker in 1973 when she was asked by Democratic
Party leaders to run in a special election. She won, becoming
Staten Island's first female elected official. She won her
subsequent re-election bids for the Assembly seat representing a
heavily Democratic district.
</P>
<P>
   In the Assembly, Connelly had served as chairwoman of her
chamber's committee on mental health and hygiene, which in the past
also covered alcohol and substance abuse. She has also been a
strong supporter of antigambling initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Assemblyman Eric Vitaliano, also of Staten Island,
called Connelly's work on those issues her ''greatest legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Albany scene today, when those interests come up, the
first name that jumps to anybody's tongue is Betty Connelly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vitaliano said he was ''stunned'' by Connelly's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm deeply saddened that I'm losing my mentor but thrilled
that she and (her husband) Bob can do what they want to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Sen. John Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, ''I will
miss them both, but I am pleased to know they leave in good health
for other important and interesting activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Connelly will be ''sorely missed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''New York state is better off by having Betty Connelly giving
us ... a little over a quarter century of serving here,'' Silver
said. ''She's earned everyone's respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly said there are a number of young people in her party
who would be qualified to replace her but she declined to give any
names.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks attractive when you're not running against an
incumbent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Lavelle, chairman of the Staten Island Democratic Party,
agreed that it is too early to determine Connelly's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   During her first year in office, Connelly was one of only four
women in the Assembly. Today, there are 36 women in that chamber, a
number that is ''still not a heck of a lot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come a long way, but I don't think we've progressed as
far as we've wanted,'' Connelly said. ''I think we could do more.''

   PHOENIX (AP) -- With three forwards scoring in double figures,
the Phoenix Suns edged closer to clinching homecourt advantage in
the first round of the playoffs Friday night by handing the Los
Angeles Clippers their 15th consecutive defeat, 112-88.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have won four in a row, two of them against the
Clippers, and have a two-game lead over San Antonio with three to
play in the race for the No. 4 spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers scored 22, Shawn Marion 20 and Cliff Robinson 17
for the Suns, who outscored the Clippers by an average of 104-81 in
their four-game sweep this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby scored 21 for Los Angeles, but only two in the
second half. Michael Olowokandi had 15 points and 12 rebounds for
the Clippers. Lamar Odom scored 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had sputtered in their previous two victories over the
Clippers and Vancouver. This one was easier, although the Suns
didn't turn it into a blowout until well into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix never trailed and led 52-40 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns shot out to a 16-5 lead. The Clippers, who have lost to
Phoenix 10 consecutive times, cut it to 24-23 with an 11-2 run,
then the Suns reeled off 10 in a row to go up 34-23 on Oliver
Miller's stuff with 10:13 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's three-point play put the Suns ahead 66-50 with 6:38
left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson scored 13, Marion 12 and Rogers 10 in the first half.
Nesby scored 19 in the first half, 14 in the first quarter. But the
rest of the Clippers were ice cold. Los Angeles shot 28 percent
(11-for-39) in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Suns' Kevin Johnson missed his second consecutive game
with a groin strain. He may return for Sunday's game against Utah.
... The Clippers were without Maurice Taylor (sore left ankle) and
Derek Anderson (lower back spasms). ... Miller had seven points in
his first appearance in three games and first significant playing
time in six games. ... If Utah wins at San Antonio on Saturday, the
Suns can clinch the first-round homecourt advantage by beating the
Jazz on Sunday. ... Phoenix has the third-best home record in the
NBA at 32-7. ... The Clippers have the league's worst road record,
4-36.

<HEADLINE> Valentine Comments Surprise Mets GM  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- New York Mets general manager Steve Phillips
said he was ''surprised and curious'' Friday that manager Bobby
Valentine criticized the team's front office during a discussion
with business school students.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips unexpectedly flew to Pittsburgh to discuss the remarks
with Valentine, but said he wouldn't fire the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine thought his comments with the University of
Pennsylvania students on Wednesday in Philadelphia were off the
record and mostly tongue-in-cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine told the group that the Mets spent too much money to
sign Todd Zeile, that he couldn't bench Derek Bell because of his
salary and that the Mets shouldn't have gotten rid of Masato
Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was kidding, saying this is the kind of stuff you'd hear on
a talk radio show, and I was playing the caller most of the time,''
Valentine told The Record of Hackensack, N.J. ''They threw it at
me, I threw it back at them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips was mad enough to get on a plane and fly to
Pittsburgh, where the Mets are playing a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I slept on it, and I thought it made sense to come here. I
would be conspicuous by my absence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Valentine spoke briefly before Friday night's game and
planned to talk again afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't come here with the intent to fire the manager,''
Phillips said. ''It's something I want to talk to him about. He's
not going to get fired over this, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips suggested he showed up to try to defuse the controversy
and ''because it seemed appropriate for me to be here. I had to be
here to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it could be a distraction to a team already off to an
erratic start, Phillips said, ''It's a potential distraction.
Whether it gets to the point where it a distraction, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips wouldn't detail what he and Valentine discussed before
the game, though Phillips said, ''I need a clarification of what
actually was said and what wasn't said. I'm not going to be
accusatory.''
</P>
<P>
   After an 8-5, 12-inning victory over Pittsburgh, Valentine was
asked if thought the controversy will deflate in a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would I? I think it should, though,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several players attempted to downplay any effects of Valentine's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not to be disrespectful, because the manager is your boss, but
I've been in baseball 16 years ... and whatever people say or do
doesn't affect me,'' pitcher Al Leiter said. ''Whatever's going on,
you still have to take care of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, 5-for-6 with two homers, said, ''You just have to
realize people say things or do things they wish they could take
back. Nobody's perfect. It happens. You just have to be prepared to
do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Valentine's relationship with Phillips has been strained
for some time and he has been warned by co-owner Fred Wilpon not to
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon also was angry about the remarks, and Phillips planned to
fill him in on his talk with Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   The manager said the students had promised they would not repeat
anything he said. However, the comments showed up on a bulletin
board on the Mets' Web site. Phillips saw the comments Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be too bad if a bunch of kids had a good time in a
classroom and somebody made it into something more than it was,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The company that hosts the Web site later took down the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the comments attributed to Valentine were that the money
the team spent on Zeile -- $18 million over three years -- might have
been spent better on new relief pitchers. He thought Jorge Toca and
Matt Franco would have been just fine at first base.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't understand trading Yoshii to the Colorado Rockies
and said the team never had a real backup plan to replace him in
the rotation. He wanted the team to sign Japanese closer Kazuhiro
Sasaki, who ended up signing with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   He said the front office won't let him sit Bell, who is making
$5 million this season, and that he ''ignores'' Rickey Henderson
and won't try to change the outfielder's personality.

Relatives said they were willing to bring Elian to a meeting with his father,
but only within close driving distance of Miami so as not to traumatize him. The
U.S. government had asked a federal appeals panel to order Elian's great-uncle
to turn the 6-year-old Cuban refugee over to his father. The Justice Department
said Lazaro Gonzalez should receive no help from a court until he surrenders the

about $100 of the surplus on tax cuts for every $1 you spend on education,''

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 104, Grizzlies 94, 2OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Terrell Brandon hit his first
three field goal attempts of the second overtime and scored 20
points to lift the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 104-94 win over the
Vancouver Grizzlies on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett also scored 20 and allowed Minnesota to complete a
four-game season sweep of the Grizzlies, who battled back from a
17-point first-half deficit in their final home game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 27 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as
the Grizzlies closed out their home schedule with a 12-29 record.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dickerson added 22 points for the Grizzlies, who did not
receive any points from their reserves in 68 combined minutes -- the
first time that has happened in the five-year history of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett missed a 10-foot attempt at the end of the first
overtime with the teams tied at 88-88.
</P>
<P>
   In a repeat scenario from many of their recent contests, the
Grizzlies were forced to go to a small lineup after falling behind
early. A 10-2 Vancouver run late in the first period enabled the
Grizzlies to trail 27-21 heading into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota hit nine of its first 10 field goal attempts through
the first 7:50 of the second to build a 17-point lead. But the
Timberwolves missed their last six shots of the opening half and
led 52-42 at the break despite 60 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's starters played nearly the entire third period and
kept the game close, getting within 73-72 with 7:48 left. The teams
then traded baskets until the final minute, and Bryant Reeves of
the Grizzlies nearly slammed home an offensive rebound at the
buzzer with the scored tie 80-80.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of bench production ultimately did in the Grizzlies.
Minnesota's reserves outscored the Vancouver bench 36-0. Over the
four-game season series, Minnesota held a 153-63 edge.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Incoming Grizzlies owner Michael Heisley said Friday he has
made no formal hirings after his purchase was approved earlier this
week by the league's Board of Governors. Heisley flew into
Vancouver on Friday amid widespread speculation he has made offers
to Dick Versace to coach the Grizzlies next season and Indiana
vice-president Billy Knight to serve as general manager. ''We've
talked to 20 or more people but we have made no offers,'' said
Heisley, who confirmed he has worked out a new lease arrangement
for his team which will shorten the Grizzlies' obligation to GM
Place to a five-year period. ... The game drew 17,748 fans, raising
the average attendance for the season to 13,899 -- the lowest in the
five-year history of the franchise.

<HEADLINE> Astros 10, Padres 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell hit a grand slam and Shane
Reynolds hit a solo home run and pitched five effective innings to
lead the Houston Astros to a 10-4 win Friday night over the San
Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell homered off Kevin Walker to cap a six-run, sixth inning
as the Astros broke a 3-3 tie. Walker was making his major league
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (2-0) was not at his sharpest as he allowed three runs
and 10 hits in five innings. But the right-hander was able to pitch
out of trouble to keep the score close.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was more successful with his bat as he hit a solo homer
off Brian Boehringer (0-2) leading off the fifth inning to tie the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Houston then took control in the sixth. Moises Alou led off with
a single, knocking Boehringer from the game. Billy Spiers followed
with an RBI double off Will Cunnane and Tony Eusebio had an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-out walk to Craig Biggio, Walker entered the game
and walked Roger Cedeno to load the bases. Bagwell then lined a 2-2
fastball over the right-field wall. It was his 15th career home run
at Qualcomm Stadium, the most he's had in any visiting park.
</P>
<P>
   Boehringer gave the Padres a 3-2 lead in the fourth with a
two-run double over the head of Alou in right field.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros went ahead 2-1 in the second on Alou's home run and a
sacrifice fly by Tim Bogar.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Alou left the game in the sixth inning with a tight left
calf. ... The Padres continue to play without injured OFs Tony
Gwynn (sore knee) and Ruben Rivera (wrist). Gwynn missed his fourth
straight game after having his left knee drained Monday. Rivera has
not started the last five games. ... Astros 3B Ken Caminiti
(strained left hamstring) sat out his fourth straight start,
although he might be ready to play Saturday. ... Reynolds has won
10 of 15 career starts vs. San Diego. ... Houston's Matt Mieske
(lower back strain) was activated from the 15-day DL. ... RHP Scott
Elarton is scheduled to make his first start of the season for
Houston on Tuesday at Los Angeles. Elarton, who began the season on
the DL as he recovered from offseason rotator cuff surgery.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in LA's Belmont Scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No criminal charges will be filed over the
multimillion-dollar construction of the Belmont Learning Center on
a polluted site, top prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the school district's auditor on the $170 million
fiasco ''simply does not support the allegations of criminal
wrongdoing,'' Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   California Attorney General Bill Lockyer and City Attorney James
Hahn also informed auditor Don Mullinax that they did not find any
evidence that state agencies or others committed environmental
crimes or failed to perform legally required duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''No misdemeanor violations have been proved,'' said the report
by Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   An after-hours call seeking comment from the Los Angeles Unified
School District was not immediately returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The unfinished center is the nation's costliest high school
project. Work was halted in 1998 after explosive methane gas and
toxic hydrogen sulfide were found on the former oil field near
downtown. In January, the Board of Education voted to abandon the
project as a high school, although the debate on what to do with it
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax sent his report on the Belmont scandal to the U.S.
attorney's office and the city, county and state prosecutors last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax has said former school board members and senior staff
were so lax in their management of the project that they should be
sued. He also found that subcontractors overbilled the district,
and said criminal charges could be warranted against the main
developer.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four state Assembly members were among dozens
of people cited Friday for blocking an intersection during a
massive march by striking janitors.
</P>
<P>
   Police issued 35 citations for failure to disperse after some of
the estimated crowd of 2,000 janitors and supporters sat down at
Wilshire and Westwood boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   The sit-down was planned by the Service Employees International

<P>
   Representatives of the union and contractors met for eight hours
Thursday in the first talks since March 31. The talks resumed
Friday afternoon but ended after about six hours.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President To Meet Arafat  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM HAZBOUN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIBBUTZ EIN GEDI, Israel (AP) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has floated on the Dead Sea and visited a desert hothouse, taking a
break from the furor over a spy plane Israel is building for China
before returning to the diplomatic agenda of his Mideast trip.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang was scheduled to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in Bethlehem today, visit the Church of the Nativity and
sign agreements to build a hospital in the West Bank town of
Qalqilya.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said Friday the
Palestinians will urge China to take a more active role in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chinese people have supported the Palestinian revolution
since the 1960s, longer than they have had relations with Israel,''
Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, while visiting Kibbutz Ein Gedi, a desert communal
farm of 700 residents overlooking the Dead Sea, Jiang politely
brushed off reporters' questions about the plane Israel is building
for China much to the chagrin of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Aircraft Industries is equipping a plane with the PHALCON
airborne early warning system at a cost of $250 million. Israel has
said it will go ahead with the sale of at least one aircraft to
China, despite U.S. objections.
</P>
<P>
   ''About the aircraft, we spoke on that yesterday, and there will
be a contract. Let's deal with life on the kibbutz,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, accompanied by Israeli President Ezer Weizman, began the
third day of his six-day visit to Israel at Zohar, an experimental
agricultural station near the communal farm of Neot Hakikar in the
Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   After taking off his dark suit jacket and putting on a white
baseball cap, Jiang toured hothouses where peppers, melons and
houseplants are grown with salty water -- an Israeli technique that
could be the answer to making China's deserts bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Schwartz, a local farmer, said Jiang was interested in the
most minute detail. At one stop, he tasted a seedless watermelon.
At another, the Chinese president picked up a red pepper with one
hand and a yellow pepper with the other, and was told by his guides
that the red ones were more popular with the customers.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, Jiang took a dip in the Dead Sea, where the salt
content is so high that bathers can float without effort. Wearing
black swim trunks, a blue bathing cap and goggles, the president
was helped into the water by security guards. He bobbed on the
water for about 15 minutes and waved to a few tourists when he made
his way back to the shore.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Jiang visited Ein Gedi, waving to kibbutz
children who shouted ''shalom, shalom'' and held up Chinese flags.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's tour shifted attention away from the planned sale of
the spy plane, a deal potentially worth $2 billion. Washington has
said the sale could upset the balance of power in Asia, at a time
when tensions are rising between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The PHALCON airborne radar system, like the American-made AWACS
system, gives early warning of approaching aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Friday that Israel was
committed by contract to selling at least one plane equipped with
the PHALCON system to China.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an obligation we cannot violate,'' Sneh told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Jiang on Thursday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Israel values the Chinese market too much to risk it by
backing out of a signed contract. The speaker of Israel's
parliament, Avraham Burg, backed U.S. criticism of the spy plane
deal, saying Israel should not try to win friends by selling them
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is Israel's main military and political ally
and gives Israel about $3 billion in military and economic aid
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's defense industry exports close to 80 percent of its
products, subject to restrictions over reselling American weapons
systems. Israel says the PHALCON, built on the frame of a Russian

<HEADLINE> Lakers 121, Kings 114  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal, back after missing two
games with a sore ankle, scored 41 points and had 16 rebounds
Friday night as the Los Angeles Lakers beat Sacramento 121-114 in a
possible first-round playoff preview.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no ill effects from the tender left ankle that sidelined
him for a week, O'Neal played 44 minutes and went 16-of-29 from the
floor and 9-of-15 from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 18 of his team's 27 points in the fourth quarter as
the Lakers held off the Kings, who beat them once and played them
close in their three other games this season.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 15 points in the second quarter,
the Lakers outscored the Kings 31-11 during a run that ended with
Los Angeles up 90-78 with three minutes remaining in the third.
</P>
<P>
   They led the rest of the way, although Sacramento closed to
111-108 with 3:24 remaining before the Lakers held the Kings off in
the final moments.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice led the third-quarter comeback, scoring 15 of his 24
points in the period on 6-of-7 shooting, including 3-of-4 from
3-point range. Kobe Bryant, who had 31 points, had 14 in the third
quarter, missing just one of seven shots as the Lakers went
16-of-21 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber led the Kings with 36 points and 10 rebounds. Nick
Anderson added 22 points, but Jason Williams was held to four
points, well below his 12.4 average, on 2-of-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers went 1-1 while O'Neal was out, losing 98-80 to San
Antonio -- their worst defeat of the season -- before coming back to
beat Seattle 106-103 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings controlled the tempo early. Webber had 21 points by
halftime, missing just three of his 12 shots, and Anderson added 14
as the Kings led 65-57 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 19 points and Bryant 12 in the half to help the
Lakers stay close.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got off to a blistering start, going 17-of-24 from the
floor to shoot out to a 39-28 lead at the end of the opening
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson scored seven points during an 18-8 run by Sacramento
over the final 4:20 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went on to led by as many as 15, 52-37 with four
minutes played in the second quarter, before Los Angeles slowly
began to pull closer.
</P>
<P>
   A slam dunk with 18 seconds left in the half by Lakers rookie
John Celestand, activated earlier in the day, narrowed the gap to
eight points.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers placed backup guard Derek Fisher on the disabled
list because of a bone spur in his right ankle and activated
Celestand to replace him on the roster. Fisher, who had not missed
a game this season and was averaging 6.3 points, was dressed in a
business suit and played cheerleader on the bench. ... The Kings
could provide the Lakers a run for their money in the playoffs.
Webber led Sacramento with 20 points and 12 rebounds in the Kings'
103-91 victory over Los Angeles in the first meeting between the
teams this season. The Lakers won the second meeting 109-106, with
Bryant scoring 40 points in the victory. O'Neal had 34 points and
Bryant 24 points and 14 rebounds in the third game, a 90-89 LA
victory on March 26 at Staples Arena.

<HEADLINE> Third World Leaders: Ease Poverty  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The leaders of the world's poor nations are
uniting to demand a greater say in the global economic system,
insisting on greater aid and trade and a role in financial
decisions that often shake their countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''From now on we will play our part in shaping this (world)
order into one that is just, fair and mutually beneficial to all
sides,'' said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, chairman of the
South Summit that closed late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of 77, founded in 1964 as a U.N. lobbying group, has
expanded to include 133 nations. The leaders used their first
summit to transform the G-77 into what could become a significant
international voice for the developing world, creating a structure
to pressure richer countries to consider the interests of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not be mendicants (beggars) content with the crumbs
that fall from the table of the North,'' said Jamaican Prime
Minister P.J. Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 heads of state or government took part, along with vice
presidents or foreign ministers from some 80 other nations.
</P>
<P>
   In resolutions adopted Friday, the summit demanded relief of the
Third World's crushing debt, increased aid, more exports to
developed countries and greater transfers of technology.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also promised greater cooperation among themselves:
a vow dramatically accepted by Cuban President Fidel Castro, who
promised to provide 3,000 doctors to a Group of 77 medical program.
He said the overall plan ''could save at least 1 million lives each
year in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo also lectured the delegates on the need to solve
problems in their own countries and to end regional conflicts.
''Peace is the bedrock of all human development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the anger was aimed at the booming North: at its
efforts to impose sometimes tough free-market policies on reluctant
Third World governments and at volatile world markets that can send
prices or interest rates falling or soaring, often with devastating
effects on poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the leaders expressed frustration that the technological
revolution that has brought wealth to the rich is out of reach to
billions of people, many living on the edge of starvation, with no
telephones or only erratic power supplies.
</P>
<P>
   As he did at the start of the three-day meeting, Castro compared
the world economic system to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hold the firmest conviction that the economic order imposed
by rich countries is not only cruel, unjust, inhuman ... but it is
also carrier of a racist conception of the world which in its time
inspired the Nazism of the Holocaust and of the concentration
camps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the third world, they now call them refugee centers,'' in
which people are ''concentrated by poverty, hunger and violence,''
Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   The summit urged ''a new global human order aimed at reversing
the growing disparities between rich and poor,'' with countries of
the South given the right to ''participate on an equal footing in
decisions which affect them.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit said the United Nations should take a stronger role
in economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders called for ''the outright cancellation of
unsustainable debt,'' increased aid and measures to ensure that
developing nations receive new technologies. They promised to try
to expand their own educational systems and domestic power and
telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
   The summit demanded that developed countries open their markets
to the farm and textile products of the South, and sought ''freer
movement'' of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with the theme of unity, Foreign Minister Abdoulaye
Yerodia of the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- the former Zaire
-- fruitlessly urged the delegates to pressure countries with troops
fighting in his nation to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are part of the G-77,'' he said, apparently referring to
Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. ''Do something to make these people go
home.''

<HEADLINE> China Tries To Dispel Superstition  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Olive-clad troops and schoolchildren in gym suits
came to the capital's military museum by the busload to see optical
illusions demystified and the magic of conception and birth
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which is now set to tour the country, is part of
an intense campaign by the government designed to encourage the
Chinese to embrace science and reject increasingly popular
superstitious beliefs -- and is the latest weapon in its bid to
stamp out the Falun Gong spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Health and longevity depend on science,'' says a display
devoted to describing medicine and surgery and condemning the
rejection of medicine in favor of spiritual cures.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ''Uphold Science and Civilization, Oppose
Superstition and Ignorance,'' features photos of mass suicides by
members of cults in other countries and testimonies from
heartbroken relatives of Falun Gong members said to have died or
committed gruesome murders.
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus is on selling science to the masses through
basic education and hands-on displays showing how those who claim
to have supernatural powers trick people to gain their trust.
</P>
<P>
   With the push of a button, a card with pictures of a birdcage on
one side and a bird on the other twirl, causing the bird to appear
as if it is sitting in the cage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our own vision causes this to happen. But it can be used to
cheat people,'' said a retired military officer, who would give
only his surname, Shao.
</P>
<P>
   Another display shows the division of cells in an embryo after
conception and the chromosomes that determine a child's sex.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are just cells. There is no such thing as reincarnation
of a spirit,'' the notation next to the exhibit says.
</P>
<P>
   A recent government survey found that beliefs in fortunetelling,
ghosts, witchcraft and supernatural abilities are spreading, the
official China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Falun Gong began in earnest after 10,000 members
staged a silent vigil around the Communist Party leadership
compound last April.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the intensity and size of the group -- official
estimates once put its membership at 70 million -- leaders labeled
it a threat to communist rule and a public menace, banning it on
July 22 and declaring it a cult.
</P>
<P>
   But the faithful still meet in secret and stage protests,
risking beatings, arrest and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ''After such a long time, the shadowy ghost of Falun Gong has
not dispersed,'' the party newspaper Guangming Daily said recently.
''The rotting, stinking corpse is still a malign poison in our
midst.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, police arrested at least two van-loads of Falun
Gong adherents after they unfurled banners on Tiananmen Square, the
symbolic political heart of China.
</P>
<P>
   The government's inability to eradicate Falun Gong, despite a
nationwide campaign in which thousands have been arrested, mirrors
the failure of a wider decades-long battle by the Communist Party
to stamp out ''superstitious'' groups and wean Chinese of their
fondness for traditional mystical practices like fortunetelling and
ancestor worship.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years of rule by the officially atheist Communist
Party, villagers still burn paper cards and houses for departed
spirits and stage ''weddings'' between corpses of dead sons and
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cults can cause great harm to society. We want to help people
know how to recognize a cult and withstand its temptations,'' said
Cui Jianping, deputy director of the Science Popularization
Department of the China Science Association, a sponsor of the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong members contend that their practices, which draw from
Buddhism, the quasi-martial art of qigong and the beliefs of
founder Li Hongzhi, a former government clerk, promote good health
and morality.
</P>
<P>
   The tug-of-war between science and superstition continues a long
tradition of suppressing doomsday cults and secret societies that
the emperors and later revolutionary leader Mao Tse-Tung viewed as
threats to stability.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by Amnesty International, in the 17
months before Falun Gong was banned, police reported they had
cracked 11,870 cases of ''using feudal superstition to disrupt
social order or defraud property'' and arrested 21,400 suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Police also have closed down hundreds of local sects and illegal
religious organizations, including evangelical Protestant and
Catholic churches operating outside state control.

<HEADLINE> Adviser: Take Warheads Off Alert  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and Russia should
downgrade the ''hair-trigger'' alert of thousands of nuclear
weapons scheduled to be eliminated under the START II treaty, a
former Clinton security adviser says.
</P>
<P>
   Frank von Hippel, who served as an assistant director of
national security for the Clinton administration in 1993-94, said
that despite the end of the Cold War, the two nations keep
thousands of nuclear weapons on high alert in the event of nuclear
war.
</P>
<P>
   He said President Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin
could now agree to make ballistic missiles safer from accidental
launch.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be the smartest thing we can do all around as a
first step,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, hours after Russia's parliament approved
the long-delayed treaty, Von Hippel recalled that before START I
was ratified in 1991, President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev had agreed to stand down all the weapons that were going
to be eliminated under the treaty in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having negotiated it, and having figured out that they could
do it in 10 years, they said, well why not now reduce the risk,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   START II would halve U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to
3,000-3,500 warheads each by the end of 2007. A new treaty, START
III, which is being discussed, envisages cuts to 1,500-2,500
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Calling on Clinton and Putin to follow in the footsteps of Bush
and Gorbachev, Von Hippel said it was harder to take the warheads
off alert in 1991 than it would be today because at that time there
was no way to verify that both sides were complying -- but now there
are inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Von Hippel, who is investigating nuclear policy alternatives,
and retired U.S. Rear Admiral Eugene Carroll, deputy director of
the Center for Defense Information, stressed that U.S. warheads
being taken out of action under START II will not be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Von Hippel explained that the way START II is written, Russia
has to eliminate its multiple warheads but the United States is
allowed to deactivate its sea-based missiles without destroying
them.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department recently announced that the warheads
that are taken out of missiles under START II are going to be
refurbished, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That means make them more reliable, more destructive, more
stable and put them back into the inactive arsenal so that in case
we get into trouble we can yank out as many as 6,000 weapons to go
to war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Hippel said taking thousands of warheads off alert would
have a positive impact on the U.N. conference to review the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, which starts April 24.
</P>
<P>
   At the last review in 1995, when the treaty was extended
indefinitely, five nuclear powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia
and the United States -- pledged to work for nuclear disarmament.
The treaty, signed in 1970, also commits non-nuclear countries to
refrain from developing their own nuclear arsenals.

<HEADLINE> Boys Arrested for School Plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONORA, Calif. (AP) -- Two 17-year-old boys whom authorities
believe were planning to storm their high school and kill students
and teachers on the anniversary of the Columbine massacre were
arrested Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuolumne County Sheriff Dick Rogers said the boys planned to
make their attack on Summerville High School on April 20, Adolf
Hitler's birthday and the one-year anniversary of the rampage at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said it doesn't appear the boys, who were booked on
charges of conspiracy to commit murder, were copying Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had been planning this for more than a year,'' he said.
''Since before Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Searches at the boys' homes turned up more than 40 pieces of
evidence, including knives, swords and some guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weapons that were seized were quite unusual,'' Rogers
said. ''They were not something you could find at the local
hardware store.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department first heard about the plot last month
and investigators have been gathering evidence, Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Summerville High School's 740 students are on spring break April
20, and for that reason authorities said they worried an attack
could have come sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Tuolumne County District Attorney Tim Clancy would
not say whether the teens belonged to any political organizations
or hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do have that information, but (releasing) it could possibly
jeopardize other work we have to do,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Summerville High School is located in Tuolumne City, about 85
miles east of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges 617; Nasdaq Sinks 355  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors have the weekend to lick their wounds
and rethink their trading strategy after one of Wall Street's worst
weeks ever ended in a selling stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks lost almost $2 trillion in value this week, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index falling an unprecedented 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's killing me. It's been a bad week,'' said Joe Ayala, a
lawyer in Sacramento, Calif. But he wasn't prepared to bail out
when markets resume trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got most of my stuff in retirement accounts, so I'm
hanging on for the long term -- I'm not going anywhere,'' Ayala
said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke Friday as the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted a
record 617.78 points, or 5.7 percent, to close at 10,305.77. Its
weekly drop of more than 805 points also was a record.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq dropped a record 355.49 points, or 9.7 percent, to
3,321.29, falling deeper into bear-market territory. Since hitting
a record 5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq has tumbled 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Already battered by days of heavy selling, the markets turned
ugly Friday after the government released a surprisingly bad
inflation report. As prices tumbled, many who bought stocks with
borrowed money were forced to sell to repay loans -- accelerating
the downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a semi-panic, almost a full cascading deterioration,''
said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisors. ''The real question is, have we reached the nadir of
emotion?''
</P>
<P>
   The rout was stunning. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index --
which represents the combined market value of all New York Stock
Exchange, American and Nasdaq issues -- ended the week at $12.5
trillion, down $1.9 trillion from the previous week. It still was
up from the $12.1 trillion of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow at one point was down an unprecedented 722 points.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff decimated several sectors, including computer
software and semiconductors, brokerage companies, banks and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for the collapse was pulled in Washington, where the
Labor Department said consumer prices surged more than expected in
March, reflecting higher costs for everything from gasoline to
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be more aggressive in
trying to cool down the economy in order to remove the threat of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has already raised rates five times since June, each
time by a quarter-point in borrowing charges. Now, many investors
fear a half-point increase as early as May.
</P>
<P>
   Even that may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk is the U.S. economy does not slow enough and the Fed
has to raise rates in the second half of the year, in spite of the
election. That is not priced into the market,'' said Nick Sargen,
an investment strategist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates raise corporate costs and hurt profits.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
Internet companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The market volatility also has caused several companies to
postpone stock offerings and mergers and acquisitions. And that is
hurting investment banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find any consensus on what might happen Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week could be extremely rough,'' said Gary Kaltbaum,
chief technical analyst at J.W. Genesis Securities in Boca Raton,
Fla. ''I'd like to believe that we've now had the panic selloff
that will allow the market to move higher. But every support that
we crashed through this week could become resistance going up.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the markets closed off their lows of the day,
which could be a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons, was among the hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corrections are designed to work off excesses and create
opportunities,'' he said. ''I've been telling people to get their
wish list together. It's the best time to buy stocks.''

<HEADLINE> Few Panic After Wall Street Losses  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The carnage on Wall Street brought out the best
and worst in everybody. Those inclined to panic, sold. For others,
it was an opportunity to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   In New York's Times Square, a crowd gathered around the windows
of Nasdaq's electronic signboard Friday to see how bad the damage
was. Some gasped as they learned the Nasdaq index had slumped 34
percent from its high point five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   To Laurence Kaplan, who works in a clothing company nearby, the
solution was obvious. Shouting hurriedly into his cell phone, he
urged his colleague to ''Sell, sell, sell!''
</P>
<P>
   Others took the decline in stride. Cynthia Middleton, a business
development executive for AT&AMP;T, was also advising a friend on her
cell phone, but in far more measured tones.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't make sense to get out now,'' she said. ''You don't
experience a loss unless you sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people did sell Friday. When the dust finally settled
the Nasdaq composite index finished down a record 355.49 points, or
9.7 percent. The Dow was off 617.78 points, also a record drop.
</P>
<P>
   All the excitement Friday brought a bemused grin to the face of
Anatoliy Basov, a 32-year-old New Jersey resident. Basov, a
software engineer, was puffing nonchalantly on a cigarette as the
buzz grew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm an investor, not a trader,'' Basov said. ''There's nothing
to worry about. The next time I plan to take money out of the
market is in 14 years when my kid goes to college. It's just time
for a regular adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Many investors across the nation displayed a measure of calm
among the craziness. For them, it was an opportunity to show
resolve and long-term thinking during trying times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure I'm unsettled,'' said Dan Zwiren, a senior vice president
with an Internet telephony company in New York. ''It's going to
take time to repair this and rebuild investor confidence. But I'm
staying with what I have. I'm not happy about it, but I'm not
panicking either.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's weird that it keeps dropping like this. It's just
bizarre,'' says Dan Shore, 40, a publishing representative who
works in southern Minnesota. ''But I assume it will turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, however, the weeklong stock market disaster -- the
Nasdaq index is down 25 percent over the past five days -- has taken
its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Moskowitz grabbed his chest and took a step back as he
laid his eyes on the stock market ticker scrolling across the lobby
of Charles Schwab's lobby at the brokerage's San Francisco
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real blood bath,'' said Moskowitz, 58, of Mill
Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moskowitz said he probably would troll the market for
bargains and add to his portfolio of about 35 stocks, which include
several tech companies.
</P>

   ''I think there should be some good deals out there,'' he said.
''There was so much hot air in the market, that this is probably a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have seen all they care to. David Hummel, a
23-year-old computer engineer for an online mortgage company in New
York, had been making about a dozen stock trades a day from his
work terminal. He's getting out for good.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't afford to lose anymore,'' said Hummel, fidgeting
nervously with his tongue stud. ''I guess this is what you get for
believing the ads from these online brokers making you think it's
all so easy.''

<HEADLINE> CNN Settles Defamation Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN has one less legal battle on its hands from
the network's ill-fated 1998 report that accused the military of
using nerve gas on Vietnam War-era defectors.
</P>
<P>
   CNN on Friday settled a lawsuit brought by retired U.S. Army
Gen. John Singlaub, who had been named as a source in the report.
Terms weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub was a former commander of the Studies and Operations
Group, an elite unit of the Army Special Forces accused of being
involved in the nerve gas operations. He had been named by a former
CNN producer as a source for the Operation Tailwind report.
</P>
<P>
   CNN retracted its June 7, 1998 report about a month after airing
it because it could not verify its accuracy. The network fired two
producers and a third resigned over the story. The lead reporter,
Peter Arnett, was reprimanded and ultimately left the network.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had an extensive, two-day mediation conference, during
which General Singlaub was able to air his grievances and
defendants were able to respond,'' said Keith Mitnik, Singlaub's
lawyer. ''The sessions were very productive and paved the way for a
resolution of the disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN spokeswoman had no comment, other than to confirm a
settlement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub appeared on camera during the Operation Tailwind
report, explaining why it could be important to kill defectors. But
his lawsuit alleged that CNN's story made it appear he had been
involved in an effort to use sarin gas against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The general was quoted more extensively in a CNN ''Impact''
broadcast that aired eight months prior to the Tailwind report. His
lawsuit said CNN defamed him by suggesting on ''Impact'' that
Singlaub might have been involved in an American bombing of
American soldiers in Laos to destroy evidence they were in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnik said that terms of the settlement were confidential,
''other than to say the financial portion of the settlement dealt
only with the 'Impact' broadcast in which General Singlaub was
featured, rather than Tailwind, in which he appeared only
briefly.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an important distinction for CNN and its lawyers, since
they could argue that Singlaub's settlement not be used as a
precedent in other Tailwind-related lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has been sued by other former military officials who served
in the Vietnam-era Special Forces, and those cases are still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also settles Singlaub's cases against Arnett, the
producers involved and Time magazine. Time, a corporate cousin of
CNN, wrote a story based on the Tailwind investigation and later
retracted it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub had been countersued for defamation by April Oliver,
one of the fired CNN producers who worked on the report. Oliver
said that Singlaub had ''confirmed the central ideas of the
Tailwind broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Oliver's lawsuit against Singlaub has
been dropped, Mitnik said.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 3, Giants 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Randy Johnson struck out 11 and Damian
Miller lined a two-out, two-run double in the ninth inning to lift
the Arizona Diamondbacks over San Francisco 3-1 Friday night, the
Giants' sixth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, swept by Los Angeles in their inaugural series at
Pacific Bell Park, are 0-4 in their new stadium. The six-game skid
is San Francisco's longest since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (3-0) continued his early-season brilliance, allowing
five hits without a walk in his second complete game. The NL Cy
Young winner has struck out 34 in 26 2-3 innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Erubiel Durazo hit a leadoff single in the ninth against Livan
Hernandez (0-3) and pinch-runner Hanley Frias moved up on a
sacrifice bunt. Travis Lee reached on an infield single to put
runners at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   After Frias was thrown out at the plate on Lenny Harris'
grounder back to the mound, Miller doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Lee put the Diamondbacks up 1-0 with his third home run of the
season in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson allowed only one hit through 5 2-3 innings. Calvin
Murray, who had singled in the fourth, singled again in the sixth
and scored on Bill Mueller's double down the left-field line to tie
it at 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked two and struck out five in a complete-game
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants nearly took the lead in the eighth when Hernandez
blooped a two-out single and Murray reached on an infield single.
Mueller's hard ground ball up the middle was snared by Johnson to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Johnson has 128 career double-digit strikeout games. That's
the second most to Nolan Ryan's 215. ... Only three left-handed
hitters have faced Johnson this year (Barry Bonds, Rico Brogna,
Brian Giles), going a combined 0-for-11. ... OF Luis Gonzalez has a
career .345 batting average (57-for-165) with three homers and 30
RBIs in San Francisco. ... The Giants optioned RHP Ben Weber to
Triple-A Fresno of the Pacific Coast League before the game. He was
0-1 with a 13.50 ERA in six appearances with San Francisco. The
Giants recalled RHP Scott Linebrink from Fresno.

<HEADLINE> 'Sopranos' Fans Have Long Wait  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Will Tony Soprano act on his fantasies about his
psychiatrist? Will the feds get him? Will his sister stay far away?
</P>
<P>
   Fans of HBO's ''The Sopranos'' will have to wait nearly a year
to see if those questions will be answered. After striking ratings
gold with its season finale this week, the show is going away for
an unusually long hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   The third, 13-episode season of ''The Sopranos'' won't start
until March 2001, to give series creator David Chase more time to
write. The second season began this past January.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process this year was very taxing on him,'' HBO chief
executive Jeff Bewkes said Friday. ''He was pressed a lot. He wants
time to think of the story arc about how the next two seasons
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   To fill the time for anxious fans, HBO will rerun the second
season of ''The Sopranos'' once this summer, and probably again
next winter as the third season approaches. The network may also
air episodes from the drama's first season.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the numbers, viewers caught up with the critics in
their fascination with New Jersey mob boss Soprano and his extended
family.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for the Sunday night episodes this year were 63 percent
higher than for the first year, according to HBO, leaving Bewkes
less worried about the 11-month hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will come back and it will be fine,'' he said. ''Look at
what happened this season -- it was the same thing. It had been away
for nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's episode, which featured the burial at sea of mob snitch
Salvatore ''Big Pussy'' Bompensiero, drew an audience of 9 million
people. One-quarter of the television homes that get HBO were tuned
in. About a quarter of the nation's TV homes get HBO.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest rating for any original HBO show in the
network's history, and the biggest audience for anything on HBO
since last April's cable debut of ''Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase and his ensemble of actors are signed up for two more
years of ''The Sopranos,'' a total of 26 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   After that, if Chase says he's through, the series is over,
Bewkes said. HBO, because it is subscriber-based and doesn't take
advertising, is under less pressure to keep its franchises running
if they are past their peak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons that our shows work and cut through is
because we don't do it that way,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Boy Continues Soccer Play  </HEADLINE>
By DANNY M. BOYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Months after his fight to play soccer drew
national attention, Ryan Taylor and his padded red walker are back
on the field -- this time without objection.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a 9-year-old with cerebral palsy, is playing with his
Pioneer Park Thunder teammates and without any opposition from the
Lawton Evening Optimist Soccer Association.
</P>
<P>
   The league had suspended Ryan over safety concerns about his
walker. But he won the right to play the final game of last fall's
season from a federal judge after he claimed the league violated
the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling applied only to the one game, but the league has
since agreed to let Ryan play, said his mother, JoAnne Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knew who he was,'' she said. ''I was wondering if he
was going to be able to play without a camera in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has become a local celebrity since his battle with the
league. He rode on the fire truck during Lawton's Christmas parade
and flipped the switch with a group of kids on the community
Christmas tree, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood promoter Paul Shrater plans to pitch Ryan's story to
networks and cable stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was immediately something that struck me as one of the
human heart kind of stories that people like and I'd like to see
more of,'' Shrater said.
</P>
<P>
   Any money, Taylor said, would be put a college fund for Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   After this spring and fall, Ryan will be too old and the next
level of soccer too competitive, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ryan mans his position as a defender near the goal with
his four-wheeled walker in front of him. There's usually not much
action on Ryan's end of the field, but Taylor said her son is just
happy to be on the field with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's three of them down there, and I think they're picking
flowers and going to sleep most of the time,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Anniversary Nears  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- As the anniversary of the Columbine High
School attack nears, many students, teachers and victims' relatives
are striving to insulate themselves from the world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   They have stood shoulder to shoulder facing the media, patiently
answering questions with wavering voices and watery eyes. Some have
asked for privacy as they observe Thursday's anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Al and Phyllis Velasquez, whose son Kyle was killed, considered
leaving the city but instead will have a potluck dinner with family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, running away would be like we're ashamed,'' Al
Velasquez said. His wife added, ''There's no shame.''
</P>
<P>
   As April 20 approaches, some find themselves breaking into tears
at times or slipping backward in the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a flashback,'' Phyllis Velasquez said. ''You
remember what you were doing that day. I remember waiting in the
gymnasium at the elementary school, hoping to see my child walk
through. Those are things we've been able to hold at bay until this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Principal Frank DeAngelis estimated about 5 percent to 10
percent of the student body -- up to 200 -- will attend a closed
memorial service Thursday, based on attendance at other school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The anniversary is definitely a milestone,'' said Jefferson
County School District spokeswoman Marilyn Saltzman. ''Staff and
students are feeling that it is coming, and I don't think anybody
knows how they are going to feel on that day.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials expect up to 100,000 people to attend a public
memorial service Thursday afternoon at a park adjacent to
Columbine. It will be followed by a candlelight vigil.
</P>
<P>
   A separate service will be held at the State Capitol, where Gov.
Bill Owens will call for a moment of silence at 11:21 a.m., the
time the attack began.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of at least four victims plan to attend a service
Thursday afternoon at the nearby Trinity Christian Center. It was
organized by Darrell Scott, whose daughter, Rachel, was slain.
</P>
<P>
   Security will be increased at Columbine and other district
schools, but officials decline to be more specific. Students and
educators have been required all year to wear identification
badges.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly lunchtime when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
strode onto Columbine's campus and opened fire, killing two
students outside the school. They entered the building, scattered
gunfire and explosive devices and fatally shot 10 more classmates
and teacher Dave Sanders before they committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage, the worst school shooting in U.S. history, has cost
nearly $9 million in expenses incurred by public agencies who
responded last April 20, and ongoing investigative and counseling
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some students and teachers feel Columbine has become a
sanctuary, where they feel safer than in the outside world because
others inside the school have gone through the same healing
process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before everything happened, I had kind of like my
kid-protected bubble, that nothing bad was ever going to happen to
me,'' said sophomore Katie Beer. ''Now, I still feel safe at school
with my teachers and my friends, but I feel like my bubble is
gone.''

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Jolts Finance Officials  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the prospect of thousands of protesters
disrupting their meetings wasn't enough, the world's top finance
ministers will now have to contemplate what a record plunge on Wall
Street will do to global confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan were playing host today to their counterparts from
the world's richest industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the global economy, which was to be a key agenda
topic, will certainly include a review of Friday's record plunge in
U.S. stock prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling
617.78 points, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index
dropping a record 355.49 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- were meeting in advance of the
spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-globalization activists have vowed to disrupt the meetings
of the IMF and World Bank by forming human chains and clogging
streets to prevent delegates from attending the discussions,
repeating their success in disrupting the meetings last December of
the World Trade Organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal law enforcement authorities have vowed to
prevent a recurrence of the Seattle disturbances, which included
window-smashing and other random acts of violence by a small group
of anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   The G-7 meeting site at the Blair House and the White House
across the street both were being guarded by extra-heavy security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Before the G-7 discussions got under way at midday, Summers was
scheduled to meet separately with the finance ministers from
France, Britain, Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing a package of reform
proposals for both the IMF and the World Bank, but other countries
have voiced objections to some of the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It was likely that the weekend meetings would end with a vague
pledge to continue pushing reform efforts at the two institutions,
which were heavily criticized for their handling of the 1997-98
global financial crisis, while leaving the details to further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Following Friday's tumble, which ended a bad week on Wall
Street, Summers insisted that the economic fundamentals in the
United States remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States economy has been a source of strength for
itself and a source of strength for the global economy,'' he said
in a CNN interview minutes after the markets closed. ''The right
priority for us is (to focus) on those fundamentals that are
important for sustained economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers refused to respond directly when asked if the
administration had the same worries as the IMF, which in its latest
economic forecast this week listed a sharp drop in U.S. stock
prices as one of the threats facing the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF produced an optimistic forecast this week that the world
economy would grow 4.2 percent this year, the fastest pace in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But it warned that one of the dangers to this forecast was a
sharp plunge in the value of U.S. stocks, which could cause
consumers to cut back on spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
total economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who has been warning since 1996 about the dangers of
investors' ''irrational exuberance'' said in a speech Friday
financial markets were still vulnerable to a sudden loss in
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the general human experience that when confronted with
uncertainty, whether in financial markets or in any other aspect of
life, disengagement is the normal protective reaction,'' Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin said Friday that Canada
would put forward its own proposal at the weekend meetings to
institute a halt in repayment of loans by countries to their
foreign creditors, including commercial banks, in times of economic
difficulty as a way to instill more caution on the part of private
investors.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was important for global institutions like the
IMF to address legitimate criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must demonstrate that we understand that countries are made
up of people and not economic indicators,'' he said in a Washington
speech. ''We need to address the skepticism as to what meetings
such as this weekend's are all about.''

<HEADLINE> World Bank Protesters Dump Manure  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington police are ready and waiting, but
demonstrators say they may yet pull a surprise with creative
tactics that will succeed in disrupting this weekend's meetings of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been completely amazed by the creativity by my
colleagues,'' said Njoki Njehu, an organizer with the coalition
sponsoring the protests, the Mobilization for Global Justice. ''The
message is getting out and that is already a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Njehu said demonstrators have learned lessons in ingenuity from
their experiences last year in Seattle, where they disrupted the
World Trade Organization meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just like police are gathering intelligence, we are doing the
same,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters raised a stink outside the World Bank on Friday by
dumping cow manure on Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   A truck festooned with signs saying ''World Bank: Meat Stinks,''
deposited the manure on the avenue known as ''America's Main
Street,'' upwind of the White House. Two protesters were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Department of Public Works carted away the pile in a
city vehicle escorted by a police van with siren blaring and lights
flashing.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, police completely, though respectfully,
surrounded a small knot of demonstrators gathered in front of the
Mexican Embassy, across the street from World Bank and IMF
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly young and almost silent crowd, protesting treatment
of indigenous Mexicans, was led by an older man looking the part of
a grizzled veteran activist, with a red bandanna tied around his
head and beating a drum.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rest of the neighborhood remained quiet, several
businesses prepared to board up windows as workers left for the
weekend, including a Citibank branch in a corner suite with
floor-to-ceiling glass.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters plan to disrupt Sunday and Monday's spring
meetings at the World Bank and the IMF, but most have pledged not
to be violent. Still, some downtown offices closed Friday in
anticipation of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Police also closed more and more roadways in advance of mass
gatherings. Streets swarmed with officers wearing dark uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Others in riot helmets and visors were scattered across the
White House lawn. They spent much of their day watching tourists
who unknowingly scheduled trips to Washington at a time of
potentially massive protests.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and IMF were given temporary diplomatic status,
allowing the Secret Service to assist the 3,500-member Metropolitan
Police Department, which has placed officers on 12-hour shifts. The
U.S. Park Police also had a full complement of officers protecting
federal parkland, including the Ellipse behind the White House,
where a major demonstration is planned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An array of organizations hold the World Bank and IMF
responsible for destroying rain forests, allowing factory
sweatshops and holding down social spending by poor nations saddled
with large foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like to liken the IMF to ... a medieval doctor who only has
one cure, which is to put a leech on the country and drain it,''
said John Cavanagh, director of the Institute for Policy Studies, a
Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The driver and passenger in the manure truck were from People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is protesting World
Bank agricultural policies. One was charged with crossing a police
line, the other with illegal dumping.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Use budget surpluses to eliminate national debt by 2013  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- Campaigning on Long Island for fiscal
responsibility, Hillary Rodham Clinton pitched the idea of paying
off the national debt by 2013 and said doing so would lead to lower
interest rates and greater savings for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the Long Island Association that -- after preserving
Social Security -- she believes Congress should dedicate at least 40
percent of the remaining $750 billion budget surplus over the next
decade to eliminating the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe this represents a tremendous and unprecedented
opportunity,'' she said Friday. ''The decision on how we spend this
non-Social Security surplus will be the most important decision
facing the next Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was received warmly at the $35-a-plate breakfast for
1,300 in Nassau County. But not everyone thought she had all the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Badolato, a commercial loan officer for Mellon Bank in
Uniondale, said she was not a Clinton supporter before the meeting,
and was not swayed. ''I think she's very nice. I like her. But I
don't think many of her ideas are too practical. ... Also, I don't
like the fact that she's not a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   After outlining her economic ideas, Clinton took questions from
the audience. She said she supported expanding trade relations with
China as a means of gaining access to its markets, as well as to
bring the communist nation closer to the world community.
</P>
<P>
   She also covered topics including health care, education,
housing and energy conservation.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that although she backs tax cuts for
middle-class families who need help sending their children to
college, parents struggling to pay for child care and families
caring for their aging parents, she opposes proposals by
Republicans in Congress for an across-the-board tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not support any tax cut that would force us to abandon
the course of fiscal discipline and spend the surplus before we
have paid down the debt,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Feld, the owner of a small printing company, said
Clinton had won him over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked the way she got to the point on various issues,'' he
said. ''I think she's honest and it seemed she truly cared about
the issues. ... I was very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference later Friday, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her Republican rival for the U.S. Senate, said he
supported cuts in the income tax and the capital gains tax, which
he said would spur the state's economy. The state's residents pay
about $15 billion more in taxes than they get back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were in Congress, those would be the two I would fight
really, really hard to reduce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked to respond to Clinton's economic ideas, he grew
irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, come on,'' he said to reporters. ''Mrs. Clinton, Mrs.
Clinton. You guys sure are unbelievable. You're like knee-jerk,
knee-jerk, knee-jerk. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the room, Giuliani said, apparently speaking to
reporters, ''join the Democratic National Committee.''

<HEADLINE> Revolutionary War Recalled  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Hefting his ''Brown Bess'' flintlock and
its shiny bayonet, the British redcoat cuts a fearsome figure,
straight out of a history book.
</P>
<P>
   Niall Kynoch, who stepped off a plane from England to step back
in time 225 years, is one of some 2,000 re-enactors who have come
to the first battlegrounds of the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the 32-year-old software developer feel about
playing one of the bad guys this weekend at Lexington and Concord?
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our country,'' quipped Kynoch, who is from Hook in
Hampshire County. ''Bloody hell, this land belongs to King
George.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of spectators are expected to witness ''Paul
Revere'' making a midnight ride and mock gunfire thundering on the
green at Lexington, at the Old North Bridge in Concord, in
Minuteman National Historic Park and other historic locations.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, 1775, British soldiers were dispatched to destroy
the colonials' supply depot at Concord. The march was supposed to
be secret, but Revere and William Dawes sounded the alarm. At dawn
the next day, the two sides faced each other on the village green
at Lexington. Eight colonists were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The British marched to Concord, where they destroyed military
supplies and then retreated to Boston, peppered by fire from
colonials along what is now called the Battle Road. Ultimately, the
British suffered 273 casualties, the Americans 95.
</P>
<P>
   For the event, part of the national park is being returned to
its Revolutionary War-era look, with pavement removed in some
places.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, participates settled into hundreds of beige canvas
tents at a soccer field. Most of the redcoat re-enactors are from
America. But Kynoch was one of a group of 17 who traveled from
England to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Jepson, 39, a ruddy-faced officer in Kynoch's unit who has
served in the real British Army, said he wasn't bothered by playing
the villain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not villains, are we? We're the good guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachussetts resident Brad Chetwynd, 58, has been doing
re-enactments for 26 years. He will play an American militia
captain.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing tiny-lensed glasses with 250-year-old frames, Chetwynd
said some re-enactors love getting into history and others like the
military aspect. He has enjoyed making friends through the hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can go down to the green and watch the British column coming
onto the green, and you're back there, you're really living it,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Falwell Announces Voter Drive  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tapping into churches for help, television
evangelist Jerry Falwell is launching an effort to register 10
million voters as he tries to re-energize the religious right after
a brutal Republican primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell insisted Friday that the effort is not aimed at helping
any candidate or political party, but he allowed that, ''People who
pray will probably vote all right, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed, he went further: ''You know and I know that the
churches and pastors who allow me to assist them in this effort
probably are not connected closely with Al Sharpton or Jesse
Jackson or Al Gore. That's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's announcement came a day after presidential contender
George W. Bush sought to reach out from his conservative base to
moderate and independent voters by meeting with a group of gay
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It also followed a primary season in which Bush's closest
challenger for the Republican nomination, Arizona Sen. John McCain,
denounced Falwell and Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson as
''agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think religious conservatives have lost any of their
power. I think they've lost their enthusiasm,'' Falwell told
reporters as he launched the formation of ''People of Faith 2000.''
He said it would lead a seven-month drive to register at least 10
million new voters by urging pastors to solicit their support
during church meetings.
</P>
<P>
   His effort was denounced as a ''shady shell game'' by Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, a private group that
said Falwell was trying to help Bush in the election. The group
said it filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service
alleging that such political activity would abuse a church's
tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   David Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson
University in South Carolina, said Falwell's effort seemed aimed at
maintaining the religious right's ''influence in the political
party, which is clearly on the wane.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell said the legalities of the effort had been researched.
He also denied that the campaign was an effort to recover from the
strong primary-season criticism from McCain, one of the
Republicans' top two contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did more toward energizing people of faith than, I have
noticed, since Ronald Reagan,'' Falwell said. In fact, exit polls
showed that voters who were influenced by McCain's comments
generally picked Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush and McCain share many conservative views, the
Arizona senator drew considerable support from GOP moderates,
independents and Democrats in this year's open primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's new group is aiming to raise $18.6 million to pay for
its operations, and Falwell pledged it would go out of existence on
Nov. 8, the day after the election.
</P>
<P>
   During the primary season, Republican exit polls consistently
showed that almost one-third of voters described themselves as
members of the religious right. Bush won the support of about
three-fourths of the religious right after more conservative
candidates withdrew from the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''In reality, this is a highly partisan drive that Falwell
himself has admitted is intended to help put George W. Bush in the
White House,'' said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell also said he had no problem with Bush's meeting with gay
activists. When the governor emerged Thursday from the hourlong
session at his Texas campaign headquarters, he said he was touched
by the stories he heard but had not dropped his conservative
beliefs such as his opposition to gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's all the signal that people of faith need to
know,'' Falwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative, Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, was
less charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was a typical example of political pandering. The
conservatives and the Christian folks who gave him his victory have
apparently lost their usefulness to the governor, and he's out
searching for what he considers greener pastures,'' he said in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would tell the governor that political pandering is going to
kill his campaign, and it's eventually going to kill the Republican
Party.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Stands by Environmental Book  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The book that critics say made Al Gore green
with environmental extremism is being recycled in the midst of his
presidential election campaign, and he's not backing down from the
views that gave Republicans almost a decade of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a new introduction to ''Earth in the Balance,'' Gore
tells opponents ''let me save you the trouble of reading the entire
book'' and points them to the pages where he advocates the
elimination of the internal combustion engine, bread and butter of
the U.S. auto industry, in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible, it needs to be done; it will create jobs, not
destroy jobs,'' writes the vice president and Democratic
presidential candidate. ''I'm proud that I wrote those words in
1992, and I reaffirm them today.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he never proposed getting rid of cars, but the
development of new types of cars that won't hurt the environment.
Automakers themselves are racing to perfect alternatives to
internal combustion, he says. ''The (GOP) attack was never more
than smoke and fumes,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee uses the book as favorite
fodder. It routinely dredges up Gore's thoughts on auto engines
when he ventures near Detroit. GOP presidential candidate George W.
Bush has also taken a few swipes, saying recently that Gore should
explain some of the views in the book. Bush admitted he hadn't read
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that every American will read 'Earth in the Balance,'
... Al Gore's extremist manifesto,'' RNC spokesman Mark Pfeifle
said Friday. ''It will make him a rich, best-selling author but
make sure he'll never be president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Earth in the Balance,'' released as Gore was switching from a
Senate career to presidential politics as Bill Clinton's running
mate, turned into a hot seller and cemented his reputation as an
environmentalist with a world view.
</P>
<P>
   In the new foreword, Gore says that his early warnings about
global warming have not only held up to scrutiny but were ahead of
their time. The vice president later was crucial in negotiating the
Kyoto accord on greenhouse gases, but some environmentalists have
faulted him and President Clinton for not trying hard enough to get
the treaty ratified by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I wrote this book, terms like 'global warming' and
'greenhouse gases' seemed exotic, unfamiliar and unimportant to the
lives of ordinary Americans,'' Gore says now. ''That has changed
dramatically -- except for those who still want to pretend that no
one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes the Kyoto treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin said the introduction was the only change in
the edition being released next week for Earth Day's 30th
anniversary, meaning the ideas that created the most fuss remain in
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have quoted some passages relentlessly to portray Gore
as an overwrought nay-sayer, such as his assertion that saving the
environment should be civilization's ''central organizing
principle'' and his depiction of society as essentially
''dysfunctional'' because of what it has done to the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that automobiles were ''posing a mortal threat to the
security of every nation that is more deadly than that of any
military enemy we are ever again likely to confront.''
</P>
<P>
   And he cited signs of ''an environmental holocaust without
precedent,'' contending ''today the evidence of an ecological
Kristallnacht is as clear as the sound of glass shattering in
Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore has not pitched some of the book's prescriptions
in this campaign, such as the ''virgin materials fee'' that he said
in 1992 should be levied on paper mills that use freshly cut trees
and on other manufacturers using nonrenewable raw material.
</P>
<P>
   The new foreword appears to modulate what appears later in the
book in one respect. Gore says the environment may be the issue
that has the greatest impact for all time ''next to the threat of
nuclear war.''
</P>
<P>
   John Baden, contributing editor of ''Environmental Gore,'' a
book critical of ''Earth in the Balance,'' said Gore may well be
right about the internal combustion engine and was ahead in seeing
global warming as a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore ''seems not capable of thinking on the margins,'' Baden
said from Bozeman, Mont. ''His lack of appreciation of economic
analysis and risk analysis is intellectually disturbing.''

<HEADLINE> Editors Examine Coverage of Youth  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- News outlets need to give reporters more time
to ask the questions that give youth and school stories more depth,
editors were told by critics of how the media cover young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has to be a crime, usually a serious crime, to get any
coverage,'' said Beth Frerking, director of the University of
Maryland's Casey Journalism Center for Children and Families.
''It's more than covering a school shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a meeting of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, Frerking said news reporters either ignore stories about
youth and families or provide only superficial coverage when they
do write about child abuse, schools or foster care.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released at Friday's discussion suggests that editors
and reporters have much work to do to improve their ways.
</P>
<P>
   Responses showed that:
</P>
<P>
   --Three in five reporters and editors said there's too little
coverage of youth and family issues.
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy percent said they've covered school violence, compared
with 51 percent who say they've worked on stories about early
childhood development.
</P>
<P>
   --Eighty percent said journalists need special training to cover
youth and families.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released by the Foundation for American
Communications, is based on 420 randomly selected journalists
interviewed this winter. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9
percentage points, said the Champaign, Ill.-based Research Survey
Service, the pollster.
</P>
<P>
   A tally of newspaper articles published this winter found only
six reports about homeless children, although about a fourth of the
nation's homeless are youngsters, said George White, who directs
journalism programs for the Pasadena, Calif.-based communications
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The group's report also included a quiz of journalists'
knowledge of certain youth topics: It found that while media
workers are relatively well-informed about homelessness and
parental custody laws, few realized that the juvenile crime rate is
declining and that few schools use metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest untold story is the lack of preschool education,
said former Miami Herald publisher David Lawrence Jr., who now
heads the Early Childhood Initiative Foundation at Florida
International University in Miami. Children are starting school
malnourished, abused and otherwise unprepared to learn, he said.
Yet news media often neglect to report research that shows such
facts as that of 100 first graders who can't read, 88 still will be
unable to read when they are in fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't need to tell you the future of the newspaper business
depends on people who can read,'' he said. ''Everyone including
journalists are the products of an education system that has
dismissed anything before the age of 5 as nursery school and
baby-sitting and hence undeserving of serious attention.''

<HEADLINE> START II May Spark Weapons Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and Russian negotiators are to meet
next week in Geneva to consider more cuts in long-range nuclear
arms now that the Duma has approved the START II treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That treaty, dating from 1993, trims 5,000 warheads from U.S.
and Russian arsenals. A follow-up pact could lop off another 1,000
to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Clinton administration wants to convince
Russia that both countries need anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Friday that if the
United States violates a 1972 ban on nationwide defenses Russia
would scrap START II and other treaties curbing nuclear and
conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to announce by the end of the year
a decision whether to go ahead with development of a defensive
missile system of 100 launchers and new radar. A critical test of
the system is due in late June.
</P>
<P>
   To legalize the U.S. project, Clinton would like Russia to agree
to a revision of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That's the
treaty to which Putin said Friday deployment of a defensive missile
system would violate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, then-President Boris Yeltsin agreed with Clinton to
consider missile-defense issues together with reductions in nuclear
weapons. But Yeltsin and now Putin have continued to oppose gutting
the 1972 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Marc Thiessen, spokesman for Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., said that Putin is ''sadly mistaken'' if he thinks the
United States will not go ahead with a defense against missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Helms is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
which has the power to block weapons reductions under START II even
after the Duma's vote to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   A series of U.S. laws kept the Clinton administration from
scrapping long-range warheads before the treaty takes effect. While
the Duma has now ratified the accord, an addition to the treaty
giving Russia until the end of 2007 to get down to the level of
3,000 to 3,500 warheads must be approved by the Senate before the
U.S. arsenal can be trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate advocates of a much larger U.S. missile defense system
also will have a chance to try to get their way when the Senate
acts on a protocol that brought three former Soviet republics that
once deployed missiles, Ukraine, Kazakstan and Belarus, into the
1972 accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''This presents a real dilemma for the administration,'' said
Spurgeon Keeny, president of the private Arms Control Association.
''If they want START II to enter into force, they will have to move
on this,'' he said in an interview. ''But if they do, the best that
can happen is nothing; the worst is defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Keeny called Russian ratification a ''very welcome and
important step in moving ahead with the reduction of nuclear
weapons. It allows formal negotiations to begin immediately on a
START III treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have decided to aim for 2,000 to 2,500 warheads in
a START III treaty, with Russia showing interest in getting down
toward 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a
private research group, said he did not consider Russian
ratification ''a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a treaty that has been overtaken by events,'' Krepon
said in an interview. ''Now what the administration needs to do is
to negotiate a deal with Putin on deeper cuts and on limited
missile defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mendelsohn, a former U.S. negotiator now executive director
of the Lawyers Alliance for World Security, said the ball is now in
the U.S. court, but it is unlikely the administration and the
Senate could cooperate enough to approve the add-on agreements that
key conservative senators have threatened to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the administration can't deliver on START II, how can they
come through on START III and limited changes to the ABM treaty?''
he said in an interview.

<HEADLINE> Black Farmers Criticize USDA  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year after they settled a civil rights
lawsuit, black farmers say the Agriculture Department still isn't
doing enough to address discrimination against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing you can credit the Agriculture Department for
is ... the fact that they admitted something happened and had the
guts to look at this. That's the only progress we've made,'' said
John Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers Association.
</P>
<P>
   USDA won court approval a year ago Friday for the settlement of
a lawsuit filed on behalf of black farmers who claimed that they
had been systematically discriminated against for years when they
applied for loans and subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18,000 farmers filed claims under the settlement. Some
7,329 cases have been approved so far, and payments of $50,000 each
have been made to 3,594 of those, according to a report that the
department is releasing later this month on its civil rights
record. Another 4,742 claims have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''From hiring practices to program outreach to accountability
and disciplinary action, we have taken strong steps to ensure that
all USDA employees and customers are treated with the fairness,
dignity, and respect that they deserve,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman says in the preface to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the settlement, farmers who can show some
evidence of discrimination are entitled to $50,000 each and have
outstanding loans forgiven. An additional $12,500 is being sent to
the Internal Revenue Service in the name of each farmer to cover
the federal income taxes that he or she would owe on the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Another 142 farmers who believe they have stronger evidence of
discrimination are seeking higher levels of damages.
</P>
<P>
   The department now is being sued by American Indian farmers and
also has been battling several discrimination complaints filed by
groups of minority employees.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's inspector general has been critical of record keeping and
management in the department's civil rights office.
</P>
<P>
   A top-level official in the department should have been removed
as a signal to the rest of the department, which has 84,000
employees, that discrimination would not be tolerated, Boyd said.
Farmers still find it difficult to get help from the department, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The department has fired 13 workers and disciplined 81 others
over the past two years for discrimination against farmers or
minority USDA employees, according to the department's report.
</P>
<P>
   Besides settling the lawsuit, the department has increased its
lending to women and minorities and boosted their representation on
the state and county committees that oversee its programs, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 107 of the 224 state committee members were minorities and
women as of last year, up from 75 in 1994.

Investors Ponder Terrible week
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors have the weekend to lick their wounds and rethink
their trading strategy after one of Wall Street's worst weeks ever ended in a
selling stampede. Stocks lost almost $2 trillion in value this week, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index falling an unprecedented 25 percent.
''It's killing me. It's been a bad week,'' said Joe Ayala, a lawyer in
Sacramento, Calif. But he wasn't prepared to bail out when markets resume
trading Monday. He spoke Friday as the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted a
record 617.78 points, or 5.7 percent, to close at 10,305.77. Its weekly drop of
more than 805 points also was a record. The Nasdaq dropped a record 355.49
points.

Cassini Spacecraft Survives Asteroids
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's Cassini spacecraft has flown through an
asteroid belt without any problems and is on track for its 2004 encounter with
Saturn. The region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter has lots of rocky
debris, but no one expected any trouble for the $3.3 billion mission, said Bob
Mitchell, Cassini's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ''I'm
glad we passed through it, but it's pretty routine,'' he said Friday. ''There's
a lot of material in the belt, but there's also an awful lot of space out
there.''

Miami Relatives Respond in Elian Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives said Friday that the boy would
be psychologically harmed if he were turned over immediately to his father.
Relatives said they were willing to bring Elian to a meeting with his father,
but only within close driving distance of Miami so as not to traumatize him. The
U.S. government had asked a federal appeals panel to order Elian's great-uncle
to turn the 6-year-old Cuban refugee over to his father. The Justice Department
said Lazaro Gonzalez should receive no help from a court until he surrenders the
boy.

Clinton Hits GOP on Education, Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republicans Friday of shortchanging
schools to pay for huge tax cuts and said Americans should look at the GOP's
budget and ask, ''How does all this add up?'' ''I think it's wrong to spend
about $100 of the surplus on tax cuts for every $1 you spend on education,''
Clinton told reporters, university spokesmen and others at a gathering of the
Education Writers Association. The House and Senate approved a $1.83 trillion
package yesterday that includes big tax cuts as well as reductions in many
domestic programs.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders welcomed a tentative agreement on

Caribbean nations Friday and suggested final action could come next month. A
monthslong logjam on the bill, a top Clinton administration trade initiative,
was broken last night as leaders from the House and the Senate met to hammer out

Fla. Court To Address Death Appeals

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Supreme Court Friday voided most of a
new law intended to speed death penalty appeals but promised to address the
issue itself. The justices unanimously found that parts of the Death Penalty
Reform Act of 2000, which was passed during a special legislative session in
January, violate the separation of powers clause in the Florida Constitution.
Only the judicial branch of government has the power to make court rules, the
justices concluded.

Diamondbacks Defeat Giants 3-1
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Randy Johnson struck out 11 and Damian Miller lined a
two-out, two-run double in the ninth inning to lift the Arizona Diamondbacks
over San Francisco 3-1 Friday night, the Giants' sixth straight loss. The
Giants, swept by Los Angeles in their inaugural series at Pacific Bell Park, are
0-4 in their new stadium. The six-game skid is San Francisco's longest since
September 1996. Johnson (3-0) continued his early-season brilliance, allowing
five hits without a walk in his second complete game.

New class-action suit seeks Holocaust damages from Austrian
companies   
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawyer has accused 80 Austrian banks and
companies in an $18 billion lawsuit of conspiring with the Nazis to
help fuel the Holocaust and wartime slave labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court by a New
York lawyer who specializes in cases stemming from the Holocaust.
The attorney, Edward Fagan, did not immediately return a telephone
message for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court documents, the Austrian banks and
companies allegedly are continuing to conceal their wrongdoing
while failing to account for assets that once belonged to Holocaust
victims, which the lawsuit seeks to certify as a class.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using forced labor, benefits came from
''Aryanization,'' a Nazi-era term used to describe the seizure of
homes, businesses and other property from owners not deemed
ethnically pure.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was greeted in Vienna, Austria, by government
officials dismayed at the global nature of a lawsuit targeting
companies that are household names -- including the Austrian Postal
Savings Bank and the Vienna Dorotheum auction house.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also names as defendants Laenderbank and Creditanstalt,
two major banks now operating under a single ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have the ambition to deal with Fagan now. Austria has
conscionably offered a gesture for the victims,'' Chancellor
Wolfgang Schuessel told Austrian state radio.
</P>
<P>
   The government has maintained it would be faster and more
expedient to settle the labor claims before dealing with other
issues, including compensation for Austrian Jews or their heirs
whose property was stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Austrian government appointed Maria
Schaumayer, a former National Bank president, to work out an
agreement with former victims or their families on compensation for
former slave laborers in Nazi-ruled Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel said his government had ''full confidence'' in
Schaumayer's work.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer of Joerg Haider's far-right
Freedom Party called the lawsuit ''incomprehensible,'' hinting the
attorneys involved were more interested in their fees than in the
cause they represent.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser, also of the Freedom party,
spoke of ''public pressure'' being used ''as an instrument,''
adding that ''the population's patience should not be overtaxed.''

<HEADLINE> Son of NAACP Leader Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A son of NAACP president Kweisi Mfume has been
sentenced to four years and nine months in prison for federal drug
and weapons convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald T. Gray, 29, pleaded guilty last October, admitting he
sold cocaine in Washington for more than two years. At his arrest
last May, federal Drug Enforcement Administration officers found
cocaine, a scale, packaging materials and $8,500 cash at his
District of Columbia home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Gray was a calculated drug dealer,'' U.S. District Judge
Henry H. Kennedy said Friday, before giving him time less than
minimum recommended under federal sentencing guidelines. A drug
conviction for amounts of cocaine between 3.5 and 5 kilograms
carries penalties of 70 to 87 months in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the guidelines were too severe because of Gray's
efforts toward rehabilitation since his arrest. Gray has regularly
attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to hasten his rehabilitation
and has lived in a halfway house while working as a restaurant
busboy.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume, who once used the name Frizzell Gray, was in the
courtroom with other family members. The NAACP president was among
several family members who pleaded for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very humbling to have to acknowledge that it is your own
child'' who has problems, said the former four-term Maryland
congressman.

<HEADLINE> GOP: We've Made Progress  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ask how Congress has progressed this session
and the answer will depend on which side is talking.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of a tax break for Social Security recipients, an
on-time budget and progress on other measures are evidence
Republicans tout as proof that Congress' glass is half full. But
Democrats cite stalled bills on the minimum wage, health care and
gun control as proof it is half-empty.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through an election-year session marked by lavish
political posturing, it makes no difference which side is right.
Lawmakers have five months or so to complete the record of the
106th Congress, and then the voters will render their own verdict,
the only one that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ''From Social Security to prescription drugs. From tax fairness
to education. This has been -- and will continue to be -- a Congress
of real accomplishment,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert declared on
Thursday as lawmakers were departing on their spring break.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Capitol a short while earlier, the Democratic
leadership offered their own, downbeat assessment. They handed out
copies of a report entitled ''GOP Congress -- Leaving on a Jet
Plane, Don't Know when we'll Get Any Bills Again.'' The cover page
included a photo of a jetliner, and thought had been given --
however briefly -- to superimposing Hastert's likeness in the
cockpit window.
</P>
<P>
   ''The GOP Congress is leaving town with no managed care reform,
no prescription drug coverage for seniors, no gun safety measures,
no measures to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare, no
measures to improve public education, and no minimum wage
increase,'' said House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that despite his protests, Gephardt would rather
see gridlock than accomplishments, so he can paint the GOP as
obstructionists and increase Democratic chances of gaining a
majority in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   There is movement on many of the issues that Gephardt mentioned
and Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle seconded. But whether that
represents progress toward enactment of legislation is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   -- House Republicans this week unveiled a plan to make private
prescription drug insurance available to senior citizens. They said
they had set aside $40 billion in their budget to subsidize the
poor and those whose bills are highest. Democrats said it was a
sham, and insurance industry reacted coolly.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bipartisan negotiators from both houses on a ''patient's bill
of rights'' bill announced tentative agreement Thursday a system
for independent reviews in cases of denial of care. If confirmed
when put into formal legislative language, it would mark a major
step forward in the talks, although other key hurdles remain.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gun control legislation remains deadlocked. With President
Clinton speaking at Columbine High School this week on the
anniversary of last year's school shootings, House Republicans
floated a compromise on establishing a waiting period for sales at
gunshows. They told reporters about their proposal before
presenting it to Democrats, who rejected it promptly.
</P>
<P>
   -- A minimum wage increase has passed both houses, but formal
compromise talks are stalled, in large part because the Senate
measure is tacked onto a bankruptcy bill. Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., a critic of that measure, has thus far refused to allow
the two bills to be separated.
</P>
<P>
   -- Republicans passed their budget on time, largely on party-line
votes, and point out it sets aside $170 billion to pay down the
federal debt. The annual appropriations season is next, and even
some of the GOP subcommittee chairs who will draft those measures
say they don't have enough money to work with.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant legislative accomplishment thus far this
year is the politically popular repeal of the so-called earnings
limit. It permits individuals between the ages of 65-69 to make as
much money as they wish without losing a portion of their Social
Security benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans proposed it, and Clinton, who had not included it in
his budget, quickly announced his support. Democrats, too, climbed
on board.
</P>
<P>
   But that stands in contrast to the political maneuvering
surrounding taxes and many other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans pressed for a vote on a temporary roll back
of the gasoline tax -- despite a Constitutional requirement that the
House originate all tax legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Senate GOP forced a vote on a $248 billion measure to
grant relief from the so-called ''marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For 10 years, we have talked about the unfairness of the
marriage penalty tax,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss. ''We're going to see who is for eliminating it and who is
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill was larger than necessary and bottled it
up when Lott refused to give in to their demands for votes on
amendments on a prescription drug program, tax breaks for college
and other popular items.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Daschle turned Lott's claim on its head. ''The
real secret that I hope everybody has fully uncovered here is that
the Republicans don't want a vote on a prescription drug benefit,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Teen Has Baby After Rape  </HEADLINE>
By ARTURO SALINAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICALI, Mexico (AP) -- A teen-age girl pressured by state and
religious officials to drop a request for a legal abortion after
she was raped has given birth to a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Paulina, a 14-year-old from the state of Baja California,
delivered a 7-pound, 12-ounce baby by Caesarean section on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Her pregnancy -- and her ultimate decision to give birth -- has
provoked a furor among human rights officials and feminist groups,
who accuse state authorities in this intensely Catholic country of
overstepping their legal bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Baja California's governor, meanwhile, has refused to honor a
recommendation from a human rights prosecutor that he punish the
state attorney general who tried to dissuade Paulina from having
the abortion and the doctors who refused to perform it.
</P>
<P>
   Paulina's parents, trembling and tearful after the 30-minute
birth in the city of Mexicali, said they would do their best to
take care of the boy, named Isaac, but would never forget what the
state put them through.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy because everything went well, but I have a lot of
anger,'' said the teen's mother, Maria Elena Jacinto, who broke
down sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare for Paulina began on July 31, when a robber broke
into her family's home, tied her up and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the family's intense Catholic roots, Paulina and her
parents decided she could not bear the rapist's child.
</P>
<P>
   The law in Baja California -- and a majority of other states in
Mexico -- allows abortion in cases of rape or when the life of the
mother or the baby is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of these instances, having an abortion is considered an
offense punishable by one to five years in jail for the mother and
10 for the doctor who performs it.
</P>
<P>
   When Paulina arrived at a hospital for poor people in Mexicali,
the chief of obstetrics refused to obey the state's orders to
provide an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   During her weeklong stay in the hospital, Paulina was visited by
two women who identified themselves as government social workers
and showed her graphic abortion videos meant to discourage her from
having the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The social work agency later denied that any of its employees
had visited Paulina.
</P>
<P>
   When the teen and her mother complained to state Attorney
General Juan Manuel Salazar, the state's highest justice official
responded by taking the mother and daughter to a Catholic priest,
who again tried to talk them out of the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar ultimately approved the abortion in October, when it was
almost too late under the law to perform it, but the family once
again ran into a daunting obstacle. This time it was the hospital
director, who warned them that Paulina could suffer a fatal
hemorrhage or end up sterile if she went ahead with the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be the last straw. Fearing for Paulina's safety,
the family backed down, and Paulina prepared herself for the long
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the end of the story. Enraged by the treatment
they had received, Paulina's family presented their situation to
the state's human rights prosecutor, who ruled that the officials
had acted inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor recommended that Baja California Gov. Alejandro
Gonzalez take action against the attorney general and the doctors
at the hospital, and create a fund to help support the child.
</P>
<P>
   But an angry Gonzalez, blaming politics for the uproar, rejected
the prosecutor's report. Instead of establishing a fund, the
government gave the family $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Baja California human rights prosecutor has
turned the case over to the National Human Rights Commission, which
is reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Among those joining the vocal criticism of the state's behavior
are feminist groups, Mexican intellectuals and well-known writers
including Carlos Fuentes, Laura Esquivel and Angeles Mastretta.
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental groups in Baja California have denounced the
''machismo'' attitude of officials from the state's ruling
conservative National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, anti-abortion groups have lauded the outcome
of the controversy. Baja California state Rep. Martin Dominguez
Rocha, of the PAN, is proposing a change to the state's penal code
that would eliminate a raped woman's legal right to an abortion.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Builds in Yugoslavia  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An opposition rally that attracted
tens of thousands has inspired the often-quarreling leaders of
Serbia's pro-democracy movement to believe they are building the
momentum needed to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the harder work is yet to come, despite the surprisingly
large turnout and apparent public support for the opposition.
Milosevic's opponents face the difficult task of forcing the
autocratic president to back down and call early general elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rally was a test of the people's support and we have
passed that test,'' Zoran Djindjic, one of the opposition leaders
said after the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that today's rally will encourage our citizens and
convince them that changes are inevitable,'' added another leader,
Vladan Batic.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition rally Friday in Belgrade's main Republic Square
attracted more than 100,000 people who defied warnings by
Milosevic's cronies to stay away. Some marched in from the
countryside on foot and evaded police checkpoints in a bold attempt
to join forces against Milosevic's grip on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was the largest opposition gathering in Belgrade
since last August and the first since the traditionally squabbling
opposition came together in January to sign a joint declaration
aimed at pushing Milosevic aside.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government showed no willingness to back down,
responding instead with renewed attacks on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The president's influential wife, Mirjana Markovic, accused
opposition leaders of ''treason,'' saying they want to trigger
clashes among Serbs. Serbia's Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic
dismissed any hope of talks, describing the opposition as
''traitors' parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the country's economic and social decline, Milosevic has
ignored opposition demands for early elections, apparently fearing
he could lose them. Instead, the government has stepped up
repression, silencing independent media and cracking down on
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the opposition has failed to come up with an effective
strategy to force Milosevic into concessions. The president has
managed to retain his strong grip on power even after effectively
losing control of the southern province of Kosovo following the
78-day NATO air war against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said the opposition will launch a major campaign,
starting next week, which will include door-to-door canvassing for
the opposition demands.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts fear that Milosevic, who is internationally isolated
because of an indictment for war crimes by the U.N. tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, will not give up power peacefully even if he
eventually loses the federal and municipal elections due by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also standing in the opposition's way are their traditional
rifts, which have ruined many chances of success in the past. At
the rally, Djindjic and his rival Vuk Draskovic shook hands -- a
rare public demonstration of cooperation. The handshake seemed
reluctant, though, signaling that their differences have not been
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milan Milosevic, a columnist from the Vreme independent
weekly who is not related to the president, expressed optimism that
the opposition may be making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gathering is a pledge for the opposition,'' he said.
''Things in Serbia will get clearer day after day. If this is the
beginning, we can say the end will be victorious.''

<HEADLINE> Many Injured in Congo Airport Blast  </HEADLINE>
By KAMANGA MUTOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Distraught relatives milled through the
hallways of a hospital overwhelmed by the dead and injured after
explosions rocked Kinshasa's airport, killing an undetermined
number of people and seriously wounding dozens more.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances raced between the airport and city hospitals,
ferrying those injured in the blasts, which reportedly sent fuel
and ammunition depots up in flames and destroyed several buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Kinshasa General Hospital was swamped by the number of
victims, said staff members who declined to give numbers.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. sources in New York said there were unconfirmed reports
that at least 27 people were injured. State radio said some people
were killed, but did not specify how many.
</P>
<P>
   Family members waited in hospital hallways and clustered around
the emergency room hoping to get news of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions Friday set off a brief panic in Kinshasa, where
people who live near the airport fled their homes for the city
center, fearing that Congolese rebels might have reached the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   State-run radio reported that a series of explosions that
shattered all the windows of the airport terminal were triggered
when a short circuit sparked a fire at an army munitions depot.
</P>
<P>
   The fire spread to a fuel depot, sparking further explosions,
and engulfing two military planes in flames, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Several buildings were set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary explosions persisted for more than two hours as
ammunition blew up, showering the area with shrapnel, state-run
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   An airport official, however, said the fire and explosions were
triggered by a soldier who dropped ammunition while unloading a
plane full of weapons. That explosion set fire to the fuel depot,
from which flames spread to the munitions depot, according to the
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was sealed off by soldiers and police and it was not
possible to independently confirm either account.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst, speaking in New York, said the
explosions involved a Boeing 707, though he did not know any
further details.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazzaville, the capital of neighboring Republic of Congo,
residents gathered along the Congo River to watch flames from the
explosion shooting into the air.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the explosions were related to Congo's
20-month civil war, which the government of President Laurent
Kabila has been fighting against a variety of rebel armies backed
by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war in the country formerly called Zaire erupted a
year after Kabila overthrew the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   A cease-fire was signed July 10 by Kabila and his allies --
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by Rwanda and Uganda, who are
backing the rebels. The main rebel factions signed on in the weeks
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But fighting continues, with the warring sides accusing each
other of violations of cease-fires, the latest of which was reached
on April 8.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Court OK on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The tug-of-war over Elian Gonzalez has turned into
an agonizing wait, with two federal courts considering the boy's
fate and protesters in Little Havana maintaining an uneasy vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The next move is expected to come from the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which issued an injunction Thursday
temporarily blocking the 6-year-old boy from being taken out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The government has asked the court to rescind that decision and
to order Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to end the wrenching
4{-month custody struggle by surrendering the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The government also told Lazaro Gonzalez that he lost legal
custody on Thursday when he defied an order to put the boy on a
plane to Washington for a reunion with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   The government, in court filings, also revealed that Elian's
father has agreed -- if he gets custody -- to stay in the United
States until the appeals court rules on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents filed in response late Friday, the Miami
relatives claimed that Elian would be psychologically harmed if he
were turned over immediately.
</P>
<P>
   They did say they were willing to bring Elian to a meeting with
his father, but only within close driving distance of Miami to
avoid traumatizing him. Attorney General Janet Reno has said the
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would not feel comfortable coming to
south Florida, where Cuban exiles have called him a pawn of Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The father, who came to Washington on April 6 in hopes of
reclaiming his son and bringing him back to Cuba, toured the
National Cathedral on Friday and said he was frustrated with the
repeated delays in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives, who are appealing a federal ruling that
upheld the government's decision to return Elian to his father,
also opened an attack on a new legal front.
</P>
<P>
   They argued in federal court in Washington that Elian should be
barred from leaving the country until the government can certify
that his human rights wouldn't be violated if he returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, ''Elian would face the risk of being persecuted for
having sought asylum in the United States,'' lawyers for Lazaro
Gonzalez said. A judge set a meeting with lawyers for Wednesday to
discuss whether the case will go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction issued Thursday defused an escalating crisis. The
Miami relatives had ignored a government deadline to present him
for a flight to Washington and dared officials to take him by
force. After the injunction, the Justice Department agreed not to
take action to reunite Elian with his father for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Justice Department sharply reminded Lazaro Gonzalez
in a letter Friday that his custody over Elian had expired.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have no legal basis to continue to exercise control over
Elian,'' wrote Michael Pearson, the executive associate
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Lazaro Gonzalez's home in Little Havana, protesters have
repeatedly promised to form a human chain to block federal agents
from seizing Elian.
</P>
<P>
   They jubilantly declared victory after Thursday's deadline came
and went with Elian still in the neighborhood. But by Friday night,
with much of the action in Atlanta and Washington, a sense of
unease rippled through the crowd of about 300.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feds are going to come in here and take the boy,'' said
Oskar Larrauri, 27. ''We all know that's what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the Democracy Movement, tried to
soothe the crowd through a bullhorn. He told the crowd to pray that
God ''uses his hand so that tomorrow when that sun appears in the
sky he makes it so the boy is still in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued by fishermen while clinging to an inner tube
in the ocean on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other people
fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have cared for him since then and have been
fighting in court for an asylum hearing. The Clinton administration
has ordered Elian back to his father, saying only he can speak for
the boy on immigration matters. The Cuban government also wants the
boy returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives contend that if Elian had been granted an
asylum hearing, they would not have had to distribute the widely
criticized home video of Elian telling his father he does not want
to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's disturbing is that Elian should have had the
opportunity to speak in the privacy of an asylum hearing or a
family court hearing,'' attorney Spencer Eig said. ''But he was not
permitted that opportunity by the INS. He was not willing to be
condemned to a future in Cuba in silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez on Friday also released what he termed ''an open
letter to the government,'' asking that no action be taken during
Easter week:
</P>
<P>
   ''In the same way that U.S. planes halted bombing raids over
Baghdad a few years ago during Ramadan, and as fighting ceased in
Kosovo during Holy Week, we ask for time to do what is right for
Elian and our family.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Frank Thomas last played at Comiskey Park, he was the
target of harsh fan criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez started his career in Detroit on the wrong foot,
sitting out the opener at Comerica Park because of a sore
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Both went a long way to winning their fans back Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the key to the Tigers' offseason as they built a team
for their new stadium, hit the first home run in Comerica Park
history as Detroit beat Tampa Bay 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exciting for me. The first home run in Comerica Park and
we win. It's very important,'' Gonzalez said. ''Everyone was
waiting for the first home run in the park. It's special.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's three-run homer in a four-run third against Ryan Rupe
(0-2) was the first in four games at the Tigers' new home. Of the
13 other major league ballparks that opened since 1989, none took
more than three games for its first long ball.
</P>
<P>
   While Gonzalez is trying to impress new fans, Thomas is getting
back into the good graces of Chicago's followers.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a warm reception at Comiskey Park, Thomas responded
with a first-inning homer to extend his season-opening hitting
streak to 11 games as the Chicago White Sox won their home opener,
beating Anaheim 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   ''My last at-bat here last year was not too nice. I got booed
out of the stadium,'' Thomas said of a second straight sub-par year
ended by September ankle surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night when he headed to the first-base line to be
introduced, the fans greeted him with cheers. Just like old times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a big ovation and that kind of surprised me a little. I
thought it would be mixed,'' Thomas said. ''That made me feel
better. I didn't know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   In other American League games, it was Texas 7, Cleveland 2;
Oakland 13, Boston 6; Seattle 11, Toronto 9; the Yankees 7, Kansas
City 5; and Minnesota 10, Baltimore 9.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, bothered by the sore right foot and ankle that required
a cortisone injection earlier this week, reached out and hit a
first-inning pitch from Ken Hill (1-2) nearly 400 feet to
right-center field for his third homer, limping noticeably as he
rounded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   He later added a single to finish 2-for-4. Paul Konerko also
homered and had an RBI double and Ray Durham drove in three runs
for the White Sox, off to their best start since also going 7-4 in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka (2-1) allowed one run in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   At Detroit, Gonzalez provided the key hit for the second
straight game. He returned to the starting lineup Thursday for the
first time since opening day and had an RBI double that led to a
2-0 win over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He added two more doubles Friday, leaving him 5-for-7 with a
homer, three doubles and four RBIs the last two nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan changes the complexion of the lineup,'' teammate Brad
Ausmus said. ''When you put him in the middle of the lineup it
forces managers to think ahead and behind him.''
</P>
<P>
Rangers 7, Indians 2
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling (2-0) shut down Cleveland on four hits in eight
innings, and David Segui, Rafael Palmeiro and Ivan Rodriguez
homered as Texas soured opening day at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel hit a two-run homer for the Indians. Dave Burba
(1-1) took the loss.
</P>
<P>
Yankees 7, Royals 5
</P>
<P>
   At New York, Roger Clemens (1-1) became the first Yankees
starter other than Orlando Hernandez to win. Clemens allowed five
runs, seven hits and four walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada hit a two-run homer in the second, Ricky Ledee put
the Yankees ahead 3-2 with an RBI double in the third and Bernie
Williams chased Jay Witasick (0-3) with a two-run double in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Athletics 13, Red Sox 6
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez hit a grand slam off Brian Rose (0-2) as Oakland
scored six runs in the first inning to hand Boston its first home
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier (2-1) allowed three earned runs and eight hits in
six innings, striking out six to win his second consecutive start.
Frank Menechino and Jason Giambi also homered for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi pulled up lame running out an RBI groundout in the
seventh inning. He has a hyperextended right knee and a hamstring
injury.
</P>
<P>
Mariners 11, Blue Jays 9
</P>
<P>
   At Toronto, Edgar Martinez hit a three-run homer as Seattle
scored six runs in the first inning to knock out David Wells, who
matched the shortest start of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson also hit a three-run homer in the first off Wells
(1-1). Jamie Moyer (2-1) allowed four runs and nine hits in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
Twins 10, Orioles 9
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken moved within three hits of 3,000, but host Minnesota
rallied for six runs in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken went 1-for-4 with a sacrifice fly and Mike Bordick, Jeff
Conine and Delino DeShields homered off Eric Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, however, snapped a five-game losing streak when
Matthew LeCroy and Torii Hunter hit two-run doubles in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Redman (1-0) got the win and Eddie Guardado earned the
save. Buddy Groom (0-1) took loss.

<P>
   Bobby Valentine's mouth made it another difficult day for the
New York Mets. Randy Johnson's pitching made it another tough night
for the Giants at Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson kept up his early season excellence, striking out 11
Friday night as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat San Francisco 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have lost six in a row for the first time since
September 1996. They fell to 0-4 at their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel like we're in a slump,'' Giants manager Dusty
Baker said. ''Our time is going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, spent the day dealing with a controversy
again caused by Valentine's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the manager called five of his players ''losers.''
This week, in a talk to Philadelphia business school students,
Valentine reportedly questioned some personnel decisions made by
general manager Steve Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets then went out and won at Pittsburgh 8-5 in 12 innings.
Mike Piazza homered twice and doubled in his first career five-hit
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just have to realize people say things or do things they
wish they could take back,'' Piazza said. ''Nobody's perfect. It
happens. You just have to be prepared to do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   In other National League games, Los Angeles beat Cincinnati 8-1,
Montreal topped Philadelphia 4-0, Houston defeated San Diego 10-4,
Colorado stopped St. Louis 6-2, Atlanta beat Milwaukee 6-3 and
Florida downed Chicago 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller lined a two-out, two-run double in the ninth
inning to lift Arizona over the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (3-0) allowed five hits and walked none in his second
complete game. The NL Cy Young winner has struck out 34 in 26 2-3
innings this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't rate my starts, I just pitch to win ballgames,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez held down the Diamondbacks until the ninth. A
pair of singles set up Miller's hit.
</P>
<P>
Mets 8, Pirates 5, 12 innings
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora hit a two-run single in the 12th inning and Piazza
added a two-run homer to lead New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets spent most of the day dealing with Valentine's remarks.
A few days ago, he wondered why the Mets traded pitcher Masato
Yoshii, claimed he could not bench Derek Bell because he makes too
much money and said he tries to ignore unhappy outfielder Rickey
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips traveled to Pittsburgh to meet with Valentine and said
he was ''surprised and curious'' about the comments.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who has a prickly relationship with Valentine, said
the manager's job was not in jeopardy. Asked whether he thought the
controversy would go away in a day or two, Valentine said: ''Why
would I? I think it should, though.''
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 8, Reds 1
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser made a triumphant return to Dodger Stadium,
beating Cincinnati in Los Angeles' home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Back with the Dodgers after a five-year absence, the 1988 World
Series MVP pitched six neat innings. The 41-year-old righty left
with a 2-1 lead, and Los Angeles went on to win its fifth straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield had three hits, including a home run for the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
Astros 10, Padres 4
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit a grand slam and pitcher Shane Reynolds homered
as Houston won at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's slam came during a six-run sixth inning as the Astros
broke away from a 3-3 tie. The homer came against Kevin Walker, who
made his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
Rockies 6, Cardinals 2
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo, Scott Servais and Mike Lansing hit home runs off
Rick Ankiel, leading Colorado over St. Louis at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire did not play for the Cardinals. He was examined for
lingering back pain by team physician Dr. George Paletta, and no
new disc injury was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire will rest and receive treatment in St. Louis. He will be
re-evaluated Monday to determine his status.
</P>
<P>
Expos 4, Phillies 0
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson pitched his second career shutout and Vladimir
Guerrero hit his fifth home run as Montreal won at Veterans
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson (1-1) gave up six hits in his first shutout since July
15, 1997, against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Chris Brock struck out a career-high 11 in seven
innings, but gave up solo home runs to Guerrero, Mike Mordecai and
Rondell White.
</P>
<P>
Braves 6, Brewers 3
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta ended a three-game losing streak, beating Milwaukee
behind Tom Glavine at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (2-0) pitched into the ninth inning, striking out seven.
Javy Lopez homered for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
Marlins 9, Cubs 4
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista hit a three-run homer and Alex Gonzalez had a
two-run drive to lift Florida over Chicago at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa homered for Cubs, who were coming off a three-game
sweep of Atlanta.

Tug-of-War Over Elian Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The tug-of-war over Elian Gonzalez has turned into an
agonizing wait, with two federal courts considering the boy's fate and
protesters in Little Havana maintaining an uneasy vigil. The next move is
expected to come from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which
issued an injunction Thursday temporarily blocking the 6-year-old boy from being
taken out of the country. The government has asked the court to rescind that
decision and to order Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to end the wrenching 4
1/2-month custody struggle by surrendering the boy.

Investors Ponder Terrible week
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors have the weekend to lick their wounds and rethink
their trading strategy after one of Wall Street's worst weeks ever ended in a
selling stampede. Stocks lost almost $2 trillion in value this week, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index falling an unprecedented 25 percent.
"It's killing me. It's been a bad week," said Joe Ayala, a lawyer in Sacramento,
Calif. But he wasn't prepared to bail out when markets resume trading Monday. He
spoke Friday as the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted a record 617.78
points, or 5.7 percent, to close at 10,305.77. Its weekly drop of more than 805
points also was a record. The Nasdaq dropped a record 355.49 points.

Opposition Builds in Yugoslavia

<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An opposition rally that attracted tens of
thousands has inspired the often-quarreling leaders of Serbia's pro-democracy
movement to believe they are building the momentum needed to oust Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. Still, the harder work is yet to come, despite the
surprisingly large turnout and apparent public support for the opposition.
Milosevic's opponents face the difficult task of forcing the autocratic
president to back down and call early general elections. The opposition rally
Friday in Belgrade's main Republic Square attracted more than 100,000 people who
defied warnings by Milosevic's cronies to stay away.

START II May Spark Weapons Cuts

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and Russian negotiators are to meet next week in
Geneva to consider more cuts in long-range nuclear arms now that the Duma has
approved the START II treaty. That treaty, dating from 1993, trims 5,000
warheads from U.S. and Russian arsenals. A follow-up pact could lop off another
1,000 to 1,500. At the same time, the Clinton administration wants to convince
Russia that both countries need anti-missile defenses.

Cassini Spacecraft Survives Asteroids

Saturn. The region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter has lots of rocky
debris, but no one expected any trouble for the $3.3 billion mission, said Bob
Mitchell, Cassini's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "I'm
glad we passed through it, but it's pretty routine," he said Friday. "There's a

Clinton Hits GOP on Education, Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republicans Friday of
shortchanging schools to pay for huge tax cuts and said Americans should look at
the GOP's budget and ask, "How does all this add up?" "I think it's wrong to
spend about $100 of the surplus on tax cuts for every $1 you spend on
education," Clinton told reporters, university spokesmen and others at a
gathering of the Education Writers Association. The House and Senate approved a
$1.83 trillion package yesterday that includes big tax cuts as well as

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With 5 Strangulations  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Police say John E. Armstrong's mood changed
frequently as he told them about killing woman after woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''His demeanor was shifting quite often from being calm to
irritable to sometimes sad,'' Wayne County sheriff's Detective
James Hines said. ''Once he began to talk, he was freely giving
very intimate details about the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Navy sailor fought back tears Friday as he was
arraigned on charges of killing five prostitutes by strangling
them. Police around the world, meanwhile, are trying to match
Armstrong's account of at least 11 other slayings to unsolved
murders in their cities. The first slaying was believed to date to
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Armstrong told them the reason he killed was because
he hated prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 26, of Dearborn Heights, was arraigned on five counts
of premeditated first-degree murder and three counts of assault
with intent to murder. The charges address crimes in the Detroit
area in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   As police whisked Armstrong into the Dearborn Heights
courthouse, reporters shouted questions at him, asking him how he
felt.
</P>
<P>
   ''So bad,'' he whispered in reply.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had anything to say, he replied: ''Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Innocent pleas were entered on his behalf. He is being held
without bond at the Wayne County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Armstrong is suspected in at least 11 other slayings
since 1992: three in the Seattle area, including the lone male
victim, two in Hawaii, two in Hong Kong and one each in North
Carolina, Virginia, Thailand and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who from 1993 to 1999 was a Navy refueler aboard the
USS Nimitz, may have killed while the ship was in port around the
world, police have said.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators warned that Armstrong, a husband and father,
may be exaggerating. Though local police say they have physical
evidence linking him to the deaths of five Detroit-area
prostitutes, agencies elsewhere said they have been unable to tie
him to any unsolved slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are gaps in his timeline that we are concerned about,''
Detroit police Cmdr. Dennis Richardson told the Detroit Free Press.
''However, nothing outside of Michigan has been confirmed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Armstrong spent eight years as a crewman aboard the
USS Nimitz, going from port to port strangling women. He may also
be linked to the deaths of several prostitutes in Japan, Korea and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong moved eight months ago to Dearborn Heights and has
worked for the past month at Detroit Metropolitan Airport as an
aircraft refueler.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit police Detective Don Johnson said Armstrong has agreed
to talk to investigators -- without a lawyer -- ever since his
arrest. Police have interrupted the interviews to give him time to
eat and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''His statement to me was 'Help me. I need help,''' Johnson
said. ''It's been bothering him for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a prostitute told police she had been assaulted and
gave a description of the suspect and his vehicle. On Monday,
investigators found the bodies of three strangled prostitutes in a
railroad yard.

<HEADLINE> Marine Corps Says it Had FAA OK  </HEADLINE>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- In a statement that conflicts with FAA
findings, the military said it had approval to fly aircraft without
lights during a nighttime exercise that ended with the deaths of 19
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that a lack of lights contributed to last
Saturday's crash of an MV-22 Osprey in Marana, about 30 miles
northwest of Tucson. Investigators have not determined a cause.
</P>
<P>
   During the exercise, two Ospreys, tiltrotor aircraft that can
take off and land like a helicopter and fly like an airplane, flew
over the Marana Northwest Regional Airport while two others flew
several miles away.
</P>
<P>
   As the two aircraft at the airport began descending vertically
like helicopters, one nosed 200 feet to the ground and exploded.
Officials said the aircraft had their lights off and that the
pilots used night vision goggles during the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Barker, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in
Seattle, said the western regional office had not received the
required waiver request from the Marine Corps concerning last
weekend's exercise.
</P>
<P>
   However, Maj. David C. Andersen, a Marine spokesman at the
Pentagon, said the lights-out flight was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Marine Corps aircraft did have an FAA waiver to fly with
night vision devices and did have their lights off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regulations -- such as requiring the use of lights on night
flights -- normally take precedence over a civilian airport such as
the one at Marana, unless there has been a waiver request for
special use of the air space.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps Air Station at Yuma, where the exercise
originated, also issued a series of notices through the FAA to
alert agencies and pilots around Phoenix and Tucson that the Marine
Corps would be conducting large-scale air operations, Andersen
said.
</P>

   A notice covering all aspects of the mission -- including lights
and use of night vision goggles -- was issued on March 25, Anderson
said.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Union Calls for Exams  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA M. LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A national push to raise the standards for
training and hiring teachers is doomed to fail unless it is
accompanied by better pay and working conditions, some education
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Friday by the American Federation of Teachers,
calls for stricter requirements for would-be teachers -- including
standardized tests, higher grades, better grounding in basic
subjects and more student-teaching experience before licensing.
</P>
<P>
   The group is the nation's second-largest teachers union,
representing nearly 1 million educators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teachers are still paid less than professions that require
comparable education and skills,'' said Bob Chase, president of the
National Education Association. ''Until this fact is addressed, all
attempts to improve the quality of teachers will ring hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Johnson, president of the 300,000-member California
Teachers Association, said a widespread teacher shortage makes
raising standards ''an exercise in futility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you had people lining up to be teachers, that would be
fine. But we are not attracting enough new people into the field,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said a ''schizophrenic system'' of raising standards
while the number of teachers dwindles has resulted in California
issuing 50,000 emergency teaching credentials in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   AFT president Sandra Feldman said about 220,000 teachers will
have to be replaced each year over the next decade. She said
improvements the report suggests should be made now.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we enhance teacher education programs and raise
requirements for new teachers now, we will be able to make dramatic
improvements in the effectiveness of teachers and in student
performance for years to come,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, presented at the annual meeting of the Education
Writers Association in Atlanta, recommends rigorous national exams
for those entering teacher education programs as well as those
seeking licenses to teach.
</P>
<P>
   The NEA, which represents 2.5 million elementary and secondary
teachers, said national tests could delay efforts to enforce higher
standards already in place in most states.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we need to have is all states implementing these tests
and to set the bar high for passing them,'' Chase said. ''The
development of a new test may delay this progress.''
</P>
<P>
   A staff member on the committee that issued the report, Joan
Earatz-Snowden, said state tests are inadequate and that some
national measuring stick is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Applicants to law school have to take the LSAT, and medical
school students take the MCAT,'' she said. ''All you have to do to
get into some teaching programs is survive two years of college.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a national test received the greatest attention. But
Earatz-Snowden said the report's other recommendations -- such as
requiring a subject major in addition to education coursework, a
one-year internship teaching in a classroom and higher grade point
averages -- may be more important.
</P>
<P>
   Most teacher education programs now require only a 2.5 grade
point average -- a C-plus, according to the report. The report
suggests raising that requirement first to 2.75 and eventually to
3.0.

<HEADLINE> CBS' 'Early Show' Hits Ratings Low  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There is more bad news for CBS's ''Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after getting a bad first quarter ratings report and a
spate of embarrassing publicity to go with it, the morning news
show sank to its lowest viewership levels yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Early Show'' with Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson had an
average of 2.2 million viewers last week, its smallest audience
since debuting in November.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spent a reported $30 million to build a new studio that
looks out over Central Park, enticed former ''Today'' show host
Gumbel back to morning television and revamped its old morning news
show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet viewership last week was 22 percent lower than the audience
the show it replaced had a year ago, according to Nielsen Media
Research.
</P>
<P>
   The three network morning shows all had a smaller audience last
week than during the first three months of the year, since
viewership tends to drop in the spring and summer months. But both
NBC's ''Today'' show and ABC's ''Good Morning America'' are running
ahead of last year's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The frontrunning ''Today'' had 5.9 million viewers last week, a
6 percent increase over 1999, and the surging ''Good Morning
America'' had 4.6 million, up 20 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite published reports that some CBS affiliates are getting
anxious about the poor performance of ''The Early Show,'' a CBS
spokeswoman said Friday that no major changes were planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feeling at CBS News is the broadcast is journalistically
strong,'' spokeswoman Sandra Genelius said. ''Bryant and Jane are
developing a nice chemistry. We knew from the start that this
broadcast would take time to see a significant uptick in the
ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first three months of 2000, ratings for ''The Early
Show'' were 14 percent below its predecessor the year before, and
below what the network promised its advertisers would be delivered.
That means CBS had to give money back to advertisers or compensate
them with free commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel has also been buffeted with bad publicity, particularly
in the New York area, stemming from a nasty divorce case.

<HEADLINE> Whistlers Meet in N.C. Convention  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISBURG, N.C. (AP) -- At the 27th annual International
Whistlers Convention, just pucker your lips and blow. Actually, you
don't even have to blow.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some whistlers who whistle entirely by whistling in.
No air goes out,'' said Allen deHart, the convention founder and
assistant to the president at Louisburg College, where competition
began Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Whistle a happy tune, whistle the blues, whistle a passage from
Beethoven -- it doesn't matter what. There is competition in adult,
teen, child and ''allied arts'' divisions, the last for people who
whistle with their fingers or practice ventriloquism.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgour Shives, 84, of Vancouver, Canada, attending for the
seventh time, prefers to whistle a capella rather than with a taped
musical accompaniment as he must do at the competition, but likes
the challenge anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get enjoyment when people hear me whistle,'' Shives said. He
planned to compete with opera accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiharu Takamoku came from Osaka, Japan, to compete. He spoke
little English but whistled clearly and handed out laminated cards
announcing the Japan Whistlers Association.
</P>
<P>
   One judge, Barry Rector of Vancouver, said whistling isn't as
popular a commercial art as it was 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whistlers that had a talent were hired by the rich and famous
to come whistle in their parlors,'' Rector said during a break in a
whistling class, where 20 or so students brushed up on their
vibrato and were counseled to keep a glass of water and lip balm
handy.
</P>
<P>
   The contest began in 1974 when the local arts festival held a
singing competition and Darrell Williams of Durham asked to whistle
his selection. He was the first whistling competition winner. He
returned the next year, bringing five or six other whistlers with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Once there were hundreds of contestants, but this year there
will be between 60 and 100 finalists; serious whistlers submitted
tapes in advance and some were eliminated. Still, if people show up
wanting to whistle, they can.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to have more whistlers because our standards were
lower,'' deHart said. ''We now have more professional whistlers,
but we never turn anybody down even though we have had some very
poor whistlers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The professional whistlers are egotistical and jealous, and
they say, 'Why do you let these whistlers in?' We say because art
should be free.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Who Faked Cancer Avoids Jail  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Two years ago, after Charlene Zimmerman
told her husband and three children she was dying of cancer, people
all over Des Moines rushed to help.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, neighbors and strangers brought food for Thanksgiving
and toys for Christmas. More help came in January when the family's
house burned down. Schoolchildren collected about $1,000 and
donated clothing and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmerman, 34, didn't have cancer. She had shaved her head
to mimic the effects of chemotherapy, and the scars she displayed
weren't from biopsies -- they were self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   The lies led to a police investigation and a charge of felony
theft for taking more than $10,000 from charities and well-wishers.
On Thursday, Zimmerman entered a so-called Alford plea to a reduced
theft charge, admitting no guilt but conceding that prosecutors had
enough evidence to convict her, said her attorney, Peter Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman was ordered to pay $1,400 in restitution and was given
a deferred sentence. She will serve no jail time if she completes
two years' probation, and her record will be expunged of the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to Charlene was the result of psychological
problems,'' Berger said. ''She truly believed she had cancer and
didn't intend to profit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman had told neighbors in suburban Waukee, population
5,000, that she wouldn't live past a certain date. She didn't die,
her story changed and people grew suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman must write a letter of apology to be published in a
Dallas County newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, her attorney said, suffered ''multiple traumatic
events in her childhood'' and has been ''in treatment off and on
again for a long time.'' He refused to elaborate but said he and
his client had agreed to an in-depth discussion on the ABC program
''20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've heard of no hard feelings,'' said Waukee Mayor Donald
Bailey. ''It's just one of those things. If this had to happen to
get that family back on track, and Charlene personally, I'm happy
for them.''

<HEADLINE> Seventh NYC Cabbie Slain This Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A livery cab driver was shot to death early
Saturday morning, following the slaying of another driver a day
earlier. The killings, seven so far this year and 11 last year,
prompted Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to create a $5 million grant
program to help the drivers install partitions or cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has created a task force to investigate
the homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the earlier cases appeared to have been motivated by
robbery, but the driver killed Friday, Luis Francisco Perez, had
cash on him after he was killed. An arrest has been made in only
one of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The city requires partitions on all yellow cabs and livery cars
operated by more than one driver, but individual drivers who own
their cars say the partitions are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Since partitions were installed in yellow cabs, murders of those
drivers have been rare, Giuliani said. The last yellow cab driver
killed on the job occurred in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 41,000 livery cab drivers in the New York
area who work where yellow cabs rarely go. Only yellow cab drivers
are allowed to pick up street fares -- livery drivers are dispatched
to pick up fares -- but to make more money, many livery drivers also
pick up street fares.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Protect Calif. Sequoias  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton is making the
nation's last stands of ancient sequoia trees permanently
off-limits to loggers, angering some California businesses and
outdoor enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was traveling by helicopter today to the Trail of 100
Giants, a remote spot high in the Sierra Nevada, to walk among
soaring trees 2 millennia old.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to declare a new national monument to protect the
sequoia that will end logging, mining and some recreational
activities on about 327,000 acres in central California.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a measure which is designed to protect the groves, not
to close off the forest,'' said George Frampton, acting White House
environmental adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Sequoia, the largest trees on the planet, live more than 3,000
years. They can grow to more than 300 feet tall and span 30 feet at
the base. They once thrived across western North America but remain
in only about 70 groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to protect 34 groves under the 1906
Antiquities Act. Clinton has used the Antiquities Act on several
occasions to carve out major areas of land for special protection
without going to Congress. On each occasion he has met strong
criticism from Western lawmakers and state officials. White House
officials have acknowledged the actions are part of an attempt by
the president to leave an environmental legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of the central California foothills say the
president's move is yet another federal land grab. Others worry
that business and recreation will be squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we really need this,'' said Brian Clausen, a
Porterville, Calif., convenience store clerk. ''I think the
president is just trying to leave a legacy so people do not think
so much about the sex scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration will bring the amount of land set aside by
Clinton in the Lower 48 states to 3.1 million acres -- more than any
president including Theodore Roosevelt, who created the national
park system.
</P>
<P>
   About half of America's remaining sequoia groves are already
protected because they lie within the Sequoia, Kings Canyon and
Yosemite National Parks. Clinton's declaration applies to the rest,
with the exception of a single grove that remains in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also announce plans to ask Congress for several
million dollars to buy that tract, Frampton said.
</P>
<P>
   The trees protected within the Giant Sequoia National Monument
are already in national forests and already are temporarily
protected from logging.
</P>
<P>
   The monument designation makes protection permanent and creates
a buffer zone around the trees where commercial logging of other
species would be banned along with some forms of recreation and
development, Frampton said.
</P>
<P>
   No roads would be closed, and the area will remain open to
hikers, sightseers and for grazing and other agricultural uses,
Frampton said. But all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles will be
restricted to regular roads, and snowmobiles also will be
restricted to well-traveled areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some local opposition to further protection for the sequoia has
centered on such recreation as well as on logging, which has been
on the decline in the forest for years.
</P>
<P>
   The region once produced up to 90 million board feet of timber
annually, but in recent years the take of pine, fir and other
species has been more like 9 million board feet, Frampton said. He
estimated up to 150 jobs could be threatened by the president's
action, mostly at a sawmill that depends largely on timber from the
forest around the sequoia.
</P>
<P>
   Existing contracts for about 30 million board feet will go
forward, meaning that commercial logging will continue for about
three years, Frampton said.

<HEADLINE> N. Jersey Gov. Defends GOP Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the tax deadline looming, New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman said today that Americans shouldn't have to pay so
much and deserve freedom from the so-called ''marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Keeping more of your earnings boils down to freedom -- freedom
to make choices about what's important to you -- whether it's
college tuition for your child, a new home for your family or
saving for your own retirement,'' Whitman said in the weekly
Republican radio address.
</P>
<P>
   She criticized the Clinton administration and Democrats for
hindering GOP plans to end the marriage penalty that causes 25
million married couples to pay higher taxes than if they were
single.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats blocked Republican legislation Thursday that
would cut taxes by $248 billion over 10 years for millions of
married couples. While eliminating the marriage penalty has broad
support in both parties, Democrats and Republicans disagree on how
to do it and how much of the projected budget surplus it should
consume.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman praised the tax cutting efforts of Republican governors
including Michigan's John Engler and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that during her time as governor, New Jersey cut
taxes 37 times, helping to create 400,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Blast Shuts Down Montreal Subway  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- An explosion apparently sparked by an electrical
problem shut down Montreal's subway system Saturday morning, a
transit official said. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blast and a subsequent fire knocked out the subway
communication system, and yellow smoke that billowed out of two
manholes caused authorities to evacuate about 100 people from their
homes in case the smoke was toxic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're fortunate that this happened on a Saturday morning,''
when traffic was light, said transit spokeswoman Odile Paradis.
</P>
<P>
   She said no train passengers were injured in the explosion at
7:45 a.m. at the Laurier subway station in central Montreal. Scores
of buses were deployed throughout the city to transport people
waiting for trains.
</P>
<P>
   Paradis said she expected the subway system to be operating as
usual by Monday.

<HEADLINE> Majority Want To Revamp Japan Laws  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A record 60 percent of Japanese support the
long-taboo idea of revising the nation's U.S.-written constitution,
according to a newspaper poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Yomiuri's survey of 1,935 citizens nationwide broke
the record of 53 percent set last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the annual survey began in 1981, more
than half of the respondents from each of six age groups -- 20s to
70s -- favored revising the 1947 document written by the U.S.
occupation force after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven percent of those surveyed opposed revising the
constitution, the first time that figure has fallen below 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper conducted the poll on March 18 and 19. It did not
give a margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   In February, lawmakers began discussing whether to rewrite the
constitution after years of public debate focusing on the so-called
''peace clause'' -- Article 9 -- which declares that Japan will never
maintain ''land, sea and air forces as well as other war
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Its military is known as the Self-Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, even questioning the need for that clause was
attacked as a dangerous revival of the Japanese militarism of the
early part of the 20th century, aggression which ended with
America's nuclear bombing of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
and the humiliation of defeat to the Western allies.
</P>
<P>
   And talk of change still rankles with Asian countries invaded
and colonized by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But with Japan's expansionist past an increasingly remote
memory, many are calling for changes that would allow Japan to take
over greater responsibility for its own defense from the United
States, and play a more active role internationally.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Denounce Amnesty Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- The Saudi interior minister
challenged Amnesty International to provide evidence of its claims
on rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, describing them as ''nonsense,''
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We say to anyone who claims something, to provide evidence. We
welcome anyone to see for himself the facts in the kingdom as it
has nothing to conceal,'' the Riyadh Daily quoted Prince Nayef as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Nayef, the interior minister, was referring to a report by the
human rights group earlier this month that said it had documented
patterns of systematic human rights violations in Saudi Arabia. The
allegations included torture of detainees in many Saudi police
stations and prisons, and the conviction of defendants in secret
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has been mentioned in this context is merely nonsense.
They should submit the truthful evidence of their claim,'' Nayef
was quoted as saying by Riyadh daily and other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International has asked Saudi Arabia to allow it to send
a delegation there for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia announced earlier this month that it was setting up
agencies to raise awareness and protect human rights, but said the
move had nothing to do with external pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative kingdom, where women are not allowed to drive
and must be covered head-to-toe in public, follows a strict
interpretation of Islamic law. Courts routinely order hands
amputated for theft, and public execution for murder, rape, sodomy
and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations have criticized those penalties, and
say defendants do not receive fair trials and often do not have
access to lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Plans Fall Off Track  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- After taking office last July, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak confidently set out to revive talks with Syria
and the Palestinians and promised peace accords by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, the talks with Syria have collapsed, and its
leaders speak darkly of war. On the Palestinian track, President
Clinton suggested this week that he may dictate terms to salvage
the floundering negotiations -- something Barak swore would never
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Barak looks increasingly like history's victim instead of its
master, and even his supporters are wondering whether he will be
able to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''His nine months in office have passed,'' columnist Yoel Marcus
wrote on Friday in the pro-peace process Haaretz daily, referring
to a Barak timeframe for tangible results. ''Barak must understand
that from now on, he will be judged by his deeds, not his words.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Syria seemed to be the most promising track. Syrian
President Hafez Assad made clear his price for peace: the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast
war.
</P>
<P>
   Barak reversed the territorialist policies of his hard-line
predecessor and strongly hinted he was willing to concede the
heights. The land-for-peace formula appeared to be more clear-cut
than the complexities posed by the Israeli-Palestinian problem,
which requires delicate solutions for two peoples who live among
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's preference for the Syrian track led to a summit in
Washington in December with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa, and a second round of lower-level negotiations. Yet
within weeks, the talks collapsed: Barak refused to meet a Syrian
demand for a prior commitment to withdraw from all the heights.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who said he wanted to know what the dividend would be
before making a commitment, was also not prepared to return a small
patch of land on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Syria had gained
the land in raids in the early 1950s, and Barak regards it as
Israeli soil.
</P>
<P>
   Assad maintained his tough line at a Geneva summit with Clinton
last month. That put the Americans on Israel's side -- Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said afterward that the ''ball was in
Syria's court.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Barak did not emerge unscathed. The hard-line
opposition is already mocking the prime minister for misreading
Assad. Barak wanted a meeting with the Syrian leader, but ''Assad
never called, he never even faxed,'' Hagai Segal, a peace process
critic, wrote in Maariv.
</P>
<P>
   In chats with reporters during his Washington trip this week,
Barak and his aides made an admission that once would have been
highly unlikely for the supremely confident ex-army chief-of-staff:
Assad baffled them. Asked about the Geneva fiasco, Danny Yatom,
Barak's top policy adviser, sighed and said, ''No one knows what
went on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is still planning a July troop withdrawal from south
Lebanon, where Israel has occupied a buffer zone since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister committed himself to the pullout during his
election. He had hoped to do it through an agreement with Syria,
the main power in Lebanon, but the collapse of the talks means that
the withdrawal will be unilateral. That raises the specter of
cross-border raids on Israeli civilians by the Islamic militants in
nearby Lebanon who have targeted Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian leaders -- unhappy that an Israeli pullout would deprive
them of leverage in their efforts to secure the Golan -- have spoken
ominously of war after a withdrawal. Hezbollah guerrillas stepped
up their attacks on Israeli troops within days of the Syrian talks
collapsing in January.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Palestinians. Barak now says he will devote his
considerable energies to the negotiations, but Palestinians are
smarting from months of neglect -- Barak suspended an important
interim troop withdrawal in January to focus on Syria -- and are
unconvinced. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's chief negotiator,
Yasser Abed Rabbo, said last week that he believes Barak will jump
as soon as Assad beckons.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Barak acknowledges the Palestinians are Israel's more
natural peace partners, and he speaks expansively of Arafat.
Publicly -- apparently believing the Israeli public is not ready to
embrace a leader once vilified as a terrorist -- he is not as
generous.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in recent months, Barak backed down from handing the
Palestinians land near Jerusalem. Weak from intimations of a
campaign finance scandal and in charge of an unwieldy coalition
that includes nationalist hawks, Barak has scaled down his
ambitious plans for a full-fledged peace with the Palestinians by
September. He now talks of a partial deal.
</P>
<P>
   That infuriates Palestinians, who want to declare a state that
includes almost all of the West Bank and part of Jerusalem by the
end of the year. Arafat, who this week described Barak's proposals
of limited Palestinian autonomy and control of about 60 percent of
the West Bank as ''extremist,'' has called repeatedly for Clinton's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Clinton stepped in and got Barak to accede to a U.S.
presence at the talks, something Barak hoped to avoid. More
astonishingly, Barak agreed to allow Americans to present their own
solutions if the sides fail to make progress by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sobering comedown. On Friday night, a satirical
television show depicted a Clinton puppet as a furious soccer team
owner firing his constantly losing coach, a Barak puppet. ''The
Syrians are ahead 14-0!'' the team owner yelled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barak is now discovering what his predecessors discovered:
there are other players in the field,'' Nahum Barnea wrote in the
Yediot Ahronot daily. ''They have their desires, interests and
political needs that are stronger than his good intentions.''

<HEADLINE> School budgets go before NJ voters on Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Ninety-six New Jersey school districts will
ask special voter approval on Tuesday to spend $28 million more
than they would otherwise be allowed under state-imposed budget
caps.
</P>
<P>
   That's in addition to $7.5 billion in basic local spending that
voters will be asked to approve.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 96 so-called ''second questions'' ask for extra
money for building repairs and staff, said Frank Belluscio,
spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''These aren't frivolous expenditures,'' said Belluscio. ''These
districts are retaining staff or, in some cases, going for
additional staff because they're expanding programming.''
</P>
<P>
   State law requires special voter approval for any spending
increase that exceeds a state-imposed limit of 3 percent or the
consumer price index, whichever is higher. The second questions
must specify exactly how the additional money will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four districts will ask for extra funds to pay for
building renovations, including heating systems, roofs and security
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The second most frequent request is for more staff, with 41
districts asking voters to exceed the cap to pay for teachers,
librarians, security officers and counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Next is technology, with additional funds being requested by 24
districts. Transportation costs are included in 12 questions, while
elementary school foreign language instruction show up in seven,
according to a school boards association analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The annual school elections usually attract few voters, even
though schools cost more than any other service funded by property
taxes. Typically, less than 20 percent of registered voters show
up. Last year's turnout was 13.4 percent -- the lowest since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also choose school board members in the annual spring
elections. A total of 2,217 candidates will vie for 1,637 seats on
Tuesday, Belluscio said.
</P>
<P>
   Belluscio said school officials are generally optimistic about
getting their budgets approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to see another good year,'' he said. ''The
one factor that seems to really have an impact is how well the
economy's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, voters approved 82.8 percent of school budgets -- the
second highest pass rate since the state Department of Education
began keeping track in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Voters last year also approved 72.8 percent of the separate
ballot questions, a big jump over 1998's 56.7 pass rate.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynne Strickland, director of the Garden State Coalition of
Schools, which represents about 100 suburban districts around the
state, said some school boards are worried.
</P>
<P>
   She said increasing special education and building costs are
forcing many districts to ask for significant budget increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall budget increases are 7, 9, 11 percent,''
Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   In Madison, Morris County, the budget proposal contains a 7.6
percent increase -- most of that due to enrollments that continue to
climb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am worried,'' said Larry Feinsod, the district's
superintendent. ''It's tough to ask people to dig deeper in their
pockets, and the school budget is the only public budget that's
voted on. That adds more to the concern that some people will take
out their frustrations during that vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Township's proposed budget asks for a 13.5 percent
increase, which includes 40 new teachers. The district is growing
by about 400 students per year, said Jamie Savedoff,
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The Somerset County community's voters have been passing the
growing budgets, and Savedoff hopes they'll be behind it again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year was probably our best support. The budget passed
with 69 percent of the vote. I'm not hearing too much controversy.
The community's pretty quiet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If voters reject a district's base budget, the municipal
governing body reviews it and decides whether to make cuts. In
certain cases those cuts can be appealed to the state education
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   In the districts where voters reject a special question, the
municipal governing body will review the question and decide
whether to approve any or all of the proposed spending. The
governing body's decision is final.
</P>
<P>
   Polling times vary by school district, but all are required to
be open between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Voters should call local school
district offices for polling times and locations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World's largest dump to close -- but what then?With AP Photos NYR109-111 April 12  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A pair of sparrow hawks hovers overhead,
searching the wild rose bushes and crab apple trees for small prey.
Nearby a songbird remains hidden in a fledgling hackberry tree,
softly chirping a spring song.
</P>
<P>
   But now come ruder noises -- grrrrrrr, brummmmm, whirrrr,
vrooommmm and an insistent beep, beep, beep. The serene Wild
Kingdom moment vanishes as a garbage truck backs up and dumps yet
another load of rotting garbage onto an already behemoth mound.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world's largest garbage dump: the 3,000-acre
Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. It's three times the size of
Central Park and at its highest point, about as tall as a 20-story
building.
</P>
<P>
   But now -- though many remain skeptical -- the quadruple towering
mounds of trash may stop growing. A closing date of Dec. 31, 2001
was set long ago for the dump, and some politicians say it could be
shut before summer of that year since plans for exporting the last
5,100 tons of daily city trash are ahead of schedule. Three of the
four once-active dumping sites have already been closed.
</P>
<P>
   City planners have formed a commission to determine Fresh Kills'
future and after 52 long and smelly years, local politicians are
conjuring up closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Once the last mound is covered, the question remains: Will the
memory of the dump, and its pervasive stench, ever fade?
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a thicket of wild rose bushes where Rutgers
University professor Steven Handel has worked since 1993, it isn't
hard to believe that something so ugly could be transformed from
trash to treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The potential for ecological restoration is enormous,'' says
Handel, who was hired by the city Sanitation Department and is
working with a grant from the National Science Foundation
introducing native plants to the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   On a small patch of land where Handel has planted 70 different
species, delicate white flowers are about to bloom on a small but
sturdy crabapple tree. Red-tail hawks, egrets and herons already
call the landfill home after migrating a short distance from a
nearby wildlife refuge, which is part of the island's protected
Greenbelt forest and wetlands area.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around, Handel doesn't see garbage. He sees hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to look ahead and have vision,'' he said, pointing
to seed traps that prove birds are bringing native plants back to
the area, and to a fistful of sticks duct-taped to a fledgling tree
used to attract wild bees.
</P>
<P>
   If city planners get their way, one day in the distant future --
anywhere from 10 to 50 years -- the area will be filled with natural
forests, wildflower meadows, baseball and soccer fields, hiking and
jogging trails, and even a marina.
</P>
<P>
   There are disagreements over how real -- and inviting -- this
future will be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care what they put there. You won't find me there,''
said Staten Islander Madelyn Anastasakos, who is relieved the dump
is closing but can't imagine picnicking atop millions of tons of
trash.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanitation experts note that the future beauty of Fresh
Kills -- whose name comes from the Dutch word for water -- can
already be imagined from some 1,000 acres of the area that were
left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are sections near the upper reaches of the Kill Van Kull
that have never even seen a garbage truck,'' said Brendan Sexton, a
former deputy mayor and sanitation commissioner who is on the
city's landfill closure commission.
</P>
<P>
   Handel agreed, referring to some areas as ''virtually
pristine,'' and noting the estuaries that run through the dump are
in good shape and birds are already there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the ecological fabric is already present,'' he said.
''Our challenge is to maximize it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a history in taking something so ugly and turning
it into something lovely and green, said Sexton, who knows the dump
intimately, both as a former sanitation commissioner and a Staten
Islander.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote about a ''stinking
mass of burning, rotting trash and the fires of hell he had to pass
on his way back to Long Island from the city.'' That spot is now
Flushing Meadows Park, the site of two World Fairs and the giant
metal Unisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grew up in Flushing Meadows, and no one in my neighborhood
ever thought of it as a dump,'' Sexton said, predicting that
memories of Fresh Kills as a dump also will fade.
</P>
<P>
   Other city parks, including Pelham Bay and Orchard Beach in the
Bronx, were landfills before their current incarnation. Centennial
Park in Liverpool, England, is another landfill conversion success.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer size, Sexton said, ''There's never been a
reclamation project this large to my knowledge.'' He added, though,
that size could be an advantage: ''The opportunity to make
something grand is almost limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   An international design contest will be held, much like the one
used to find Central Park designers Frederick Law Olmsted and
Calvert Vaux in 1857. The competition, funded by the city and
state, is aimed at finding the best design for what many say is the
city's last great available green space.
</P>
<P>
   ''All suggestions should be considered,'' Sexton said. But he
added that the main thing city planners should realize is ''people
are desperate for open space in this town. ... People want to be
able to walk out their front door and have lunch on the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation will not occur overnight. Federal
environmental laws dictate that the landfill's most contaminated
parts cannot be used for 30 years. The design competition alone
should take nearly three years, with public hearings in all five
boroughs before several designs are submitted to the City Planning
Department for final approval.
</P>
<P>
   While that is happening, the city will begin the closure
process, which includes capping the last two mounds of trash and
installing pipes to reclaim and recycle methane gas produced by the
rotting trash.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the land can almost immediately be planted with native
oak trees, shrubs and fields of flowers, and Handel believes that
''within 10 years it will be seen as a really lovely part of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say there will be immediate improvement for residents
living closest to the dump on the day it closes. There will be no
more trucks and barges coming so the noise level will drop and the
rotten egg smell should decrease dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ''The smell is worse of all,'' said Anastasakos, who has lived
on Staten Island for three years. ''It smacks you in the face the
minute you walk out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said that should improve once more methane gas is drawn
out and fresh air is pumped in.
</P>
<P>
   It can't come soon enough for the nearly 400,000 Staten
Islanders who have complained since the dump opened in 1948.
Borough President Guy Molinari said his father, a state
assemblyman, fought against turning Fresh Kills into a dump because
he feared garbage eventually would cover all the vast, once vibrant
salt marshes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been an issue more important to Staten
Islanders,'' said Molinari. ''The joke here is that of the 10
biggest issues on Staten Island, numbers 1 through 9 are the
garbage dump.''
</P>
<P>
   As an assemblyman himself and later as a congressman, Molinari
watched in dismay as the city closed landfills in the other
boroughs: first Edgemere in Queens, then Pennsylvania Avenue and
Fountain Avenue in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, Fresh Kills was the city's only dump, taking in an
astronomical 27,000 tons of trash a day at its peak. Recycling has
since reduced that figure to about 14,000 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the landfill began warning city officials in
1989 that a more comprehensive plan was needed to get rid of the
city's waste. They predicted that if dumping continued at the peak
rate, Fresh Kills' mounds would reach 412 feet by 2005, making it
the highest man-made point on the Eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the tallest mound is 190 feet, and one councilman
suggested (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) that the city could turn Fresh
Kills into a ski slope when it closed.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari finally sued the city under the Federal Clean Air in
1996 and city, and later that year the closing date at the end of
2001 was announced for Fresh Kills.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the city has exported the bulk of its trash to other
states including New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania. A recent
City Council analysis said that closing Fresh Kills and exporting
its trash will cost the city $622 million over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari looks forward to hosting ''a heck of a party,'' the day
the dump closes. And he's convinced Fresh Kills will once again be
home to fish and birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be exquisite,'' he said confidently. ''Imagine, taking
something we are all ashamed of and making it something special.''

<HEADLINE> Judge overturns animal cruelty conviction of E.Brunswickveterinarian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- A state Superior Court judge has
thrown out the criminal convictions of an East Brunswick
veterinarian accused of killing and abusing pets in his care.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Baker had been fined $3,500 and ordered to perform
community service last July after being convicted in Old Bridge
municipal court of animal cruelty against 11 pets. His conviction
was based on the testimony of an animal rights activist who worked
undercover in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's license had also been revoked by a state veterinary
board, and Friday's court ruling had no immediate affect on that
decision. He had been a practicing veterinarian for two years and
operated the Village Veterinary Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Joyce Munkacsi said the municipal charges
against Baker were not supported by credible evidence and she said
the chief witness against Baker was biased.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Salvato, a spokeswoman for the state Board of
Veterinary Medical Examiners, said the board may conduct
independent hearings to determine whether Baker's license should be
reinstated. Lawyer Michael Rosenbaum said Friday the board has ''no
choice but to overturn'' its decision.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Baker were brought to local prosecutors
by Michele Rokke, a former activist and investigator for People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals who made secret videotapes of
Baker while employed at his clinic as an assistant from June 1996
to April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, Baker admitted giving light slaps or taps to pets,
and grabbing cats by the scruff of the neck to settle them down,
but he denied the cruelty charges.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's trial lawyer had argued Rokke was an ''animal rights
zealot whose lack of training or experience in the conduct of
veterinary medicine and radical views taint her perception of
events involving animals.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left court Friday, Baker said, ''Where do I go to get my
reputation back?''

<HEADLINE> Unions Fight Criticism of a Split  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of union members coming to rallies
in the nation's capital this week are bringing with them an old
familiar gripe about American jobs disappearing overseas -- this
time to China.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. The same workers in union jackets and ''Buy American''
buttons are falling into ranks with other activists here to protest
a lack of good jobs in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Is the U.S. labor movement developing a split personality?
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney says no. ''There certainly are
connections'' between the causes of American and foreign workers,
he said. ''It's all part of whether globalization is going to work
for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Adversaries of organized labor accuse unions of political
expediency -- supporting conflicting agendas as they struggle to
defend outdated positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their message doesn't resonate with the public on
protectionism,'' said Chamber of Commerce spokesman Frank Coleman.
''Job growth is at an all-time high, worker shortages are
appearing. It's kind of hard to make NAFTA-era arguments; they
almost sound like tired cold-war rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is arguing that China should have to meet higher
human rights standards before being welcomed into new world trade
agreements. Last fall, the labor federation helped gather the
multitude of demonstrators who shut down a meeting of the World
Trade Organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the AFL-CIO is encouraging union members to march with
environmental, human rights and other activists to protest policies
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which are
holding their annual spring meetings here this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. labor movement's priorities are evolving by necessity,
said Lance Compa, a senior lecturer on international issues at
Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The AFL-CIO has moved to a more genuine international
position,'' he said. ''It's clearly driven by the phenomenon that
we call globalization for shorthand, and the fact that even though
the U.S. has the largest single national economy in the world, we
can't just go it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections between American and foreign workers are more
tangible than ever, Compa notes. ''Workers in other countries are
in some cases encountering the same multinational firms that U.S.
unions are facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging another tightening bond with workers from abroad,
the AFL-CIO earlier this year reversed a long-standing policy
discouraging immigration, calling for a general amnesty for illegal
workers who have become the labor movement's best prospects for new
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally on Capitol Hill Wednesday, union marchers could still
be heard grumbling about keeping American jobs for Americans. But
in visits with lawmakers, their arguments against a U.S.-China
trade pact negotiated by the Clinton administration were more
globally minded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of us being threatened by our employers as to why we
don't meet their wage scale, why don't we bring theirs up
instead?'' said Ken McClelland, speaking of Chinese workers. The
United Auto Workers member traveled by bus from Coopersville,
Mich., for the demonstration and meetings with members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At one rally led by religious groups last Sunday, Sweeney spoke
out in favor of forgiveness of debts owed by developing nations to
the World Bank, IMF and industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not able to put the resources that are necessary to
improve the lives of their workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If living standards for foreign workers improve, Sweeney
explains, ''it will raise the level of competition for U.S.
companies, which are taking the lowest possible road, and that's
important for U.S. workers.''

<HEADLINE> Sides Trade Claims in Budget Fight  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the annual fight over Congress' budget,
lofty promises by the authors and apocalyptic warnings by the
opposition party are as integral as numbers with lots of zeroes.
Sometimes, some of the predictions even come true.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the $1.83 trillion budget for fiscal 2001 that
Republicans pushed through Congress last week is no exception. With
lawmakers ready to start focusing on spending and tax bills that
should prompt confrontations with President Clinton, here is a
guide to some of each sides' claims.
</P>
<P>
   --Likely to happen: A big, significant reduction in the $3.6
trillion publicly held national debt. Fearful of being labeled
hostile to Social Security, neither party wants to spend the
program's huge surpluses. Add two more ingredients: Debt reduction
is popular with the public, and lawmakers have found non-Social
Security surpluses adequate to pay for the tax cuts or extra
spending they want. The result: The $1 trillion in Social Security
surpluses projected for the next five years, starting with $161
billion in 2001, could well end up going to debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   --Unlikely to happen: Social Security and Medicare will be
''saved.'' Neither party has proposed cutting either programs'
benefits or raising taxes so they can afford the retirement of the
baby boom generation. Using Social Security surpluses for debt
reduction can help indirectly by lowering interest rates,
strengthening the economy and making it easier for the government
to raise revenue. But worried about voter retaliation, lawmakers
will duck tough choices to rein either program this year. They
might even do the opposite and create prescription drug benefits
under Medicare, making that program even costlier.
</P>
<P>
   --Likely: Plenty of political posturing with an eye to the
November elections. To draw contrasts, Republicans will doubtless
send Clinton tax-cutting bills he is certain to veto. Democrats
will probably accuse Republicans of hurting education, even though
the GOP proposes spending more than this year. In a sampling of
Thursday's rhetoric, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.,
said the GOP budget would ''threaten our record prosperity and
undermine the values of middle-class families.'' Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Democrats ''want to
spend all your money'' and have ''more spending programs than you
ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   --Not likely: Any dramatic changes in federal tax or spending
policy, despite the doomsday characterizations each side uses for
the other's budget plans. With divided government, neither party's
fiscal vision can completely trump the other's. That means that of
the tax cuts Republicans want and the spending increases Democrats
prefer, only portions are likely to become law.
</P>
<P>
   --Likely: More spending this election-year for defense, schools,
farmers and medical research, some of the priorities both parties
agree on and are sure to shower on their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   --Unlikely: Lawmakers will deliver on their promise to hold
spending on many domestic programs to $289 billion. Republicans say
that would be $7 billion more -- 2.5 percent -- than this year. But
in recent years, Congress has usually boosted spending by twice
that amount. And Democrats say Republicans are using accounting
gimmicks and are actually cutting spending by $6.5 billion from
this year. Either way, Republicans will be hard-pressed to meet
their spending goal.
</P>
<P>
   --Likely: The budget will be balanced in fiscal 2001 for what
would be the fourth consecutive year, the first time that has
happened since 1927 to 1930, when Babe Ruth was playing for the
Yankees. Right now, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
projects that if lawmakers do nothing, there will be a $181 billion
surplus next year, with all but $15 billion coming from Social
Security. Even with the tax and spending changes legislators want,
most of that black ink is likely to remain.
</P>
<P>
   --Unlikely: Budget peace. Though incremental changes in tax and
spending policy are likely by year's end, that will not be a signal
of political consensus. Rather, it will underline a tacit agreement
between the two parties that their disputes over taxes and spending
should be taken to the voters, who will decide who will control the
White House and Congress next year.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Tax Information Leaked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Information from the files of 11.5
million taxpayers has been leaked from computers of Brazil's
Internal Revenue Service and was sold to direct-mailing companies,
Brazilian media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The leak was confirmed Friday by the Sao Paulo Crime Laboratory,
although it didn't say how the information got out, various media
said without citing sources. The police were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The data reportedly was from 1998 tax returns and included the
names, incomes, addresses, telephone numbers, activities and other
information of 7.6 million individuals and 3.9 million companies.
Among the personal returns were those of President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, media said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of a massive leak of tax files surfaced last November,
when the Telefonica phone company told police about a newspaper ad
offering data about the company. Police reportedly have charged
four people.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Whitman Defends GOP Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the tax deadline looming, New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman says Americans pay too much and deserve freedom
from the so-called ''marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Keeping more of your earnings boils down to freedom -- freedom
to make choices about what's important to you -- whether it's
college tuition for your child, a new home for your family or
saving for your own retirement,'' Whitman said in the weekly
Republican radio address Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She criticized the Clinton administration and Democrats for
hindering GOP plans to end the marriage penalty that causes 25
million married couples to pay higher taxes than if they were
single.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats blocked Republican legislation Thursday that
would cut taxes by $248 billion over 10 years for millions of
married couples. While eliminating the marriage penalty has broad
support in both parties, Democrats and Republicans disagree on how
to do it and how much of the projected budget surplus it should
consume.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman praised the tax cutting efforts of Republican governors
including Michigan's John Engler and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that during her time as governor, New Jersey cut
taxes 37 times, helping to create 400,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Investment Brokers Say Don't Panic  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Responses from some investment advisers who were
asked, ''What
should I do on Monday morning when the stock markets open?'':
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''It really depends on what an investor has in their portfolio.
But basically I'm telling my folks to stay put. People who have put
together diverse portfolios and are looking toward long-term
investment goals shouldn't have to worry too much about market
fluctuations.'' -- Vernon Lee, an independent financial planner and
head of Lee Investment Consulting in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think stocks are way too cheap for investors to begin
selling their holdings now. History says that unless the market is
falling on an event that is extraneous to the market -- like the
outbreak of war -- it should snap back. ... But people who are
already invested may want to sell their weaker stocks, meaning
those of companies that have no earnings and were overvalued in the
first place.'' -- David Klaskin, chairman and chief executive of
Oakridge Investments in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It almost never pays to panic. People should have a
well-balanced portfolio and they should just basically be patient
with it.'' -- Jim Melcher, president of Balestra Capital Management,
a New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a long-term investor, it's probably a mistake to
sell your holdings. You'll probably incur a substantial tax penalty
and, unless you're a very, very gifted person, it's unlikely that
you'll get back into the market at the right time.'' -- Burt
Greenwald, an independent mutual fund consultant in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on what an investor is holding and it depends on
his objectives. ... If he's a long-term investor with long-term
goals, then my advice is to stay the course. A technology investor
who has taken on a lot of risk should stick with it if they don't
mind the volatility.'' -- Jack Piazza, a financial adviser in
Wheaton, Ill.

<HEADLINE> Finance Leaders Discuss Market Drop  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the prospect of thousands of protesters
disrupting their meetings wasn't enough, the world's top finance
ministers faced a new problem today: How to prevent a record plunge
on Wall Street from destabilizing the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan and finance officials from six other rich industrial
countries arrived in a light rain at the Blair House for afternoon
talks on the state of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan gave a little wave to reporters waiting outside but
said nothing before entering.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters that
Summers had assured him during a morning meeting that the
fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong despite the horrible
week on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department issued a statement after the U.S.-Japan
discussions saying that the world's two largest economies had
pledged to work together to make the spring meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ''constructive and
fruitful.''
</P>
<P>
   The state of the global economy already was high on the agenda
of the finance ministers and central bank presidents. But now added
to that discussion was a review of Friday's record plunge in U.S.
stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 617.78 points,
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index plunged a record
355.49 points.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-globalization activists have pledged to disrupt the IMF and
World Bank meetings by forming human chains and clogging streets to
prevent delegates from attending the discussions, as many of the
same protesters were able to do to last December's meetings in
Seattle of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Early today, police staged a raid and closed down the
protesters' headquarters in an old warehouse after fire officials
declared the building unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were arrested at the warehouse, which demonstrators
had dubbed the ''convergence center'' because hundreds of
protesters had been attending teach-ins and sessions on nonviolent
demonstrations there during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably saved their lives,'' Washington Police Chief
Charles Ramsey said in discussing the fire hazards he said
authorities had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal law enforcement authorities are determined to
prevent a recurrence of Seattle, which included window-smashing and
other random violence by small groups of anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   The G-7 meeting site at the Blair House and the White House
across the street were being guarded by extra-heavy security
forces. Police today greatly expanded the security perimeter,
forcing out-of-town tourists to make sharp detours because of all
the street closings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing a package of reform
proposals for both the IMF and the World Bank, but other countries
have voiced objections to some of the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It was likely that the weekend meetings would end with a vague
pledge to continue pushing reform efforts at the two institutions,
which were heavily criticized for their handling of the 1997-98
global financial crisis, while leaving the details to further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Following Friday's tumble, which ended a bad week on Wall
Street, Summers insisted that the economic fundamentals in the
United States remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States economy has been a source of strength for
itself and a source of strength for the global economy,'' he said
in a CNN interview minutes after the markets closed. ''The right
priority for us is (to focus) on those fundamentals that are
important for sustained economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers refused to respond directly when asked if the
administration had the same worries as the IMF, which in its latest
economic forecast this week listed a sharp drop in U.S. stock
prices as one of the threats facing the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF produced an optimistic forecast this week that the world
economy would grow 4.2 percent this year, the fastest pace in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But it warned that one of the dangers to this forecast was a
sharp plunge in the value of U.S. stocks, which could cause
consumers to cut back on spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
total economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who has been warning since 1996 about the dangers of
investors' ''irrational exuberance'' said in a speech Friday
financial markets were still vulnerable to a sudden loss in
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the general human experience that when confronted with
uncertainty, whether in financial markets or in any other aspect of
life, disengagement is the normal protective reaction,'' Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin said Friday that Canada
would put forward its own proposal at the weekend meetings to
institute a halt in repayment of loans by countries to their
foreign creditors, including commercial banks, in times of economic
difficulty as a way to instill more caution on the part of private
investors.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was important for global institutions like the
IMF to address legitimate criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must demonstrate that we understand that countries are made
up of people and not economic indicators,'' he said in a Washington
speech. ''We need to address the skepticism as to what meetings
such as this weekend's are all about.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on Youth Violence  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marking the first anniversary of the shooting
deaths at Columbine High School, President Clinton announced $120
million in new federal grants Saturday to place more police
officers in schools and help even the youngest kids cope with their
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our national struggle against youth violence we must not
fail our children; our future depends on it,'' the president said
in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced that he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
will host a White House Conference on Teen-agers on May 2 to ''talk
through the challenges of raising responsible children.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, teens, teachers, youth workers and others will discuss
research that indicates the preteen years set patterns for behavior
and success in adulthood. Other subjects will include the risks,
challenges and anxieties faced by young people today and what can
be done to avoid dangerous or risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to talk about safety and security in every house in
America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics said the federal government is a clumsy
middleman in trying to cope with problems that should be addressed
locally. They cast doubt on whether the teen conference would
accomplish anything, accused Clinton of ignoring media violence,
and said he should support stiff jail sentences for anyone carrying
a firearm in a violent or drug-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced $40 million in grants for 23 school districts
that he said have found successful, comprehensive approaches to
help troubled young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''These districts are bringing school nurses and counselors
together to respond to warning signs like depression or bullying,''
Clinton said. ''They are improving classroom security and expanding
after-school and mentoring programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also unveiled the $60 million fifth round of funding for
''COPS in School,'' a Justice Department program that helps pay the
costs of placing police officers in schools to help make them safe
for students and teachers. The money will be used to provide 452
officers in schools in more than 220 communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Already, it has placed 2,200 officers in more than 1,000
communities across our nation, where they are heightening school
safety as well as coaching sports and acting as mentors and
mediators for kids in need,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clinton said the Education Department has earmarked $20
million for local proposals to create or expand counseling programs
for elementary schoolchildren. ''We have seen all too clearly that
even our youngest children need our help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we prepare next week to mark the one-year anniversary of
the tragedy at Columbine High School, our thoughts turn to the
safety of our communities, schools and children,'' Clinton said.
''All of us -- parents, schools, communities and government -- share
responsibility to keep kids safe.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, 1999, two students at Columbine High in Littleton,
Colo., fatally shot 12 students and a teacher before killing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals drew instant comment from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House Conference on teen-agers is sure to draw
national headlines and attention, but unlikely to add new light to
these troubling questions,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla.,
chairman of the House Republican Conference. He said the solutions
will be found around America's kitchen tables, ''not from
Washington or from posturing politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson accused
Clinton of having ''shamelessly politicized and taken advantage of
national tragedies'' while ignoring the films, television programs
and music videos Nicholson said are responsible for creating ''a
culture of death'' among youthful Americans. Instead of using his
office to combat the entertainment industry, Clinton has chosen to
use the industry as a source of campaign cash, he said.

<HEADLINE> NJ ends criminal probe of troopers over faking records in trafficstops  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state has ended its criminal
investigation of 10 unnamed troopers who had been suspected of
falsifying records on highway traffic stops in order to conceal
patterns of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   However, these troopers who had patrolled the New Jersey
Turnpike in early 1998 remain subject to internal investigations
that could result in disciplinary steps against them.
</P>
<P>
   State Police spokesman John Hagerty said Saturday the state
attorney general's office ''completed its review and determined
that there was no criminal action, and referred it back to the
state police'' for its own proceedings. Hagerty said none of the
troopers had been suspended or assigned to changes in duty as a
result of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A state grand jury in April 1999 indicted troopers John Hogan
and James Kenna on charges of police misconduct for falsifying
reports and for illegally stopping vehicles and searching
occupants. The allegations included efforts to misrepresent the
race of the motorists they had stopped in order to conceal the fact
they were targeting minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Kenna and Hogan had been involved in the April 1998 shooting of
three minority men during a traffic stop on the turnpike, which led
to their indictment last September by a different grand jury on
charges of attempted murder. Hogan and Kenna claimed their opened
fire because the van the men were in was backing up to strike them.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended troopers still await trial on both sets of
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   As state investigators were digging into the turnpike shooting,
they reviewed the traffic stop records of Hogan, Kenna and other
troopers in the Moorestown and Cranbury barracks assigned to patrol
the turnpike. The misconduct indictment against Hogan and Kenna
arose from this separate inquiry and concerned traffic stops
conducted in the three months before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant Attorney General Paul Zoubek at the time said
the inquiry would continue. It was later reported the traffic stops
of 10 other troopers were being scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan was charged with 17 counts of falsifying or tampering with
records, Kenna with eight counts. Both were also indicted on two
counts each of misconduct. They face up to 10 years in prison and
$100,000 in fines for each of the counts of official misconduct.
The falsifying records charges carry a maximum penalty of up to 18
months in prison and $7,500 in fines for each count.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Superintendent Col. Carson Dunbar met with members
of the state's Black Ministers Council Friday, assuring them racial
profiling had been fully addressed. ''Those few who have also
caused problems in the past also know this is a new day,'' Dunbar
told the ministers. He did not tell them the criminal probe of
other troopers had been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer said New Jersey has done more
''than any other state or the federal government to prohibit the
practice of racial profiling.''

<HEADLINE> Veterans Group Accuses VA Secretary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West rejected the
recommendation of a task force that Vietnam War soldiers who
developed diabetes after being exposed to Agent Orange should be
compensated, The Denver Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said it had obtained documents showing the VA's
Agent Orange Task Force had recommended honoring the claims, but
West decided more research was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a deliberately deleterious action by the secretary. He
is the politico and he is standing in the way,'' said Rick Weidman,
director of government relations for the Vietnam Veterans of
America. His group says West is siding with cost-cutters.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bensen, a spokesman for West, said the secretary was
following the law when he sent the issue back for ''a more
comprehensive look at all the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   About 19 million gallons of Agent Orange and other chemicals
were used to defoliate trees in the jungles of Vietnam beginning in
1962. Their use was stopped in 1971, two years after studies first
linked Agent Orange to birth defects in laboratory animals.
</P>
<P>
   VA files obtained by The Post indicate the Agent Orange Task
Force unanimously recommended on April 30, 1999, that diabetes be
added to the list of ailments linked to Agent Orange. Chaired by
Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, then the VA's undersecretary for health, the
panel said in its report that it had reached its conclusion after
four meetings of a working group and ''careful deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kizer and Joe Thompson, who runs the VA benefits program,
separately concurred with the task force findings and urged West to
list diabetes. Thompson predicted in a May 5, 1999, memo to West
that the task force finding ''will reverberate throughout the VA
and our stakeholder community.''
</P>
<P>
   In a June 17, 1999, memorandum to Kizer, West declared that ''a
number of unresolved issues prevent me from making a fully informed
determination regarding the task force's recommendation that I
establish a presumption of service connection for diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force in March announced that it had found the
''strongest evidence to date'' that exposure to Agent Orange is
linked to diabetes. The National Academy of Sciences then said it
was reviewing the Air Force study and would report to Veterans
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Veterans Affairs said a decision on whether
diabetes will be linked to Agent Orange exposure would be made
after a federal review of another study on dioxin and diabetes, due
to be completed in May.
</P>
<P>
   The law governing Agent Orange does not require researchers to
establish a causal relationship between exposure and diabetes for
medical claims to be paid. All that is required is a finding that
''a relationship is as likely as not'' to exist between an ailment
and exposure to the chemical.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Gambles on Land Occupations  </HEADLINE>
ANGUS SHAW
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Reeling after an unprecedented electoral
rebuke, President Robert Mugabe sought to shore up his flagging
popularity among Zimbabwe's landless poor by backing armed black
squatters' illegal occupation of white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   But 20 years after he led his country to independence as an
international hero of African liberation and democracy, Mugabe is
now being branded a despot for ignoring court rulings to evict the
violent squatters.
</P>
<P>
   And with the country wracked by an economic crisis as
parliamentary elections loom, it is unclear whether his gamble has
won him any of the support he so desperately needs at home.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mugabe canceled deeply symbolic parades and
ceremonies marking the 20th anniversary of freedom from white rule
in Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before independence on April 18,
1980. The events were scrapped, he said, to save money to help
Zimbabwean flood victims. But he likely feared the jubilant crowds
that once packed his rallies would be replaced by protesters and
possible violence between rival parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''His ship is sinking. There's nothing to celebrate and he knows
it,'' said Isaac Maphosa, director of the National Constitutional
Assembly, an alliance of opposition and reform groups.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation soared last year to a record 70 percent, and
corruption and economic mismanagement have been blamed for acute
gas and power shortages since December that have crippled the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabweans were further alienated by Mugabe's foreign policy:
They watched their health, education and social services decline
while Mugabe spent precious foreign reserves deploying 11,000
troops to back embattled President Laurent Kabila in the Congo
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In this agriculture-dependent country of 13 million, 4,000 white
farmers own one-third of the productive farmland, and Mugabe has
tried to use land redistribution to his political advantage. But in
February, voters rejected a new constitution that would have
allowed the government to seize white-owned farms without paying
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe quickly set up the current crisis in the wake of that
rare electoral defeat. He said landless blacks would take matters
into their own hands by seizing farms from the comparatively
wealthy descendants of colonial-era British settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, thousands of men armed with clubs, axes and guns
occupied more than 900 farms across the country. Many of the
squatters were being paid; some said their money was coming from
ruling party activists.
</P>
<P>
   According to the human rights group Zimrights, most Zimbabweans
believe Mugabe personally orchestrated the occupations ahead of
elections expected to be called in May.
</P>
<P>
   Only a direct order from Mugabe can end the occupations,
Zimrights chairman Nicholas Ndebele said. Vice President Joseph
Msika appealed Thursday for squatters to leave peacefully, but on
Saturday, an occupation leader told a cheering crowd at the ruling
party's Harare headquarters that squatters will continue their
takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, an austere, 76-year-old former school teacher, has
described the occupations as a democratic protest. He has appeared
unmoved by reports of violent assaults on white farmers, insisting
the occupations have been mostly peaceful and declaring they are
not a campaign against all the nation's 70,000 whites.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a fight against whites as such, it is a fight
against a particular section of the whites who have the land,'' he
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The whole crisis is an embattled ruler's scheme to keep power,
Maphosa said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has very little left to bargain with but land, and it's
backfiring on him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Land inequity simply is not the main issue for voters, who worry
about further disruptions to the agriculture-based economy, Ndebele
said. Most people see unemployment and worsening economic hardships
as their main grievances, according to a recent Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   After years of virtually unchallenged rule, Mugabe's troubles
began three years ago, when leaked government documents showed
politicians, military officers and ruling party officials looted
$35 million from a war veterans pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Impoverished veterans demonstrated against the government,
forcing Mugabe to award 50,000 of them pensions that drew $300
million from state coffers. That worsened the government's debts
and angered Western donors and financial institutions, including
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   When the IMF froze loans to Zimbabwe last year, partly because
of the costly Congo deployment, Mugabe described the institution as
''the devil incarnate'' for imposing Western economic reform
targets on African governments.
</P>
<P>
   But in what became a common saying, many Zimbabweans attributed
their deepening economic hardships to a different IMF: It's
Mugabe's Fault.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion leader Randall Terry's estate for sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WINDSOR, N.Y. (AP) -- The 116-acre estate used by one of the
nation's most prominent anti-abortion leaders and his followers is
on the market as past court judgments from protests mount.
</P>
<P>
   The rural home used for years by Randall Terry, founder of
Operation Rescue, is valued at $499,000. Terry, who is working in
Vermont, is considering a run for U.S. Senate now being pursued by
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The estate is for sale in the wake of legal action against
Terry, reported the Binghamton Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin. Terry, in town
for his syndicated radio show, Randall Terry Live, wouldn't
comment.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Cindy Terry, who owns the property, said the sale is
not an attempt to shield assets from creditors. The six-bedroom
house is too big for her and her children since Terry left, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband left me in August. Me and my two daughters live at
the home, and it's too big a place,'' she said. The six-bedroom
Victorian 15 miles east of Binghamton, N.Y., had been used for
retreats for Terry and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a guest house, in-ground pool, basketball and tennis
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Terry had sought protection from opposing organizations and
creditors by filing for bankruptcy in November 1998. He claimed he
had $1.7 million in debts, mostly civil judgments won by women's
groups and abortion rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the property comes after a federal bankruptcy court
in March denied a motion to dismiss a claim by Terry's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's an attempt to raise money to settle (the
case) or if it's an attempt to avoid it being a part of his
bankruptcy,'' said attorney Peter Orville of nearby Vestal, N.Y. He
represents a number of women's groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Terry moved to Montpelier, Vt., where he heads Loyal Opposition,
which lobbies against legislation proposing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Terry was ordered in 1988 to pay $50,000 in a lawsuits for
blocking access to abortion clinics. In 1989, he was one of three
people ordered to pay a $282,610 fine for violating an injunction
against blocking abortion clinics. The state also filed three tax
liens in 1994 and 1995 totaling $6,831.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Weapons Check Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq on Saturday rejected a new U.N. plan
to restart weapons inspections, saying it was a no-go until the
Security Council lifts the trade sanctions imposed nearly 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters the government
was not impressed by the U.N. Security Council's approval Thursday
of the plan drawn up by chief weapons inspector Hans Blix.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any resolution which does not meet Iraq's legitimate rights in
removing the embargo and denouncing aggression (against Baghdad) is
not acceptable,'' he said, referring to the U.N. sanctions imposed
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and the subsequent U.S.
and British airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   While some Iraqi officials have left open the possibility of
compromise over the bid to revive weapons inspections, Aziz said he
did not know of any member of the Iraqi leadership who would permit
them.
</P>
<P>
   The council's approval of Blix's plan for a new weapons
inspectorate, called the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission, showed that world powers remain determined
to restart inspections.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq in December 1998 ahead of the
airstrikes, launched to punish Iraq for allegedly failing to
cooperate with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions can be lifted only when the inspectors inform the
Security Council that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction and the means to produce them. Baghdad says it has
already done so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to reconfirm what we have said before -- that U.S.
and British efforts to impose a new unfair resolution will never
succeed,'' Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed as ''trickery'' the December resolution that set up
the new inspection commission and offered Iraq the possibility of
suspending sanctions in return for its cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never hinted that Iraq will deal with this resolution.
... It is a treacherous resolution with which we cannot
cooperate,'' Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan drawn up by Blix of Sweden addresses some of Iraq's
grievances about the former U.N. weapons inspectorate, known as
UNSCOM. The plan stresses that arms experts will work for the
United Nations rather than any government.
</P>
<P>
   Blix made it clear the new inspectors will come from all around
the world and will be paid by the United Nations. They will not be
volunteers with obligations to member governments.
</P>
<P>
   Blix also stressed that intelligence gathered by inspectors must
remain with the agency and be used only for its key disarmament
work.
</P>
<P>
   The chief inspector clearly does not want his team to be tainted
by the allegations that stung UNSCOM: that weapons inspectors spied
on Iraq on behalf of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Vow Defiance  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Squatters illegally occupying hundreds
of white-owned farms will continue their takeovers, defying a High
Court ruling and a government appeal for them to leave the farms, a
leader of the occupations said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are human rights, we have right to our land ... and
that must be respected,'' Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of the National
Liberation War Veterans Association told about 500 cheering
supporters at the ruling party's headquarters in Harare. ''The
redistribution of land must be speeded up.''
</P>
<P>
   Police, meanwhile, resisted a court order to oust the armed
black squatters from white-owned farms and instead mounted a
massive security operation in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As police helicopters swooped overhead, officers erected
roadblocks at the approaches to the city center. There they
searched cars and buses for weapons. Riot police also deployed
across the city ''in case there might be people who would like to
cause trouble,'' said Assistant Commissioner Emmanuel Chimwanda,
the operation commander.
</P>
<P>
   The roadblocks left hundreds of vehicles stalled on main
highways leading to the city center where Hunzvi addressed militant
ex-guerrillas of Zimbabwe's liberation war from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's 4,000 white-owned farms comprise about a third of the
country's productive farmland, while millions of blacks are
landless and impoverished. Since the end of February, thousands of
squatters armed with clubs, axes and guns have invaded at least 900
white-owned farms and demanded the farmers sign away their land.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe has called the actions a justified
protest against inequality in land ownership. Some squatters have
admitted being paid by ruling party activists.
</P>
<P>
   Police will appeal a High Court order for them to evict the
squatters, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported Saturday.
Police have said they lack the resources to act against the armed
invaders and that doing so could end in violence.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the High Court made its ruling Thursday, Vice
President Joseph Msika asked the squatters to abandon the occupied
farms and said the government wanted to end the standoff amicably.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, Hunzvi told his cheering and singing followers
that he did not respect any court ruling that he believed was
unfair. He said he could not control the actions of squatters
claiming their ''motherland, their soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the white farmers, he said: ''The land has been left in their
hands too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Although police complain that they lack sufficient personnel and
equipment, Saturday's mobilization of thousands of officers showed
they can bring downtown Harare to a virtual standstill. The
operation effectively sealed off the city center for several hours,
leaving parking lots and bus parks mostly empty during usually busy
shopping hours.
</P>
<P>
   Chimwanda said there were no reports of violence. He explained
the security campaign as an anti-crime effort and a measure to
avert possible political unrest ahead of upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, 15 people were injured in downtown Harare when
ruling party militants and men claiming to be ex-guerrillas
attacked opposition protesters with iron bars, clubs, bricks and
wire whips.
</P>
<P>
   The Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition group,
said it had no rallies or protests planned in Harare on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Finance Leaders Discuss Market Drop  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the prospect of thousands of protesters
disrupting their meetings wasn't enough, the world's top finance
ministers faced a new problem today: How to prevent a record plunge
on Wall Street from destabilizing the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan and finance officials from six other rich industrial
countries arrived in a light rain at the Blair House for afternoon
talks on the state of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan gave a little wave to reporters waiting outside but
said nothing before entering.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters that
Summers had assured him during a morning meeting that the
fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong despite the horrible
week on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department issued a statement after the U.S.-Japan
discussions saying that the world's two largest economies had
pledged to work together to make the spring meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ''constructive and
fruitful.''
</P>
<P>
   The state of the global economy already was high on the agenda
of the finance ministers and central bank presidents. But now added
to that discussion was a review of Friday's record plunge in U.S.
stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 617.78 points,
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index plunged a record
355.49 points.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-globalization activists have pledged to disrupt the IMF and
World Bank meetings by forming human chains and clogging streets to
prevent delegates from attending the discussions, as many of the
same protesters were able to do to last December's meetings in
Seattle of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Early today, police staged a raid and closed down the
protesters' headquarters in an old warehouse after fire officials
declared the building unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were arrested at the warehouse, which demonstrators
had dubbed the ''convergence center'' because hundreds of
protesters had been attending teach-ins and sessions on nonviolent
demonstrations there during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably saved their lives,'' Washington Police Chief
Charles Ramsey said in discussing the fire hazards he said
authorities had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal law enforcement authorities are determined to
prevent a recurrence of Seattle, which included window-smashing and
other random violence by small groups of anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   The G-7 meeting site at the Blair House and the White House
across the street were being guarded by extra-heavy security
forces. Police today greatly expanded the security perimeter,
forcing out-of-town tourists to make sharp detours because of all
the street closings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing a package of reform
proposals for both the IMF and the World Bank, but other countries
have voiced objections to some of the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It was likely that the weekend meetings would end with a vague
pledge to continue pushing reform efforts at the two institutions,
which were heavily criticized for their handling of the 1997-98
global financial crisis, while leaving the details to further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Following Friday's tumble, which ended a bad week on Wall
Street, Summers insisted that the economic fundamentals in the
United States remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States economy has been a source of strength for
itself and a source of strength for the global economy,'' he said
in a CNN interview minutes after the markets closed. ''The right
priority for us is (to focus) on those fundamentals that are
important for sustained economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers refused to respond directly when asked if the
administration had the same worries as the IMF, which in its latest
economic forecast this week listed a sharp drop in U.S. stock
prices as one of the threats facing the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF produced an optimistic forecast this week that the world
economy would grow 4.2 percent this year, the fastest pace in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But it warned that one of the dangers to this forecast was a
sharp plunge in the value of U.S. stocks, which could cause
consumers to cut back on spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
total economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who has been warning since 1996 about the dangers of
investors' ''irrational exuberance'' said in a speech Friday
financial markets were still vulnerable to a sudden loss in
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the general human experience that when confronted with
uncertainty, whether in financial markets or in any other aspect of
life, disengagement is the normal protective reaction,'' Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin said Friday that Canada
would put forward its own proposal at the weekend meetings to
institute a halt in repayment of loans by countries to their
foreign creditors, including commercial banks, in times of economic
difficulty as a way to instill more caution on the part of private
investors.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was important for global institutions like the
IMF to address legitimate criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must demonstrate that we understand that countries are made
up of people and not economic indicators,'' he said in a Washington
speech. ''We need to address the skepticism as to what meetings
such as this weekend's are all about.''

<HEADLINE> Protesters' Headquarters Raided  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police staged a lightning raid and closed the
headquarters of world finance protesters today, declaring the old
warehouse unsafe and saying they found a container that could have
been used for a firebomb.
</P>
<P>
   Moving through the building, officers seized a plastic container
with a rag stuffed inside and what looked like a wick, said
executive assistant police chief Terry Gainer. He said it ''looks
like a Molotov cocktail.''
</P>
<P>
   An undisclosed amount of ammunition and firebomb instructions
were found in a raid on a house the previous evening, Gainer said.
He did not say whether that raid had anything to do with today's
decision to clear the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The ''convergence'' center was used by hundreds of demonstrators
to train for mass protests planned Sunday and Monday against
meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Police deployed in huge numbers through the capital to try to
head off a replay of the destructive anti-globalization protests in
Seattle at a December meeting of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some 750 senior diplomats and finance leaders were attending the
Washington meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, closed to
vehicles since the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, also was
closed to pedestrians today. Tourists, who normally snap pictures
of the White House from the sidewalk, were kept behind barricades
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested two people for refusing to obey orders as they
evacuated the protest center. Officials said the building was a
fire hazard, with a jury-rigged electrical system, chained doors
and a propane stove that was not up to code.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're simply concerned about their safety, and we want to make
sure there are no fire hazards,'' Washington Police Chief Charles
Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant chief Gainer said police also found the stuffed
plastic container. Protest organizers, who have said they intend to
run disruptive but nonviolent protests, were using the warehouse to
make signs, banners and puppets as well as to conduct training
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will not deter us,'' Molly McCarthy, 21, of Seattle, said
of the evacuation. Protest leaders took their belongings and moved
to another building.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey spoke to protesters on the streets earlier. When one
asked whether police would use tear gas, the chief replied, on
Washington station WRC-TV, ''We could light this town up if we had
to, but we don't intend to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Reinsborough of San Francisco, who was in the warehouse
as the raid began, said two police officers and two fire officials
came to the center unannounced and began inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters demanded a search warrant, but the fire
officials said they didn't need one for a fire inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police said they found things that were a fire hazard,''
Reinsborough said. ''As soon as they claimed they found a fire
hazard, a large number of police were in the area. They demanded
the space be evacuated.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, police raided a house where they found a large
supply of tools and equipment that protesters apparently planned to
use to thwart police efforts to break up human blockades. It was
the second time this week that officers seized such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Gainer later said police also recovered firebomb instructions in
the raid and added: ''We found ammunition.'' Asked what kind, he
said, ''small caliber.'' Three people were arrested for possession
of criminal instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Chains, chicken wire and gas masks were among the items seized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased that we're taking these instruments of
crime off the street, and this will make the weekend much safer,''
Gainer said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before police moved into the headquarters this morning,
about 20 demonstrators from 10 countries appeared at the home of
World Bank President James Wolfensohn and handed him a letter
protesting the institution's lending policies.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn, on his way to work, listened quietly as Vineeta
Gupta, an Indian physician, read part of the letter. The
demonstrators sang quietly in the street, drawing a squad of
motorcycle officers, and held signs saying, ''Wake up Wolfensohn''
and ''Wake Up World Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good morning. Well, thank you very much. You got up very
early,'' Wolfensohn said he told the group before he got into his
chauffeur-driven car.
</P>
<P>
   The letter demanded an international boycott of the bonds that
are the main financing source for the World Bank. ''We call on
governments of all member nations of the World Bank to cease
further funding ... until all destructive World Bank lending has
ended and the World Bank has canceled all debts owed to it by Third
World countries,'' the letter said.

<HEADLINE> Massachusetts Digs 'First' Claims  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LeBLANC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- There are few phrases more cherished in the marble
halls of the Massachusetts Statehouse than ''first in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, lawmakers have proudly claimed a series of
national benchmarks, from a ban on dumping old computer monitors to
tough new handgun regulations.
</P>
<P>
   There was a proposal for a first-ever plan to provide all
seniors with drug coverage. And Massachusetts was the first in the
nation to elect a pregnant woman to statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Big Dig -- the enormous and troubled Boston highway
construction project -- has bragging rights to at least one
engineering title: the world's longest asymmetrical cable-stayed
bridge. Less popular is the fact that it also is now the nation's
most expensive public works project.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the deep-seated belief that Massachusetts, long
ago ousted as the country's financial and political trendsetter,
still holds a place on the cutting edge of policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''Massachusetts is a model for the rest of the country,'' said
state Sen. Cheryl Jacques, referring to a recent report which
praised Massachusetts' gun laws as some of the toughest in the
nation. Jacques spearheaded the state's landmark 1998 gun control
law.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the state's cutting-edge accomplishments are liberal
initiatives, which only makes sense in a place that is home to the
Kennedys, sympathetic to the Clintons, and where more voters
identify themselves as liberal than almost any other state.
</P>
<P>
   And that sticks in the craw of people who don't lean in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's true, it's a frightening thought,'' said anti-tax
conservative Barbara Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson pointed to the legislature's 1988 passage of a
first-in-the-nation law guaranteeing universal health care. The
measure, championed by former Gov. Michael Dukakis, foundered when
the Massachusetts economy went into recession and was never fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Massachusetts is a leader with few followers,
according to former Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ''Massachusetts as a whole is very much out of the national
mainstream and very much out of synch with the rest of the
country,'' said Edwards, now a professor at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, according to Massachusetts loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Attorney General Thomas Reilly announced
Massachusetts would begin using consumer protection laws to
regulate firearms. Although 34 other states have similar laws,
Massachusetts is the first to impose the regulations, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   The state also is leading the charge in the tobacco wars,
according to advocates.
</P>
<P>
   One groundbreaking initiative would allow the attorney general's
office to ban some tobacco advertising near schools and
playgrounds. The second would force the industry to disclose the
ingredients of all tobacco products. The tobacco industry is
fighting to quash both.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Tolman wrote the disclosure law when he served in the
state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly the tobacco disclosure law was the first of its
kind. It was copied in 12 other states,'' Tolman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all firsts are as dramatic as guns or tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Massachusetts began enforcing the nation's
first ban on dumping computer monitors, televisions and video games
that contain cathode ray tubes. Environmental officials say they're
trying to head off a flood of potentially toxic electronic trash.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope it is replicated nationwide,'' said John McNabb, solid
waste policy director at Clean Water Action of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes lawmakers use the ''first in the nation'' label as
part of their legislative pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a bill to create 25-foot, protest-free buffer
zones around abortion clinics are touting the legislation as a
national model. The bill twice won approval in the Senate and is
now before the House.
</P>
<P>
   Activists also are using the ''first in the nation'' claim to
push a proposal to provide all senior citizens in the state with
affordable prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the ''first'' label is just a matter of timing. Weeks
after then-acting Gov. Paul Cellucci named her his running mate,
Lt. Gov. Jane Swift learned she was expecting her first child.
Pundits said she was the first candidate in the country to run for
statewide office while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to score firsts is not unique to Massachusetts, but
the Bay State may be more obsessed with the label than other
states, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a professor of communication
at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're first in self-introspection,'' Berkovitz said.

<HEADLINE> Estate used by anti-abortion leader Randall Terry is for sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, N.Y. (AP) -- The 116-acre estate used by one of the
nation's most prominent anti-abortion leaders and his followers is
on the market as past court judgments from protests mount.
</P>
<P>
   The rural home used for years by Randall Terry, founder of
Operation Rescue, is valued at $499,000. Terry, who is working in
Vermont, is considering a run for U.S. Senate now being pursued by
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The estate is for sale in the wake of legal action against
Terry, reported the Binghamton Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin. Terry, in town
for his syndicated radio show, Randall Terry Live, wouldn't
comment.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Cindy Terry, who owns the property, said the sale is
not an attempt to shield assets from creditors. The six-bedroom
house is too big for her and her children since Terry left, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband left me in August. Me and my two daughters live at
the home, and it's too big a place,'' she said. The six-bedroom
Victorian 15 miles east of Binghamton, N.Y., had been used for
retreats for Terry and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a guest house, in-ground pool, basketball and tennis
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Terry had sought protection from opposing organizations and
creditors by filing for bankruptcy in November 1998. He claimed he
had $1.7 million in debts, mostly civil judgments won by women's
groups and abortion rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the property comes after a federal bankruptcy court
in March denied a motion to dismiss a claim by Terry's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's an attempt to raise money to settle (the
case) or if it's an attempt to avoid it being a part of his
bankruptcy,'' said attorney Peter Orville of nearby Vestal, N.Y. He
represents a number of women's groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Terry moved to Montpelier, Vt., where he heads Loyal Opposition,
which lobbies against legislation proposing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Terry was ordered in 1988 to pay $50,000 in a lawsuits for
blocking access to abortion clinics. In 1989, he was one of three
people ordered to pay a $282,610 fine for violating an injunction
against blocking abortion clinics. The state also filed three tax
liens in 1994 and 1995 totaling $6,831.

<HEADLINE> Furor over power plant proposed for Hudson ValleyBy MICHAEL HILL Associated Press Writer </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, N.Y. (AP) -- Picture this: a Hudson River School painting
portraying lush green hills, vast blue skies and a 1080-megawatt
power plant.
</P>
<P>
   That dissonant image helps explain the controversy over the
proposed Athens Generating Project.
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents dislike the idea of building a power plant a
couple of miles from the historic banks of the Hudson River -- along
a stretch of land master painter Frederick Church gazed at from his
hilltop home named Olana. With a crucial ruling on the proposal due
soon from New York, one issue under review revolves around the
plant's impact on that historic view.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E Generating wants to build a $500 million plant fueled
primarily by natural gas in Athens, a quaint, modest river town
about 30 miles south of Albany in rural Greene County.
</P>
<P>
   The Athens plant would sell its electricity wholesale through
New York's newly-deregulated power market. Dan Whyte, the company's
director of government relations, said the plant will serve eastern
New York. If approved, it would be the first major power plant to
be authorized by the state in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Athens proposal has been under review for more than a year --
dogged by controversy for much of the time. A focus of the furor is
located some four to five miles south of the proposed site, across
the river at the Olana State Historic Site.
</P>
<P>
   Church chose this hilltop perch to begin building his grand,
Moorish-style home in 1870. The popular tourist attraction still
provides a panoramic view of the Hudson Valley -- albeit one
considerably more developed than the 19th century vista known to
Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Athens plant would only be visible from portions of the
Olana property. However, it would be more noticeable with plumes of
steam rising from its smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that have joined the fray against the Athens plant
include Friends of Olana and Scenic Hudson. Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan in November called for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
review. And Pataki's parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, wrote
last year that the Athens plant would have an ''adverse effect'' on
the valley's historic and cultural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only one Olana in the state of New York,'' said Carl
Dworkin, a lawyer for a group opposing the plant called Citizens
for the Hudson Valley. ''You want to be real careful in what you
put there and only sacrifice if there is a real dying need.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents claim the plant could be located somewhere else,
although the company cites the proximity of gas and power lines to
the Athens site as one of its best features.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte said the PG&AMP;E Generating has made a number of changes
since Castro wrote her letter -- things like changing the plant's
color from white to brown and lowering planned smokestack heights.
The company has also agreed to plant trees at Olana to act as
''vegetative screening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whyte noted the conclusion of two state hearing officers who
reported last fall that the visual impact of the Athens plant would
be acceptable since it would be a ''relatively minor component of
the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hearing officers forwarded their findings to the state
Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment. The board
is due to make a decision on Athens by April 30, although the
deadline has been pushed back before.
</P>
<P>
   The plant proposal also faces reviews by the state Department of
Environmental Conservation and the Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The state siting board will look at whole a range of issues,
including the plant's larger environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents believe the company's plan to draw water from the
Hudson River to cool the plant could endanger shad coming up the
river to spawn. Theresa Rose Hanczor, an attorney at Riverkeeper,
is concerned Athens would fail to use the best technology available
-- a ''dry cooling'' system that relies on far less river water.
</P>
<P>
   Whyte said Athens would require far less water than five power
plants already on the river currently use.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you really care about the river, you want this plant
because it will displace the other plants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is supported by local residents who see the plant as
an economic engine for a rural county where the unemployment rate
has lately been above 6 percent. PG&AMP;E has sweetened the deal with a
package that includes a $3 million trust for the town, $250,000 for
computer science at local schools and a block of wholesale power
for the town and county.
</P>
<P>
   Arlin Anderson of the county chamber of commerce claims that
despite a high-profile opposition campaign, a silent majority backs
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opponents have definitely made their voice heard a lot
louder. However, they are the minority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said a mailed questionnaire to local residents showed
support running overwhelmingly for the plant. Responses to that
mailing also included a few death threats, underscoring local
tensions over the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Legislature moves to outlaw gift-giving to jurors  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A bill is headed toward passage in the state
Legislature to make it a crime for people involved in trials to
give money or other gratuities to jurors, as Abraham Hirschfeld did
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was in direct response to Hirschfeld's gifts of
$2,500 to each of the 10 members of a jury in New York City which
deadlocked over whether he was guilty of tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   When Hirschfeld was tried later in the year in connection with
an alleged murder-for-hire plot, a state Supreme Court justice
barred him from paying jurors in that trial after it ended.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld's lawyer Arthur Aidala argued that there was no legal
basis in New York for Justice Carol Berkman to issue that order and
that Hirschfeld was free to give money or other gifts to anyone he
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the legislation this year in Albany affirms that
there is currently no prohibition in state law to paying jurors
like Hirschfeld did, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. James Lack, a Nassau County Republican who chairs his
chamber's judiciary committee, said the state Office of Court
Administration was ''absolutely, totally taken aback by the vacuum
Mr. Hirschfeld capitalized on'' last year to make his payments.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation proposed this year by the Office of Court
Administration would make it a Class A misdemeanor for someone to
give a gratuity to a juror in a civil or criminal action in which
that person was a party.
</P>
<P>
   A Class A misdemeanor carries a fine up to $1,000 and up to a
year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Court administrators said payments like those by Hirschfeld, a
quirky millionaire who made his money building open-air parking
garages, undermine the legal system by giving the appearance that
defendants are rewarding jurors for deciding cases in their favor.
No compensation should be made to jurors past the pay they receive
for serving, administrators said.
</P>
<P>
   David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the Office of Court
Administration, said top court officials were ''delighted'' the
bill passed the state Senate on April 3. It is now in committee the
state Assembly, but with Codes Committee Chairman Joseph Lentol and
Judiciary Committee Chairwoman Helene Weinstein as its prime
sponsors, it is expected to win final passage in that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will preserve the dignity of the court process,''
Bookstaver said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the spokesman, gift-giving to jurors has not been
banned earlier in New York because court administrators knew of no
instances where it had occurred before Hirschfeld's payments to
jurors at his tax fraud trial.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts since April 3 to elicit comment from
Hirschfeld, who is running for U.S. Senate this year, failed.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Being Overrun by Rats  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's leaders joined hundreds of
people in a trash pickup Saturday that highlighted growing health
concerns about the province's burgeoning rat population.
</P>
<P>
   No one is really quite sure how many rats have invaded the city,
but rodents have become more visible in recent weeks, crawling
along major streets and foraging through piles of refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the United Nations' top administrator in
Kosovo, warned that the problem would only get worse if people do
not start disposing of trash properly. Rats feeding off the rotting
waste strewn around the provincial capital, Pristina, have become a
threat to the population's health.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not the plague yet,'' Kouchner said. ''But there is a
growing rat population. I can't tell you how many there are.''
</P>
<P>
   The garbage in the capital and the countryside has been
accumulating in the 10 months since NATO took control of the
province after a war aimed at stopping Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's repression of ethnic Albanian militants. U.N.
authorities recognize the problem, but say they lack the money
needed to clear the garbage away.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the weather is getting warmer here, health officials
say they are starting to see the impact of the trash -- and the rats
-- on Kosovo's people.
</P>
<P>
   At Pristina's hospital, doctors say they see 10 people a day who
have gotten sick from diseases transmitted from the rats and rodent
droppings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, we didn't have this problem,'' said Dr. Nadire
Maqedonci at the hospital's infectious disease department. ''Now
all the doctors are discussing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The wards are full of cases related to the rodents. One victim,
a 33-year-old woman who had given birth four days ago, was
receiving treatment for an infection.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have many rats in my house, but only recently,'' said Elezaj
Xherahire, who had been separated from her newborn because her
disease is infectious.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's NATO-led cleanup was billed as a way to educate
people to be more careful about how they get rid of their waste.
People in Kosovo tend to simply throw trash in the street, in empty
lots, in rivers -- anywhere there is an untended empty space.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to set an example,'' said Gen. Klaus Reinhardt,
the German commander of the NATO troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt led a contingent of peacekeepers in combing across
grassland at Pristina's university, picking up cigarette butts,
orange peels, broken glass and plastic spoons.
</P>
<P>
   Students also joined the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York has rubbish too, but not like Pristina,'' said Gent
Uka, 14, who lived in New York for a short time while living as a
refugee from Milosevic's forces. ''We want our city to be clean.''

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Syringe Attack, 1st Ld-Writethru, 235  </HEADLINE>
Doctor attacks woman with a syringe outside hospital
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Westchester County doctor attacked a nurse by
stabbing her six times with a syringe outside a Bronx hospital,
police reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Pack, 44, a resident of the posh Westchester
community of Chappaqua, reportedly had been romantically involved
with the woman, who was pregnant, police and television reports
said. He was charged with assault, said police spokesman Alan
Krawitz.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old woman, who suffered five stab wounds to the leg
and one to the buttocks, was taken to Montefiore Hospital. She was
attacked just outside that hospital on Friday at about 8 p.m. and
was listed in stable condition on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was arrested minutes after the attack near the scene
at 210th Street and Rochambeau Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Pack is married and the syringe attack apparently was his
attempt to abort the 6-week-old fetus by injecting the woman with a
fluid -- possibly a substance used to induce labor or cause an
abortion, local television reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Pack waited for her by the parking garage at East
210th Street, then lunged at her, threw her to the ground and
yelled that he would give her an abortion, according to WPIX
television.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Challenged  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- With more than half the votes counted,
Rauf Denktash led the race for president of the self-declared
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on Saturday, but was short of
the majority necessary to avoid a run-off.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash gathered close to 44 percent of votes, while his main
contender, Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu, had 30 percent, according
to the Turkish Cypriot Higher Election Board. The results were
based on a count of 56 percent of the ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, I'll win,'' Denktash said of the initial results.
''Worst comes to worst it'll be in the second round,'' he said on
Bayrak state television.
</P>
<P>
   The election for president of the north half of Cyprus -- the
Turkish half -- comes just a month before Turkish Cypriot and Greek
Cypriot leaders gather in New York for another attempt to find a
solution to the island's division.
</P>
<P>
   The impending talks are expected to help boost support for
Denktash's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had it been at another time, it wouldn't have been so
important to choose Denktash. But he must finish this peace deal,''
said 25-year-old Gurhum Umut, who said he was voting for the first
time because he was worried that Denktash would need every vote.
</P>
<P>
   After polls closed, a preliminary tally showed that 76 percent
of the electorate voted.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash, 75, established the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus in 1983 and is leader of his community of 200,000. His
self-declared state is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains
some 30,000 troops on the island.
</P>
<P>
   However, he faced a strong challenge from Eroglu, who has built
support through his role as prime minister and the distribution of
social assistance. Eroglu forced Denktash into a run-off in the
last election in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Denktash hasn't solved the issue in decades. You think he will
now?'' said Mevlut Haci Mevlut, an Eroglu supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash called on voters to cast their ballots for him, saying
''let's not wait for a second round.''
</P>
<P>
   Most seemed to believed Denktash would again be forced into a
run-off against Eroglu.
</P>
<P>
   ''And if he doesn't win in this round, he may have difficulty in
a run-off because all other candidates could unite against him,''
said Yusuf Kanli, an expert on Cypriot politics.
</P>
<P>
   Six other candidates were running Saturday, including five
left-wing candidates. A second round of voting will be held April
22 if no candidate gains more than 50 percent of the vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of peace has become more urgent because of the
European Union's membership talks with Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots
want a settlement to be reached as soon as possible so the two
sides can enter the EU simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into Turkish and Greek sections since
the 1974 Turkish invasion which came in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> India: Clinton a Help in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By BINOO JOSHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, India (AP) -- President Clinton's visit last month to
India and Pakistan helped reduce tensions between the two nuclear
rivals over the disputed territory of Kashmir, India's defense
minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister George Fernandes said during a visit to Jammu,
the winter capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, that India would be open
to Pakistan's offer to restart talks if Islamabad continues to
scale down attacks on Indian forces in the Himalayan territory.
</P>
<P>
   While saying there had been no change in ''Pakistan's attitude''
on Kashmir, Fernandes noted that ''the number of rounds fired by
Pakistan across the cease-fire line has gone down after Clinton's
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension had escalated between India and Pakistan before
Clinton's visit to the subcontinent in late March. Armies on both
sides exchanged heavy gunfire on an almost daily basis across the
cease-fire line dividing Kashmir between the hostile neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was hoping Clinton would agree to mediate in its
Kashmir dispute with India, but Clinton ruled out any such
participation unless both sides agreed and asked Pakistan to
respect the cease-fire line. He also pressed both sides to resume
talks.
</P>
<P>
   India rejects any third party intervention and says it wants to
settle the dispute directly with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India has accused Pakistan of training and arming Kashmiri
militants. Pakistan says it only provides moral and diplomatic
support to the Islamic rebels fighting a secessionist war in
Indian-held Kashmir since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   An Egyptian newspaper on Saturday quoted Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
Pakistan's military ruler, as saying that any solution to the
Kashmir issue ''should take into consideration the hopes of the
people of Kashmir according to U.N. resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These resolutions are the key for normalizing relations
between India and Pakistan,'' the Al-Ahram newspaper quoted
Musharraf as saying. He arrived in Cairo on Saturday for talks with
Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan wants residents of Kashmir to be allowed to vote on
whether to join India or Pakistan, as outlined in decades-old U.N.
resolutions. India opposes the idea.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over control of Kashmir
since they won independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   A dialogue between the two countries was interrupted after India
detected hundreds of armed fighters occupying mountainous peaks in
the Kargil sector in Indian-held Kashmir in May last year.
</P>
<P>
   India said the fighters were Pakistani army soldiers and Afghan
mercenaries and carried out massive ground and air attacks for 11
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were diffused after Pakistan asked the fighters to pull
back. Islamabad said the infiltrators were Kashmiri rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the army seized 230 pounds of a demolition
explosive in Kashmir in what was considered to be the biggest haul
of RDX in the past two years, Press Trust of India news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   RDX -- so powerful that two pounds of it can blow up an aircraft
-- is often used by Islamic guerrillas fighting Indian security
forces in Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Report: Air Force To Charge Officer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Air Force will charge an officer with
dereliction of duty and will reprimand five others for their parts
in the death of a suburban Cincinnati recruit during a training
exercise, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Airman Micah J. Schindler, 18, collapsed Sept. 10 after a
5.8-mile march during recruit training at Lackland Air Force Base
in San Antonio, Texas. He died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force general in charge of training at the base and six
other officers flew to Cincinnati on Friday to deliver their final
case report to Schindler's parents, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler's father, Michael Schindler, said he is upset no
criminal charges will be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe the people have been held accountable to the
degree they should be,'' he said. ''Now I feel they didn't and
don't care about Micah.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force considers its charges in the case ''nonjudicial
punishments.''
</P>
<P>
   A noncommissioned officer will be charged with dereliction of
duty for failing to properly assess Schindler's condition after he
vomited during a dinner break less than an hour before he
collapsed, Air Force officials said. The maximum punishment
includes reduction in rank and 30 days in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers and three noncommissioned officers will get letters
of reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force wouldn't release the names of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case last week, a Marine captain based a Camp
LeJeune, N.C., was given a reprimand and fined for his role in the
July 7 death of a reservist during a training hike.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Victor Arana, 28, of Chicago was found guilty of
dereliction of duty and failure to obey an order. He was leading

Cpl. Giuseppe ''Joey'' Leto, 21, of New Milford, Conn., collapsed
and died.

<HEADLINE> SC Flag Removal Faces Uphill Fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A proposal that would remove the
Confederate flag from South Carolina's Statehouse dome faces an
uphill battle in the state House, where most black lawmakers say
they will vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24 of the 26 black members of the House feel that the
bill passed by the Senate on Thursday doesn't go far enough, said
House Minority Leader Gilda Cobb-Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would take the flag off the dome and out of the House
and Senate chambers, but place a similar flag behind the
Confederate Soldier Monument on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It left a bad taste, and our job is to take that away so it's
more acceptable to people like me,'' said Cobb-Hunter, who is
black.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been very clear with the Senate side that we were not
going to support a flag on Main Street,'' said Rep. John L. Scott
Jr., a former chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, referring
to the Confederate monument's location where Main Street runs into
the Statehouse complex.
</P>
<P>
   The flag debate had long focused on the Democrat-controlled
Senate, where all seven black senators supported the bill that
passed 36-7.
</P>
<P>
   The House is controlled by Republicans, 64 to the Democrats' 59,
with one vacancy. A number of the Republicans oppose removal of the
flag. But House Republicans and black lawmakers joined to pass a
bill creating a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The vote was 82-35,
with the majority including 30 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many black lawmakers say that coalition appears unlikely on the
flag bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan also is opposed by the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, which is leading a tourism and
business boycott of South Carolina over the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
   One of few black House members who supports the Senate bill is
Rep. Brenda Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senators have worked on this for months and saw it as the best
vehicle to bring the flag down. That's how I feel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that flies the Confederate flag
above its Statehouse. Opponents say it is a racist symbol, while
supporters say it represents Southern heritage and honors
Confederate war dead. Only the Legislature can take down the flag,
which has flown since 1962.

<HEADLINE> Albright in Kazakstan for Talks  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASTANA, Kazakstan (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
reached agreement with the president of this central Asian nation
on a wide range of topics Saturday, including a pledge from the
Kazak leader to tighten weapons exports.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result of our expanded discussion, it is evident that we
have a multifaceted relationship that deals with many areas of
common interest,'' Albright said after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two touched on one subject that clearly irritated President
Nursultan Nazarbayev -- the handling of the case of officials who
sold 40 Soviet-built MiG-21 jet fighters to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officials, the Kazak military chief of staff, was
acquitted of abuse of office in connection with the case, while a
presidential adviser was convicted of smuggling but immediately
given amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, the defense minister and the national security
chief, resigned when the sale was reported last August, but were
later reappointed to lower-level posts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the trial results nor the reappointments pleased
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously had a discussion and I did in fact express our
surprise and disappointment about the outcome of the trial and the
transfer of the two people discussed,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev angrily defended reappointing the two officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were demoted to lower-level jobs and that was their
punishment,'' Nazarbayev said. ''I don't think it's the
responsibility of the U.S. secretary of state to decide who should
be appointed to what position in southern Kazakstan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kazakstan, a country of 16 million people, has taken
measures to tighten export controls to prevent such arms deals in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was pleased that Kazakstan had agreed to lift a cap on
oil exports, imposed last year by the government to keep oil at
home after Kazak and foreign oil companies sold mostly on foreign
markets for higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pleased with the decision to eliminate the cap on oil
exports,'' Albright said. ''We view it as a signal of Kazakstan's
intention to improve the climate of both foreign and domestic
investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright announced a number of U.S.-funded initiatives designed
to support democracy and human rights in Kazakstan. They include
Internet access and training, support for independent media, civics
education for Kazak youth and support for public organizations.
</P>
<P>
   She also unveiled a plan to combat terrorism, including the
strengthening of coordination by security policy makers, and
exchange of information among experts in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbayev and leaders of other Central Asian nations have
claimed they need to maintain a tight grip on power because of the
danger of Islamic extremism spilling over into their regions. Such
fears have been stoked by the radical Taliban movement taking over
most of Afghanistan, which borders on the former Soviet republics
of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Kazak authorities said last fall they had to battle Islamic
militants in the south of the country, while Uzbekistan had a
series of bombings in February that were blamed on opposition
Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, several hundred Islamic fighters raided Kyrgyzstan,
engaging government troops and holding a dozen hostages for more
than two months.
</P>
<P>
   It was Albright's first visit to Central Asia in more than three
years in office. Following her talks with Nazarbayev, Albright was
expected to meet with the leaders of nongovernment organizations.
She planned to go to Kyrgyzstan on Sunday and visit Uzbekistan on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright on Friday visited Ukraine, where she urged officials to
set a definite date for the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Mourn Revered Saint  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Millions of Iranians, many beating
themselves with bare hands or iron chains, took to the streets
Saturday to mark the anniversary of the death of one of Shiite
Islam's most revered saints.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Tehran, large processions of men dressed in
black marched down the city's main streets. They beat themselves in
rhythm in a show of sorrow at the death of Hussein, the grandson of
Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion, known as Ashoura, is also observed every year in
Shiite communities in other countries, including Lebanon, Bahrain,
Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, whose 62 million people are predominantly Shiite, men
trudged over blood from slaughtered cows and sheep. Women, who do
not take part in the self-flagellation in public, wept and watched
the processions.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was killed in a battle on the plains of Karbala near the
Euphrates River in 680. The Karbala battle, part of a dispute over
leadership of the faith that began after Mohammed's death, was a
key event in Islam's split into the Sunni and minority Shiite
branches.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiites favored the prophet's son-in-law, Ali, and Ali's
son, Hussein, as Mohammed's successors, but both were slain in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's martyrdom -- recounted through a rich body of prose,
poetry and song -- remains a powerful example of sacrifice to many
Shiites, who make up about 10 percent of the world's estimated 1
billion Muslims. Clay from Karbala is stamped into little cakes
used by Shiites to rest the forehead in prostration during prayer.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, actors wearing armor re-enacted the Karbala battle.
Performers on horseback portraying Hussein and his companions were
dressed in green and white, the colors of Islam. Actors playing the
enemy wore red.
</P>
<P>
   Loudspeakers in the main streets blared religious songs
eulogizing Hussein and his followers. Many restaurants gave away
food.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners was Amir Feizollahzadeh, a high school
student, who was beating his shoulders with chains.
</P>
<P>
   ''I attend the mourning ceremonies because I love Imam Hussein.
He sacrificed his blood to teach us not to give in to corruption
and coercion, but to seek honor and justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another mourner, Shah Mirza Ojaghi, said he was cured of back
pain during Ashoura more than 20 years ago and has since
slaughtered a cow every year to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back in 1978, I had a severe back pain. Doctors said they
could not treat me,'' he said. ''On the night of Ashoura, I slept
in the place of mourning for Imam Hussein. I appealed to Hussein. I
said, 'kill me or cure me.' The next day, I joined the mourners,
walking as if I never had pain.'' He wept quietly as he recounted
the story.

<HEADLINE> Stocks sell-off spooks consumers, may help cool down robusteconomy  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street's sharp sell-off has wiped out
billions of dollars in mutual funds and brokerage accounts,
spooking American investors who say they're starting to rein in
their spending.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the prescription to cool the economy and put curbs
on inflation -- something the Federal Reserve has been trying to
achieve through interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could help push the country toward a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people out there now saying, 'Oops, I don't
have as much money today as I did last week,''' said Kathleen
Stephansen, senior economist with the investment firm Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ''If they then go on and change how they spend,
that could really slow this economy down.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy has been expanding for a record 109 consecutive
months, and it is showing few signs of leveling off. Fed
policy-makers, concerned that too-rapid economic growth could spark
inflation, have raised interest rates five times since June, but
their efforts have done little to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The economic slowdown they're seeking could be hitting now,
thanks to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have plunged on Wall Street in recent weeks -- losing
almost $2 trillion in value last week alone --because of growing
concerns about inflation and interest rates as well as investors'
increasing disillusionment with high-technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the worries as the new trading week begins is whether
there will be additional fallout from the heavy borrowing by
traders to buy stock as the market's bull ran stampeded through the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As the sell-off took hold in the past month, many who bought
stocks with borrowed money were forced to sell shares to meet
collateral requirements for so-called margin debt. Those traders
couldn't always find buyers for some of the more speculative issues
and had to sell shares of more established stocks to meet margin
calls from the brokers holding the loans.
</P>
<P>
   That selling helped lead to record declines in major market
indexes Friday. The Nasdaq composite index was down 34 percent from
its all-time high reached March 10, and the Dow Jones industrial
average is 10 percent below the peak it reached in January.
</P>
<P>
   That has some Americans -- many of whom have enjoyed greater
wealth thanks to the long bull market -- worrying that the boom
times are coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some people are saying they will hold off on purchases
of expensive goods, such as cars and electronics, and scale back on
pricey pampering services, such as facials and massages.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agent Wayne Hawkins, 61, of Texarkana, Texas, put much of
his money into stocks and now is bracing for what Monday will
bring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm greatly concerned,'' Hawkins said. ''We were buying a new
motor home ... and now we're putting it on hold for a few weeks
until we see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists will be watching to see if consumers like Hawkins
just cut back on the extras or start changing their buying habits.
With consumer spending accounting for about two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity, a sharp curb in spending could lead to
a recession.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't likely, however, that stores will empty out anytime
soon. The overall economy remains strong, and that should keep
people feeling good about their financial well-being at least for
the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, there is a plentiful labor market, and the
unemployment rate remains at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, I don't think that stock market volatility is
affecting everyday spending. That is determined a lot more by your
paycheck and your job confidence, and the good news is that most
people are satisfied with their jobs right now,'' said Gary Thayer,
chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to keep focus on the fundamentals, and the
fundamentals of our economy are sound; we will continue to do well
over time as long as we keep our eyes on the ball,'' Vice President
Al Gore said Saturday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Dukes, who works for Mississippi's economic development
department, was unfazed by the market downturn as he took some time
out from a conference to visit Wall Street on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   From his point of view, only those investors who speculated on
risky new Internet companies will be hurt by Wall Street's wild
ride.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're investors, not crap shooters,'' Dukes said.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate question for the stock market is what plans the
Federal Reserve has for interest rates. The central bank's
policy-makers meet next month to decide whether to again push rates
higher.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy is bound to slow, whether it is investors or the
Fed that reins it in.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wants a meltdown, especially the Fed, but they'd like
some cooling off,'' Stephansen said.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Donates Kidney to Student  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Fifteen-year-old Michael Carter had a
new kidney Saturday, thanks not to a close relative but to his
science teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Jane Smith, a teacher at R. Max Abbott Middle School
in Fayetteville, were both in fair condition Saturday, said
officials at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, where the transplant
took place Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we believe anyone donating an organ to benefit
another person is an exceptional human being, the fact that a
teacher would be so moved to offer her student such a gift is
phenomenal,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Fair, chief of the abdominal
transplant program at UNC.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said Smith could return home Monday, while
Michael likely will remain in the hospital until Wednesday or
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael had one kidney that failed to grow and another that
functioned only minimally. He began four-hour dialysis treatments
three times a week in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen of Michael's relatives and friends were tested as
potential kidney donors but were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Then last August, Ms. Smith told Carter to pull up his baggy
jeans at recess. He explained that his loose-fitting pants were
more comfortable because he was undergoing dialysis and was waiting
for a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked at him and said 'I've got two, do you want one?'''
Ms. Smith said later. ''He said 'What's your blood type?'''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of tests, Smith was found to be a good match.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery had to be postponed twice when Michael developed
infections.

<P>
   SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton
reassured Americans about the economy after Wall Street's sharp
plunge, saying Saturday that ''I still think we're going to have a
very good year'' with modest inflation and strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the investment climate and markets ''will
take care of themselves. I think that they'll go up and they'll go
down but I think long-term trends are quite positive.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with reporters briefly after setting aside 388,000
acres of land to protect giant sequoia trees.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, stocks plummeted in heavy trading as inflation
jitters helped push the Dow industrials down a record 616 points.
The Nasdaq composite index also took a record fall of 355 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody that invests their money will tend to look at what
it is likely to look like over the year,'' the president said.
''All I can do is try to keep the economy strong and that's what
I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the projected inflation rate for the year ''is still
quite modest and the projected growth rate for the year is still
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we stay with our economic policy and the American people's
productivity continues to increase, as it is going to, I still
think we're going to have a very good year.''

<HEADLINE> Women Adjusting to VMI  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Erin Claunch is proof that women can do
what men can do -- sometimes even better.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after she and a handful of other women broke gender
barriers at Virginia Military Institute, Claunch has risen to
battalion commander -- the second-highest student military post.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to blend in and be a good cadet,'' said Claunch,
20, who will lead half of the 1,200-member cadet corps during her
senior year this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The assimilation of women, who first enrolled at VMI in 1997
after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the school's all-male policy
unconstitutional, appears to be going smoothly. Last month, a
federal judge said he's inclined to close the 10-year-old case that
forced VMI to admit women.
</P>
<P>
   On her way up the ranks, the 5-foot-4, 125-pound Claunch even
outperformed men on the school's stringent physical fitness
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a day goes by that you don't read something about how
there should be changes in certain standards for men and women,''
VMI Superintendent Josiah Bunting III said. ''But this young woman
and the others in her class said, 'Judge us as cadets and recognize
us if we achieve on your system.' And she has.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement between VMI and the U.S. Justice Department,
the school would file more extensive reports on its transition to
coeducation through May 2001, after which U.S. District Judge
Jackson Kiser would dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 53 women among the 1,200 cadets at VMI -- less
than 5 percent of the student body. All four of the school's
classes will be co-educational for the first time this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ebony McElroy, of San Diego, Calif., who entered VMI with
Claunch, said she was surprised a woman climbed the ranks so
quickly. But she wasn't surprised it was Claunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's an all-around nice person, who's not opposed to helping
out if anybody needs it,'' McElroy said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few problems, including instances in which
male and female cadets were caught in compromising situations. And
in 1997, VMI's highest ranking cadet, Jerry B. Webb II of Casper,
Wyo., was expelled after being accused of demanding sex from three
female cadets.
</P>
<P>
   Claunch said she's never experienced sexual harassment or
discrimination, but admits rumors of the torturous first year at
VMI made her nervous.
</P>
<P>
   VMI freshmen endure a harsh system of discipline to test their
physical, mental and emotional limits. Every year, several freshmen
cadets leave VMI. Six of the 29 women who enrolled with Claunch
quit during their first year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard, but I was motivated the entire time because I
knew it would be over soon,'' Claunch said.
</P>
<P>
   Claunch plans to use her new leadership post to help women
improve their performance on physical fitness tests by organizing
early morning workout groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than a quarter of women who took the fitness test this
year passed compare to about 85 percent of the male cadets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Claunch is very intelligent and has demonstrated her
leadership potential,'' said Derek Bogdon, 21, of Rochester, N.Y.,
the other new battalion commander. ''She's well deserving of the
position. It doesn't matter that she's a woman.''

<HEADLINE> Cosby 'Dad' Remains Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Earle Hyman, who played Bill Cosby's father on
''The Cosby Show,'' remained hospitalized Saturday, one day after
he collapsed on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, 73, was acting in Edward Albee's ''The Play About the
Baby,'' when he fell to the floor about 10 minutes into the
performance Friday night. He maintained consciousness, said Paul
Tetreault, the theater's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   The actor was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital and was in good
condition Saturday. He was to undergo tests, a hospital spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tetreault said Hyman had not reported feeling ill during
rehearsals or before the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's audience included about 40 physicians. When a
request was made for a doctor in the house, four immediately came
on stage, where Albee joined them, Tetreault said. The performance
was canceled.

<HEADLINE> Wrong Castle on Prince's Stamp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY, Channel Islands (AP) -- Postal chiefs were red-faced
Saturday after admitting they put the wrong Welsh castle on their
stamp commemorating Prince William's 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp, one of four to be issued by Jersey Post, was supposed
to show Caernarfon Castle in north Wales, where Prince Charles'
investiture as Prince of Wales was held. The graphic designer
mistakenly used an illustration of nearby Beaumaris Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are obviously embarrassed because our publicity material
says the stamp shows Caernarfon Castle, '' said Adress Valentine,
philatelic manager for Jersey Post.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Post, which is due to issue the stamp June 21, received
numerous calls from Wales after a publicity photo appeared in the
local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes 18 months to produce these stamps so we are going
ahead with our plans,'' Valentine added.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps also show the prince skiing and playing polo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell on Saturday
opened a model U.N. summit for more than 100 students from across
Europe who will spend the next two days debating global issues.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as Ginger Spice, Halliwell told about 120 teen-agers
that they could change the world. Halliwell is a Goodwill
Ambassador for the U.N. Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your minds are sharp and objective. You don't have cynical
attitudes,'' Halliwell told students at the Model United Nations
Millennium Summit in London. ''All of you have the power to inspire
or even change the world, and I mean that.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summit, the students will debate poverty
reduction, education, AIDS, crime and drug abuse and violence,
including the use of children in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the two-day conference, the teens will produce a
declaration setting out what U.N. action they would like to see in
the new century. The declaration will be presented to the United
Nations in September. Halliwell urged the teens to consider asking
for a permanent representative to the global body.

   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Rapper Chuck D says hip-hop should be seen
as more than just music.
</P>
<P>
   The member of the group Public Enemy described it as a social,
political and artistic movement that bridges race, social class and
age.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hip-hop is cultural exchange. It's drawing people together
while other things in society are trying to separate people,'' he
said Friday at a hip-hop conference held at the University of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper encouraged those at the three-day conference to use
the ''wild, wild Web'' to form a grassroots movement for their
music and bypass what he calls the profit-driven corporate musical
industry.

<HEADLINE> Miller Revives Old Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Playwright Arthur Miller's first Broadway
production, ''The Man Who Had All the Luck,'' was so poorly
received it closed after just four performances.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1944, when the famed author of such classics as
''The Crucible'' and ''Death of a Salesman'' was 29.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Man Who Had All the Luck'' hasn't been seen in America
since -- until now.
</P>
<P>
   The former resident director of Broadway's ''The Lion King'' is
reviving the early work for a limited run at Los Angeles' Ivy
Substation theater.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Fields said he's long been drawn to the play, a fable about
a young man who has the unlucky fortune of getting everything his
heart desires.
</P>
<P>
   ''The power of Miller's young voice astounded me,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Miller, the playwright said he was won over by Fields'
passion for the play, set to run from Saturday night through May
21.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seemed to know what the play was meant to accomplish,''
Miller said. ''Enthusiasm deserves reward.''

<HEADLINE> 300 rally outside quiet Statehouse to defend abortion rights, backcandidates  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- About 300 activists fearing a threat to
abortion rights marched downtown here Saturday and staged a
cheerful Statehouse rally despite a continuous drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Statehouse was locked and closed as usual on
weekends, the rally nevertheless carried political weight as
Democratic candidates for seats in Congress walked with or spoke to
the group to advance their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The two men competing for the Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senate, Jon Corzine and former Gov. Jim Florio, gave brief speeches
beneath a canopy as activists listened, cheered, chanted and
huddled under dripping umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's campaign had promoted his appearance; Corzine's kept
his quiet. Most in the crowd showed no real preference for either,
pleased that both firmly opposed restrictions on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The political heat turned up for Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass
Levin, a longtime Democratic activist on the New Jersey political
scene who is challenging an anti-abortion congressman in southern
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   After toying with various possible races over the years, Bass
Levin finally pulled the trigger last week when she filed to run
against U.S. Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, in the 3rd district,
which covers parts of Camden, Burlington and Ocean counties.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Levin has said a key to her campaign will be to target
Saxton for his abortion views, and she tapped into that tactic
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent speaks proudly of the fact that for 25 years, he
has voted to deny us our right to choose,'' Bass Levin said to a
wave of booing. ''We must make the difference. We must do it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW New Jersey president Elizabeth Volz said, ''This woman has
the fight, she has the energy, she has the money. Let's get him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Maryanne Connelly also spoke to build support in her
Democratic primary in the 7th district, where she is vying with
seven others to replace U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights.
Franks is stepping down to run for U.S. Senate, but neither he nor
most of the Republicans running to replace him in the northern New
Jersey district are known for opposing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Female ralliers young and old said they feel abortion rights are
under constant threat.
</P>
<P>
   D.D. Ables, 79, of Basking Ridge, said she recalls the years
before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down abortion bans in 1973.
''It was done, and it certainly improved a lot once we got legal.
And it certainly improved a lot once we got free access to Planned
Parenthood clinics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very firmly that people should have a right to choose
whether to have a baby or not. I prefer that they not have an
abortion,'' Able said. But, she added, ''We have got to show our
support for people who really want to stand up for legislation that
will keep the right available for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dillon, 20, of Elizabeth said she opposes laws to restrict
abortion access for teen-agers, adding that for many a requirement
to notify parents before an abortion is the same as an outright ban
on the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes it harder because kids have other things to deal with
other than fearing their parents because they're pregnant,'' Dillon
said. ''It is really putting risks on teen-age girls who are
pregnant because of rape or incest or because they were careless or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ani Desilets, 23, of Roselle, said activism and rallies are
important ''as long as we have conservative men and right-wing
Christians in power.''

<HEADLINE> Corzine tops $10 million in spending on Senate primary  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- How much does a seat in the U.S. Senate cost?
For New Jersey millionaire Jon S. Corzine, the price tag has
already topped $10 million, just in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of Goldman Sachs reported Saturday that he
spent more than $6.6 million in the first three months of 2000, the
vast majority from his own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the $3.2 million he spent in the final half of 1999,
plus a smaller amount before that, and Corzine is on pace to spend
a record amount in a Senate primary.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey primary is June 6. Corzine is spending at least
$1 million a week on advertising in the 12 weeks leading up to
primary day, which means he could easily top $20 million in
spending just during the primary.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent for the Democratic nomination, former Gov. Jim
Florio, reported spending $346,000 in the first three months of
2000. Added to his prior spending of $573,000, he is still under $1
million in expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns on Saturday provided summaries of financial
reports that had to be in the mail by day's end to the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, worth an estimated $300 million, has not said how much
of his own money he is willing to spend on race for Senate. He has
thus far loaned his campaign about $8 million from his own pockets.
At this pace of personal spending, Corzine is approaching levels
never seen outside California.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Checchi spent nearly $39 million in losing his
party's 1998 primary for California governor.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Michael Huffington spent $30 million in California's
1994 Senate race, only to lose to Democrat Dianne Feinstein. Like
Corzine, he had a contested primary; unlike Corzine, Huffington
spent well under $10 million on the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., paid for his successful 1998
campaign largely with $11 million in loans he guaranteed against
his personal fortune. About $7 million of that was spent to win the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Though bankrolling his campaign mostly from his own wealth,
Corzine is also raising funds from others. His campaign said
Corzine raised about $905,000 in the first three months of 2000 and
$2.3 million overall since entering the race. He had about $557,000
on hand as of March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Florio raised $302,000 in the first three months of 2000 and had
$961,000 on hand on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has made an issue of Corzine's wealth, saying it
threatens ''to make this not a primary contest but an auction.''
</P>
<P>
   But a recent Qunnipiac College poll found that most Democratic
voters are not turned off by either Corzine's wealth or his
willingness to use it for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, the people of New Jersey will care more about the
billions that Jim Florio has taken out of their pockets than the
millions Jon Corzine has taken out of his,'' said Steven Goldstein,
one of Corzine's two campaign managers.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the $2.8 billion tax increase Florio enacted
as governor, which led to his ouster after one term. Corzine said
earlier in the campaign that he would not attack Florio for the tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Florio spokesman Jim Lanard responded, ''Jim Florio has
committed his career to fighting for children, working families and
seniors.''

<HEADLINE> Software Glitch at H&AMP;R Block  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- An error in an electronic tax-filing
program that misread intervals of $1,000 as intervals of $1 has
left some H&AMP;R Block customers owing money to the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block has told about 3,000 of its income tax customers that
because of the error, they didn't pay enough money to the IRS and
they will have to send a check, a company spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem affects only customers who owed more than $1,000,
filed returns electronically on the company's Tax Cut software or
online and had authorized the IRS to take the payments directly out
of their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The program misread the comma in amounts of $1,000 or more owed
as the end of the line, meaning $1,000 was read as $1.
</P>
<P>
   Affected taxpayers were notified by overnight letter and e-mail
Friday that they would have to use regular mail to send their
payments to the IRS, said Neil Getzlow, a spokesman for the Kansas
City-based company. He said the software problem had been
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are working with the IRS to ensure that they will not face
any penalties,'' Getzlow said. ''In the unlikely event that
happens, H&AMP;R Block will take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS said affected taxpayers should include the letter from
Block when mailing their payments.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 million people use the company or its software to
prepare their tax returns.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Bids 'Impossible'  </HEADLINE>
By AARON FAVILA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) -- It is impossible to meet the demands
of Philippine rebels who want to trade hostages for Arab terrorists
jailed in the United States, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What kind of a demand is this?'' Mercado asked. ''We can't
even consider them.'' He said negotiators should continue trying to
convince the Muslim extremists to free the 29 people they were
holding at a jungle base in Basilan, about 545 miles south of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Joseph Estrada, the Abu Sayyaf group
listed Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the
World Trade Center in New York, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman,
imprisoned for conspiring to blow up New York City landmarks, among
those they wanted freed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Franklin Drilon said the rebel demand was ''out
of this world'' and urged the government to reject it outright.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels seized more than 50 people from two schools in
Basilan province after attacking an army outpost on March 20. They
were still holding 31 last week. But they freed two children Friday
after Robin Padilla, a popular movie actor helping negotiate the
hostages' release, visited their stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla met relatives of the remaining hostages Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry, I was not able to free all,'' Padilla told the
relatives waiting at a Catholic center in Basilan's capital,
Isabela.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two Muslim groups
fighting for an independent Islamic state in the southern
Philippines. The group has been blamed for numerous attacks on
Christians, including the abduction of foreign missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Saturday, officials raised a Philippine flag in a
major Muslim separatist camp captured after days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Brig. Gen. Emmanuel Teodosio said Camp Bilal, in Munai
town in southern Lanao del Norte province, fell Friday afternoon.
Up to 500 rebels fled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the camp, which began on April 8, left three
soldiers dead and 18 marines wounded. An undetermined number of
guerrillas were killed, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The camp belonged to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the
larger rebel group.

<HEADLINE> D'Alema's Market Investments Decried  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Responding to attacks from right-wing opponents,
Premier Massimo D'Alema defended his stock market investments and
noted that he recently took a loss, Italian newspapers reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   During the final hours of campaigning for regional elections,
D'Alema waved a March 31 bank statement in front of reporters on
Friday, the newspapers said. The statement showed that his market
investments had resulted in a loss of about $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is supposed to be my conflict of interest?'' D'Alema
asked. The exact nature of the investments was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Maurizio Gasparri of the right-wing National Alliance,
said he had asked magistrates to investigate to see if D'Alema's
investments constituted conflicts of interest for the government's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The political sparring comes ahead of regional elections Sunday
that could influence D'Alema's political future. Coming roughly a
year ahead of parliamentary elections, the outcome of balloting is
seen as a measure of support for D'Alema's center-left bloc and for
chief rival Silvio Berlusconi's conservative alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Within D'Alema's own coalition, there has been criticism of the
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be inopportune, make that highly inopportune, that a
minister uses information to his own personal advantage,'' said
Arturo Parisi, whose Democrats have been part of the coalition
infighting which has scarred D'Alema's government.
</P>
<P>
   A few ministers in the Cabinet also have stock investments,
Milan daily Il Corriere della Sera reported Saturday. A proposed
law prohibiting ministers and Cabinet undersecretaries from
investing in the stock market has been bogged down in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a day of reflection for some three-quarters of
Italy's population eligible to vote for presidents and assemblies
for 15 of the nation's 20 regions.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign barely touched on issues that fall under the domain
of regional officials, such as health and transportation services.
Instead the focus was on D'Alema, a former Communist who has been
running the country for a year and a half, and Berlusconi, the
media magnate who -- as he did when he launched his conservative
movement in the early 1990s -- has teamed up with former
neo-fascists and autonomy-seeking advocates of the affluent north.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi's economic empire includes Italy's biggest private TV
networks as well as publishing, real estate and advertising
interests. He has long been criticized for possible conflict of
interests between business and politics.

<HEADLINE> Ex-cop Convicted in Fastball Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A former police officer was convicted of
soliciting assault for giving a 10-year-old Little League pitcher
$2 to bean another youngster with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated only two hours Friday before convicting Shawn
Patrick Phillips of misdemeanor charges of corruption of minors and
solicitation to commit simple assault.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 28, a former part-time officer in East Penn Township
and Coaldale, faces up to three months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon County Detective Joseph Pampanin testified that Phillips
admitted asking the pitcher to hit a batter last May.
</P>
<P>
   The boy hit a 10-year-old in the leg, dropping him to the ground
and bruising him. Four days later Phillips gave the youngster $2
for the job, Pampanin said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips testified that he was only joking about beaning the
other player and that he gave the boy $2 for listening to his
pitching tips
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not detail a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was fired in December for unrelated reasons, said
Coaldale Police Chief Jim Strauss.

<HEADLINE> Money Leaders Try To Calm Investors  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world's leading financial officials,
hoping to calm jittery investors, projected an air of unity and
cooperation Saturday in the face of throngs of anti-globalization
protesters and one of the worst weeks in Wall Street history.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan held closed-door talks with America's rich allies to
review financial conditions in their respective countries and
compare ideas on ways to reform the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Summers' main message was that the fundamentals
of the U.S. economy remain strong despite a week which saw nearly
$2 trillion in wealth evaporate on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was spending the weekend in California
away from the demonstrations, also expressed confidence in the
strength of the U.S. economy, saying that financial markets ''go up
and they'll go down but I think long-term trends are positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The finance discussions were being held under extraordinarily
tight security as local police and federal authorities closed
dozens of city streets to keep demonstrators blocks away from the
Group of Seven finance meetings and the headquarters of the IMF and
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, operating under the umbrella group Mobilization
for Global Justice, have vowed to disrupt the opening sessions of
the IMF and World Bank on Sunday in a replay of their victory last
December when mass protests in Seattle resulted in the cancellation
of the opening session of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Washington police, trying to prevent that from happening, staged
an early morning raid on the old warehouse the demonstrators had
been using as their headquarters, closing it down for alleged fire
violations. Two arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   Finance officials from the Group of Seven countries were working
on a joint communique that they hoped would reassure nervous
investors that the world's richest countries planned to cooperate
closely on economic matters and currency exchange rates lest signs
of discord further roil financial markets when they open again on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the final G-7 joint statement expressed optimism that
prospects for the global economy continued to brighten and noted
that Japanese authorities had pledged to keep interest rates low as
long as needed to boost domestic demand, Dow Jones reported.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury statement said Summers and Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa had agreed to cooperate closely to ensure
''constructive and fruitful'' discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The world's two largest economies have frequently been at odds
in recent years with the United States expressing displeasure at
the widening trade gap between the two nations and Japan's
inability so far to mount a sustained economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Summers and Greenspan held a series of discussions with finance
officials from several countries in Summers' office before the
start of the afternoon G-7 talks, being held at the Blair House,
the government's official guest house across the street from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa told reporters that Summers told the Japanese
delegation that the plunge in American stock prices had not altered
the strong fundamentals of the U.S. economy, which is currently
enjoying the lowest unemployment rates in three decades and is in
the midst of the longest economic expansion in the country's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing a major package of reforms
of the IMF and World Bank in an effort to head off even more
radical changes being put forward by congressional critics of the
two institutions.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. proposals have drawn objections from other
countries. It was likely the G-7 nations would end up using vague
language pledging support of reforms while leaving the exact
details to be worked out in later meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF on Wednesday issued an economic forecast projecting that
the global economy should grow this year by a healthy 4.2 percent,
the best showing in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF warned that some of the biggest threats to that
forecast resided in the United States, in the form of America's
soaring trade deficit and the potential for a sharp fall in
America's high-flying stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries were dramatically underscored when both the Dow
Jones industrial average and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
index suffered record point losses on Friday, capping off a dismal
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq is now down 34 percent from its all-time high reached
on March 10, and the Dow Jones industrial average is 10 percent
below its peak reached in January.
</P>
<P>
   The big sell-offs on Friday were triggered by a
worse-than-expected report on inflation which raised fears that the
Federal Reserve, which has already boosted interest rates five
times in an effort to head off price pressures, may be forced to
act much more aggressively, raising the danger of pushing the
country into a recession.

<HEADLINE> FEC: Giuliani Leads Clinton in Funds  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Senate campaign is far
ahead of Hillary Rodham Clinton's in the fund-raising race, but
huge numbers of small checks are helping both campaigns get rich,
according to Federal Elections Commission filings released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign raised $7.36 million between Jan. 1 and
March 31, while Clinton raised $4.73 million, the campaigns
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns released estimates at the end of March reflecting
similar amounts, but the final figures for the quarter were issued
Saturday under an April 15 deadline from the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Giuliani raised $12 million and Clinton raised $8
million, bringing the mayor's total to over $19 million and
Clinton's to more than $12 million. With seven months left before
the election, the Senate race is easily on track to be the most
expensive in state history.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ''hard money'' donations from individual contributors
cannot exceed $2,000 per person. However, both campaigns are raking
in thousands of checks in much smaller amounts. Clinton received
55,000 donations averaging $82 each for the quarter, according to
her spokesman, Howard Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover Weiss, did not have
figures on individual contributors for the last three-month period,
but she said the $19 million was comprised of 250,000
contributions, which means an average of $76 per donation.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor ended the period with $9.1 million cash on hand, while
Clinton had $6.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Boy Poll Shows US Disapproval  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After a week of stalemate, a majority of
Americans disapprove of both the actions of Elian Gonzalez' Miami
family and the Clinton administration, according to a poll released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsweek poll found that 52 percent thought the family was
not cooperating enough with government and court efforts to resolve
the case of the 6-year-old boy. That is up from 41 percent a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Only 30 percent felt the family was cooperating enough in the
efforts to resolve the custody battle of the Cuban shipwreck
survivor, down from 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 752 adults was conducted on Thursday and Friday. It
has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the boy's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez defied the
government's demand that he take the boy to the airport for a
flight to Washington to be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Disapproval rose, too, for the federal government's efforts to
resolve the case.
</P>
<P>
   A majority -- 53 percent -- disapproved of the way the Clinton
administration and the Justice Department handled the case, up from
49 percent a week earlier. Only 28 percent approved, down from 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unchanged, however, was the majority view that the boy be
reunited with his father in Cuba. Fifty-three percent still
supported that view, while 30 percent said he should remain with
his relatives in Miami.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Senate campaign is way
ahead of Hillary Rodham Clinton's in the fund-raising arena, but
huge numbers of small checks are helping both campaigns get rich,
according to Federal Elections Commission filings made public
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign raised $7.36 million between Jan. 1 and
March 31 while Clinton's raised $4.73 million, the campaigns

</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss did not have
figures on individual contributors for the last three-month period,
but she said the $19 million total was comprised of 250,000
contributions overall, which comes out to about an average donation
of about $77.
</P>
<P>
   Glover Weiss did say, however, that 50,000 contributions poured
into the Giuliani campaign during the last two weeks of March.
</P>
<P>
   It was during that period that the mayor faced tremendous local
criticism for his response to the police killing of an unarmed
black man, Patrick Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns have engaged in extensive direct-mail
solicitations. Last year they each raised about half their money
out of state. Neither campaign could say how much money was raised
out of state for the past quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor ended the period with $9.1 million cash on hand while
Clinton had $6.6 million in cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   In expenses, Giuliani's campaign listed $5.6 million for the
three months while Clinton's listed $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Contributor lists bearing the names, addresses and occupations
of every donor will not be available until Monday, the campaigns
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns will also benefit from additional millions of
dollars in so-called ''soft money'' raised by their respective
parties. There is no cash limit on the amount that political
parties can collect for these unregulated donations. The parties
can then use the money as they see fit to help individual
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign also showed that it has $332,000 in unpaid
bills, while Giuliani's campaign listed $150,000 in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's pending obligations include $60,000 for air travel on
chartered planes.
</P>
<P>
   Glover Weiss reiterated complaints the Giuliani campaign has
made before that Clinton should be reimbursing the government more
for her fund-raising and campaign trips.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been paying for the cost of one first-class airfare
per trip rather than for the actual entire cost of the trip.
Wolfson said that's the standard legal reimbursement formula used
by presidents, vice presidents and first ladies when they campaign
for themselves or others while still in office.
</P>
<P>
   Glover Weiss acknowledged that Clinton is ''following the letter
of the law, but is it right?''

   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A day after a mysterious chain of deadly explosions
struck Kinshasa's international airport, at least 40 people have been reported
dead as Red Cross workers dig through the ruins in a desperate search for
survivors. Reports from Belgium, Congo's former colonial ruler, put the deaths
at between 40 and 50 -- including victims hit by debris up to several miles
away. Hospital officials said 216 were seriously injured. Explanations of what
caused the blasts Friday at Kinshasa's N'Djili international airport ranged from

Denktash gathered close to 44 percent of votes, while his main contender, Prime

<HEADLINE> Tons of bizarre trash plucked from N.J. beaches in annual cleanups  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. (AP) -- What do potato chip bags,
bullet casings, tampon applicators, false teeth, gasoline tanks, a
newspaper vending machine and a limbo pole have in common?
</P>
<P>
   All this and more was discarded and found its way onto New
Jersey's beaches. About 3,000 people participated in beach cleanups
Saturday, picking up an amazing array of disgusting detritus.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wouldn't believe the things we find each year,'' said
Cynthia Zipf, executive director of the Clean Ocean Action
environmental group, which sponsors the cleanups each year. ''We've
been doing this for 15 years; hopefully we won't have to keep doing
it for another 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an incessant drizzle, volunteers fanned out up and down
the coast from the Raritan bayshore to Cape May, picking up and
carrying away anything that didn't belong on the sand or in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Hook's Gateway National Recreation Area provided a
treasure trove of trash. Among the items recovered there were 4,102
snack food bags such as potato chip wrappers; 421 plastic tampon
applicators, which have earned the derogatory nickname ''New Jersey
beach whistles'' because children pick them up and mistake them for
toys, and a vast array of other plastic items.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers picked up a plastic kiddie pool, a limbo pole, a set
of false teeth, a plastic gasoline container, a light bulb, and a
soggy, blurry traffic ticket issued to a presumably irate motorist,
who then either threw it into the ocean or down a storm drain,
where it made its way to the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too bad we can't read the name,'' Zipf said. ''Wouldn't that
person love to know the ticket's come back to haunt them?''
</P>
<P>
   Other items collected by volunteers in various locations
included a bowling ball, bullet and shotgun casings, condoms,
underwear (not found near the condoms), a Frisbee, and Zipf's
favorite, a lace doily
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the three discarded fishing nets, numerous
six-pack plastic rings, balloons, bottle caps, aerosol cans, and a
Star-Ledger newspaper vending rack someone tossed onto the sand at
Monmouth Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Still haven't had enough? How 'bout a toilet seat, a bicycle
seat, a rubber mermaid? And to top it all off, one volunteer found
a Polaroid photo of someone's genitals.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Bus Crash Kills 30  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- An overcrowded bus toppled over early
Saturday, killing 30 people and injuring at least 50 in central
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were still rescuing people from the wreckage more
than seven hours after the 6 a.m. crash that happened just outside
Chimaltenango, a city about 60 miles west of Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was headed to the town of San Martin Jiotepeque when the
driver lost control while taking a curve through the mountainous
region in the state of Sacatepequez. Authorities said excess weight
caused the bus to flip over onto the side of the road. The legal
capacity of the bus was 60 passengers, but it was carrying 100 at
the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people, including the driver, were taken to the
National Hospital of Chimaltenango, but local authorities said the
hospital was not equipped to handle that many patients. At least 14
people remained in critical condition.

<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Rauf Denktash failed to capture a
majority of votes in the race for president of the self-declared
Turkish republic in northern Cyprus on Saturday, sending the
elections into a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash is fighting for re-election in the Turkish-run third of
the Mediterranean island a month before new talks with Greek
Cypriots in the south in an attempt to forge a solution to the
island's bitter and protracted division.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash garnered close to 44 percent of votes, while his main
contender, Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu, had 30 percent, according
to the Turkish Cypriot Higher Election Board.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash and Eroglu will face one another in the second round on
April 22, with two left-wing candidates -- Mehmet Ali Talat and
Mustafa Akinci -- acting as power brokers. Talat and Akinci together
took 22 percent of the votes Saturday. Another four percent went to
three other left-wing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people placed their trust in me again. I will be stronger
to fight for the (Turkish Cypriot) cause on May 23,'' Denktash told
his supporters speaking from the balcony of the presidential
palace, referring to the new talks.
</P>
<P>
   The impending negotiations, the third round of U.N.-mediated
talks to be held in New York, were expected to boost support for
Denktash's campaign as he heads into the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had it been at another time, it wouldn't have been so
important to choose Denktash. But he must finish this peace deal,''
said 25-year-old Gurhum Umut, who said he was voting for the first
time because he was worried that Denktash would need every vote.
</P>
<P>
   But some voters were skeptical that Denktash could achieve peace
after so many years of animosity with Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Denktash hasn't solved the issue in decades. You think he will
now?'' said Mevlut Haci Mevlut, an Eroglu supporter.
</P>
<P>
   After polls closed, a preliminary tally showed that 76 percent
of the electorate voted.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash, 75, established the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus in 1983 and is leader of his community of 200,000. His
self-declared state is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains
some 30,000 troops on the island.
</P>
<P>
   However, he faced a strong challenge from Eroglu, who has built
support through his role as prime minister and the distribution of
social assistance. Eroglu forced Denktash into a run-off in the
last election in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash had called on voters to cast their ballots for him,
saying ''let's not wait for a second round.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of peace has become more urgent because of the
European Union's membership talks with Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots
want a settlement to be reached soon so the two sides can enter the
EU simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into Turkish and Greek sections since
the 1974 Turkish invasion, which came in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Protestors Leave for Coke Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- With a nod to the civil rights activists before
them, a busload of demonstrators left Saturday for a five-day
journey to draw attention to their struggle with Coca-Cola, which
they accuse of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, called ''the ride for justice,'' will have its first
stop Sunday in Greensboro, N.C., the scene of lunch counter sit-in
demonstrations 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bus riders, flanked by their friends and family, loaded apples,
cookies, potato chips and even a few cans of Coke on the bus
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's Coke on this bus?'' asked Angela Graham, who lost her
job in February. ''Well, we haven't started the boycott yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. E. Randel Osburn, vice president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, led a prayer Saturday before the
bus left Atlanta, where Coke is based.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coke is really not the real thing unless it does the real
thing, which is justice,'' Osburn said. ''We feel about Coke the
way we feel about America; it is better than most companies but it
is still not what it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Other rallies are planned Monday at a Baptist church in
Richmond, Va., and Tuesday at the Capitol in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The trip ends Wednesday in Wilmington, Del., where the group
will attend Coke's annual shareholders meeting. They hope to press
the beverage maker to settle a racial discrimination lawsuit filed
by eight current and former employees. Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch
said the company had no comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that Coke's black workers have been denied
fair pay, promotions, raises and performance evaluations. Coke
denies the allegations. The company estimates that 27 percent of
its 28,000 U.S. employees are minorities, including 15 percent of
American managers.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs want a federal judge to certify the lawsuit as a
class action, which would include up to 2,000 Coke workers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Meadows, a former Coke consumer marketing researcher who
was laid off in February, said she hopes the bus ride makes Coke
aware of its treatment of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm hoping is that the company recognizes that there is a
problem,'' Meadows said. ''This suit and bus ride is about
affirmative action and protecting the rights that blacks have
fought for all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin McCain, one of the four North Carolina A&AMP;T University
students who sought to integrate the Woolworth lunch counter in
1960, said the Coke protesters face a far different environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no sign on the door saying 'colored' and 'white,'''
said McCain, 58, a retired sales executive. ''However, there are
still some signs in parts of our lives that make it difficult. It's
at a much higher level, a level that's not seen so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty years ago, those people couldn't have even worked for
Coke,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Protesters' Headquarters Raided  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police in dark raincoats closed the
headquarters of world finance protesters in a lightning raid
Saturday after authorities deployed for mass demonstrations
declared the building unsafe and ordered it evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Buses by the dozens rumbled into the capital and demonstrators
spilled out, intent on disrupting meetings Sunday and Monday of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund while pledging
nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters still holding their breakfast plates streamed out of
their headquarters, an old warehouse where they were making signs,
banners and puppets, and drifted 10 blocks away to another staging
center.
</P>
<P>
   There, they practiced hymns, street theater and passive
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will not deter us,''' said Molly McCarthy, 21, of
Seattle, a protest organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost our food, and our cooking supplies, and we've got
thousands of people to feed,'' said another organizer, Antonia
Jahasz, 29, of Washington. ''With one of the highest homicide rates
in the country, D.C.'s finest are guarding our dangerous puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they moved through the first headquarters, authorities
also found a plastic container with a rag stuffed inside to serve
as a wick, said Terry Gainer, executive assistant police chief.
</P>
<P>
   He said it ''looks like a Molotov cocktail.'' Police also found
soda bottles with the tops or bottoms cut off, Gainer said.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders said police had merely come across art supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''They found a plastic bottle that had rags in it that were
being used to get paint off of people's hands,'' said Adam
Eidinger, 26, of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after the raid, Police Chief Charles Ramsey said
police did not intend ''to violate anyone's First Amendment
rights'' and allowed some protesters to retrieve the puppets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect hell to break out'' during the protests,'' he
said. ''I expect a lot of people who want to express their
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a light rain, with police sirens sounding almost constantly
downtown, tourists who normally stroll to the gates of the White
House to snap pictures were held behind barriers across the street.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the largest closures in downtown Washington, police
closed some 50 individual blocks, barring everyone from getting
past metal barriers. Police clustered at every barricaded
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   A protest outside a Gap clothing store in the trendy Georgetown
neighborhood turned into an impromptu striptease when police took a
man wearing a grass skirt with nothing underneath into custody and
made him put on underwear.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a dozen or so other men and women in the crowd of
200 to strip down to their skivvies. They were protesting
sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey said he expected 10,000 or more protesters at the height
of the demonstrations. Police had arrested 20 people since protests
began a week ago, several for possessing blockade material such as
pipes used to link arms, and had confiscated an undisclosed amount
of ammunition in one raid.
</P>
<P>
   The major demonstrations were planned Sunday and Monday, when
financial ministers and central bank heads have their main meetings
scheduled. Protesters accuse the banks of destroying the
environment through dams and other such projects, allowing
sweatshops and imposing harsh debt-repayment programs that prevent
poor countries from spending on social programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''International corporations are making the countries that have
the poorest people even poorer,'' said David Rovics, 33, of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, police raided a house where they found an
undisclosed amount of small-caliber ammunition and firebomb
instructions, Gainer said. The raid also produced a large supply of
pipes and chicken wire used to make human blockades.
</P>
<P>
   After the warehouse was emptied Saturday, a line of officers in
blue fatigues stood guard to prevent protesters from re-entering.
Demonstrators shouted: ''More world, less bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the building was a fire hazard, with a jury-rigged
electrical system, chained doors and a propane stove that was not
up to code. ''We're simply concerned about their safety,'' Ramsey
said. Protesters said that was a pretext to throw them off stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's really just an escalation of tactics designed to
keep us from being able to express ourselves,'' said Han Shan of
Baltimore, from a group called Mobilization for Social Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were arrested for refusing to go along with the
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Most protesters were in their 20s or younger, many sporting dyed
hair and earrings. But graying veterans of the 1960s anti-war
movement also were sprinkled through the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 protesters began their day at dawn in a quiet, woodsy
Washington neighborhood where they sang a Haitian protest song in
low voices outside the home of World Bank President James
Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn came out on his way to work, and listened quietly as
Vineeta Gupta, an Indian physician, read part of a protest letter
signed by more than 400 people from 35 countries.

<HEADLINE> Putin Clarifies Start II Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will not immediately scrap any nuclear
ballistic missiles following the ratification of the START II
treaty, President Vladimir Putin said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty gives the United States and Russia until 2007 to
halve their nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,5000 warheads each. In the
interim, Russia will only decommission those missiles whose service
life has already expired, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, ratified START II on
Friday. Putin said even if the treaty had not been ratified,
Russia's heavy ballistic missiles would have to be decommissioned
by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ''The service life of these missiles expired and has been
extended,'' he said. Defense Ministry specialists advised that a
further extension would be ''inexpedient, dangerous and
unreasonable,'' Putin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said ''not a single missile, not a single charge will be
removed from duty until the expiration of the final guaranteed time
of their use.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments appeared to be aimed at the millions of Russians
who support the Communist Party. The Communists vehemently opposed
the treaty, saying it was a serious threat to Russia's national
security and would give the United States a major military
advantage.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ulster Leader Plans Split  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble plans to propose radical party reforms to freeze out
opponents of the province's Good Friday peace accord, The Sunday
Telegraph reported.
</P>
<P>
   The changes would prevent the Protestant Orange Order, Northern
Ireland's major Protestant fraternal group, from sending 120
delegates to the 860-member policy-making council of the Ulster
Unionists. That would end the Order's influence over party
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the mainly Protestant party was formed in 1905, it
has had strong ties with the Orange Order. Party leaders, including
Trimble, have often been members of both organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who narrowly survived a leadership challenge in March
from lawmaker Martin Smyth -- a senior Orange Order figure -- said
his proposals had been planned for months.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not something dreamed up in response'' to the
leadership vote, he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said he also wants to strip the anti-Good Friday accord
Young Unionists of their 34 seats at party meetings. He likely will
submit his proposals to the party's rules revision committee in
June, he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Unionist David Brewster, a leading critic of the peace accord,
said Trimble's plan could provoke serious party infighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''This move is a bit like a doctor faced with a patient who is
hemorrhaging and who decides to rip out the backbone. It is foolish
in the extreme,'' Brewster said.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant hard-liners have vowed to topple Trimble if he tries
to go back into government with Sinn Fein, the party linked to the
outlawed Irish Republican Army. Trimble did so before, but in
February, Britain suspended the fledgling power-sharing Cabinet --
the central objective of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord -- after
just 11 weeks in office.

<HEADLINE> At Least 40 Dead in Congo Explosion  </HEADLINE>
By KAMANGA MUTOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Red Cross workers dug through the ruins
of a collapsed hangar Saturday in a desperate search for survivors,
a day after a mysterious chain of deadly explosions struck
Kinshasa's international airport.
</P>
<P>
   Official radio put the death toll at 10. But reports from
Belgium, Congo's former colonial ruler, said between 40 and 50
people had been killed -- including victims hit by debris up to
several miles away. Hospital officials said 216 were seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll could rise much higher, with customs officials
saying more than 100 people could still be trapped in the hangar.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting explanations of what caused the blasts
Friday at Kinshasa's N'Djili international airport, ranging from a
short circuit to a soldier dropping ammunition while unloading a
plane full of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''First there was the big explosion. Then we saw rockets and
shells flying. People were running everywhere but the hangar
collapsed before many could get out,'' said Kalala Ngoy, a
42-year-old customs inspector. ''Soldiers were running. The bosses
were running. Poor people were running. We were all the same in the
face of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The government initially declined comment on the disaster, but
Saturday night Congolese Information Minister Didier Mumengi said
the government was setting up an investigative commission to look
into the cause of the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions occurred on the first full day of a new
cease-fire signed last week by the parties in Congo's 20-month
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   President Laurent Kabila toured the wreckage-strewn site
Saturday morning and was seen speaking with several victims'
families. Congolese state radio said about 10 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the jumbled remains of a hangar used by customs and tax
officials to handle incoming cargo from Europe, local Red Cross
workers used crowbars and shovels to dig for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers did not allow journalists to talk to the rescuers, and
it was unclear whether any victims were found alive. Limp bodies
were seen pulled from the twisted wreckage of steel and concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses were dragged to another hangar where four Red Cross
trucks waited to carry them off.
</P>
<P>
   Several customs officials feared more than 100 people -- both
officials and customers collecting cargo -- had been trapped inside.
A wall and ceiling of the hangar collapsed when a munitions depot
behind it exploded during the chain reaction of blasts.
</P>
<P>
   An airport postal facility also collapsed but it was uncertain
whether there were people inside at the time. Many other buildings
and several planes were also damaged. Practically the only building
left unscathed was the airport control tower.
</P>
<P>
   Family members swarmed onto the wreckage-strewn tarmac in hopes
of hearing news of loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Antoinette Kaku, a 20-year-old student, looked dazed as she
searched for her father, Mutombo Ngeleka, a baggage handler at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am losing hope. He always comes home straight after work but
since last night we have heard nothing. I must continue searching
until I find him,'' she said weakly.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind the blast remained murky.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese state-run radio reported that a short circuit sparked
a fire around noon Friday, triggering a series of explosions at the
munitions depot that shattered all the windows of the airport
terminal.
</P>
<P>
   An airport official, however, said the fire and explosions were
triggered by a soldier who dropped ammunition while unloading a
plane full of weapons. That explosion set fire to the fuel depot,
from which flames spread to the munitions depot, according to the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions, which lasted more than an hour, killed and
injured an undetermined number of people in surrounding
neighborhoods up to several miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Kisweko saw his older sister, 42-year-old Honorine
Malueka, get hit by a piece of flying metal as she went into her
small brick and cement home next to an open-air butcher market in
Massina -- some three miles from the airport. Mulueka died Friday
night. The shrapnel impact caved in a wall of the house,
overturning a bed and a table.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government must help us bury our sister,'' Kisweko said.
''She was a market seller and gave money to the family. We are too
poor even to buy her a casket.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released overnight, Belgium's Foreign Ministry
said at least 40 people were killed at the airport and many more
were injured. Other victims were found in a neighboring residential
area.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's private television station, RTL-TVI, however, quoted
officials in Brussels as saying about 50 people were dead and some
200 injured.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear if the explosions were related to Congo's
20-month civil war, which the government of President Laurent
Kabila has been fighting against several rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions set off a brief panic in Kinshasa, where people
living near the airport fled for the city center, fearing that
rebels might have reached the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was sealed off by soldiers and police. Airline
officials said all international flights over the weekend to and
from Kinshasa were canceled.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Leave for Coke Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- With a nod to the civil rights activists before
them, a busload of demonstrators left Saturday for a five-day
journey to draw attention to their struggle with Coca-Cola, which
they accuse of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, called ''the ride for justice,'' will have its first
stop Sunday in Greensboro, N.C., the scene of lunch counter sit-in
demonstrations 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bus riders, flanked by their friends and family, loaded apples,
cookies, potato chips and even a few cans of Coke on the bus
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's Coke on this bus?'' asked Angela Graham, who lost her
job in February. ''Well, we haven't started the boycott yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. E. Randel Osburn, vice president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, led a prayer Saturday before the
bus left Atlanta, where Coke is based.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coke is really not the real thing unless it does the real
thing, which is justice,'' Osburn said. ''We feel about Coke the
way we feel about America; it is better than most companies but it
is still not what it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Other rallies are planned Monday at a Baptist church in
Richmond, Va., and Tuesday at the Capitol in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The trip ends Wednesday in Wilmington, Del., where the group
will attend Coke's annual shareholders meeting. They hope to press
the beverage maker to settle a racial discrimination lawsuit filed
by eight current and former employees. Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch
said the company had no comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that Coke's black workers have been denied
fair pay, promotions, raises and performance evaluations. Coke
denies the allegations. The company estimates that 27 percent of
its 28,000 U.S. employees are minorities, including 15 percent of
American managers.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs want a federal judge to certify the lawsuit as a
class action, which would include up to 2,000 Coke workers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Meadows, a former Coke consumer marketing researcher who
was laid off in February, said she hopes the bus ride makes Coke
aware of its treatment of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm hoping is that the company recognizes that there is a
problem,'' Meadows said. ''This suit and bus ride is about
affirmative action and protecting the rights that blacks have
fought for all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin McCain, one of the four North Carolina A&AMP;T University
students who sought to integrate the Woolworth lunch counter in
1960, said the Coke protesters face a far different environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no sign on the door saying 'colored' and 'white,'''
said McCain, 58, a retired sales executive. ''However, there are
still some signs in parts of our lives that make it difficult. It's
at a much higher level, a level that's not seen so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty years ago, those people couldn't have even worked for
Coke,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> White House Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. (AP) -- What a difference a light
bulb makes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Saturday he has saved taxpayers big bucks
simply by switching to energy-efficient light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just by changing the lights in the White House, I cut the
power bills $100,000 a year,'' the president said. He said there
were additional savings from installing a new heating system and a
more fuel-efficient roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the changes we made in the White House were made in every
federal building ... we would reduce greenhouse gases so much it
would be the equivalent of taking 1.7 million cars a year off the
road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the actual White House savings are larger than Clinton
claimed. A report released last Dec. 2 identified savings of
$300,000 a year including $138,000 from more efficient lighting,
$37,000 from a new heating system and window air conditioner
upgrades and $15,000 from new sprinklers and timers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at a ceremony where he set aside 328,000 acres of
forests to protect giant sequoia trees. He leaned back to gaze up
at soaring sequoia along the Trail of One Hundred Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The president was accompanied on his tour by Eagle scout
Alexander Reed-Krase, who said he has hiked 1,000 miles in Sequoia
National Forest, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and Sequoia
Forest Superintendent Art Gaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chilly day with fresh snow on the ground. Clinton wore
a brown leather bomber jacket with a presidential seal but seemed
surprised by the cold. ''I'm going to have a hard time making the
case for global warming today but I'm going to try, anyway,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I could stay here all day,'' Clinton said. ''I'd get
warmer pants.'' He marveled that young Reed-Krase wore only a
short-sleeve shirt and wasn't disturbed by the cold. ''I was
thinking that growing older has some merit but one thing it doesn't
have is the ability to withstand cold better,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say that the 1990s were the hottest decade on
record, and that Americans must build a consensus to cut down on
emissions of greenhouse gases that many scientists blame for global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Midway in his speech, Clinton was talking about efforts to
preserve biodiversity. ''The last point I'd like to make is they
won't do much good ... if I get killed by this falling ice.'' That
got everybody's attention. It turned out that a clump of ice had
fallen by his lectern from a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending the afternoon in the forest, Clinton flew to
Palo Alto to play golf at Stanford Golf Course. His foursome
included Geoff Yang, a venture capitalist, Evan Thorney, CEO of
LookSmart.com, and Jack Thyme, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton was heading to Los Angeles for a $2.5 million
fund-raiser with Vice President Al Gore in Beverly Hills.

World Leaders Seek To Calm Investors
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world's leading financial officials, including
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
held closed-door talks with America's rich allies today to review financial
conditions in their respective countries. They hoped to calm jittery investors,
comparing ideas on ways to reform the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank. Officials said Summers' main message is that the fundamentals of the U.S.
economy remain strong despite a week which saw nearly $2 trillion in wealth
evaporate on Wall Street.

Rescue Efforts Continue in Congo
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Red Cross workers desperately searched for survivors
today, a day after a mysterious chain of explosions at a hangar at Kinshasa's
international airport reportedly killed between 40 and 50 people. Official radio
put the death toll at 10, but reports from Belgium said between 40 and 50 people
had been killed -- including victims hit by debris up to several miles away. The
death toll could rise much higher, with customs officials saying more than 100
people could still be trapped in the hangar. Explanations of what caused the
blasts Friday at Kinshasa's N'Djili international airport ranged from a short
circuit to a soldier's dropping ammunition while unloading a plane full of
weapons.

Protesters Pray Elian Will Stay
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- More than 250 people chanted and prayed outside the Little
Havana home where Elian Gonzalez has been living with his Miami relatives, and
fretted that this weekend might be his last there. In the afternoon, the crowd
began chanting that the boy's father is a coward and a traitor, and that he
should return to Cuba without his son. The 4{-month custody struggle was in the
hands of the federal appeals court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary
injunction Thursday blocking Elian from leaving the country. The Justice
Department also agreed that day to hold off on reuniting Elian with his father
for a few days.

S.C. Flag Removal Issue Not Over

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A proposal that would remove the Confederate flag from
South Carolina's Statehouse dome faces an uphill battle in the state House,
where most black lawmakers say they will vote against the bill. At least 24 of
the 26 black members of the House feel that the bill passed by the Senate on
Thursday doesn't go far enough, said House Minority Leader Gilda Cobb-Hunter.
The bill would take the flag off the dome and out of the House and Senate
chambers, but place a similar flag behind the Confederate Soldier Monument on
the Statehouse grounds.

Denktash is fighting for re-election in the Turkish-run third of the
Mediterranean island a month before new talks with Greek Cypriots in the south
in an attempt to forge a solution to the island's bitter and protracted
division. Denktash and his main rival, Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu, will face

taken to the streets respectfully, in peace, raising their voices, there would
already be a fraud consummated,'' Toledo told reporters. Fujimori slammed Toledo
for creating an atmosphere of social upheaval that he said could plunge Peru
back into the violence and economic disaster of the 1980s.

   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- An overcrowded bus toppled over in central Guatemala
early Saturday, killing 30 people and injuring at least 50 others. Authorities
were still rescuing people more than seven hours after the crash that happened
just outside Chimaltenango, a city about 60 miles west of Guatemala City. The
driver lost control while taking a curve through the mountainous region in the
state of Sacatepequez. The legal capacity of the bus was 60 passengers, but it

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Order in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton urged
Cuban-Americans on Saturday to support the rule of law in the 4{
month custody struggle over Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''When this thing finally plays out, in the end, the law has to
be obeyed,'' said Clinton, who supports reunion of the boy with his
father. The president spoke about the case briefly during a visit
to Sequoia National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reviewed the legal case with Attorney General Janet Reno
by telephone late Friday. ''I just told her that I strongly
supported her efforts that we clearly had to uphold the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''We have to let the court cases be decided. But I
think the main thing is -- I hope that all the people there who say
they came to the United States because we have freedom and the rule
of law will observe the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The president praised Reno's handling of the case, noting she
was a Florida prosecutor for 12 years. ''I think she'll handle it
in as sensitive but firm a way as possible.'' He said she ''has to
deal with the day-to-day details.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Atlanta issued a temporary injunction
Thursday blocking Elian from leaving the country. The Justice
Department also agreed that day to hold off on reuniting Elian with
his father for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the appeals court to suspend the injunction
and order the 6-year-old's great-uncle to hand him over. The
relatives want the court to let them meet with Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, without being required to let Elian go.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Wants Inmates Released  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- If Israel wants peaceful relations with
Lebanon, it must not only withdraw from the country's south but
also release all Lebanese held in Israeli jails, the leader of the
Hezbollah guerrillas said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel must also pay compensation for the loss of life and
damage that resulted from its occupation and settle the fate of
350,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah
said in a public speech.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah's demands indicated that Hezbollah, which has been
fighting Israel's forces in south Lebanon since 1982, is unwilling
to make peace once Israel pulls out in July as promised by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has never stated clearly whether it will continue its
campaign against Israel with cross-border attacks after Israeli
troops leave the south. Israel has warned Lebanon of harsh
retaliation if it comes under guerrilla attack after the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and the western Bekaa
is just one of the problems,'' Nasrallah said, addressing tens of
thousands of Hezbollah supporters in a southern suburb to
commemorate the martyrdom of Hussein, a revered Shiite Muslim
saint.
</P>
<P>
   Men dressed in black beat their chests as an expression of
sorrow and chador-clad women wailed. Hussein, the grandson of
Islam's Prophet Mohammed, was killed by rival Muslim forces in the
year 680 on the Karbala plain in modern-day Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Shiites elsewhere in Lebanon also marked the occasion, known as
Ashoura.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the demonstration in Nabatiyeh, Israeli guns shelled
the town's suburb of Kfar Roumman, wounding a 22-year-old man in
the head and legs, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman said Israeli and
allied militia returned fire after attacks on several of their
positions in southern Lebanon on Saturday. The spokesman declined
to be named.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Nasrallah also gave a warning to militiamen from
the South Lebanon Army, which has helped Israel control the
occupied zone. SLA members, seen as traitors, should retreat along
with the Israeli soldiers, turn themselves in to the Lebanese
judiciary, or ''perish in fighters' bullets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't leave with them (Israeli troops), we are coming
for you, not for peace, but with rifles,'' the black-turbaned
Nasrallah vowed.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Israel to release all Lebanese prisoners in Israeli
jails before withdrawing its troops, including Sheik Abdel Karim
Obeid and Mustafa Dirani, both senior officials affiliated with
Lebanese guerrilla groups battling Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has refused to grant Israel security guarantees unless
its withdrawal is part of a regional agreement involving Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Shuts Down Montreal Subway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Several thousand people were forced from the
city's subway system Saturday after a series of small explosions
shut down the entire underground line. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts Saturday morning in mid-Montreal knocked out the
transit system's communications board and killed contact with
subway train drivers, closing down all 65 of the city's subway
stations. Limited subway service was restored by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people ride the subway on Saturdays,
transit spokeswoman Odile Paradis said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people were temporarily evacuated from their homes
as authorities checked to see if yellow smoke billowing out of two
manholes was toxic. Power was also knocked out to several thousand
homes, and about 200 homes were still without electricity by
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   There were no problems getting the thousands of passengers off
the trains and out of the subway stations, Paradis said, and the
city put an extra 100 buses on the streets to deal with the
stranded passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The 7:45 a.m. explosion at Laurier station may have been caused
by an underground cable that was already damaged due a recent house
fire in the area, said Yves Boucher, a city spokesman. But one fire
official said a power surge might have been to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Regular service was expected by Monday, at the latest, Paradis
said.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Kill 12 in Northeast India  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Separatist guerrillas swooped down on a
village in remote northeast India Saturday, killing at least 12
people and seriously wounding seven others, Press Trust of India
news agency said. The attack was apparently linked to local
elections scheduled for later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 heavily armed rebels stormed Khas Kalyanpur, a village
in Tripura state, and set fire to several houses and shops. They
opened gunfire as the villagers came out of their homes and tried
to flee, the news agency quoted an army officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers also kidnapped three villagers after looting their
homes, United News of India news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists are apparently trying scare residents of the
village, 950 miles southeast of New Delhi, before elections later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack. But police blamed
the National Liberation Front of Tripura for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Separatist rebels have been fighting the government for decades
for a homeland for the people who are native to the area, and
conflicts have been frequent between locals and people who have
moved in from other regions of the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The locals say new settlers control the economy and force
cultural changes among its people. Much of the resentment is also
directed against the federal government, which is trying to crush
the uprising by deploying army and paramilitary soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urged on Peace Ideas  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- President Clinton asked Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to bring ideas to the table when they meet in
Washington later this week for discussions on the Mideast peace
process, a Palestinian official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not
elaborate on what kind of specific ideas Clinton was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has stepped up its involvement in talks
between Israel and the Palestinians in the face of looming
deadlines -- a peace treaty framework is supposed to concluded next
month, with a full accord by September.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, nearing the end of another
round of talks in Washington, have exchanged documents outlining
their views on a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem and
other thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Abed Rabbo, who is leading talks with Israelis at the
Bolling Air Force Base in Washington D.C., said Saturday that the
sides agreed verbally that the framework agreement should address
all the final status issues, which include Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlements in the territories and the borders of
a Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Abed Rabbo said there was concern among the
Palestinians that Israel would eventually agree to only a partial
settlement of these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Arafat on Friday to update him on a nearly
four-hour discussion the president had earlier this week with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Arafat is scheduled to meet with
Clinton at the White House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader said Israel has procrastinated in talks
on the terms of Palestinian statehood and has systematically
violated agreements while expanding Jewish settlements on lands
claimed by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat thanked the United States for increasing its role as
mediator in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''We demanded that the United States play a role in pushing the
peace process forward, and we thank President Clinton and the U.S.
administration for that role,'' Arafat said Saturday during an
appearance with visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat denied an Israel TV report that Barak has offered to
recognize a Palestinian state in 65 percent of the West Bank.
Arafat said no such offer was made.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians insist on an Israeli withdrawal from all the
West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel
in the 1967 Mideast war, Arafat said. The Palestinians hope to
build a state on the land.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of several interim agreements, the Palestinians
control about two-thirds of Gaza and 40 percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Poor Taxpayers Face More Audits  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- It used to be wealthy Americans who had
the most to fear from the Internal Revenue Service. But lately, the
nation's poorest taxpayers have faced a greater likelihood of being
audited, according to a report released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IRS' overall audit rate last year dropped to just
under 1 percent, the focus has shifted from the rich to the poor,
according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse, which analyzes government data.
</P>
<P>
   Among taxpayers making $100,000 or more, 1.15 percent were
audited in 1999, down from 1.66 a year earlier, TRAC reported. The
rate for those making $25,000 or less was 1.36 percent, up from
1.14 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, IRS auditors have focused on wealthier taxpayers
because they have more to hide from the government and better
opportunities for hiding it. In the early 1990s, taxpayers with
incomes of $100,000 or more were audited at about five times the
rate of those earning less than $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The data is accurate because we provided it to them,'' said
IRS spokesman Don Roberts. ''The interpretations, however, may not
be fully reflective of what additional data might show.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1988, the IRS was clamping down on tax shelter
cheaters so the audit rate for those with incomes over $100,000
jumped to 11.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the IRS received additional funding to reduce
noncompliance in the earned income tax credit program, or EITC, a
special tax benefit for low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a reason for more examinations, and it's not because
of their income levels. It is because of items they are claiming on
their returns,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, noncompliance in the EITC program involves confusion and
misunderstanding about the eligibility rules rather than deceit and
criminal intent, said Wayne Thomas, the IRS' deputy chief
operations officer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the same dependent may be claimed by two different
individuals, requiring the IRS to audit both returns to determine
who is entitled to the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the IRS has stepped up its examinations of
nonfilers, he said. Because their incomes are unknown, the
nonfilers are considered part of the lowest income classification.
</P>
<P>
   If the EITC and nonfiler cases are excluded, the audit rate for
low-income Americans is actually 0.17 percent, Thomas said. When
the same is done in the higher income bracket, the rate is 1.08
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see the pattern is pretty much what you would expect. The
rate is about seven or eight times greater for the more wealthy,''
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The revised overall audit rate for the more than 122.5 million
individual returns filed in 1999 would be 0.34 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if this is actually a new, kinder IRS. There are
a lot of dynamics involved here,'' said David Burnham, co-director
for TRAC.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC identified the substantial decline in the size of the IRS
staff as a factor in the changing audit practices. After a buildup
during the Reagan administration, years of budget cuts reduced IRS
staffing from a high of 123,198 employees in 1988 to 97,810 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more cynical explanation is that the IRS still has enough
significant legal and financial resources left at its disposal that
it is easier to go after a hundred low-income taxpayers that would
just as soon pay the bill than 10 high-income taxpayers with
attorneys,'' said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers
Union.
</P>
<P>
   As millions of Americans rush to beat the tax deadline Monday,
they can take consolation in knowing there have been dramatic
declines in the tax agency's three primary enforcement collection
practices: levy, lien and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking at 3.7 million levies in 1997, IRS agents issued
504,403 levies in 1999 -- an 86 percent drop. Levies are made
against the assets of delinquent taxpayers that are under the
control of a third party, such as bank accounts or wages.
</P>
<P>
   The number of seizures dropped from a yearly average of between
10,000 and 11,000 during the 1990s to only 161 seizures last year,
a 98 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in liens was more gradual. Liens, a legal claim
attached to property, peaked at 1.5 million in 1991 and 1992. By
last year, they dropped to 167,867, a fall of 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the plunge in levies and seizures was partly the
result of administrative changes required by the IRS Restructuring
and Reform Act of 1998, changes enacted following intense
Congressional criticism of past IRS collection practices.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Race To Go Second Round  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Rauf Denktash failed to capture a
majority of votes in the race for president of the self-declared
Turkish republic in northern Cyprus on Saturday, sending the
elections into a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash is fighting for re-election in the Turkish-run third of
the Mediterranean island a month before new indirect talks with
Greek Cypriots in the south in hopes of forging a solution to the
island's bitter and protracted division.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent president garnered close to 44 percent of votes,
while his main contender, Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu, had 30
percent, according to the Turkish Cypriot Higher Election Board.
</P>
<P>
   Two left-wing candidates -- Mehmet Ali Talat and Mustafa Akinci --
together took 22 percent of Saturday's vote. Another four percent
went to three other left-wing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash and Eroglu will face one another in the second round on
April 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people placed their trust in me again. I will be stronger
to fight for the (Turkish Cypriot) cause on May 23,'' Denktash told
supporters from the balcony of the presidential palace, referring
to the new talks.
</P>
<P>
   The president had asked voters for support to strengthen his
hand in the upcoming negotiations on the future of the divided
island. He has steadfastly insisted on formal recognition of the
Turkish state.
</P>
<P>
   Eroglu, 62, formerly supported two separate states as a
permanent solution to the conflict, but has since come out in favor
of a confederal solution with Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
   Yusuf Kanli, an expert on Turkish Cyprus, said he expected Talat
and Akinci to push Denktash toward moderating his position on a
settlement. Both left-wing candidates favor a quick solution in the
talks so that Turkish Cypriots can join the Greek side in
membership talks with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The impending negotiations, the third round of U.N.-mediated
talks to be held in New York, were expected to boost support for
Denktash's campaign as he heads into the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had it been at another time, it wouldn't have been so
important to choose Denktash. But he must finish this peace deal,''
said 25-year-old Gurhum Umut, who said he was voting for the first
time because he was worried that Denktash would need every vote.
</P>
<P>
   But some voters were skeptical that Denktash could achieve peace
after so many years of animosity with Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Denktash hasn't solved the issue in decades. You think he will
now?'' said Mevlut Haci Mevlut, an Eroglu supporter.
</P>
<P>
   After polls closed, a preliminary tally showed that 76 percent
of the electorate voted.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into Turkish and Greek sections since a
1974 Turkish invasion, which came in the wake of an Athens-backed
coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash, 75, established the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus in 1983 and is leader of his community of 200,000. His
self-declared state is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains
some 30,000 troops on the island.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has faced a strong challenge from Eroglu, who has
built support through his role as prime minister and the
distribution of social assistance. Eroglu forced Denktash into a
run-off in the last election in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Kill White Farmer  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Squatters occupying white-owned land
shot to death a farmer and abducted four others, farmer leaders
said Sunday, a killing that could deepen the crisis over Zimbabwe's
tense land standoff.
</P>
<P>
   David Stevens was abducted from his occupied property near
Macheke, 75 miles east of Harare and driven into the bush where he
was shot dead, said Commercial Farmers Union officials.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Stevens' neighbors who went to his assistance after he
was confronted by squatters Saturday were abducted and their
whereabouts were not immediately known, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, John Osborne, who witnessed the killing, said
Stevens -- in his 40s -- was hit in the head and back by shotgun
blasts, the union said. Osborne was beaten by the group of
squatters and hospitalized, it said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how Osborne escaped.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first reported slaying of a white farmer in the criss
over illegal land occupations of white-owned farms by squatters
backed by in Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and his ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has refused to force an end to the occupations,
describing them as a justified protest against the ownership of one
third of the nation's productive land by the descendants of British
settlers. Opponents have accused him of backing the squatters' to
pull in support in upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   But his government on Friday appealed for an end to the
stalemate, a day after the High Court ordered police to evict the
squatters.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a group of former guerrillas in the bush war that
led to Zimbabwe's independence vowed to continue their takeovers, a
leader of the occupations said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of the National Liberation War Veterans
Association, said Saturday he was powerless to order squatters led
by war veterans to leave white-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are human rights, we have right to our land ... and
that must be respected,'' Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of told about 500
cheering supporters at the ruling party's headquarters in Harare.
''The redistribution of land must be speeded up.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's 4,000 white-owned farms comprise about a third of the
country's productive farmland, while millions of blacks are
landless and impoverished. Since the end of February, thousands of
squatters armed with clubs, axes and guns have invaded at least 900
white-owned farms and demanded the farmers sign away their land.
</P>
<P>
   Police resisted the High Court order to evict the squatters.
They have said they lack the resources to act against the armed
invaders and that doing so could end in violence.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, police mounted a massive security operation in the
capital on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As police helicopters swooped overhead, officers erected
roadblocks at the approaches to the city center, searching vehicles
for weapons while riot police deployed across the city. Assistant
Commissioner Emmanuel Chimwanda said the operation was aimed to
avert possible political unrest ahead of upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the High Court made its ruling Thursday, Vice
President Joseph Msika asked the squatters to abandon the occupied
farms and said the government wanted to end the standoff amicably.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, Hunzvi told his cheering and singing followers
that he did not respect any court ruling that he believed was
unfair. He said he could not control the actions of squatters
claiming their ''motherland, their soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the white farmers, he said: ''The land has been left in their
hands too long.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Backs American's Expulsion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's Supreme Court rejected an appeal by
a leading American human rights worker who was expelled from Mexico
after visiting the troubled state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that Mexican authorities acted within
their right in expelling Tom Hansen two years ago, the Interior
Secretariat said in a news release issued Saturday. The ruling was
made on March 17, and there was no explanation for the delay in the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The former director of the Chicago-based Pastors for Peace was
among more than 150 foreigners who were kicked out of the country
for allegedly violating terms of their tourist visas by
participating in political activities in Chiapas, the site of a
5-year-old rebellion by the leftist Zapatista National Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a senior federal appeals court ruled that
immigration authorities had violated Mexico's constitution by
expelling Hansen and overturned his February 1998 expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The government promptly rewrote his expulsion order, which was
accepted by a federal judge. Hansen then took his appeal to the
Supreme Court. The court's ruling closes the case for good, the
news release stated.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, who is currently director of the Chicago-based Mexican
Solidarity Network, a coalition of 76 U.S. human rights groups, has
led more than 25 human rights delegations to Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Altamirano, a rebel stronghold, in February 1998 to
distribute video equipment to Tzeltal Indians as part of the
U.S.-Mexico Fund for Culture project, which was financed by the
Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Pray Elian Will Stay  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Demonstrators chanted and prayed outside the home
where Elian Gonzalez has been living with his Miami relatives, and
fretted that the little boy might be spending his last weekend in
Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 people kept their vigil into a muggy Saturday
night, with many waving American flags. At one point, the crowd
began chanting that the boy's father is a coward and a traitor, and
that he should return to Cuba without his son.
</P>
<P>
   The 4{-month custody struggle was in the hands of the federal
appeals court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary injunction
Thursday blocking Elian from leaving the country. The Justice
Department also agreed that day to hold off on reuniting Elian with
his father for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the appeals court to suspend the injunction
and order the 6-year-old's great-uncle to hand him over. The
relatives want the court to let them meet with Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, without being required to let Elian go.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also pointedly reminded the great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, that he lost legal custody of Elian on Thursday
when he defied the government's demand that he take the boy to the
airport for a flight to Washington. Elian's father has been waiting
there since April 6.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll released Saturday found that a majority of
Americans now felt the family was not cooperating enough with
government and court efforts to resolve the case. A majority also
disapproved of the Clinton administration's handling of the case
</P>
<P>
   Both disapproval numbers were up from a week earlier. But the
same amount -- 53 percent -- thought Elian should be returned to his
father in Cuba. The poll was conducted among 752 adults on April
13-14 and the results have a 4 percentage point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, President Clinton, speaking in the Sequoia
National Forest in California, said: ''We have to let the court
cases be decided, but I think the main thing is I hope all the
people who came to the United States because we have freedom and
rule of law will observe the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Clinton's comments, a lawyer for the family
stepped outside the home and said that the family would not try to
stop the government from taking the boy, but it would not help.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family respects the rule of law. The family recognizes and
accepts the legal right of the INS to pick up Elian,'' said Manny
Diaz. ''The door will be open. ... The family will not interfere.
The family will not resist.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was no indication Saturday of precisely when the
government would seek to reunite Elian with his father, many
protesters in Little Havana said they feared the moment would come
Monday -- the anniversary of the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, 1961, a force of CIA-trained Cuban exiles tried to
invade Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Cuban
forces easily repelled the invasion at the swampy, mosquito-ridden
inlet on the country's southern coast, killing 200 rebels and
capturing almost 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's victory became the defining moment for Miami's Cuban
exiles, who accused President John F. Kennedy of betraying them by
failing to back up the invasion force with aerial cover.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that they not win this one,'' said Maria
Miller, who said her brother fought in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Allen of Fort Lauderdale, who joined the crowd of
demonstrators to show support for keeping Elian here, said he was
moved by the strong emotions in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans forget what happened at the Bay of Pigs,'' he said.
''I come down here and it feels like it happened yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been in Miami since he was rescued by fishermen who
found him clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits on
Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned
when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have cared for him since then and have been
fighting in court for an asylum hearing. The Clinton administration
has ordered Elian be reunited with his father, saying only he can
speak for the boy on immigration matters. The relatives are
appealing a federal judge's ruling that upheld the government's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Elian's father, Gregory Craig, on Saturday
harshly criticized repeated allegations by Elian's Miami relatives
that Juan Miguel Gonzalez was abusive to Elian and his ex-wife,
Elian's mother. He called the tactic a desperate effort to
influence the court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has said it has found no evidence that
the father was abusive. And residents of Elian's hometown of
Cardenas, Cuba, have repeatedly told The Associated Press that
Elian's parents, though divorced, had a very good relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also noted that in March, Elian's cousin Marisleysis
called Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''a loving and good father'' and said
she was looking forward to seeing Elian's face when they were
reunited.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Wary of Proposals  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Developing countries expressed their concern
Saturday at proposals to reform the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, particularly any changes that would make it more
difficult for them to obtain loans or have to pay them back faster.
</P>
<P>
   They also rejected conclusions of a U.S. congressional committee
that the IMF should limit itself to short term lending and the
World Bank should halt loans to middle income countries become a
development agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find some of these proposals unacceptable and have serious
concerns about them,'' said German Suarez, chairman of the Group of
24 developing countries. ''But we support efforts to reform'' the
IMF and World Bank and ''strengthen cooperation between them.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the so-called Meltzer Report, written by a
commission led by Carnegie Mellon University Professor Alan
Meltzer. It recommended that the IMF should stop lending to the
world's poorest nations, many of which are African, and leave
development financing to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez spoke at a news conference after a daylong meeting at the
IMF of the G24, which comprises Asian, African and Latin American
nations and represents developing countries in negotiations on
international monetary matters.
</P>
<P>
   Habib Abu Sakr, the G24 vice chairman and a senior Lebanese
finance ministry, official, said the G24 ''finds no contradiction
between our position'' defending the interests of poor nations and
''the people who are demonstrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Ebi, deputy governor of Nigeria's central bank, said the
G24 had to be sensitive to protesters' dissatisfaction with the
functioning of the IMF and World Bank but do a better job educating
them on their roles.
</P>
<P>
   Protest groups gathering in Washington this weekend hope to shut
down the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. They blame
the two institutions for a variety of global woes, from the
perpetuation of poverty to the destruction of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In their communique, the G24 expressed ''serious concern for the
reform'' of the IMF and World Bank in ways that would deprive''
poor nations access to their resources.
</P>
<P>
   They said obtaining foreign aid for development of their
economies often is dependent on the IMF and the World Bank serving
as a catalyst that unlocks such financing.
</P>
<P>
   The G24 said it has ''strong reservations about any significant
shortening'' of the period to repay IMF loans. particularly when a
country has balance of payment problems that cannot easily be
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers also said they were concerned about the limited
representation of poor countries in new forums set up to discuss
international monetary and financial affairs such the Financial
Stability Forum, involving central banks, and the U.S-backed G20,
which groups major industrialized nations and significant emerging
market countries.

   He did not speak to reporters in Jordan, but he told The
Associated Press before leaving the United States that he hopes to
''separate the humanitarian work from the political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   During his four days in Iraq, Hall said he wanted to investigate
reports from relief agencies that a quarter of Iraqi children may
be suffering from chronic malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would pay particular attention to what happens to
food and medicine entering the country under the U.N. oil-for-food
program. If supplies are not reaching the people who need them,
Hall said, he wanted to find out whether the United Nations or
relief agencies needed to handle things differently, or whether
''Iraq needs to get out of the way and let us do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government blames the embargo for the malnutrition,
infant mortality and other hardships.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and the
means to produce them. Iraq says it has done so and has barred
inspectors since late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other congressman has visited Iraq. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson went to Baghdad in 1995 while a
representative for New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 7, Giants 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Kelly Stinnett hit two homers, including a
three-run shot caught by a fan just as Barry Bonds was about to try
for a leaping grab, and the Arizona Diamondbacks sent San Francisco
to its seventh straight loss, 7-4 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants fell to 0-5 at new Pacific Bell Park. Their overall
skid is the worst since they lost seven in a row in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Stottlemyre (3-0) lasted five innings to win his third
straight start. Greg Swindell pitched three perfect innings for his
first save.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit his fifth home run of the season, and 450th of his
career, to give the Giants a 1-0 lead in the first. Stinnett tied
it for Arizona in the third with a home run off Russ Ortiz (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Erubiel Durazo reached on an infield single in the Arizona
fourth, and walks to Steve Finley and Travis Lee loaded the bases
with one out. Lenny Harris' sacrifice fly put the Diamondbacks up
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett then lofted a high drive to deep left. The ball clearly
was over the fence, and Bonds timed his jump to try to rob Stinnett
of a home run.
</P>
<P>
   As he was about to make the catch, a young boy's glove reached
on top of Bonds and caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing what he had done, the fan quickly let go and the ball
trickled back into Bonds' glove, but it was too late. Stinnett had
his second home of the day -- and third of the season -- for a 5-1
Arizona lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did not argue because the ball had cleared the wall.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco rallied for three runs in the sixth on an RBI
single by Armado Rios, an RBI groundout by Felipe Crespo, and
run-scoring wild pitch by Dan Plesac.
</P>
<P>
   But with the potential tying run at second, Plesac struck out
Marvin Benard to keep Arizona's lead at 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona got RBI singles from Finley and Harris to go up 7-4 in
the eighth off Alan Embree.
Notes: Stottlemyre is 4-1 with a 3.89 ERA lifetime against the
Giants. ... The Diamondbacks have won seven of their last eight
games played in San Francisco. ... Giants leadoff hitters are
1-for-11 with one walk in the first inning this season.

<HEADLINE> Great Dayne Now a New York Giant  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Wasting no time on second thoughts
or trade talk, the New York Giants filled a gaping hole at halfback
by selecting Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne with the 11th pick in
the NFL draft Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams took the majority of the 15 minutes allotted to make
their first-round selections, but the Giants needed only 1 minute,
59 seconds to choose the big tailback, who left Wisconsin as the
Division I career rushing leader with 6,397 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Ernie Accorsi, the Giants general manager, was already
downstairs briefing beat writers about the former southern New
Jersey star from Overbrook High School before commissioner Paul
Tagliabue announced the choice on national television.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more I watched him, the more I knew about him, the more I
talked to him and saw him and talked to people about him -- it was a
while ago that I knew this was the guy,'' said Giants coach Jim
Fassel, who meet Dayne at the Hula Bowl in January. ''There was no
doubt in my mind. I've been convinced for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Dayne gives the Giants a power runner for a team
that averaged 88.1 yards rushing and missed the playoffs for the
second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Giants had averaged less than
100-yards in a non-strike season since 1953, but it also came in a
year where New York lost its top running back, Gary Brown, for most
of the season. Rookie Joe Montgomery's team high 348 yards were the
fewest since Bobby Duhon had 344 in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi said there is a lot more to Dayne, 5-foot-10 and
somewhere between 255 and 263 pounds, than meets the eye. The
general manager also insisted the big guy can catch the ball coming
out of the backfield. He had only 31 receptions in his career at
Wisconsin, including just one last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think his No. 1 attribute is power,'' Accorsi said.
''I really think his No. 1 attribute is his quickness, and his No.
2 attribute is his vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, they make Dayne as elusive as he is powerful. He
proved that the past two years in the Rose Bowl MVP twice,
combining for 446 yards rushing and scoring five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, who watched the draft in Wisconsin, had a feeling the
Giants were going to take him, based on the interest the team has
shown in him and reports he and his brother, Yas, had gone over in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days ago, he also dreamed that the Giants would pick
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were winning the Super Bowl,'' Dayne said of the dream.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne is expected to start next season, although Fassel said the
job will be up for grabs in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne knows some will doubt him.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my hunger that makes me want to go out and play,'' he
said. ''People still doubt me, saying I can't do this and can't do
that. That's what happened my first year in college and my senior
year in college. People doubted me and doubted me. I just want to
prove I'm a great back and can do anything small backs do, and even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also coveted tailback Shaun Alexander of Alabama, but
with Dayne still available, the team had no choice but to take the
Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   Marv Sunderland, the Giants director of player personnel, said
Dayne's size, his ability and his production in college were too
good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a guy that has taken it over in the fourth
quarter,'' Sunderland said. ''If you watched the Rose Bowl and
games like that, he's a guy who keeps coming at you and coming at
you, and pretty soon he wears you out.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Giants didn't take Alexander, they filled a need on
the defensive line, taking Cornelius Griffin of Alabama. A junior
college transfer, he had 53 tackles and 5{ sacks playing tackle
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can play tackle and end, and he has a good motor,'' Fassel
said of the 6-3, 289 pounder who was one of the Tide's tri-captains
this past season. ''He works hard and he is an athlete. Based upon
where we are in need in that area, I'm really excited.''

Police Make Mass Arrests in D.C.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-globalization protesters swarmed through the heart of
the capital late today and came face to face with lines of helmeted police in a
tense show of will sparked by animosity toward international lending
institutions. Several hundred were arrested for parading without a permit and
led peacefully away to at least seven yellow school buses as supporters shouted
for police to let them go. Police pulled the fake red nose off one protester
dressed as a clown as he filed into the bus. In downtown Washington, riot-ready
police made some 50 blocks off limits around the World Bank headquarters,
barring everyone from getting past metal barriers.

Zimbabwe Squatters Kill White Farmer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Squatters occupying white-owned land shot to death a
farmer and abducted four others, farmers leaders said Sunday, a killing that
could deepen the crisis over Zimbabwe's tense land standoff. David Stevens was
abducted from his occupied property near Macheke, 75 miles east of Harare and
driven into the bush where he was shot dead, said Commercial Farmers Union
officials. Four of Stevens' neighbors who went to his assistance after he was
confronted by squatters Saturday were abducted and their whereabouts were not
immediately known, the union said. Another neighbor, John Osborne, who witnessed
the killing, said Stevens -- in his 40s -- was hit in the head and back by
shotgun blasts, the union said.

Rescue Efforts Continue in Congo

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Red Cross workers desperately searched for survivors
today, a day after a mysterious chain of explosions at a hangar at Kinshasa's
international airport reportedly killed between 40 and 50 people. Official radio
put the death toll at 10, but reports from Belgium said between 40 and 50 people
had been killed -- including victims hit by debris up to several miles away. The
death toll could rise much higher, with customs officials saying more than 100
people could still be trapped in the hangar. Explanations of what caused the
blasts Friday at Kinshasa's N'Djili international airport ranged from a short
circuit to a soldier's dropping ammunition while unloading a plane full of
weapons.

Poor Taxpayers Face More Audits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- According to a report released today, the nation's
poorest taxpayers face a greater likelihood of being audited. Though the IRS'
overall audit rate last year dropped to just under 1 percent, the focus has
shifted from the rich to the poor, according to Syracuse University's
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which analyzes government data.
Among taxpayers making $100,000 or more, 1.15 percent were audited in 1999, down
from 1.66 a year earlier, TRAC reported. The rate for those making $25,000 or
less was 1.36 percent, up from 1.14 in 1998.

Whaling Trade Plans Rejected
</SUBHEAD>

   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- In a major setback Saturday, Japan and Norway lost
bids to win international approval for limited trade of the grey and minke
whales. In a secret ballot, 53 countries attending the U.N. conference on trade
in endangered species voted against a proposal that would have allowed
controlled trade of the whale. Forty countries voted in favor of the plan and
nine abstained. Delegates also rejected two other Japanese proposals to allow
controlled trade in minke whales located in the southern hemisphere and in an
area from the Okhotsak Sea to the western Pacific Ocean.

fretted that this weekend might be his last there. In the afternoon, the crowd
began chanting that the boy's father is a coward and a traitor, and that he
should return to Cuba without his son. The 4{-month custody struggle was in the
hands of the federal appeals court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary
injunction Thursday blocking Elian from leaving the country. The Justice

<HEADLINE> N.Koreans Skip Anti-West Propaganda  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's drab capital city came
to life Saturday with thousands celebrating their biggest national
holiday. But this year's festivities lacked a usual prop: a
diatribe against the United States and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The isolated communist state usually marks ''Sun's Day'' -- the
birthday of late President Kim Il Sung -- with vows to pick up arms
to fight what it calls U.S. imperialist aggressors and their South
Korean stooges.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's celebration came five days after North Korea agreed
to hold a summit with South Korea in June in a historic deal that
could bring the impoverished North badly needed economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pyongyang is transported with boundless joy on Sun's Day,''
said the North's official foreign news outlet, KCNA, monitored in
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Squares and streets were decorated with colorful posters and
flowers, it said. Despite the electricity shortages that cause
frequent power outages in the capital, communist authorities
festooned Pyongyang's streets with 19 miles of decorative light
bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Squares, theaters and gymnasiums were packed with people holding
rallies and watching art performances, KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
   Long lines of people paid homage to the Kumsusan Memorial
Palace, where Kim Il Sung lies in state. Kim founded and ruled
North Korea for four decades until he died at age 82 in 1994. He
still is revered as a demigod in the North.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Kim Jong Il, took power in communism's first hereditary
succession.
</P>
<P>
   The junior Kim, flanked by senior party and military officials,
visited his father's memorial Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He faces the tough task of pulling his country out of a deep
economic crisis. The country has been relying on outside aid to
feed its people since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's propaganda machines on Saturday did not mention
the planned summit.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of anti-Western propaganda was all the more salient
because the United States and its South Korean allies launched a
six-day joint military exercise Saturday to test their ability to
receive and deploy reinforcement forces from U.S. bases outside the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Military drills typically draw harsh rhetoric from the North,
which consider them war preparations.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the reaction came from the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yankee go home!'' 1,000 South Korean students and other
activists chanted Saturday at a park in central Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   They accused Washington of staging the military exercise to
heighten tension on the divided peninsula and sabotage the planned
summit. Carrying anti-American pickets, the protesters marched
three city blocks. Traffic was backed up but no serious clashes
were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Students also demanded that Washington investigate and apologize
for alleged massacres of civilians by American troops during the
1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops led U.N. forces that fought the war on South Korea's
side against North Korea and its Chinese and Soviet supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict ended without a peace treaty, and Washington
maintains 37,000 troops in the South under a mutual defense treaty.

<HEADLINE> Mapuche Indians Seize EU Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A group of Mapuche Indians protesting the
detention of some colleagues seized the European Union offices here
for six hours Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 12 Mapuches used a ladder to climb a wall of the
residence in eastern Santiago housing the European delegation. A
spokesman for the occupiers, Cristian Melillan, said the action was
not aimed at the EU.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing against the European Union. We just want to
call international attention to our problem,'' Melillan said,
speaking through a fence as the group remained in the garden of the
residence.
</P>
<P>
   The group was demanding the release of several colleagues
detained in southern Chile after they invaded a farm. After around
six hours, the seizure ended with the protesters leaving the
offices after being assured police would take no reprisals. None
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   There are around 1.2 million Mapuches in Chile, living mostly in
the south of the country. In recent months, a protest movement has
grown among the Mapuches, with some radical groups invading farms
owned by large timber companies. Native leaders say their movement
is aimed at recovering land that belonged to their ancestors.

<HEADLINE> Capitals Miffed by Officiating  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Washington Capitals didn't like where the
NHL made them play Game 2 against Pittsburgh. What made them madder
still was how the officials made them play.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, trying to get back to their dump-and-grind style
that was so successful this season, were shorthanded nine times in
a 2-1 loss Saturday decided by Penguins star Jaromir Jagr's
overtime goal.
</P>
<P>
   Capitals coach Ron Wilson was angered that defenseman Ken Klee
was called for holding Alexei Kovalev in overtime, leading to
Jagr's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we played a great game,'' Wilson said. ''I can't
control what is a penalty or what one team's allowed to do and the
other team pays the price. It's very frustrating to see the other
team get warned for interfering, for slashing and, for the same
offenses, we don't get a warning and we are in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Klee called the penalty ''unbelievable'' but said it was
''typical'' of referee Paul Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's too good for the players,'' Klee said. ''It's his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Capitals accused Kovalev of taking a dive on the Klee
penalty. Kovalev denied that, saying, ''I never dive. I always go
for the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Olaf Kolzig not only questioned the Klee penalty -- Klee's
second in a span of six minutes -- but, ''You have to question a lot
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals played Saturday without star Chris Simon, who was
suspended for cross-checking Penguins defenseman Peter Popovic
across the jaw in Pittsburgh's 7-0 victory in Game 1. Popovic
played Game 2, which was supposed to be played in Washington but
was moved to Pittsburgh because of arena scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Burn the Floor'' dance show was supposed to occupy Mellon
Arena next week. Instead, it's been replaced by the Capitals' slow
burn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe they've got a great medical staff ... but you're going
down, you've been cross checked in the head, you're got a severe
concussion, possible broken jaw and you're right back out there the
next night,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Game 2, Penguins forward Matthew Barnaby crumpled to
the ice after being slashed by Sergei Gonchar, who was not
penalized. Barnaby was taken to the dressing room for medical care,
but returned to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go off with a broken arm and you're right back out there
five minutes later,'' Wilson said. ''This is frustrating. I don't
know what to say. Every time a guy is down, (Penguins captain)
Jaromir Jagr comes over to complain about it and, the next time, we
have a guy in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two games, Pittsburgh is 4-for-17 on the power play to
Washington's 1-for-10.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also accused Jagr of hitting Klee in the head with a
stick late in regulation without being penalized.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (the referee) certainly would have seen Chris Simon hit
someone over the head with a stick,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals also lost an apparent goal that would have put them
up 2-0 when the officials ruled goalie Ron Tugnutt had covered the
puck.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been 2-0 and maybe we shut them down from
there,'' Kolzig said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Putin on Start II  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday
congratulated new Russian President Vladimir Putin on the Russian
Duma's approval of the Start II treaty to reduce long-range nuclear
arms. The White House said the two leaders will meet soon for their
first summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on a trip to California to permanently set aside 34
groves of giant sequoia trees as a national monument, spoke to
Putin by telephone from Air Force One before leaving Bakersfield.
The call, at about noon, lasted 10 minutes, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president noted Mr. Putin's personal involvement on this
and said, 'This is an important step forward toward the reduction
of nuclear arms,''' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, dating from 1993, would cut 5,000 warheads from U.S.
and Russian arsenals. A follow-up pact could trip the total by an
additional 1,000 to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert said Clinton told Putin he hoped to have further
discussions soon on ''their shared agenda'' on economic reform,
further nuclear arms reduction, and other security matters.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert said Clinton knows difficult issues are involved but he
hopes he can, ''find a way forward.'' Clinton also mentioned
several ''problem areas'' that he expects to discuss with Putin
including Chechnya, Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to go to Moscow in June to meet with Putin,
according to administration officials, although the dates and site
have not been announced officially.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin agreed to meet sometime before world leaders
gather in Okinawa, Japan, July 21-23 for the annual meeting of
industrialized powers, Siewert said. He said the two leaders also
would talk in Okinawa.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Support Protests  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- After a summit pushing for a bigger share of the
world's wealth, developing nations threw their support Saturday
behind protesters massing in Washington to demand reform in the
world financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Group of 77 summit of developing nations closed in
Havana ahead of opening sessions Sunday of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington that a loose coalition
of protesters have vowed to disrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's Arthur Mbanefo, G-77 president, said the gathering's
leaders ''give their full backing and solidarity with the
demonstrators.''
</P>
<P>
   I personally support whatever demonstrations that make the IMF
and the World Bank think positively about our problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, operating under the umbrella group Mobilization
for Global Justice, say the world financial system has left
millions destitute in developing countries. Last December, mass
protests in Seattle resulted in the cancellation of the opening
session of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Washington police tried to prevent a replay of the violence
Saturday, staging an early morning raid on the old warehouse the
demonstrators had been using as their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The G-77, founded in 1964 as a U.N. lobbying group, has expanded
to include 133 nations. The leaders used their first summit to
transform the group into what could become a significant
international voice for the developing world, creating a structure
to pressure richer countries to consider the interests of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said Saturday the G-77
would send a high-level delegation to present the group's proposals
at a July summit of industrialized nations in Japan, known as the
Group of 7.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's information minister, Jerry Gana, said from now on,
the G-77 would insist on sitting in on each G-7 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Havana proposals call for cooperation with
wealthy nations, Obasanjo said ''I think the north should be happy
-- but you never can be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-day Havana summit, which ended Friday, the G-77
leaders also insisted on equal footing at the IMF, World Bank and
the U.N. Security Council. They urged the United Nations to take a
stronger economic role and use the group to negotiate with wealthy
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many countries have rejected the results of the policy
initiatives of the World Bank and the IMF,'' said Mbanefo, arguing
that their insistence on austerity and privatization programs in
poor nations had damaged the ''economies they were supposed to
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Resolutions adopted at the summit demanded relief of the Third
World's crushing debt, increased aid and more exports to developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the G-77 summit ended Friday, officials of the World
Bank, IMF and the Clinton administration defended free trade as an
anti-poverty strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is ''the only way we are going to raise people
around the world to the same level as people in industrialized
countries,'' IMF acting director Stanley Fischer said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the World Bank on Thursday reported that as rich countries
advance, the gap between rich and poor is not improving. Some 1.2
billion people tried to exist on less than $1 a day in 1998 -- a
figure essentially unchanged over the past decade.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cal Ripken moved within two hits of the
3,000-hit mark Saturday night when he singled in the fourth inning
at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken sent a 2-2 pitch from Minnesota Twins right-hander Sean

<HEADLINE> Fusaichi Pegasus Wins at Aqueduct  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the final 220 yards of the $750,000 Wood
Memorial, Fusaichi Pegasus showed why he is sure to be the
unquestioned favorite for the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing a powerful finishing kick, Fusaichi Pegasus cruised
past Red Bullet and Country Only for an easy 4\-length victory in
the 1[-mile Wood at Aqueduct on a rainy Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He justified himself as the Kentucky Derby favorite,'' trainer
Neil Drysdale said. ''I could not have asked for a better
performance. Just look at him coming back -- he adores looking
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong-willed Fusaichi Pegasus has a habit of checking out
the surroundings before and after a race. So much so that Drysdale
says he has a ''mind of his own, and when he decides to do it, he
does it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did it on the East Coast for the first time, where he
obviously found a new racing surface, a wet track and a large field
of 12 3-year-olds to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet, beaten for the first time in four starts, held on
for second, with Aptitude third and Country Only fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In adding the Wood to his previous win in the San Felipe Stakes
on March 19 at Santa Anita, Fusaichi Pegasus has now beaten many of
the other top Derby contenders. He defeated The Deputy in the San
Felipe, a colt who went on to win the Santa Anita Derby on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a major, major step,'' Fusaichi Pegusas' jockey Kent
Desormeaux said. ''This horse showed me the capability of being
able to sprint to a spot, go on cruise control, sprint to a spot
later on, go back on cruise control and then really stretch out
when you ask him for his life late in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus lived up to his pedigree and price tag against
one of the strongest fields in 76 runnings of the Wood.
</P>
<P>
   He is a son of the late Mr. Prospector, out of a Danzig dam,
Angel Fever, and was purchased for an eye-popping $4 million at the
1998 Keeneland July Sale by Japanese entrepreneur Fusao Sekiguchi,
who said he would have paid $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus looked like he was worth every penny Sekiguchi
paid as he cruised behind the leaders, then made his move around
the final turn. Country Only, ridden by Herbert Castillo Jr., was
the pace-setter, with Red Bullet right behind.
</P>
<P>
   The two stayed that way until they entered the stretch. And
that's when Desormeaux asked Fusaichi Pegasus to run a little
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave him some underhand slashes under the girth, but that
was just to keep his attention,'' Desormeaux said. ''I nibbled on
him a little, and he took right off. I wanted him to keep reaching
late and to keep reaching until after we said, 'OK, big fella,
you've done enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus covered the 1[ miles in 1:47 4-5 over track
labeled good. The strapping colt was the 4-5 favorite of the crowd
of 15,684, and returned $3.80, $2.70 and $2.20. Red Bullet, ridden
by Alex Solis, paid $3.60 and $2.80 and Aptitude, trained by Hall
of Fame trainer Bobby Frankel, got up for third and paid $3.20.
</P>
<P>
   After Country Only, Appearing Now was fifth, followed by
Postponed, Cat's at Home, Painted Pistol, Exchange Rate, Fight for
Ally, Connect and Traditionally.
</P>
<P>
   In the two other major prep races, the D. Wayne Lukas-trained
High Yield won the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland and Graeme Hall
won the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Orseno, who trains Derby-bound Red Bullet, said his colt was
a little too close to the lead but, ''if Alex had taken him back he
most probably would have gotten into traffic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will he move up from this race? I think he will but the
question is how much because the winner ran a very big race.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the race, Fusaichi Pegasus took longer than most to get
to the start before he was finally led into his No. 5 gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he wants to come out and play today,'' Desormeaux
remembered thinking.
</P>
<P>
   After he won, Desormeaux had a tough time getting Fusaichi
Pegasus back to the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   But when he did, he smiled at Sekiguchi's daughter, Yukari, and
said, ''he's a rebel with a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus earned $450,000 for the win and can earn a
$250,000 bonus if he completes the Wood-Derby double.
</P>
<P>
   The last Wood winner to take the Kentucky Derby was Pleasant
Colony in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Precise End won the $110,000 Bay Shore by 5\
lengths over Turnofthecentury; Brutally Frank won by a head over
Kelly Kip in the $100,000 Bold Ruler; and '99 Belmont Stakes and
Travers winner Lemon Drop Kid and End of the Road finished in a
dead heat in a $60,000 allowance.

<HEADLINE> Analyses of NFL Draft Picks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A look at how each NFL team addressed its needs
in Saturday's NFL draft:
</P>
<P>
CLEVELAND
</P>
<P>
   The second-year Browns need plenty and could have gotten several
extra selections by trading down. Instead, they stuck to their plan
of taking an impact player, COURTNEY BROWN, DE, PENN STATE. He
should start immediately and be visiting the Pro Bowl in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   A division champion rarely picks so high. The Skins, through
deals with New Orleans and San Francisco, moved into position to
put a stranglehold on the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   LAVAR ARRINGTON, LB, PENN STATE, has been compared in some
quarters to Lawrence Taylor. While that might be unfair, he should
be a factor right away, helping plug up a porous defense.
</P>
<P>
   The other choice, CHRIS SAMUELS, OT, Alabama, fills perhaps a
bigger need at left tackle, protecting Brad Johnson and opening
running room for Stephen Davis.
</P>
<P>
CINCINNATI
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye Carl Pickens? The Bengals are looking to dump their
disgruntled wideout, and have the perfect replacement now in
game-breaking PETER WARRICK, WR, FLORIDA STATE. Warrick also should
star immediately on special teams and gives Akili Smith another
deep threat to go with Darnay Scott.
</P>
<P>
BALTIMORE
</P>
<P>
   Offense-minded coach Brian Billick was seeking a running back
and a wideout from the first round. The runner became JAMAL LEWIS,
Tennessee, who has been injury prone, but has size and speed. He's
considered a better inside runner than Thomas Jones, the other top
RB in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver came 10th overall as Baltimore grabbed TRAVIS
TAYLOR, FLORIDA. Although injured for much of last season, Taylor
is a speedy deep threat with good hands. The Ravens got just what
they wanted.
</P>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles could be putting together a decent front four if Hugh
Douglas and Mike Mamula can stay healthy to join COREY SIMON, DT,
FLORIDA STATE. Simon was, by far, the best player at his position
and fills an immediate void, even if a receiver might have seemed a
bigger need.
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   With THOMAS JONES, RB, VIRGINIA, the Cardinals got a very
necessary tool for a lagging offense. They haven't had a real
threat at running back in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
PITTSBURGH
</P>
<P>
   If coach Bill Cowher's job is on the line this season, he at
least got a potential playmaker to help him keep it in PLAXICO
BURRESS, WR, MICHIGAN STATE. Considered something of an attitude
problem, Burress' skills and size (6-5) make him an attractive
target if Kordell Stewart can find him.
</P>
<P>
CHICAGO
</P>
<P>
   A new Monster of the Midway in versatile BRIAN URLACHER, LB, NEW
MEXICO. Urlacher also can play safety or tight end, but at 6-4, 258
with speed, he will go at outside linebacker. Not the biggest need
for Chicago, but he's too good an athlete to pass up, and the Bears
felt they could get a receiver, cornerback or running back later
on.
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK GIANTS
</P>
<P>
   Wanted a heavy-duty running back. Got a heavy-duty running back
in Heisman Trophy winner RON DAYNE, WISCONSIN. While he'll have to
do a lot of work on his own behind a weak offensive line, Dayne can
move piles better than some of the Giants' blockers. And he's
almost as big.
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK JETS
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trade their way up -- or down -- the Jets used their
four first-rounders. In consecutive picks, they aided the defense
with SHAUN ELLIS, DE, TENNESSEE, and JOHN ABRAHAM, LB, SOUTH
CAROLINA. Ellis could be the pass rusher they desperately need, but
Abraham does not fill a need, unless the team is planning to trade
Mo Lewis or Roman Phifer.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lucas' development at quarterback apparently didn't impress
new coach Al Groh enough, because the Jets went for CHAD
PENNINGTON, MARSHALL, at No. 18. Pennington will be groomed as
Vinny Testaverde's eventual replacement, although Lucas would like
a say in that.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing off their unprecedented mother lode in the opening
round, the Jets addressed a major problem with ANTHONY BECHT, TE,
WEST VIRGINIA. He will need to improve his blocking, but has little
competition at the position.
</P>
<P>
GREEN BAY
</P>
<P>
   The Packers breathed a whole lot easier when BUBBA FRANKS, TE,
MIAMI (FLA.), was not taken by the Jets. Franks can be a playmaker
at the position, and with Mark Chmura facing an uncertain future,
this was a wise choice.
</P>
<P>
DENVER
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos really must be worried about Dale Carter's pending
suspension. Why else go for DELTHA O'NEAL, CB, CALIFORNIA, who was
projected as a second-rounder, with the 15th pick? O'Neal will help
as a kick returner.
</P>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO
</P>
<P>
   Wanted: a pass-rushing linebacker. Acquired: a pass-rushing
linebacker, JULIAN PETERSON, MICHIGAN STATE. He should fill two
needs if he upgrades his pass coverage, and immediately adds
athletic ability to a lagging defense.
</P>
<P>
   More Big Ten help for the defense came in the 24th spot when the
Niners selected AHMED PLUMMER, CB, OHIO STATE. He should start
immediately and gives San Francisco some size, which it lacked on
the corner.
</P>
<P>
OAKLAND
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. Rebel placekicker SEBASTIAN JANIKOWSKI, FLORIDA STATE,
who has been accused of trying to bribe a policeman, could wind up
being deported to his native Poland. He has a bigtime leg,
regularly hitting from beyond 50 yards, and he sends nearly every
kickoff into the end zone. But a kicker at No. 17 overall when
wideout and defensive end were more critical areas is a reach.
</P>
<P>
SEATTLE
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Watters is slowing down, and the Seahawks stole a player
the next two teams in line wanted by choosing SHAUN ALEXANDER, RB,
ALABAMA. But needing an inside linebacker, deep receiving threat
and a blocker, why make this move? Maybe Watters is on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   And three spots later, the Seahawks chose someone to open holes
for Alexander in CHRIS MCINTOSH, OT, WISCONSIN. Mike Holmgren looks
like he's serious about upgrading the running game.
</P>
<P>
DETROIT
</P>
<P>
   The Lions went into the draft looking to add a guard who could
play on the left side between Ray Roberts and Mike Compton, and
seem to have gotten their man in STOCKAR McDOUGLE, OT, OKLAHOMA.
McDougle is a superior run blocker who rarely commits penalties.
</P>
<P>
KANSAS CITY
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs would have loved Dayne or Alexander. At least they
helped their mediocre receiving corps with SYLVESTER MORRIS, WR,
JACKSON STATE, who can get deep, but is a bit of a project. The
running game still needs addressing.
</P>
<P>
CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   With a pair of aging cornerbacks in Doug Evans and Eric Davis,
both of whom have seen their best days, the Panthers opted for
RASHARD ANDERSON, JACKSON STATE. The top three offensive linemen
were gone, so the Panthers went after another weak spot, but they
must wish McIntosh or McDougle had fallen to them.
</P>
<P>
MINNESOTA
</P>
<P>
   Although the offensive line and secondary are lacking, the
Vikings went for help for John Randle on the defensive line with
CHRIS HOVAN, DT, BOSTON COLLEGE. A bit one-dimensional, he should
occupy blockers to free Randle more.
</P>
<P>
BUFFALO
</P>
<P>
   You lose Bruce Smith, you go for a defensive end who can get
into the opposing backfield. ERIK FLOWERS, ARIZONA STATE, fits the
bill and figures to start.
</P>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS
</P>
<P>
   Thinning at linebacker, the Colts went for ROB MORRIS, BYU, who
will be placed on the inside, where he shouldn't have any trouble
becoming a starter. Indianapolis' offense is high tech and the
defense needs to become more stingy. This should help.
</P>
<P>
JACKSONVILLE
</P>
<P>
   Needing speed at receiver, the Jaguars ignored a gaping hole at
guard to select unpredictable R. JAY SOWARD, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
If Mark Brunell gets enough time, he'll have another threat on the
outside to join Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardle.
</P>
<P>
TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   Not overwhelming at linebacker, the Titans went for a
run-stuffer who should do well in coverage in KEITH BULLUCK,
SYRACUSE. They needed a defensive tackle more, but didn't see one
to their liking, and there were no tight end prospects in sight.
</P>
<P>
ST. LOUIS
</P>
<P>
   A strange pick to finish off the first round. One thing the Rams
have plenty of is game-breaking types on offense. They need
offensive linemen. Yet they went for TRUNG CANIDATE, RB, ARIZONA,
who was looked at as a mid-second-round guy. Then again, they won
the Super Bowl, so cut them some slack.
</P>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS
</P>
<P>
   After trading what would have been the No. 2 overall pick in the
Ricky Williams deal last year, the Saints had to wait until No. 33.
They need a strong fullback to block for Williams and depth in the
secondary, but opted instead for DARREN HOWARD, DE, KANSAS STATE,
an impressive pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons addressed a number of needs with free-agent
signings, but still had a few holes to fill. One was on offensive
line, where TRAVIS CLARIDGE, OT, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, expected by
some to be a first-rounder, can play right tackle or guard.
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO
</P>
<P>
   After signing free agent wide receiver Curtis Conway, the
Chargers went into the draft focused on adding a linebacker or
depth in the secondary. They went for ROGERS BECKETT, S, MARSHALL,
who is a hard hitter in the Tim McDonald mold.
</P>
<P>
NEW ENGLAND
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots desperately need a running back, but went for
ADRIAN KLEMM, OT, HAWAII, in the second round. Klemm, projected by
some as a first-rounder, could develop into a solid left tackle.
Now, New England needs someone to run behind him.
</P>
<P>
DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   With the likely loss of Deion Sanders, the Cowboys were in need
of a defensive back. DWAYNE GOODRICH, DB, TENNESSEE, has
outstanding speed and is superb in man-to-man coverage. Still,
Goodrich will be hard-pressed to step into Sanders' shoes.
</P>
<P>
TAMPA BAY
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers' primary need was at wide receiver -- until they
pulled off a trade with the New York Jets to get Keyshawn Johnson.
So, Tampa Bay focused on upgrading the offensive line. It traded up
six spots to ensure it would get CASEY COLEMAN, G, TENNESSEE,
regarded by many as the best all-around lineman available.
</P>
<P>
MIAMI
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins probably won't re-sign Pro Bowler Richmond Webb
after next season, so TODD WADE, OT, MISSISSIPPI, is the
replacement-in-waiting. Like several offensive linemen taken in the
second round, Wade was considered a possible first-rounder.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Call Elian's Dad Traitor  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Demonstrators in Little Havana called Elian
Gonzalez's father a traitor and a coward on Saturday while Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, in an interview with CBS, denied accusations he
was abusive and said he was being falsely characterized.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters' chants came a day after affidavits filed by the
boy's Miami relatives alleged the father abused his ex-wife and
6-year-old son. The Justice Department has said it has found no
evidence that the father was abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are lies, totally,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez told CBS' 60
Minutes in an interview to be aired Sunday. ''They have tried in
every way to set me as a bad father, as a bad husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4{-month custody struggle was in the hands of the federal
appeals court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary injunction
Thursday blocking Elian from leaving the country. The Justice
Department also agreed that day to hold off on reuniting Elian with
his father for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the appeals court to suspend the injunction
and order the 6-year-old's great-uncle to hand him over. The
relatives want the court to let them meet with Elian's father
without being required to let Elian go.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also pointedly reminded the great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, that he lost legal custody of Elian on Thursday
when he defied the government's demand that he take the boy to the
airport for a flight to Washington. Elian's father has been waiting
there since April 6.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll released Saturday found that a majority of
Americans now felt the family was not cooperating enough with
government and court efforts to resolve the case. A majority also
disapproved of the Clinton administration's handling of the case
</P>
<P>
   Both disapproval numbers were up from a week earlier. But the
same amount -- 53 percent -- thought Elian should be returned to his
father in Cuba. The poll was conducted among 752 adults on April
13-14 and the results have a 4 percentage point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, President Clinton, speaking in the Sequoia
National Forest in California, said: ''We have to let the court
cases be decided, but I think the main thing is I hope all the
people who came to the United States because we have freedom and
rule of law will observe the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Clinton's comments, a lawyer for the family
stepped outside the home and told the crowd of 400 that the family
would not try to stop the government from taking the boy, but it
would not help.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family respects the rule of law. The family recognizes and
accepts the legal right of the INS to pick up Elian,'' said Manny
Diaz. ''The door will be open. ... The family will not interfere.
The family will not resist.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was no indication Saturday of precisely when the
government would seek to reunite Elian with his father, many
protesters in Little Havana said they feared the moment would come
Monday -- the anniversary of the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, 1961, a force of CIA-trained Cuban exiles tried to
invade Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Cuban
forces easily repelled the invasion at the swampy, mosquito-ridden
inlet on the country's southern coast, killing 200 rebels and
capturing almost 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's victory became the defining moment for Miami's Cuban
exiles, who accused President John F. Kennedy of betraying them by
failing to back up the invasion force with aerial cover.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that they not win this one,'' said Maria
Miller, who said her brother fought in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, amid shouts of coward and traitor, the crowd
began chanting: ''Elian shouldn't leave. The one who should leave
is his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been in Miami since he was rescued by fishermen who
found him clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits on
Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned
when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have cared for him since then and have been
fighting in court for an asylum hearing. The Clinton administration
has ordered Elian be reunited with his father, saying only he can
speak for the boy on immigration matters. The relatives are
appealing a federal judge's ruling that upheld the government's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Elian's father, Gregory Craig, on Saturday
harshly criticized repeated the allegations of abuse. He called the
tactic a desperate effort to influence the court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Elian's hometown of Cardenas, Cuba, have repeatedly
told The Associated Press that Elian's parents, though divorced,
had a very good relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also noted that in March, Elian's cousin Marisleysis
called Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''a loving and good father'' and said
she was looking forward to seeing Elian's face when they were
reunited.

<HEADLINE> Poland Solidarity Submits Candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The leader of Poland's Solidarity movement
announced Saturday he would challenge ex-communist President
Aleksander Kwasniewski in fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Solidarity people, nothing is impossible,'' said Marian
Krzaklewski, 49, as he declared his candidacy after months of
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Krzaklewski gained fame after taking over the Solidarity trade
union in 1991 when its legendary founder, Lech Walesa, became
president.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential elections are due in the fall, though a date has
yet to be announced. All opinion polls show the incumbent
Kwasniewski the runaway winner if presidential elections were held
now.
</P>
<P>
   Kwasniewski, 45, hasn't said if he will seek a second five-year
term, but his post-communist allies are already campaigning for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Public approval of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's governing
coalition, formed around Krzaklewski's party, is at a record low
because of rising unemployment and cuts in government health care,
pensions and education.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Solidarity Social Movement, who endorsed
Krzaklewski's candidacy Saturday, hope he will win support of
several other factions in Solidarity Electoral Action, the senior
party in the governing coalition.

<HEADLINE> White Zimbabwe Farmer Said Killed  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Squatters occupying white-owned land
shot to death a farmer and abducted four others, farmer leaders
said Sunday, a killing that could deepen the crisis over Zimbabwe's
tense land standoff.
</P>
<P>
   David Stevens was abducted from his occupied property near
Macheke, 75 miles east of Harare and driven into the bush where he
was shot dead, said Commercial Farmers Union officials.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Stevens' neighbors who went to his assistance after he
was confronted by squatters Saturday were abducted and their
whereabouts were not immediately known, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, John Osborne, who witnessed the killing, said
Stevens -- in his 40s -- was hit in the head and back by shotgun
blasts, the union said. Osborne was beaten by the group of
squatters and hospitalized, it said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how Osborne escaped.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first reported slaying of a white farmer in the criss
over illegal land occupations of white-owned farms by squatters
backed by in Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and his ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has refused to force an end to the occupations,
describing them as a justified protest against the ownership of one
third of the nation's productive land by the descendants of British
settlers. Opponents have accused him of backing the squatters' to
pull in support in upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   But his government on Friday appealed for an end to the
stalemate, a day after the High Court ordered police to evict the
squatters.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a group of former guerrillas in the bush war that
led to Zimbabwe's independence vowed to continue their takeovers, a
leader of the occupations said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of the National Liberation War Veterans
Association, said Saturday he was powerless to order squatters led
by war veterans to leave white-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are human rights, we have right to our land ... and
that must be respected,'' Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of told about 500
cheering supporters at the ruling party's headquarters in Harare.
''The redistribution of land must be speeded up.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's 4,000 white-owned farms comprise about a third of the
country's productive farmland, while millions of blacks are
landless and impoverished. Since the end of February, thousands of
squatters armed with clubs, axes and guns have invaded at least 900
white-owned farms and demanded the farmers sign away their land.
</P>
<P>
   Police resisted the High Court order to evict the squatters.
They have said they lack the resources to act against the armed
invaders and that doing so could end in violence.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, police mounted a massive security operation in the
capital on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As police helicopters swooped overhead, officers erected
roadblocks at the approaches to the city center, searching vehicles
for weapons while riot police deployed across the city. Assistant
Commissioner Emmanuel Chimwanda said the operation was aimed to
avert possible political unrest ahead of upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the High Court made its ruling Thursday, Vice
President Joseph Msika asked the squatters to abandon the occupied
farms and said the government wanted to end the standoff amicably.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, Hunzvi told his cheering and singing followers
that he did not respect any court ruling that he believed was
unfair. He said he could not control the actions of squatters
claiming their ''motherland, their soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the white farmers, he said: ''The land has been left in their
hands too long.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several hundred anti-globalization protesters swarming
through the capital late today were arrested for parading without permits. The

death toll could rise much higher, with customs officials saying more than 100

Poor Taxpayers Face More Audits

   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- According to a report released today, the nation's

shifted from the rich to the poor, according to Syracuse University's
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which analyzes government data.
Among taxpayers making $100,000 or more, 1.15 percent were audited in 1999, down
from 1.66 a year earlier, TRAC reported. The rate for those making $25,000 or
less was 1.36 percent, up from 1.14 in 1998.

<P>
   SONORA, Calif. (AP) -- Two 17-year-old boys authorities believe
were planning to storm their high school and kill students and
teachers on the anniversary of the Columbine massacre have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tuolumne County Sheriff Dick Rogers said the boys, arrested
Friday, planned to make their attack on Summerville High School on
April 20, the one-year anniversary of the shooting rampage at
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rogers said it doesn't appear the boys, who were booked
on charges of conspiracy to commit murder, had been inspired by the
Columbine shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had been planning this for more than a year,'' he said.
''Since before Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Searches at the boys' homes turned up more than 40 pieces of

   Summerville High School is located in Tuolumne City, about 85

<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Edgar Martinez reached a milestone in grand
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hit a grand slam for his 200th career homer as the
Seattle Mariners beat the Toronto Blue Jays 17-6 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I broke in I never thought I would play this long, so
this is nice,'' Martinez said. ''It's not 500 home runs, but it's
still something.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who drove in five runs Friday, homered off Pedro
Borbon to give Seattle a 10-4 lead in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   John Mabry and Mark McLemore also homered for the Mariners, who
have won seven straight against the Blue Jays. There have been 22
homers in six games at SkyDome this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball is jumping out of here like I've never seen before,''
Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi said. ''Everything in this game
revolves around hitting now. Nothing favors the pitcher. I just
don't think strikes are being called these days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not blaming the umpire for the loss, but these National
League umpires haven't seen many of these pitchers, and they don't
know them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerwin Danley, a former National League umpire, worked the game.
This season, both AL and NL umpires are integrated.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't call strikes all day,'' said Fregosi, who had a
heated exchange with Danley in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first inning against Roy
Halladay (1-2) on Alex Rodriguez's two-run double and John Olerud's
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto went ahead with four runs in the third inning on Marty
Cordova's RBI groundout, Raul Mondesi's RBI single and Tony
Batista's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry and McLemore homered in the fourth to give Seattle a 5-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored five times in the sixth. Mike Cameron led
off with a double off Paul Quantrill. After McLemore singled, Stan
Javier followed with sacrifice fly. Quantrill left after walking
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon then loaded the bases by walking Olerud. Martinez
followed with his shot just over the wall in left center.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Rodriguez (1-0) pitched 3 1-3 innings for the win. He
allowed one run and three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Halladay gave up five runs on nine hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's seventh-inning homer into the fourth deck of SkyDome
made it 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added six runs in the ninth inning, keyed by
Olerud's bases-loaded double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Toronto's Shannon Stewart pulled his right hamstring while
sliding into third base in first inning. He left the game and is
day-to-day. ... Rookie Dewayne Wise, who replaced Stewart, singled
in the third inning for his first major league hit. ... Mondesi hit
his first career homer at SkyDome. ... Mondesi has two homers this
season. ... This is Martinez's 12th season in the majors.

   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- In less than 20 minutes, the Washington
Redskins added two impressive starters to a team already considered
a Super Bowl contender. Those smiles and hearty rounds of applause
in the war room weren't just for show.
</P>
<P>
   Mining a rare draft-day gold vein that came about after a series
of trades over the past few years, the Redskins chose Penn State
linebacker LaVar Arrington at No. 2 overall and Alabama tackle
Chris Samuels at No. 3 in Saturday's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, owner Dan Snyder celebrated his first NFL
draft by lighting a cigar, crossing his legs and propping his feet
on the desk.
</P>

   ''When you look at the two guys, that's why our war room looked
like it did,'' coach Norv Turner said. ''It's really hard to please
an entire room, but in a half-hour period, we pleased the defensive
staff with Arrington and turned around and pleased the offensive
staff with Samuels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' one major concern was alleviated when the
Cleveland Browns opted for Arrington's Nittany Lions teammate,
defensive end Courtney Brown, with the first overall selection.
While Brown and Arrington are considered certain Pro Bowl
prospects, the Redskins already have Bruce Smith, Marco Coleman and
Kenard Lang at defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   But Arrington, often labeled as the next Lawrence Taylor, gives
Washington the dominating linebacker presence they've been missing
since Ken Harvey's retirement. The Redskins, using a trio of young
linebackers, ranked 30th in total defense last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have the needs that we had, it was very fortunate for
us,'' said director of player personnel Vinny Cerrato, in charge of
a draft for the first time. ''The impact guys were there in the
positions we really needed them. It fell right into our laps. It
was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the draft, the Redskins flew Arrington and Samuels
to Redskin Park for an introduction to the media. The players'
entourages -- 40 people with Arrington and 14 with Samuels -- stayed
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, 6-foot-2{ and 233 pounds, won the Dick Butkus Award
for the nation's top linebacker last season. He had 72 tackles,
nine sacks and 20 tackles for losses. He also made famous the
''LaVar Leap,'' a move in which he hurdles the line of scrimmage to
stop a ball-carrier or block a kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins will start Arrington on the strong side, making
Greg Jones a reserve, but Turner said he wouldn't hesitate to use
Arrington on the weak side or on the line on passing downs.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have designated Arrington to wear No. 56, Taylor's
number.
</P>
<P>
   ''Great expectations have already been put on me,'' Arrington
said. ''But if you want to chase greatness, No. 56 is a great place
to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuels will become the instant starter at left tackle, joining
last year's second-round selection, Jon Jansen, to form a
formidable pair of bookends on the offensive line for perhaps the
next decade. Andy Heck, last year's starting left tackle, has
re-signed with the team, but he is 33 and probably will serve as
the rookie's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels, 6-5 and 291 pounds, did not allow a sack or quarterback
pressure for Alabama last season, but he missed the Orange Bowl and
the Senior Bowl with a knee injury. He was recently timed at 4.93
seconds in the 40-yard dash -- very fast for an offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been dreaming about this all my life, and my dream has
finally come true,'' Samuels said. ''I'm going to work as hard as I
can to help the organization. I've developed mentally a whole lot,
and now I'm ready for this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Arrington and Samuels said in recent days they wanted to
play in Washington. Rarely does a player chosen this high get to go
to a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to beg 'em to play,'' Cerrato said.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the Redskins have been adamant about avoiding
protracted contract negotiations with their draft picks. Arrington
and Samuels are confident that they and their management teams will
avoid drawn-out talks so the rookies can enter training camp on
time in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been clear sailing up to this point,'' Arrington said.
''There have been a couple of ripples, but the waters shouldn't get
too rough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, satisfied with receivers Michael Westbrook and
Albert Connell, passed up a chance to take Florida State receiver
Peter Warrick. Cerrato also said his phone ''hadn't rung in two or
three days'' from any other team seeking a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder confirmed there weren't serious plans to trade, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew all along we were going to stand pat,'' Snyder said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sets Aside Sequoia Tract  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. (AP) -- Dwarfed by towering trees
that are among the oldest and largest living things on earth,
President Clinton set aside 328,000 acres of federal forests
Saturday to permanently preserve 34 groves of giant sequoia.
</P>
<P>
   ''These giant sequoias clearly are the work of the ages,'' the
president said. ''They grow taller than the Statue of Liberty,
broader than a bus.'' He said they were so perfectly adapted to
their environment that none has ever been known to die of old age.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision praised by environmentalists but scorned by
loggers and others as a federal land grab, Clinton ordered the
formation of a national monument that will halt commercial timber
sales, mining and some recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles will be allowed only on
regular roads while snowmobiles will be restricted to well-traveled
areas. Hiking, horseback riding and other recreational activities
will be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about locking lands up,'' the president said. ''It
is about freeing them up for all Americans for all times.''
</P>
<P>
   For a lame-duck president seeking an environmental legacy, the
declaration gave Clinton perhaps the best conservation record in
the lower 48 states since Theodore Roosevelt, who is generally
regarded as the father of the national park system. Clinton already
had carved out 2.8 million acres as federal monuments in Utah,
Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the 30th anniversary of Earth Day, Clinton walked
on a carpet of pine needles to inspect the massive reddish trunks
in an area called the Trail of One Hundred Giants. He marveled at
the resilience of a partially charred tree that had been struck by
lightning 30 or 40 years ago. ''Look how deep the burn goes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clear, chilly day with pockets of fresh fallen snow on
the ground. Clumps of ice fell from branches overhanging Clinton's
lectern.
</P>
<P>
   The sequoia, some of which are more than 3,000 years old and
measure 100 feet around the base, once were scattered across
western North America but now grow only in about 70 groves on the
western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in central
California.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the remaining groves already are protected because
they lie within the Sequoia, Kings Canyon and Yosemite National
Parks. Clinton's declaration applies to 34 groves outside those
boundaries and within the borders of Sequoia National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The trees protected within the Giant Sequoia National Monument
already are temporarily protected from logging. The monument
designation makes protection permanent and creates a buffer zone
around the trees where commercial logging of other species would be
banned along with some forms of recreation and development,
Frampton said.
</P>
<P>
   No roads would be closed, and the area will remain open to
hikers, sightseers and for grazing and other agricultural uses,
Frampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's protective order could force the closing of a
family-owned logging company in the small town of Terra Bella and
cost up to 150 jobs, said George Frampton, chairman of the
president's Council on Environmental Quality. The order allows a
transition period of 2-2{ years for timber sales already under
contract before a complete ban on commercial logging.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say fire dangers will increase with a logging ban.
Frampton said noncommercial cutting and prescribed burning would be
permitted for ecological reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The president issued his order under the 1906 Antiquities Act,
which allows him to safeguard objects of historic or scientific
interest without going to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, in particular, have been incensed by Clinton's use
of the law. However, the White House said the same law has been
invoked to designate more than 100 monuments in 24 states and the
Virgin Islands, protecting about 70 million acres. Since Theodore
Roosevelt, only three presidents have failed to exercise the law:
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sierra Club President Joe Fontaine said Clinton was
leaving a ''priceless, irreplaceable gift to future generations of
Americans.'' Thomas Kiernan, president of the National Parks
Conservation Association, said Clinton's action ensures the sequoia
''will still inspire visitors in the year Y3K.''

<HEADLINE> Inkster Leads Longs Drugs Challenge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Calif. (AP) -- Juli Inkster is playing the front-runner
role to perfection for the second straight year in the LPGA Longs
Drugs Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famer, playing about 125 miles from her Los Altos
home, shot a 6-under-par 66 on Saturday to increase her lead to
three strokes after the third round
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit the ball right where I wanted to most of the time,''
Inkster said. ''I'm playing very well. I hit every fairway and also
putted well. I'll take that same solidness tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster had a 13-under 203 total on the Twelve Bridges course,
the lowest three-round score in tournament's five-year history.
Last year, she also led by three strokes after three rounds en
route to a four-stroke victory.
</P>
<P>
   Brandie Burton was second after a 68, and Sweden's Carin Koch
was another stroke back after her third straight 69. Australia's
Rachel Heatherington (71) and Canada's A.J. Eathorne (68) were tied
for fourth at 211.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know this course can both give and take shots pretty
easy,'' Burton said. ''The only thing you can do is just hang in
there and play the course. I just have to keep playing and not
focus on anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another memorable day for Inkster, who won five
tournaments last year and qualified for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by one stroke, she opened the round with a birdie on the
first hole and added three more through six holes. Consecutive
birdies on the back nine, the second one on a short putt at No. 13,
increased Inkster's lead to four strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was hitting solid shots all day, getting close enough to
give myself the opportunities for birdies,'' Inkster said.
</P>
<P>
   The only green Inkster missed in regulation was the 18th. She
left a putt from the short grass well short of the hole, yet came
back with an 18-footer to save par.
</P>
<P>
   Koch remained in contention with a pair of sensational shots on
the back nine. She chipped in for eagle at No. 12 and holed out
from a bunker for birdie on No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chip-ins were a reward for how well I played on the front,
they got me going again,'' Koch said. ''I had a feeling that first
one would go in, it's one of my favorite shots. It spins and rolls
out, it was the perfect situation for it.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: It was a frustrating day for Annika Sorenstam, who made
six birdies, but had three bogeys for a 69. The Swedish star is 10
strokes off the lead. ... Dorothy Delasin, the U.S. Women's Amateur
champion, birdied the 18th to finish with a 70. She is 3 over
through three rounds. ... Jill McGill, one stroke off the lead to
start the day, shot a 73.

<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Curt Schilling threw five shutout
innings Saturday night in a rehab start for the Class-A Clearwater
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling allowed one hit, one walk and hit a batter against the
Brevard County Manatees. He struck out seven in a 79-pitch outing.
His fastball topped out at 94 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It still is just a matter of getting the innings in and today
I would have liked to stretch it out to six innings but I threw to
many pitches early,'' Schilling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All my pitches were good today. I didn't think I had
exceptional play on my fastball but all my other pitches felt
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling has one more start for Clearwater on Friday against
the St. Petersburg Devil Rays.

<P>
   Kalin Bankov scored in the 21st minute and Manny Lagos, who
missed two games with an ankle injury, added a goal with just over
a minute left for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Quill, who entered with one career, had three Saturday
night. Colorado opened the scoring on Valdes' goal in the 13th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes then got the Rapids within 3-2 in the 57th minute. The
Mutiny are 3-0 at home, outscoring their opponents 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Raul Diaz Arce -- who has three goals in three games

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Henry A. Walker Jr., who turned a sugar company
laden with debts into one with assets worth billions, died of
leukemia Friday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was named president of Amfac Inc. in 1967 and chairman
and chief executive officer in 1973, a position he held until he
retired in 1983. He became chairman again in 1987 after a company
restructuring and was named chairman emeritus the following year
after Amfac was acquired by Chicago-based JMB Realty Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, Amfac became the first Hawaii company, in
1974, to reach $1 billion in annual revenues. The company later
reached annual revenues of $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's father, H. Alexander Walker Sr., joined the company in
1927 when it was known as American Factors Ltd. He became president
of the company in 1927. The elder Walker died in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   His son joined the company in 1947 as a truck driver's helper,
and worked his way through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaii-born Walker served in the Navy and was aboard the
battleship USS Missouri during the World War II surrender ceremony
in Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945. He played a key role in bringing the
Missouri to Hawaii in 1998.

Jekyll And Hyde by a half-length Saturday in the $250,000
California Derby at Golden Gate Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Bet On Red, who is not nominated to the Kentucky Derby, ran 1[
miles in 1:48.08, and paid $10.80, $5.80 and $3. Jekyll and Hyde

Poor Taxpayers Face More Audits

   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- According to a report released today, the nation's
poorest taxpayers face a greater likelihood of being audited. Though the IRS'
overall audit rate last year dropped to just under 1 percent, the focus has
shifted from the rich to the poor, according to Syracuse University's
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which analyzes government data.
Among taxpayers making $100,000 or more, 1.15 percent were audited in 1999, down
from 1.66 a year earlier, TRAC reported. The rate for those making $25,000 or
less was 1.36 percent, up from 1.14 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 120, Wizards 116, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sam Cassell scored 34 points, including
consecutive baskets at the start of overtime, as the Milwaukee
Bucks moved within a half-game of the Eastern Conference's final
playoff spot by beating the Washington Wizards 120-116 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Robinson added 31 points and 11 rebounds and Ray Allen
scored 29 points for Milwaukee, which has two games remaining. The
Bucks travel to Orlando, which currently holds the eighth seed, on
Monday and play host to the Wizards, who they've gone 2-1 against,
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Juwan Howard and Mitch Richmond each scored 21 points for the
Wizards, who didn't trail until 3:34 remained in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's 3-pointer with 12.3 seconds left gave the Bucks a
109-105 cushion, and Don Reid scored with 7.5 seconds left to make
it 109-107.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson missed a free throw with 5.9 seconds left that could
have provided a four-point lead, and Richmond sank a 3-pointer from
the right side as time expired in regulation for a 110-all tie.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee took the lead for good on back-to-back baskets by
Cassell, a layup and jumper, and outscored Washington 10-6 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond scored 12 points in the first quarter, Washington was
4-for-4 in 3-point attempts and led 37-31 after one period.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who had 17 first-half points, knocked down consecutive
3-pointers, starting a 10-3 second-quarter run for the Bucks, who
trailed 65-58 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell scored 12 points in the third quarter, but the Bucks
made only three field goals in the final seven minutes. A 9-for-9
effort from the free throw line kept Milwaukee close, and Tim
Thomas' three-point play with 18.2 seconds left cut the Wizards'
lead to 89-85.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Washington's 37 first-quarter points were a season-high,
one better than they scored March 16 against the Los Angeles
Lakers. ... Robinson and Allen were a combined 7-for-9 on 3-point
attempts in the first half. ... When one of the sweepers didn't
adequately wipe moisture off the court in the third quarter, Howard
grabbed the towel-wrapped broom and finished the job himself.

<HEADLINE> Cancer victim's dream of pro ball players realized before death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)-- Eleven-year-old Jimmy Schneeberger lost his
long bout with cancer Thursday, but not without realizing his
dream.
</P>
<P>
   With a tumor at the base of his brain stem that was first
diagnosed by doctors in 1997, the Naples, Fla. boy had little
choice but to undergo extensive and painful therapies. They
included a full regimen of radiation and chemotherapy, a bone
marrow and stem cell transplant, and three surgeries in two years --
only to have the tumor grow back.
</P>
<P>
   In December, The Wishing Well Foundation of Marco Island, Fla.,
arranged for Schneeberger to meet Dominik Hasek, Michael Peca,
Brian Holzinger and Rob Ray at a Sabres practice. As guests of the
hockey team, the Schneebergers watched the Sabres end a five-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Also that weekend, the young sports fan had the opportunity to
toss a football and shoot the breeze with Doug Flutie in the Bill's
field house before attending a Sunday game with his parents and
siblings as guests of the Bills. Players from the football team
presented Schneeberger with autographed jerseys and footballs to
show off to his friends at home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His parents said they are grateful for what their son
experienced from Buffalo athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He probably had the dream week of any little boy,'' Jim
Schneeberger said. ''It was a great, great visit, and there were a
lot of big moments for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a dream vacation on many levels, but Jimmy's
parents received some bad news from doctors at Children's Hospital
and Roswell Park Cancer Institute during their stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cancer had spread to his spine,'' said Jim Schneeberger.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental therapy at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston
didn't work. After a five-week stay there, Jimmy came home for a
visit but never went back.
</P>
<P>
   ''He died at home with his mother holding one hand and his
father holding the other,'' Jim Schneeberger told the Buffalo News.
''We were both right there when he gave his final breath.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles 6, Twins 4  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- On the night that Cal Ripken got his 3,000th
hit, the Baltimore Orioles ended a four-game skid with a 6-4
victory over the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's historic hit Saturday night came in the seventh off
Hector Carrasco, a line drive to center field just one pitch after
Albert Belle scored from third on a passed ball by rookie Matthew
LeCroy.
</P>
<P>
   Belle had doubled off Travis Miller (0-2) and advanced to third
on Harold Baines' groundout that brought Ripken to the plate and
the crowd of 18,745 to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd gave Ripken, who went 3-for-5, a two-minute ovation.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff's solo homer off Mark Redman in the ninth made it
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Worrell (2-1) picked up the victory with 1 2-3 innings of
scoreless relief. Former Twins closer Mike Trombley pitched the
ninth for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick's RBI single in the first and Charles Johnson's
fifth homer, in the second, put Baltimore up 2-0. After Ripken
singled in the fourth, Jeff Conine knocked in a run with another
single for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Koskie hit a two-out, two-run triple off Calvin Maduro in
the bottom of the inning and he scored on Ron Coomer's double,
tying it at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff's RBI single in the fifth gave Baltimore a 4-3 lead, but
the Twins tied it again in the bottom half when Torii Hunter led
off with a triple and scored on Todd Walker's single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tony Gwynn is the only other active member of the 3,000-hit
club. He's 18th all-time, just behind Cap Anson. ... Bordick has
hit in all 11 of the Orioles' games.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 5, Senators 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Battle of Ontario turned into target practice
for the Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas scored twice and Darcy Tucker, Mats Sundin and
Sergei Berezin added one each in a 5-1 Toronto victory Saturday
night that gave the Leafs a 2-0 lead in the first-round NHL playoff
series.
</P>
<P>
   Sami Salo was the only Ottawa player to put a puck behind Curtis
Joseph, who played another strong game.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 in the best-of-7 series is Monday at Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   This one was close -- but just for one period.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first, the Leafs took control with three goals
in a 3:03 span early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker pushed in a rebound at :46 as he was being knocked down
from behind by Jason York. Sundin beat Tom Barrasso with an
unscreened wrist shot from just inside the Ottawa blue line at
1:28. Thomas then whacked a one-handed Sundin pass in from the
right-wing circle at 3:49.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made it 4-0 at 12:46. Jonas Hoglund fed him a breakaway
pass on the right wing. Thomas cut to his left to the net, and
Barrasso moved across his crease and went down. Thomas put on the
brakes, stopped, turned, pulled the puck to his backhand, and slid
it into the vacated side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left to determine was the size of Toronto's winning
margin. Leafs coach Pat Quinn was feeling so comfortable that he
sent fourth-line winger Tie Domi out for a power-play shift.
</P>
<P>
   Salo got Ottawa's first goal of the series when, on a power
play, he lifted a rising wrist shot past Joseph at 19:05 of the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   Berezin, one of Toronto's best snipers, scored 5:36 into the
third period. Open on the left wing, Berezin slapped at a cross-ice
pass from Igor Korolev and the puck found the open side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Domi, knocked to the ice in the second period by Patrick
Traverse, got even by dropping Traverse with a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators are not nearly as formidable an opponent without
top defenseman Wade Redden, who can't play in the series because of
a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa outshot Toronto 30-25, but the Leafs had the best scoring
chances.

<HEADLINE> Penn State Players Go 1-2 in Draft  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Leave it to the Raiders to provide a kick to an
otherwise predictable NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   No first-round trades for the first time since 1983 -- those came
before Saturday's lottery. Penn State's Courtney Brown and LaVar
Arrington, as expected, went 1-2. And a first-round bonanza for
Washington, whose owner tolerates nothing short of a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the 17th pick, and a move sure to raise eyebrows
among the NFL's character police, especially after a season in
which two players were charged with murder and dozens more with
various lawbreaking. That's when Oakland picked Florida State
kicker Sebastian Janikowski -- a player facing bribery charges that
could get him deported to Poland. He's the first kicker taken in
the first round in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel we have an environment with our veteran players and
our coaching staff for this young man to flourish,'' Raiders coach
Jon Gruden said.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't new for the Raiders, who won Super Bowls two decades
ago with the likes of John Matuszak and Ken Stabler advancing their
wild-child image.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not surprising Janikowski was taken high -- he kicked 50
field goals the past two seasons, sent most of his kickoffs and
wowed people at the scouting combine. ''An orbital display,''
Gruden called it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they tried in vain to trade down before using the high
pick, but no one bit because all the movement was before the draft.
Moreover, most personnel people say there's not much difference
between players in the middle of the first round and the middle of
the second.
</P>
<P>
   That's not true at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The first pick was Brown, the Penn State defensive end who was
chosen by Cleveland over teammate Arrington, a linebacker promptly
snatched by the Redskins. It was the first time since 1984, when
Irving Fryar and Dean Steinkuhler of Nebraska went 1-2, that the
top two choices were from the same school, and only the third time
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which had obtained picks 2-3 in trades with New
Orleans and San Francisco, grabbed Alabama's Chris Samuels, whom it
hopes will play left tackle for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really hard to please an entire room, but in a half-hour
period, we pleased the defensive staff with Arrington and turned
around and pleased the offensive staff with Samuels,'' said coach
Norv Turner. Maybe demanding owner Dan Snyder will stay pleased,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington even upped the expectations by choosing No. 56, the
number worn by Lawrence Taylor, to whom he's often been compared.
And while all the ''next LTs'' have proven to be less than that,
all Arrington has to do for now is provide some impact to a defense
that ranked next to last in the NFL even while Washington was
winning the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, a native of Poland with the strongest leg most NFL
people have ever seen, wasn't the only player who was chosen
despite problems with the law. In fact, he wasn't the only Florida
State transgressor taken.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Peter Warrick, chosen by Cincinnati with the
fourth overall pick, was suspended for two games last season after
he got $400 worth of department store merchandise for $21. And
Laveranues Coles, tossed off the Florida State team as part of the
same incident, was taken by the Jets in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski was taken higher than any kicker since Russell
Erxleben was taken No. 11 overall by New Orleans in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Redskins, the team that probably did the best in
the three rounds that took place Saturday were Baltimore and the
New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens, who had choices five and 10, got just what they
wanted for their anemic offense, a running back and receiver. Jamal
Lewis of Tennessee was the back, going at No. 5, and Travis Taylor
of Florida was the receiver at No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had four first-round picks, two of their own and two
they obtained from Tampa Bay in the trade Tuesday for Keyshawn
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably for a team being run by Bill Parcells, they went for
defense at Nos. 12 and 13 with defensive end Shaun Ellis of
Tennessee and linebacker John Abraham of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But they pulled a surprise with the 18th pick, choosing Chad
Pennington of Marshall as their quarterback of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''That really wasn't really the talk,'' said Pennington, who,
like most analysts, expected to go to Pittsburgh, Denver or San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After Brown, Arrington, Samuels and Warrick, Lewis went to
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Then Philadelphia chose defensive tackle Corey Simon of Florida
State; Arizona took running back Thomas Jones of Virginia, and
Pittsburgh took wide receiver Plaxico Burress of Michigan State,
who had alienated the Eagles by skipping a workout to attend the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took Brian Urlacher of New Mexico, a 260-pounder they
will use at linebacker although he also played tight end and safety
in college. Baltimore then chose Taylor, and the New York Giants,
using only two of their 15 allotted minutes, jumped on Heisman
Trophy winner Ron Dayne, the leading rusher in college history.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets then took Ellis and Abraham and Green Bay chose Miami
tight end Bubba Franks, who is expected to replace Mark Chmura, who
missed most of last season with a neck injury and was accused last
week of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what felt good to us,'' new coach Mike Sherman said.
''I think Franks has the ability to be a starter in this offense.
Whatever role he plays on our team this year, he'll be a big target
for Brett Favre.''
</P>
<P>
   After Franks, Denver took California cornerback Deltha O'Neal;
San Francisco went for Michigan State linebacker Julian Peterson;
the Raiders took Janikowski; the Jets took Pennington; Seattle took
running back Shaun Alexander of Alabama; Detroit took Oklahoma
offensive tackle Stockar McDougle; Kansas took Jackson State wide
receiver Sylvester Morris; Seattle used its second first-rounder on
Wisconsin offensive lineman Chris McIntosh; and Carolina took
cornerback Rashard Anderson of Jackson State, the second player in
three picks from Walter Payton's Division I-AA alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, terrible at cornerback last season, took Ohio
State corner Ahmed Plummer; Minnesota when for Boston College
defensive tackle Chris Hovan; Buffalo took a potential replacement
for Bruce Smith in Erik Flowers, a defensive end from Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets then used their fourth first-rounder pick on West
Virginia tight end Anthony Becht; Indianapolis took BYU linebacker
Rob Morris; Jacksonville took wide receiver R. Jay Soward of
Southern Cal; Tennessee chose Syracuse linebacker Keith Bulluck;
and St. Louis finished the first round with running back Trung
Canidate of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third round, Buffalo chose All-America Corey Moore
of Virginia Tech. A 5-11, 223 pound defensive end in college, he's
projected as a linebacker in the NFL, although his size makes him a
question mark.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who already have two players from Hofstra in their
starting lineup, took a third, quarterback Giovanni Carmazzi with
the third pick of the third round. Louisville's Chris Redman, who
dropped because of questions about his back, was the third QB taken
Saturday. He went to Baltimore with the 13th pick of the third
round.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers 106, Knicks 96  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The New York Knicks' chances of winning the
Atlantic Division took a huge hit Saturday night as they lost
decisively on the road for the second night in a row, 106-96 to the
Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Miller scored 18 points to lead six Cleveland players in
double figures. New York (49-31), coming off a 15-point loss at
Toronto, fell 1{ games behind Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston had 21 points for the Knicks, who could never
mount a comeback after Cleveland used a 13-4 run to open a 23-12
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miller led Cleveland's early charge with four points, four
rebounds and three assists in the first quarter. Three of Miller's
first-quarter rebounds were at the offensive end as the Cavaliers
continually beat the Knicks to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland controlled every aspect of the game except free
throws, where New York made 34 of 40, led by Houston's 10-for-10
performance. The Cavaliers were 15-of-18 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Lamond Murray scored 16 points, Shawn Kemp had 15, Bob Sura and
Mark Bryant 14 apiece and Wesley Person 12 for Cleveland
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby each scored 15 points for New
York and Sprewell had a game-high 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   New York made just four of 18 shots in the second quarter as
Cleveland extended a 28-23 lead to 59-45 by halftime. Miller had 12
points and five teammates scored eight apiece in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The final margin of 10 points was the closest New York got in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cavs' 30th anniversary all-time team, as selected by
fans, was honored at halftime. Eight of the 12 members were
present: Mark Price, Larry Nance, Austin Carr, Bobby (Bingo) Smith,
Shawn Kemp, Nate Thurmond, Jim Chones and Campy Russell. Unable to
attend were Brad Daugherty, World B. Free, John (Hot Rod) Williams
and Terrell Brandon. ... The sellout crowd of 20,582 was
Cleveland's sixth this season. ... The Cavs had a season-low nine
turnovers. ... The Knicks have lost four in a row in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Fortify Defense in Draft  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers committed
their top four picks to resolving gaping defensive holes. Only then
did they draft a possible future replacement for Steve Young, whose
own football future remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, with two first-round picks for the first time in
six years, on Saturday used the 16th overall selection on
pass-rushing linebacker Julian Peterson of Michigan State and the
24th pick on cornerback Ahmed Plummer, a three-year starter at Ohio
State.
</P>
<P>
   They stuck with the defensive emphasis in the second round,
adding Virginia Tech defensive end John Engelberger with the 35th
overall pick and using No. 48 for Texas A&AMP;M cornerback Jason
Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have filled needs,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ''Right
now, we've got a better defensive huddle than we had yesterday. The
outside edges on defense needed lots of improvement and we had to
address those immediately. That's the direction we went early in
the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only in the third round that the 49ers veered to offense,
making Giovanni Carmazzi the 65th selection and the second
quarterback taken in the draft behind Marshall's Chad Pennington.
San Francisco added Hawaii linebacker Jeff Ulbrich with the 86th
pick in the third round after trading their a fourth- and
fifth-round pick to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just love his escapability and mobility. We love his
upside,'' Mariucci said of Carmazzi, who becomes the third player
from Division I-AA Hofstra to join the 49ers. Pro Bowl safety Lance
Schulters and tackle Dave Fiore are the others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hofstra is now one of the football factories,'' Mariucci
joked.
</P>
<P>
   Carmazzi was the first quarterback drafted by Walsh as a
projected future starter since he took Joe Montana in the third
round in 1979. Walsh traded for Young in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're excited to have him. We think he was the best
quarterback physically in the draft,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of speculation about the 49ers' interest in
Pennington as a potential successor to Young, San Francisco's
38-year-old quarterback who hasn't played since a head blow at
Arizona last Sept. 27 left him with his fourth concussion in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who has said through his agent that he's leaning toward
resuming his playing career this season, is expected to meet with
the 49ers in the next couple of weeks to discuss his future with
the team. Though medical reports on Young have been encouraging,
team officials said he still has not been cleared to play again.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said the 49ers considered Pennington but opted to pass,
deciding their defensive needs were too pressing and their belief
in Carmazzi's potential to develop into a starter whether he spends
the first season learning from Young or Jeff Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good opportunity,'' said Carmazzi, a scrambling
quarterback who set 11 records at Hofstra, including 71 career
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, the best thing for the 49ers is for Steve Young to
come back and I would have a chance to learn from one of the
best,'' Carmazzi said. ''And Jeff Garcia showed last year he was a
capable quarterback. I just want to come in and learn. That's what
I'm most looking forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennington wound up with the New York Jets as the 18th player
selected, two picks after San Francisco got Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to rectify our problems on defense,'' Mariucci said.
''We can have a Steve Young and Joe Montana standing next to me on
the sidelines and if you give up 45 points in a game, no
quarterback can make that up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers already envision Peterson, whose 25 sacks in two years
at Michigan State ranks second on the school's career list, as the
starting outside linebacker replacing former Pro Bowl selection Lee
Woodall, let go as part of San Francisco's offseason $24 million
salary cap purge.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson brings together a rare combination of power and speed --
he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.57 seconds, giving the 49ers a
linebacker they can blitz as well as use in pass coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who ranks sixth in Ohio State history with 14 career
interceptions, fortifies the 49ers' most troubled secondary
position.
</P>
<P>
   While Garcia returns after playing relatively well in filling in
for Young at quarterback, San Francisco's secondary was unsettled
through the 1999 season with seven different players starting at
cornerback. The 49ers surrendered a league-high 36 touchdown
passes, fourth most in NFL history.

   ''We needed a guy like him,'' Mariucci said of Plummer. ''He was
tested time and time again in the Big Ten and oftentimes they
preferred to throw away from him because he was the shutdown guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said he likes the notion of coming in as a projected
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to playing and contributing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who also forced 10 fumbles in his two seasons at
Michigan State, said he believes it won't take him long to make his
mark in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lot of confidence,'' he said. ''I always felt I had
the ability to be a first-round draft pick. I'm trying to be the
best. I'm trying to become my own icon.''

<HEADLINE> Expos-Phillies Game Rained Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rain kept the Philadelphia Phillies from
playing, but a game in Florida had many people in the organization
watching.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies and Expos were rained out Saturday night before
they could get underway. Philadelphia ace Curt Schilling,
recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, made a start for
Single-A Clearwater.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was impressive in his third rehab start, throwing 79
pitches in five shutout innings. He allowed one hit and one walk
and struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been nothing but encouraging,'' Phillies manager Terry
Francona said. ''Except for a few days in February, he has been
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's pitches topped out at 94 mph and averaged between 91
and 92 mph, but Francona refused to discuss when he would rejoin
the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needs to complete spring training,'' Francona said. ''We
need to be careful how we treat Schilling. When he's ready believe
me we'll pitch him. His arm will dictate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies were debating whether to move Schilling to Triple-A
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre or leave him in Clearwater for his next rehab
start.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want him to pitch, that is the important thing,'' Francona
said, ''Everyone would like him to pitch to better competition but
we don't want him to miss a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling has a timetable that he is shooting for.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did some things tonight that made me feel good,'' he said.
''If all goes well, I'm definitely going to pitch on the 20th in
Clearwater and then on the 25th in Scranton.''
</P>
<P>
   He could return to the Phillies and make a start at home on
April 30 against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   '' That is the date I had planned on for three months,''
Schilling said.
</P>
<P>
   No makeup date has been announced for the rainout, which was
announced after a delay of 1 hour, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will keep their pitching rotations the same with
Philadelphia's Andy Ashby going against Montreal's Hideki Irabu on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame we couldn't get the game in,'' Montreal manager
Felipe Alou said.

<HEADLINE> 600 World Bank Protesters Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-globalization protesters swarmed through
the heart of the capital late Saturday and came face to face with
lines of helmeted police in a tense show of will sparked by
animosity toward international lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated 600 people were arrested for parading without a
permit, and similar charges, and led peacefully to waiting buses.
Police pulled the fake red nose off one protester made up as a
clown as he filed into the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Riot-ready police made some 50 blocks off-limits around the
World Bank headquarters, barring everyone from getting past metal
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests which began early in the day when police raided
protesters' headquarters continued into the into the cool, damp
night -- weather reminiscent of Seattle, scene last December of
similar demonstrations against international financial policy.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Charles Ramsey said those arrested would be charged
with ''parading without a permit and refusal to disperse, among
other things.'' Some might also be charged with blocking traffic,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey said it would take several hours just to get the
protesters, loaded, transported and processed at two locations in
the city and that how long they remain in custody would depend, in
part, on how cooperative they are.
</P>
<P>
   Those who provide identification will be fine $50, Ramsey said.
Those who don't will be fined $300.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a right to be here and we also have a right to protest
and we also have a right to walk away,'' said protester Larry
Holmes, complaining that police had penned demonstrators in a
barricaded area to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters complained that there was no warning before arrests
began, but Ramsey said they were warned to get back on the
sidewalks when they began to swarm into the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe you didn't hear it with all the people, but we did give
a warning,'' Ramsey told reporters at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how many of us are arrested today, we are resolved
to carry our message to the streets tomorrow,'' said Ilyse Hogue of
the Mobilization for Global Justice, the key organizer of the
weekend demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, pouring in by the busload all day for demonstrations
meant to peak Sunday and Monday, took over an abandoned row house
in a poor part of the city as neighbors shouted at police to do
something, and another group stripped down to their underwear in an
anti-sweatshop demonstration in trendy Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest group of protesters congregated as close as they
could get to the World Bank and its sister lending institution, the
International Monetary Fund, upset that police had shut down their
protest headquarters early in the day, declaring it to be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters still holding their breakfast plates streamed out of
their headquarters, an old warehouse where they were making signs,
banners and puppets, and drifted 10 blocks away to another staging
center.
</P>
<P>
   There, they practiced hymns, street theater and passive
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will not deter us,''' said Molly McCarthy, 21, of
Seattle, a protest organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost our food, and our cooking supplies, and we've got
thousands of people to feed,'' said another organizer, Antonia
Jahasz, 29, of Washington. ''With one of the highest homicide rates
in the country, D.C.'s finest are guarding our dangerous puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they moved through the first headquarters, authorities
also found a plastic container with a rag stuffed inside to serve
as a wick, said Terry Gainer, executive assistant police chief.
</P>
<P>
   He said it ''looks like a Molotov cocktail.'' Police also found
soda bottles with the tops or bottoms cut off, Gainer said.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders said police had merely come across art supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''They found a plastic bottle that had rags in it that were
being used to get paint off of people's hands,'' said Adam
Eidinger, 26, of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after the raid -- and well before the mass arrests
at nightfall -- Ramsey said police did not intend ''to violate
anyone's First Amendment rights'' and allowed some protesters to
retrieve the puppets.
</P>
<P>
   In a light rain, with police sirens sounding almost constantly
downtown, tourists who normally stroll to the gates of the White
House to snap pictures were held behind barriers across the street.
</P>
<P>
   In a poor section of northwest Washington, more than 100
protesters gathered by an abandoned row house and a few went on the
roof and chained themselves there, holding signs saying, ''Stop the
evictions,'' and ''Housing for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Police blocked off the area while neighbors loudly demanded that
they move in and get the protesters out. ''They have no business
being in our neighborhood like this,'' said Leuns Moore, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours after the protesters took over the house, police went
on the roof, cut the protesters' chains and arrested nine of them
for unlawful entry.
</P>
<P>
   A protest outside a Gap clothing store in Georgetown turned into
an impromptu striptease when police took a man wearing a grass
skirt with nothing underneath into custody and made him put on
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a dozen or so other men and women in the crowd of
200 to strip down to their skivvies.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Saturday, police had arrested a number of people for
such things as possessing materials to set up blockades and had
confiscated an undisclosed amount of ammunition in one raid.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters accuse the World Bank and IMF of destroying the
environment with dams and similar projects, allowing sweatshops and
imposing harsh debt-repayment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, police raided a house where they found an
undisclosed amount of small-caliber ammunition and firebomb
instructions, Gainer said. The raid also produced a large supply of
pipes and chicken wire used to make human blockades.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the building was a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's really just an escalation of tactics designed to
keep us from being able to express ourselves,'' said Han Shan of
Baltimore, from a group called Mobilization for Social Justice.

<HEADLINE> Revolution 2, United 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Imad Baba scored two goals, including an
overtime strike, as the New England Revolution beat D.C. United 2-1
on Saturday night for their first victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On the winning goal, Baba took a short pass from William Sunsing
and cracked a 6-yard shot off the left post, cleanly beating
goalkeeper Tom Prestus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to get it on goal,'' Baba said. ''I made a late
run and yelled for it -- I'm not sure he even saw me, but he laid it
off beautifully. I never saw the ball go in. I just saw it hit the
post.''
</P>
<P>
   New England improved to 1-2-2, while D.C. United fell to 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United opened the scoring when midfielder Eddie Pope found
Jamie Moreno with a long pass through the New England defense.
Moreno ran uncontested into the Revolution area and put the ball
inside the right post from 12 yards out in the 19th minute.
</P>
<P>
   It was Moreno's third goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution missed several chances to tie until D.C. defender
Jeff Agoos took down Sunsing in the 72nd minute. The ensuing
penalty was slammed home to the left side by Baba.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team could produce a winning goal in the first
five-minute overtime period, but Baba put the game away early in
the next period.

<HEADLINE> Ripken's 3,000th One of Many Feats  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken didn't need 3,000 hits as his claim
to fame. The Baltimore Orioles third baseman long ago accomplished
enough to earn a bronze plaque in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's 3,000th hit, delivered Saturday night in Minnesota, is
merely one more milestone in an outstanding Hall of Fame career. He
is the 24th player in baseball history to amass 3,000 hits and only
the seventh to also have 400 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ripken will always be known primarily for just one number --
2,632. That's how many consecutive games he played from 1982 to
1998, a streak that assured him lasting notoriety before he began
flirting with such round numbers as 400 and 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that he can add to the legacy that he already
has. He's on almost all of the all-time lists,'' Orioles manager
Mike Hargrove said. ''I don't think at this point in his career,
anything he does or doesn't do will make or break his legacy.
That's already been established. He's obviously going into the Hall
of Fame, and I would be surprised if it wasn't on the first ballot.
I think it's very deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, members of the exclusive 3,000-hit club have
three important traits -- consistency at the plate, endurance and
longevity. If you're going to average 150 hits over 20 seasons,
you've got to be in the lineup almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't get caught up in enormity of the number 3,000,''
Ripken said. ''It was always important for me to go out and play
the game as best I could and to have some success. I'm proud of the
fact that I've been able to be productive for a long period of
time. That's what it means to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before he was a baseball player, Ripken was a baseball fan.
He knows that when milestones are reached, the joy of the occasion
extends far beyond the feelings of the record-breaker. Ripken was
touched last year by the fanfare surrounding Tony Gwynn and Wade
Boggs when each recorded his 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a magical number, no doubt,'' Ripken said. ''I saw Gwynn
and Boggs do it, and I think everyone gets involved in the
celebration. I see it as a celebration of baseball, not necessarily
the individual accomplishment. It's a means of comparing players
from era to era.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly how Ripken viewed the hoopla on Sept. 5, 1995,
when he broke Lou Gehrig's record of playing in 2,130 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a celebration for baseball, not me. I just happened to
be the person that was of focus at that moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On that night at Camden Yards, his father was there to share the
moment. Cal Ripken Sr. died during spring training in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moments like this give me an opportunity to look back at my
career,'' Ripken said shortly after his 3,000th hit. ''And my dad
was a big part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With his dad as the Orioles' third base coach, Ripken got his
first hit as a 20-year-old rookie on Aug. 16, 1981, off Dennis Lamp
of the Chicago White Sox. He went 5-for-39 that year, but his
production picked up considerably the following season when he
became the Orioles' regular shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   He got his 1,000th hit on June 16, 1987, off Rich Bordi of the
New York Yankees and No. 2000 on July 10, 1993, off Wilson Alvarez
of the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   From May 30, 1982, to Sept. 19, 1998, Ripken didn't miss a game.
That's one reason he was able to reached the 3,000-mark despite
having only two 200-hit seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you play that many games straight, you're going to get a
lot of hits,'' said teammate Will Clark. ''He was out there every
day. That's why they call him the Iron Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people call Ripken the finest player to wear an Oriole
uniform. In this era of free agency, Ripken is a rarity in that he
has spent his entire career with one team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always put a level on importance in playing in Baltimore
because I'm from here. I always wanted to be an Oriole,'' he said.
''I guess I'm lucky in that respect.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Ripken Gets 3,000th Hit  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cal Ripken can add another big number -- 3,000
-- to his Hall of Fame resume.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles star, already renowned for playing a
record 2,632 straight games, got hit No. 3,000 with his third
single Saturday night in a 6-4 victory over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken became the 24th player to reach the milestone, doing it a
year after both Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs joined the club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was relieved, I felt a weight was lifted from my
shoulders,'' Ripken said. ''I thought about how lucky you are and
how you started.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a phenomenal experience, one I'm really glad is over,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, Ripken signed autographs for about 15
minutes for some of the fans who had given him a two-minute
standing ovation. The gesture was reminiscent of the victory lap he
took at Camden Yards after breaking Lou Gehrig's ''Iron Man''
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to give back as much as I can and I thought it was
right and appropriate to celebrate with the fans,'' he said. ''It
was part of a moment. I wanted to sign as many autographs as I
could and put a date on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken lined a clean single to center field off Twins reliever
Hector Carrasco for No. 3,000. He was greeted at first base by
coach and longtime teammate Eddie Murray, who also got his 3,000th
hit at the Metrodome while playing for Cleveland in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''To meet Eddie at first base, that was a special moment,''
Ripken said. ''He said, 'Way to go, welcome to the club.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Ripken shook hands with Twins first baseman Ron
Coomer while the souvenir ball was retrieved by Baltimore's Will
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken took the ball, walked over to the first-base stands and
flipped it underhand to his wife, Kelly, wearing a bright orange
blazer and flanked by their two children.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken returned to first base, took off his cap to acknowledge a
standing ovation and then tapped his heart once as he mouthed the
words ''Thank you'' to the crowd of 18,745.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the celebration, the Orioles spilled out of the
dugout to congratulate Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Said Twins coach Paul Molitor, eighth on the career list with
3,319 hits: ''Certain players, because of the way they handle
themselves, seem to transcend whatever uniform they happen to be
wearing. He definitely has the respect of all baseball fans across
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken entered the season nine hits shy of the mark, but was
just 6-for-34 (.176) going into Saturday, the 2,800th game of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He grounded out in his first at-bat, then singled cleanly to
right in the fourth off Sean Bergman. In the fifth, Ripken hit a
high bouncer that third baseman Corey Koskie fielded, but had no
play on for an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Right before Ripken came to bat in the seventh, Twins manager
Tom Kelly was booed when he went to the mound to make a pitching
change. Carrasco relieved Travis Miller, and his first pitch went
for a passed ball that scored Albert Belle and put the Orioles
ahead 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken singled right up the middle on the next pitch, a high
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hit the best I had,'' Carrasco said.
</P>
<P>
   In his last at-bat, Ripken flied out.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken conquered a bad back and the butterflies that had stoked
a season-long slump.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just have to deal with it, plow through and get those
hits,'' he said recently. ''But I can see why someone would say the
last few are the hardest ones to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken became the seventh player in major league history to get
3,000 hits and 400 home runs. He was the AL MVP in 1983 and 1991
and the Rookie of the Year in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 24 players to get 3,000 hits, 10 have done it on the
road. Ripken was born and raised in the Baltimore area, and Orioles
fans were hoping to see him reach the mark at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles play the Twins again Sunday before returning home to
face Tampa Bay on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all of us wish it could have been done in Baltimore,''
Orioles manager Mike Hargrove said. ''But for him to go ahead and
get all three of them tonight was fairly dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-time All-Star has always been fond on the Metrodome,
where his .321 average is 43 points higher than his career mark.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken played his 2,000th consecutive game at the Dome, on Aug.
1, 1994, on his way to breaking Gehrig's record a year later, a
streak he said was easier to pursue than 3,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken is the third player to get his 3,000th hit at the
18-year-old Metrodome, the ballpark where it has happened more than
anywhere else. Dave Winfield did it there on Sept. 16, 1993, and
Murray did it on June 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the fifth time the Twins have been involved with a
3,000th hit, tying the Cleveland Indians for the most. Rod Carew
(Aug. 4, 1995) and Paul Molitor (Sept. 16, 1996) reached the mark
on the road while with the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said he was eager to get the milestone out of the way so
he could turn his attention toward a far more pressing goal: to
stay healthy and duplicate the unprecedented offensive prowess he
showed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken hit .340 with a .584 slugging percentage last year, both
career highs, but he twice was placed on the disabled list -- for
the first time in his career -- because of back pain and played in
only 86 games.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Ripken reached No. 3,000 in a win made this moment
even more special.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy I got a few hits tonight,'' Ripken said.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Demonstrators in Little Havana called Elian Gonzalez's father a
traitor and a coward on Saturday while Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in an interview
with CBS to be aired Sunday, denied accusations he was abusive and said he was
being falsely characterized. The protesters' chants came a day after affidavits
filed by the boy's Miami relatives alleged the father abused his ex-wife and
6-year-old son. The 4{-month custody struggle was in the hands of the federal
appeals court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary injunction Thursday blocking
Elian from leaving the country. The Justice Department also agreed that day to

Stevens was abducted from his occupied property near Macheke, 75 miles east of
Harare, and driven into the bush where he was shot dead, said Commercial Farmers
Union officials. Four of Stevens' neighbors who went to his assistance after he
was confronted by squatters Saturday were abducted and their whereabouts were

Congo Blast Rescue Mission Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Red Cross workers desperately searched for survivors
Saturday, a day after a mysterious chain of explosions at a hangar at Kinshasa's
international airport reportedly killed between 40 and 50 people. Official radio
put the death toll at 10, but reports from Belgium said between 40 and 50 people
had been killed -- including victims hit by debris up to several miles away. The
death toll could rise much higher, with customs officials saying more than 100

Poor Taxpayers Face More Audits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- According to a report released today, the nation's
poorest taxpayers face a greater likelihood of being audited than wealthy
Americans. Though the IRS' overall audit rate last year dropped to just under 1
percent, the focus has shifted from the rich to the poor, according to Syracuse
University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which analyzes
government data. Among taxpayers making $100,000 or more, 1.15 percent were
audited in 1999, down from 1.66 a year earlier, TRAC reported. The rate for
those making $25,000 or less was 1.36 percent, up from 1.14 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 100, Pistons 94  </HEADLINE>
By KEN BERGER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson, his sore elbow getting more
swollen by the minute, scored 30 points Saturday night as the
Philadelphia 76ers beat the Detroit Pistons 100-94.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons star Grant Hill lasted only 16 minutes on his sprained
left ankle and scored a season-low four points as the Pistons
missed a chance to clinch a playoff berth. The Sixers pulled within
a game of the Knicks for the third spot in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia also moved 1{ games in front of idle Charlotte for
the fourth spot, which would give them homecourt advantage in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   George Lynch turned in a gritty performance with 17 points and
15 rebounds, but the Sixers still struggled to work Toni Kukoc into
the offense and were sloppy at times with 22 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With Hill watching from the bench in obvious pain, a disjointed
performance was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of disjointed, Iverson's shooting elbow was looking
worse and worse. Wrapped in a white stocking-like cloth, it was
gruesomely swollen. Iverson could barely straighten it, and he had
to leave the game once because it was bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, also playing with a broken big toe and partially torn
rotator cuff, made 11 of 22 shots and took quite a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Hill sprained his left ankle last Monday at Minnesota while
scoring 36 points in a 102-100 loss. He had only 12 points in 31
minutes Wednesday night in a 90-73 victory over Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Hill hobbled around for awhile in the first half as the Pistons
trailed 50-47, then tried to come out and play in the third
quarter. His ankle heavily taped, Hill's limp was even worse after
halftime. He left the game with 9:47 left in the third and never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers had already burned what was essentially a four-man
team for three quick baskets for a 56-49 lead. With Hill out, they
extended it to as many as 13 in the third and 17 in the fourth
before a garbage-time rally produced the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   With all his bumps, bruises and bandages, Iverson was the focal
point during an intense stretch that was physical enough for
helmets and shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, a former high school football star, took a shot in the
head from Jerome Williams at the top of the key before setting up
Tyrone Hill's layup for a 43-39 lead with 2:21 left in the second
quarter. Moments later, he stood near the foul line with his
clenched fists on his forehead and battered elbows in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was bluffing how much pain he was in, because he
sprinted free on an inbounds play and drove down the middle for a
48-43 lead with 43.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Iverson was running back on defense with his eyes
on the ball when he collided brutally with Williams, who was
setting a pick. Williams, a fellow Georgetown alum, must have felt
sorry for the little guy; he hugged Iverson so he wouldn't hit the
deck.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Iverson was called for a foul. A grimace on his
face, Iverson shouted at every referee he could find. Williams hit
1-of-2 to cut it to 50-44 with 30.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Stackhouse scored 15 for Detroit, and Kukoc and Matt
Geiger each had 15 for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Stackhouse gave everyone a scare when he went down
clutching his knee under the basket with 2:43 left in the first
quarter. A hush came over the crowd, but Stackhouse only bumped
knees with a defender and returned to the game. ... The guys from
the ''WHASSSSSUUUUPPP!'' beer commercial were in the stands and
entertained the crowd with a rendition. They entertained players in
the Phillies' baseball clubhouse a couple of nights ago. ... The
scoreboard malfunctioned numerous times, showing the wrong score
and incorrect point totals for players.

<HEADLINE> FAA Advises To Redesign 737 Rudders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Federal Aviation Administration engineering
board will recommend redesign of the Boeing 737 rudder control
systems, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   Citing government and aviation industry officials, the Post
reported in Sunday's editions that the recommendation will be made
in response to tests that indicated the system could fail in
several ways that, however unlikely, could cause the rudder to move
unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   It said one previously unsuspected failure could involve a small
buildup of ice in one control link.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said both the FAA and Boeing Co. stressed that the
possible failures are so unlikely that no immediate mechanical
fixes are necessary but that, pending redesign or modification of
the rudder, they are following the board's suggestion to come up
with new pilot emergency procedures, new mechanical inspections and
new training for pilots and mechanics to alert them to the early
signs of rudder problems.
</P>
<P>
   The paper noted that the 737 is the most numerous jetliner in
commercial service, with 3,630 built so far, and that they have
compiled one of the best safety records in aviation after 99.7
million flight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really haven't found anything that would cause us to do any
remedial action,'' Thomas McSweeny, the FAA associate administrator
for regulation and certification, told the Post. ''We don't want to
push the science (and) create unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Erickson, the agency's director of aircraft
certification service, told the paper the FAA is working closely
with Boeing on new emergency procedures and that Boeing is already
working on a rudder redesign.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott scored a season-high 15 points
and the San Antonio Spurs overcame the absence of Tim Duncan to
defeat the Utah Jazz 106-83 Saturday night and keep alive their
slim hopes for a Midwest Division title.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson had 19 points and 12 rebounds for the Spurs, who
must win their final two games and hope Utah loses its final three
in order to win the division.
</P>
<P>
   Utah has lost three of its last four games.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio played its second straight game without Duncan, who
is out with a slight tear of the lateral meniscus in his left knee.
The Spurs are 3-3 without Duncan this season.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Rose also had 15 for San Antonio, which has won four of
its last five. Starting in Duncan's absence, Samaki Walker added 14
points.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone led Utah with 23 points, while Jeff Hornacek added
13.
</P>
<P>
   After leading by 11 points at halftime, San Antonio opened the
third quarter with a 10-2 run to lead 61-42 on two free throws by
Mario Elie with 8:42 to play in the period.
</P>
<P>
   After San Antonio stretched the lead to as many as 20 points,
69-49, Utah closed the third quarter with 10-6 run and trailed
75-59 after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had four points early in the fourth quarter as San
Antonio pushed the lead to 83-62 with 9:30 to play. Utah could get
no closer than 16 points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio closed the first half with a 10-4 run to lead 51-40
at halftime. Robinson had 15 first-half points to lead the way for
the Spurs, which outscored Utah 28-17 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Antonio is now 29-10 at the Alamodome this season. ...
David Robinson recorded the 2,500th block of his career, which is
No. 6 all-time in NBA history. ... The Spurs and Jazz split four
games this season, with both teams winning a pair at home. ... The
Spurs are now 42-18 all time against Utah in games played at San
Antonio. ... Utah guard John Stockton played in his 1,255th game,
surpassing Paul Silas for 7th place on the all-time NBA list.

<HEADLINE> O's' Trombley Sees 3,000 Hit Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Baltimore relief pitcher Mike Trombley has
seen this before.
</P>
<P>
   When Cal Ripken collected his 3,000th hit in the Orioles' 6-4
victory at Minnesota on Saturday night, it was the fourth time that
Trombley witnessed the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three of my teammates have done it now,'' Trombley said after
getting his first save. ''And I threw the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   Trombley played for the Twins when teammate Paul Molitor hit No.
3,000 in 1996 and when Dave Winfield did it for Minnesota in 1993.
On June 30, 1995, Trombley gave up Eddie Murray's 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been joking with Eddie about it all week,'' Trombley said
of Baltimore's first-base coach. Murray was the first person to
greet Ripken after his historic single.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ripken, Murray and Winfield reached 3,000 at the Metrodome.
That means, Trombley was on the field each time the milestone took
place in Minnesota, and four out of the 24 times it has happened in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a big baseball fan,'' Trombley said. ''I'm a fan of trivia
so it's really neat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The players have all been similar,'' he added. ''Cal was like,
the hit is nice but the moment is over and it's a team thing.
That's how he approaches the game.''

<HEADLINE> Reds 5, Dodgers 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eddie Taubensee, batting cleanup for the
first time since 1998, matched his career-high with four RBIs
Saturday night as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Los Angeles Dodgers
5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee's two-run double off Alan Mills (0-1) in the seventh
snapped a 3-3 tie. Barry Larkin and Ken Griffey Jr. drew two-out
walks before Taubensee lined a 2-2 pitch into the right-field
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williamson (1-1) got two outs for the victory. Danny
Graves pitched two innings to earn his team's first save of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth doubled to lead off the ninth and moved to
third on a single by Devon White. Mark Grudzielanek followed with
an RBI groundout, advancing White to second base. One out later,
Graves walked Gary Sheffield before getting Eric Karros to ground
out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped a five-game Dodgers' winning streak, which
equaled their longest since they won seven straight in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee, who had four RBIs in a game five times previously,
gave the Reds a 2-0 lead by hitting a two-out, two-run homer off
rookie Eric Gagne in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle pitched shutout ball until Sheffield hit a two-out,
three-run homer in the fifth to put the Dodgers ahead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tied the game off Jeff Williams in the sixth when Dante
Bichette hit a one-out double and scored on D.T. Cromer's single.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne, recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque to make the start,
allowed two runs and three hits in five innings. Neagle was lifted
after giving up four hits and three runs in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sheffield has hit safely in all 11 Dodgers games with four
homers and 12 RBIs. He has hit in 17 straight games dating to last
year, with nine homers in those 17 games. ... Gagne was expected to
be a member of the Dodgers' starting rotation entering spring
training, but was optioned to Albuquerque after going 0-2 with a
15.63 ERA in four exhibition games. ... Sean Casey, normally the
Reds' first baseman, hit off a tee Friday, took soft-toss batting
practice Saturday, and might take live batting practice Sunday.
McKeon said he expects Casey, who broke his right thumb in the
final exhibition game, to be sidelined another 10 days or so. Casey
hit .332 last season. ... Taubensee's homer, a drive just inside
the right-field foul pole that traveled an estimated 402 feet, was
just the eighth ever hit into the second level of seats in the
39-year history of Dodger Stadium. The homer was the first for
Taubensee, who hit a career-high 21 last year.

<HEADLINE> Photographer Arrested in WDC Protest  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning
photographer for The Washington Post was among about 600 people
arrested at a protest against international financial policies
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Carol Guzy after escorting her from a
cordoned-off area where they had taken into custody demonstrators
protesting policies of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Press photographer Kamenko Pajic said officers took
him and Guzy from the protest area, but police released him before
arresting Guzy. She is among Post photographers who won this year's
Pulitzer for feature photography for their pictures of Kosovo
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Pajic said it was unclear to him what prompted the arrest of
Guzy, who was behind him as they were being led away. He turned and
photographed her being handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Sgt. Joseph Gentile said Guzy was charged with
parading without a permit, just like the other protesters. He would
not say why a journalist was arrested along with the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Pajic and Guzy were among several news photographers who had
stayed in the cordoned-off area after police began arresting
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Post officials declined comment Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen reporters, photographers and television crew
members were among the hundreds of people trapped between lines of
police in riot gear for about 90 minutes after the protesters
swarmed into a downtown street a few blocks from the IMF
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the arrests began, S.P. Digan, another spokesman
for the Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters inside the
cordon that they were on the wrong side of a police line and should
leave. Gentile then arrived and told journalists, ''if you go off
to the side, you will not be arrested,'' though minutes later
officers began escorting journalists out of the area and then
arrested Guzy.
