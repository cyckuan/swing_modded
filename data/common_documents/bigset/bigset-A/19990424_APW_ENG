<HEADLINE> Indian Schools Battle Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Two monuments sit on a grassy knoll at the  
Chemawa Indian School. 
</P>
<P>
	One carries the names of two former students who died in an  
alcohol-related car crash in 1996. The other, a granite marker, 
memorializes four former students who died in the 1997 crash of a 
stolen pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas of the campus are marred by the scrawls of graffiti,  
but the monuments are clean. Scattered around them are the 
offerings of grieving students. A few votive candles, forlorn in 
the Oregon mist. Some grimy coins. A handful of withering 
wildflowers. Several purple plastic packages of Jolly Rancher 
jellybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who work here, it's a reminder of what happens to the  
students the cash-strapped Indian boarding school cannot reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on the front lines of life and death here,'' says the  
school's principal, Larry Byers, a Cherokee. ``The destructive 
behavior we see makes me wonder, if they go home, are they going to 
be alive in five years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chemawa is the end of the line, the last hope before jail,  
reform school or life as a dropout for hundreds of deeply troubled 
American Indian teen-agers. And at nearly 120 years old, it's the 
oldest continually operated federal boarding school in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The boarding school system of years past tried to forcibly  
assimilate American Indians into white culture. Now, Chemawa and 
the other seven off-reservation boarding schools are primarily 
dedicated to giving their students tools to cope with their 
problems and a measure of pride in who they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the early years, there was an attempt to change students,  
to take the Indian out of them,'' said Superintendent Louis King, 
an Oklahoma Seminole. ``Today's boarding schools are much more in 
tune with cultural issues and trying to protect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That task can be daunting. About 400 students begin each school  
year at Chemawa. More than two dozen are homeless. More than 90 
percent will be required to get some form of alcohol or drug 
treatment during their stay. Some are as many as three years behind 
on their classwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 200 remain at the end of the school year, with around  
50 graduating. Some students return to school or enroll in 
treatment programs back home, but many more fall through the 
cracks. Chemawa sent surveys to the more than 200 students who left 
last year but only about 25 responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemawa and other federal boarding schools got $3,067 per  
student for their educational programs last year. That's $600 lower 
than the lowest statewide average spending by public school systems 
for the 1996-97 school year. The national average per-pupil 
spending that year was $5,661, according to the National Education 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's facilities and maintenance budget has been cut  
every year for the eight years King has been Chemawa's 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemawa's agricultural program, once the pride of the school,  
now runs only through donations from the Daughters of the American 
Revolution. Carpet hasn't been replaced in some dorms and academic 
areas since the buildings opened in 1980 -- before most students 
were born. 
</P>
<P>
	``When these cuts build up year after year, things will  
eventually come crashing down on you,'' King said.

<HEADLINE> Crimson Classic Wins at Fonner Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND ISLAND, Neb. (AP) -- A reluctant Ken Shino agreed to ride  
Crimson Classic, and it turned out to be the quickest way for him 
to finally win the $100,000 Bosselman-Gus Fonner Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Crimson Classic finished in 1:43 3-5 for a 3/4-length victory in  
the 1 1-16 mile race, which offers Fonner Park's biggest purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Battle Mountain was second, followed by  
Skunktail, the horse Shino rode to second-place finishes over the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the races I've been trying to win for a lot of  
years now,'' Shino said. ``I would have liked to have won it on 
Skunk. But things happen. You end up having to ride different 
horses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crimson Classic was gritty down the stretch. The win paid  
$60,000 and raised the career earnings of the Kentucky-bred son of 
Sky Classic out of the dam Marianna's Girl to $374,048. 
</P>
<P>
	The posttime favorite in a field of seven at 7-to-5 odds,  
Crimson Classic paid $5, $3.20 and $2.40. Battle Mountain returned 
$3.80 and $2.80. Skunktail paid $2.60 to show.

<HEADLINE> NATO VIPs Entertained in Tent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intimate East Room affairs are all good and  
well for a few dozen NATO VIPs. But for Saturday night's cast of 
hundreds, the White House took its gala for visiting dignitaries 
outside under a South Lawn tent. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of both the alliance members and its partner nations --  
along with their ministers and other delegation members -- left 
behind briefings and conferences for an evening of soothing opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just a few years ago, a gathering of all the nations here in  
partnership would have been unthinkable,'' President Clinton said 
in his official toast before nearly 900 guests. ``But we are all 
here tonight because we are thinking ... of a future brighter than 
the past, a future of shared values and shared visions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Your presence here is the most vivid demonstration of how much  
our world has changed and changed no doubt for the better,'' NATO 
Secretary General Javier Solana said in his toast. He reminded his 
colleagues that ``principles not only have to be proclaimed but 
have to be defended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each leader arrived in limousine at the White House's grand  
foyer, most smiling or waving for the cameras but ignoring the 20 
or so demonstrators across the street who blew whistles and chanted 
anti-NATO slogans in megaphones. 
</P>
<P>
	The inside of the enormous tent resembled a reception hall, from  
the light green bunting draped across the ceilings to the facades 
on the walls with painted doors. Former Sen. Bob Dole and wife 
Elizabeth, Attorney General Janet Reno and Sen. Strom Thurmond, 
R-S.C., mingled among guests from the diplomatic core and military. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town, District of Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams threw  
his own bash for other foreign dignitaries and more than 1,000 
government and community leaders at the National Building Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Three stages were set up to represent different Washington  
neighborhoods, and the U.S. Navy Band played on a stage with a 
replica of the Capitol dome as the backdrop. Katharine Graham, 
chairman of the executive committee of The Washington Post Co., and 
former Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, helped welcome guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton presented his 18 NATO colleagues each with a  
commemorative medallion and a white porcelain bowl featuring the 
flags of member countries and the presidential seal. Leaders of the 
Partnership for Peace nations received a crystal bridge sculpture, 
while a crystal globe was given to delegation members. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House summoned opera stars Thomas Hampson and Renee  
Fleming to perform for the crowd. Heinz Fricke, music director of 
the Washington Opera since 1993, and the Kennedy Center Opera House 
Orchestra completed the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chefs prepared a feast of chicken breast with  
fire-roasted onion, grilled filet of bison and a variety of spring 
vegetables. Gold base plates topped tables adorned in cream table 
cloths.

<HEADLINE> SmithKline Enlists To Sell Avandia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hoping to ensure a successful launch for its new  
diabetes drug, SmithKline Beecham is taking the unusual step of 
enlisting the help of a rival pharmaceutical company. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after winning support from a key government advisory  
panel, SmithKline Beecham announced an agreement Friday with 
Bristol-Myers Squibb to promote the new drug, Avandia. The drug is 
expected to win final approval in June. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline is hoping to tap the expertise Bristol-Myers has  
garnered over the past several years marketing its top-selling 
diabetes drug, Glucophage. For Bristol-Myers, the arrangement helps 
the company retain a competitive position in the diabetes drug 
market after its patent on Glucophage expires in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the two companies would likely share profits  
generated by Avandia, which promises to fight diabetes with fewer 
liver risks than existing drugs. Analysts expect that Avandia could 
quickly reach sales as high as $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for diabetes drugs is lucrative in America, where  
some 15 million people suffer from Type 2 or adult-onset diabetes. 
Most patients take a combination of pills, though Avandia and 
Glucophage can be prescribed alone. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline President J.P. Garnier said he expects Bristol-Myers  
sales representatives to recommend doctors to prescribe Avandia for 
all new diabetes patients, and as the first drug used in 
combination with Glucophage. He said the companies will not 
actively seek to switch patients from Glucophage to Avandia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not see this as a big contradiction,'' Garnier said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers officials said the deal was the quickest way to  
expand diabetes sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great foundation with Glucophage,'' said Donald  
Hayden, president of worldwide medicines at Bristol-Myers. ``We see 
this co-promotion as a further ability to meet unmet needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst Hemant Shah of HKS &AMP; Co. said: ``The deal is  
far more important for Bristol because it allow them to extend the 
life cycle of Glucophage as a combination drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement, SmithKline may get the chance to  
co-promote a future Bristol-Myers drug. Other terms of the deal 
were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	New diabetes drugs such as Avandia have been widely anticipated  
since the federal government last month added new warnings to 
Warner-Lambert's Rezulin drug because of patients suffering liver 
failure. Food and Drug Administration officials list 43 Rezulin 
patients who suffered acute liver failure. Of those, 28 died and 
seven needed liver transplants to survive.

<HEADLINE> United on Kosovo, NATO Looks Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders, having declared their  
determination to bomb Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into 
submission, moved on today to key questions of the alliance's 
future -- and the possibility of more Kosovos. President Clinton 
said the current crisis underscored ``the imperative of modernizing 
our alliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question of how to deal with Kosovo, the province where  
Yugoslav army and special police forces are attempting to force out 
the ethnic Albanian majority, dominated the first day of the 
three-day NATO summit and put a damper on what was to have been a 
celebration of the alliance's 50 years of maintaining the peace in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said today that discussions  
included the future of the region and ``how we are going to stop 
the former Yugoslavia from being the permanent bleeding wound of 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Konrad Freytag, the NATO military briefer, said that  
alliance forces struck during the preceding 24 hours at targets in 
Serbia and at Yugoslav forces on the ground in Kosovo. Targets 
included command-and-control facilities, including two radio relay 
and television transmission towers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air defense targets included airfields, petroleum production and  
storage depots and the Novi Sad refinery, said Freytag. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday evening, NATO defense ministers approved a plan to stop  
oil imports from reaching Yugoslavia via Montenegro, said German 
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Scharping told reporters, ships suspected of  
carrying oil would be stopped and searched at harbor entry and 
turned back if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has concentrated much of its air campaign on bombing oil  
storage and refining capabilities, but has been frustrated that 
while pilots risk their lives to bomb these facilities, refined oil 
continues to enter the country. The 15-nation European Union 
already has agreed on an oil embargo, but that does not cover all 
potential oil shippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said the searches of ships would be designed ``to tighten  
the taps, switch off the oil tap completely. And I heard this 
morning that the Serbs are now going around to all of the abandoned 
refugees' cars -- and there are many of them inside of Kosovo -- 
and are siphoning the petrol out of the tanks. I mean, they are 
that desperate now to find fuel wherever they can that they are 
going to those extreme measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the alliance leaders opened today's session, Clinton said,  
``The crisis in Kosovo has underscored the importance of NATO and 
the imperative of modernizing our alliance for 21st century 
challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Clinton with brief remarks before today's discussions  
were closed to the media, Javier Solana, the alliance's 
secretary-general, said that in Kosovo, NATO is facing ``the same 
challenges to stability, security and well-being in Europe'' that 
it faced when it was founded 50 years ago to counter the Soviet 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day devoted to discussions of Kosovo, alliance leaders  
were moving to approval of an overall NATO strategic concept: basic 
principles that they term the European Security and Defense 
Identity. The program would allow European countries freedom to 
conduct operations in which the United States was not interested, 
but using NATO assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The program includes a new Defense Capability Initiative, an  
attempt to head off a growing technology gap between U.S. military 
forces and the rest of the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategic concept outlines the threats of the future against  
which NATO might have to defend, among them regional and ethnic 
conflicts like Kosovo, terrorism, and proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the agenda is a program setting out required steps for  
aspiring members, a sort of road map to joining NATO; the enhanced 
Partnership for Peace program, wherein non-member countries get 
involved in NATO activities which may or may not lead to 
membership; increased dialogue with Mediterranean countries; and 
creation of a new center to deal with weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The major difference over the new strategic concept, which will  
replace the one last revised in 1991, concerns the alliance's 
relations with the United Nations. Essentially, France and a number 
of other European countries want to set out specifically the 
conditions under which NATO can take military action outside its 
traditional Euro-Atlantic area. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, while agreeing the United Nations should play  
a pre-eminent role, feels the issue is adequately addressed in 
NATO's founding treaty and prefers to leave the details vague. This 
would allow the alliance to act on its own under special 
circumstances -- Kosovo being the perfect example. A Russian veto 
would have prohibited any NATO action in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a wide difference between President Clinton and me on  
the need to ask the United Nations (before taking action),'' French 
President Jacques Chirac said after meeting with Clinton on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies dismissed a Russian initiative to settle the conflict  
since Belgrade still refused to accept a NATO-led military force to 
enforce peace. Still, the leaders said they wanted to work 
constructively with Russia.

<HEADLINE> Diary Details Colo. Massacre Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A detailed diary by one of the Columbine  
High School gunmen showed they were ``going for the big kill'' in a 
suicide attack that had been planned for a year before they struck 
on Adolf Hitler's birthday, the sheriff said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line of this thing is they wanted to do as much  
damage as they could possibly do, and destroy this school, and 
destroy as many children as they could and go out in flames,'' 
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the strongest official statement about the motive for  
Tuesday's murder-suicide rampage that killed 12 students, one 
teacher and two teen gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The handwritten diary, discovered in one of the gunmen's homes,  
uses German phrases and goes back a year. Stone said the assailants 
reasoning was: ``We want to be different, we want to be strange and 
we don't want jocks or other people putting (us) down. ... We're 
going to punish you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said he didn't know which of the gunmen kept the diary.  
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff also placed some blame on the parents of Dylan  
Klebold and Eric Harris. He noted that along with the diary, 
investigators found a shotgun barrel on a dresser and bomb-making 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of this stuff was clearly visible and the parents should  
have known,'' said Stone. ``I think parents should be accountable 
for their kid's actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parents have not commented beyond separate written  
statements released by their attorneys. The statements expressed 
sorrow and sympathy for the victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
	The diary shows that Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, had been  
planning the attack for a year. The teens also had a school map 
that noted where the school was ill-lit and pointed out possible 
hiding places. The diary also revealed that they monitored the 
lunch room to find out when the greatest number of people would be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were going for a big kill,'' said Stone. ``This had been  
on their minds and they've been planning this particular thing and 
they've been building bombs ... for a considerable period of time. 
They've been acquiring weaponry for a considerable period of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why they picked April 20, the sheriff said, ``It was  
Hitler's birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``It was a Nazi kind of thing.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stone brief reporters as a weekend of funerals began. At the  
Trinity Christian Center, a mile south of Columbine High, students 
walked to the pulpit one by one to mourn Rachel Scott, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobbing and hollow-eyed, they remembered a girl who loved life,  
adored acting and was nice to people she didn't know. ``A truer 
friend you couldn't find,'' Nick Baumgart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier friends and family wrote comments in black felt pen on  
the Miss Scott's casket. Friends said she was killed outside the 
school, one of the first to be shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidi Johnson, a friend of Miss Scott's since fourth grade,  
wiped tears as she kneeled and wrote on the casket, ``Rachel, I'm 
so proud of you! I will miss you dearly. You were truly one of my 
true best friends and I love you from the bottom of my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other messages said, ``See you in Heaven,'' ``You are my hero,''  
and ``You always brought a smile to my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her father wrote simply: ``I love you. Dad. Forever.''  
</P>
<P>
	Police have interviewed hundreds of witnesses and collected  
2,000 pieces of evidence, down to the smallest scraps of metal at 
the school, in the search not only for a motive but to determine 
whether Harris and Klebold had accomplices, before or during the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and police had described one gunman wearing a white  
T-shirt, while witnesses also spoke of two gunmen in dark dusters. 
But the body of one of the gunmen did not have a trench coat on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very possible, we're thinking now, that maybe the trench  
coat was shed at some point,'' said sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis. ``Now ... maybe we're back to two suspects instead of the 
white-shirt third suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But later Davis said that ``the chances are even increasing'' of  
``further involvement'' by others. He refused to give details, 
saying, ``We have to be very, very careful at this point of what we 
release.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made and no other suspects beyond the dead  
gunmen have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the same clique of trench coat-clad outsiders --  
called the Trenchcoat Mafia -- in which the gunmen belonged -- 
described being taunted by other students. 
</P>
<P>
	The youth told The Denver Post that life for members of his  
group as ``hell ... pure hell.'' He said that athletes at the 
school called him ``faggot,'' bashed him into lockers and threw 
rocks at him as he rode his bike home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't describe how hard it was to get up in the morning and  
face that,'' the 18-year-old, demanding anonymity, told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he did not know of his friends' violent plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying what they did was OK,'' he said. ``But I know  
what it's like to be cornered, pushed day after day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, police discounted a note purported to be from one of  
the assailants warning of more violence next week. Earlier, police 
had expressed fears about the threat and said they didn't think the 
note was a hoax. Hours later, they said they believed it didn't 
come from either of the gunmen.

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Farmers Seek Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With many states once again close to depleting  
money available for farm loans, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
is urging Congress to move quickly to pass emergency funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress must act,'' Glickman said late last week. ``We're  
going to be out of money or are (already) out of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farm credit problem has been brewing for months as farmers  
try to prepare for the spring planting season. Low prices last 
season, affected by the Asian economic crisis and lagging exports, 
left farmers in a serious economic pinch. 
</P>
<P>
	States have reported record numbers of farmers coming in for  
loans, which are administered by state offices of USDA's Farm 
Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand is significantly in excess of the demand of last  
year,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has proposed $153 million in  
emergency money for the Agriculture Department. Most of the money 
would be used for direct loans or loan guarantees for an estimated 
10,000 producers unable to get credit from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	But the money, part of a $1.3 billion supplemental bill that  
also includes hurricane aid for Central America, has stalled as 
lawmakers battle over proposed GOP cuts to offset the spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The money could be further slowed as lawmakers debate an  
emergency funding measure that deals with U.S. efforts in Kosovo, 
according to some congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
	To help the situation, Glickman earlier this month authorized  
shifting $30 million allocated for other uses to temporarily ease 
the loan situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over 3 weeks later, that temporary money has also been  
depleted, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That money is already gone. It's gone,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton in early March signed a stopgap measure that  
allowed $450 million, originally targeted for another program, to 
be used for farm loans. But demand has exceeded funding. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, officials in Arkansas, which was hit hard by last  
year's drought, said they received about $26 million from the 
government covering about 226 new loans. But USDA officials in 
Arkansas say another $55 million is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas' Farm Service Agency approved nearly $130 million in  
guaranteed and emergency loans just in the first half of this 
budget year, a 132 percent increase over 1998, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Moser, a farm loan manager in Nebraska's Wayne County, said  
his office was told by state officials that ``maybe another week to 
two weeks is probably about all the funding that's available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of funds comes as his office is trying to deal with a  
50 percent increase in the number of loan requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand has definitely been greater than in the past,''  
Moser said. ``We've had to shift some priorities around and maybe 
not complete some of the day-to-day things we normally would 
complete. We're just letting those slide until we have some time to 
get to them.''

<HEADLINE>  Crowd Rallies for Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With a bullhorn in hand, Obanion Gordon  
wanted to make sure his message Saturday was loud and clear: A 
corrupt legal system put former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal on 
death row, not the bullet that killed a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state has always lynched black males, especially black  
males who have been passionate about the liberations of their 
people,'' said Gordon as he led 30 protesters over a bridge from 
Camden, N.J., into Philadelphia on Abu-Jamal's 45th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's group was among more than 3,000 people who traveled  
from as far away as France to demand a new trial for Abu-Jamal, who 
was convicted in the 1981 death of police Officer Daniel Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
	Three groups of protesters marched with police escorts to City  
Hall, where more than 50 people were scheduled to speak. The 
peaceful rally drew a crowd smaller than organizers had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has been on Pennsylvania's death row since 1982, when  
he was convicted of shooting Faulkner after coming upon his brother 
struggling with the officer after a traffic stop. Faulkner also 
wounded Abu-Jamal, and the two were found bleeding a few feet from 
each other with Abu-Jamal's gun lying nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	No execution date has been set.  
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system -- and  
efforts to win a new trial -- have made him a worldwide celebrity. 
He has contended that his conviction sprung from a biased judge and 
an ineffective counsel, which have become focal points for death 
penalty critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say Abu-Jamal, who has never given his version of  
events, was framed in Faulkner's slaying because he was a black 
activist who supported the radical MOVE organization and helped 
found Philadelphia's chapter of the Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's conviction was upheld in 1989 by the state Supreme  
Court. In 1995, it also let stand a ruling that denied a new trial 
he sought based on new evidence. His lawyers have said they will 
appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and prosecutors say Abu-Jamal was fairly convicted based  
on physical evidence and testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown San Francisco, police said between 12,000 and 15,000  
people attended a march in support of Abu-Jamal.

<HEADLINE> Court Bars Use of Rival Trademark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal appeals court outlawed a stealth  
weapon in the Internet commerce wars by forbidding companies from 
using their rivals' trademarks to steal business through Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involves  
the practice of including a competitors' trademark or brand name in 
an Internet site, either as the address or through what are known 
as ``meta-tags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``meta-tags'' are embedded in a Web page's coding. They  
can't be seen but a search program can detect them. The result is 
that millions of consumers looking for a particular trademark may 
find themselves pointed to the competitor's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court compared the practice to ``posting a sign with  
another's trademark in front of one's store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thursday ruling, which is binding in California and eight  
other Western states, is one of the latest to interpret trademark 
law for the high-stakes field of electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because e-commerce is new, some businesses feel there are no  
laws in place that govern their actions,'' said Jonathan Rosenoer 
of the consulting firm Arthur Anderson. ``The court is saying this 
is not the Wild West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved Brookfield Communication Inc., a Los  
Angeles-based company that sells entertainment industry software. 
In a suit filed last year, it accused West Coast Entertainment of 
infringing on its trademark, ``MovieBuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brookfield said the company, one of the nation's largest video  
rental chains, improperly took the Web address www.moviebuff.com 
and included it in the coding. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge initially ruled against Brookfield, saying West  
Coast Entertainment registered the address first and thus had some 
right to use it. But the appeals court ordered the judge to issue a 
permanent injunction barring West Coast from using the Web address 
or meta-tags. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivals still would be permitted to use competitors' trademarks  
for product comparisons and other legitimate uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision helps to protect intellectual property, which is  
driving our booming economy,'' said Richard Lee Stone, a lawyer for 
Brookfield. ``Brand names have value, and this helps companies 
preserve that value.''

<HEADLINE> Ontario To Sue US Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Ontario government wants to take the United  
States tobacco industry to court in a bid to recover as much as $40 
billion, Health Minister Elizabeth Witmer announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ontario has obtained legal counsel in the United States as part  
of its plan to be the first Canadian jurisdiction to sue the 
industry for damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers, invoking the statute, will argue that the tobacco  
industry is a criminal conspiracy, guilty of a pattern of 
wrongdoing that has resulted in injury. The statute was originally 
aimed at organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ontario is taking a leadership role as the first Canadian  
jurisdiction to retain U.S. counsel with the intent to seek 
damages,'' Witmer said Friday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Money from a successful U.S. court action would be applied to  
the cost of health care to treat smoking-related illnesses, she 
said. Funds also would be allocated for public awareness and 
education programs about the risks of tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. state governments launched legal proceedings against the  
tobacco industry, with 46 states settling last year for $206 
billion payable over 25 years. The other four states reached 
settlements ranging from $4 billion to $15 billion.

<HEADLINE> 5 Charged in Texas Shooting Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBERLEY, Texas (AP) -- Five junior high school students have  
been charged with conspiring to kill students and teachers in an 
alleged plot similar to the Colorado rampage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, all age 14, were taken into custody Friday and were  
being held on juvenile charges of conspiracy to commit murder, 
conspiracy to commit arson and conspiracy to manufacture 
explosives, said sheriff's Sgt. Allen Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation determined that the group had started  
earlier this year to plan the assault on the school,'' he said. 
``Further evidence showed that they had targeted fellow students 
and teachers they were going to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believe the boys had been planning since January to  
carry out an assault at Danforth Junior High School in Wimberley, a 
450-student school about 40 miles northeast of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have evidence they had a relatively detailed plan,''  
said David Simmons, superintendent of the Wimberley School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said a school staff member and several students  
notified them early Friday of the alleged plot. They apparently 
overheard the students on several occasions discussing their plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said concerns about school violence in the wake of the  
Littleton, Colo., shootings may have prompted acquaintances of the 
teens to take the alleged threats more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not say what, if anything, they discovered  
during searches of the boys' homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students around the country have been suspended and  
arrested since the Columbine High School shootings for making what 
were regarded as threats to carry out copycat attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools have been evacuated, locked down and closed as a result  
of the incidents, which have taken place in big cities and small 
towns alike since the attack in Colorado on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>  Morris Returns To LPGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- Marianne Morris had rather modest  
expectations for her first LPGA tournament in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be honest, I didn't even think I'd break 80,'' she said.  
``I haven't touched a club in so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris considered giving up the game after her brother was  
gunned down in a February robbery. But she returned to the tour 
Friday, somehow managing a 5-under-par 67 that put her just two 
shots behind leader Maria Hjorth after the first round of LPGA's 
Chick-fil-A Charity Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty emotional,'' Morris said. ``Now I feel I'm  
playing for both of us. Maybe I'll play more like him: play 
aggressive and enjoy being out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Spalding and Kelly Robbins were tied at 66. But the most  
remarkable performance of the day belonged to Morris, one of four 
players grouped two shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morris, his sister's mentor, business partner and best  
friend, was shot to death Feb. 21 in an apparent robbery at their 
suburban Atlanta golf shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 34, was unsure if she still wanted to play the game  
after her brother's death. But two weeks ago, she picked up a sand 
wedge and started chipping. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to resume her career at Eagles Landing Country Club  
south of Atlanta, where her brother took time away from their 
business a year ago to serve as her caddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Her round was highlighted by a couple of 25-foot birdie putts  
and another from 20 feet on greens quickened by unseasonably warm, 
dry weather. Each time, she wondered if her brother was guiding the 
ball into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not known for draining a lot of long putts,'' said Morris,  
a native of Middletown, Ohio. ``I honestly think there was 
something going on. Every day that goes by now, he'll be 
watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hjorth bogeyed her final hole, missing a 3-foot putt. That was  
the only slip for the 25-year-old Swede, who had the best round of 
her two-year career and finds herself leading an LPGA tournament 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will go out and try to forget today,'' she said. ``I'll be  
focused and not look too far into the future. That's been a problem 
for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spalding, who missed the cut four times in her first nine  
tournaments and hasn't finished higher than 31st this year, also 
put together a career-low round despite a triple-bogey at No. 9. 
She compensated with 10 birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love fast greens,'' Spalding said. ``All you have to do is  
pick your line and hit it there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' brother, five years her senior, encouraged her to play  
more aggressively and have fun. Last Christmas, he sent his sister 
a card that said, ``1999 is going to be your year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Morris remembered those words and felt a sense of  
calm each time she stood over a difficult putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was going to make them,'' she said. ``I felt as  
good on the golf course as I ever have. I don't think I'll be as 
hard as myself as I used to. I'm fortunate to play golf for a 
living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Crafter, who was part of the group at 67 that also included  
Rachel Hetherington and Lorie Kane, said Morris' game will benefit 
from a new perspective on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grieving process takes time, but it makes coming back and  
playing so much easier,'' said Crafter, recalling the deaths of her 
parents. ``You can take the pressure of a 3-foot putt. It doesn't 
matter if you miss it. There are more important things in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone seemed to be cheering for Morris -- even those who are  
trying to beat her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a good player,'' Hetherington said, ``and she deserves  
to play well with what she's been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Divots:* Nancy Lopez, who won the Chick-fil-A in 1997, becomes the  
official host next year. The tournament name will change to the 
``Chick-fil-A Charity Championship Hosted by Nancy Lopez.'' The 
honor didn't help her Friday as she shot 73. ... Defending champion 
Liselotte Neumann was nine shots off the lead after a 74. ... 
Karrie Webb, a winner three times and a top-10 finisher in all 
seven of her tournaments this year, was five shots off the lead.

<HEADLINE> No Sacred Cows for Groening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At first glance, he's living an unexceptional  
Chamber of Commerce existence: league bowling on the weekends, 
singing in a barbershop quartet and operating the best-known 
convenience store in metropolitan Springfield, USA. 
</P>
<P>
	But Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has a darker side: the chutney  
Squishees he once tried to force upon an unsuspecting populace. His 
role in the off-off-off-off-off-Broadway production of 
``Streetcar!'' (liberally adapted from Tennessee Williams). The 
flash-frozen senior citizen who once inhabited his dairy case. 
</P>
<P>
	You know Apu. He's a lot like you and me -- his successes pinned  
proudly to his polyester Kwik-E Mart frock, his failures stashed 
furtively under the counter behind the food-service cans of 
Reagan-era nacho cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Except Apu exists only in a cosmos of pen and ink, of bright  
yellows and popping eyes. He's a member of an unusual animated 
flock, sprung from the mind of an even more unusual genius: the man 
whose brain produced ``The Simpsons'' -- and the new sci-fi cartoon 
``Futurama''; the man whose pointed humor has, for more than a 
decade, made lots of people laugh and lots of people uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a particular ax to grind,'' he insists.  
</P>
<P>
	So instead, with smiles and jabs and idealism and sarcasm, Matt  
Groening grinds them all. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Utterances by Homer Simpson, fatty foods aficionado, errant  
nuclear-plant employee and incompetent if loving father: 
</P>
<P>
	--''I used to rock and roll all night and party every day. Then  
it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a 
week in which to get funky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Maybe, for once, someone will call me `sir' without adding,  
`You're making a scene.''' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Ooh! Barbecue!''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One day, somewhere in the middle of the baby boom, a young boy  
in a sandbox looked around at his playmates. Suddenly, he saw their 
futures: lawyers, investment bankers, grown-ups in grown-up suits. 
And Matt Groening realized being a kid wasn't such a bad gig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that other kids were going to get serious and go on and  
be professionals,'' says Groening (rhymes with ``raining''). ``I 
never wanted to go to an office and carry a briefcase. I said, 
`That's no fun. I want to play. I want to make up stories.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Four decades later, at 45, he still does.  
</P>
<P>
	He made up ``Life in Hell,'' a weekly comic strip that  
chronicles the travails of a rabbit named Binky and a nihilistic 
gay couple in fez hats named Akbar and Jeff. He created ``The 
Simpsons,'' the delightfully astute late 20th-century family sitcom 
and a winner of 12 Emmys. Now he has hatched ``Futurama,'' an 
equally offbeat cartoon that blends ``The Simpsons'' with ``The 
Jetsons,'' ``The Three Stooges'' and a hodgepodge of sci-fi 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
	Groening's vision, rounded out by a team of animators and  
writers from across the political spectrum, evokes many 
descriptions: absurdist theater; crackling cultural commentary; a 
vast collage of American pop and high culture; the rapid-fire 
dialogue of Marx Brothers movies and the lunacy of Warner Bros. 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly Saturday-morning ``Josie &AMP; the Pussycats'' or ``Smurfs''  
fare. View an episode of ``The Simpsons'' and watch the background. 
Little treats abound -- rewards, Groening says, for paying 
attention. Hidden in plain view are indictments of consumerism, 
jabs at bureaucracy and pokes at pretension. It is, quite simply, 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider these recent nuggets: an art museum named ``Louvre --  
American Style'' (``No shirt, no shoes, no Chardonnay''); an 
unrepentantly carnivorous steakhouse with a slab of beef called 
``Sir Loinalot'' and a Heimlich machine in case of emergency; a 
sign that says, ``Welcome to Atlanta -- Home of Ted Turner's mood 
swings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Groening and his writers (his official title is executive  
producer, but he retains great creative control) push to the edge 
of hilarity but never complete implausibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of television shows ... don't deal with the things  
people are ashamed to admit. We can do that,'' says Dan 
Castellaneta, who voices Homer Simpson and an array of other 
characters, including belching barfly Barney Gumble and 
flame-bearded, Scottish-brogued Groundskeeper Willie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first television show that has an underground comic  
sensibility,'' Castellaneta says in a decidedly un-Homeric voice. 
``Very rarely do people talk about major corporations and companies 
taking away people's rights. In `The Simpsons,' it just sneaks in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the exclusionary in-jokes of ``Seinfeld,'' Groening's  
work is both accessible and deliciously obscure: Baby Maggie's 
attempt to break out of a day-care center would be hilarious even 
if it didn't feature the theme from ``The Great Escape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridiculing mass media is a ``Simpsons'' staple. Local TV news is  
skewered with glee, as are violent cartoons: ``The Itchy and 
Scratchy Show,'' a cat-and-mouse cartoon within a cartoon, features 
graphic dismemberment and titles like ``Scar Trek: The Next 
Laceration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Groening's own network isn't safe. One episode featured  
Homer and Bart watching ``Nonstop Fox,'' featuring ``When Buildings 
Collapse'' and ``World's Funniest Tornados.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we all share is laughing at the Elmer Fudds of  
the world -- authorities who don't like to be laughed at,'' Groening 
says of his writers. 
</P>
<P>
	This notion -- that no cow is sacred -- renders the Simpsons  
affectionately benign. Sure, Apu is a broad parody of an Indian 
convenience-store owner, but Homer is an equally broad parody of a 
second-rate suburban white American father. In the end, everybody's 
good, everybody's bad and everybody's a bit ridiculous -- sort of 
like real life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you reflect and say, `Yeah -- that's me too. I've been  
there,''' says Cherie Kerr, a founding member of the Groundlings, 
the West Coast comedy troupe that has produced such favorite 
``Simpsons'' guest voices as Jon Lovitz and the late Phil Hartman. 
``But it's in an animated form, and that makes it less 
in-your-face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such humor is bound to raise hackles, though, and producers of  
``The Simpsons'' have become accustomed to strong reactions; last 
month's episode of Simpsons-spun Bible stories elicited more. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Bart annoyed people most; schoolteachers said his  
``underachiever and proud of it'' attitude fostered mediocrity and 
rebelliousness. Now, Homer's bathetic travails dominate the show 
and he has become a target. U.S. Rep. Joseph Pitts, a conservative 
Pennsylvania Republican, recently blamed Homer and his ilk for 
contributing to the decline of fatherhood in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really missing the boat on this,'' says Robert  
Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular 
Television at Syracuse University. ``If I had a choice between an 
8-year-old watching a literate, artistic, densely packed comedy 
like the Simpsons or one of these supposedly friendly, 
family-oriented `TGIF' programs like `Full House,' tell me which is 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Simpsons could serve for a kid today what Mad magazine did  
for me,'' Thompson says. ``It awakened a political consciousness, 
made me realize I could read something and have an opinion about it 
-- all the useful intellectual tools you get from reading satire.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Signs seen around Springfield:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Join the Army -- and see the opposing Army!''  
</P>
<P>
	--''Mt. Swartzwelder Historic Cider Mill: Now 40 percent  
quainter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Wall E. Weasel's Pizzeria/Arcade: We cram fun down your  
throat.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa and Maggie are his sisters, Homer and Marge his parents. He  
favors sarcasm and cutting repartee, but his mischief is 
good-natured. He distrusts authority. He seems forever young. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Bart. Matt.  
</P>
<P>
	Groening, who names characters after relatives (``Life in Hell''  
also features his sons, Will and Abe, depicted as rabbits), says he 
aimed to create a universe where people screw up but must rely upon 
each other to survive, where ``you can have a great life if you're 
second best -- or in Homer's case, in last place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The characters in `The Simpsons' love their lives, and Homer  
loves his life more than anyone,'' Groening says on a recent day 
from the Los Angeles offices of ``Futurama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He follows his passions 100 percent. It gets him into a lot of  
trouble, but there's a part of us that wishes we had the guts to be 
like Homer and really savor that doughnut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savoring, whether doughnuts or life, is what Groening's work is  
about. He still can't believe he's making a living at an activity 
that people warned would be his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	During high school in the late 1960s and early '70s, the  
Portland, Ore., native watched as music and film and underground 
comics flourished. He absorbed popular culture like a sheet of 
Bounty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a perfect age to turn out the way I did,'' Groening says.  
</P>
<P>
	After college, he photocopied his own cartoon magazine, ``Life  
in Hell.'' It became his first success and today is syndicated 
nationally. He got his world view moving from job to job: 
record-store clerk, movie extra, chauffeur and dishwasher -- ``the 
standard stuff you do when you're trying to live by your wits and 
nobody's hiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Tracey Ullman enlisted Groening to do a few shorts  
about a dysfunctional family called the Simpsons for her variety 
show. Those first tries were rough, angular versions of the 
rounded-out family we know today. 
</P>
<P>
	The humor stuck, and the Simpsons' own show debuted in December  
1989 and became a regular series the following month. It succeeded 
in part because Groening, a media junkie, drew from myriad cultural 
sources -- high, middle and lowbrow -- for his humor. Everybody 
understood something. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything he likes, he's willing to twist into his version,''  
says longtime collaborator David X. Cohen, co-executive producer of 
``Futurama,'' which debuted last month with a similar sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama,'' as absurdist and caustic as ``The Simpsons,'' is  
more ambitious. Groening and Cohen wanted to create a distinctive 
future that could accommodate both comedy and science fiction. But 
how to design it? A happy, cornball Jetsons utopia or a dark, 
drippy, smelly ``Blade Runner'' landscape? 
</P>
<P>
	They compromised.  
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it should be a dark, drippy, cartoony, smelly  
Jetsons utopia,'' Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Like much sci-fi, ``Futurama'' deals with other times and  
places, making sensitive issues seem more oblique than in the 
Simpsons. As Katey Sagal puts it, ``there is no politically correct 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sagal (``Married ... With Children'') voices Leela, the  
tough-but-sexy alien ship captain in ``Futurama.'' Despite her 
large and only eye, Leela is a 31st-century woman balancing career 
and love. Fry (Billy West, who voiced both Ren and Stimpy) is a 
pizza delivery boy cryogenically frozen for a millennium, coping 
with a not-so-brave new world. Together with a cast of 
neo-Springfieldian oddballs, they face life. 
</P>
<P>
	Theirs is a cosmos ruled by DOOP (the Democratic Order of  
Planets), where a wisecracking alcoholic robot lives among humans, 
the moon is a theme park and New Yorkers commute in pneumatic 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' has its melancholy side, too: Fry walks through  
what was Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and sees the ancient ruins 
of his 20th-century world. His face falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just this human quality to everybody, this  
vulnerability,'' Sagal says. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the famous voices ``The Simpsons'' has featured, from  
Paul McCartney to Rod Steiger to Michelle Pfeiffer, Groening 
anticipates and welcomes celebrity appearances on ``Futurama.'' One 
catch: This is an era where famous people's brains are kept alive 
in a disembodied head museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ``Futurama'' premiere, Leonard Nimoy's voice speaks from  
his pickled head; he tells of living ``a life of quiet dignity,'' 
then sucks up some fish food dropped into his tank. The year 3000 
version of ``New Year's Rockin' Eve'' appears on TV -- with Dick 
Clark's head as host. 
</P>
<P>
	And a couple of craniums down from Richard Nixon's sits a jar  
containing the face of a bearded, bewildered-looking man. The jar's 
plaque, visible for only a micromoment, says ``Matt Groening'' -- 
another little reward for those paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of Springfield's retail landscape:  
</P>
<P>
	--Guns: ``Bloodbath and Beyond.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Cappuccino: ``Java the Hut.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Drive-thru Mexican: ``TacoMat.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Prime time today is stuffed with cartoons, from the mordant  
``Family Guy'' to the suburb-skewering ``King of the Hill'' to the 
cubicle-bound nerdfest ``Dilbert.'' And ``The Simpsons'' has helped 
pave the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Groening has managed to blend humor and substance into  
something rare -- a world full of flawed characters easy to care 
about, each with a specific personality, from Apu to Homer, from 
Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel to Uter the Germanic exchange student. 
Dysfunctional, yes, but a community nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're inviting yourself into someone's home when you do a TV  
show,'' Groening says. ``For all of 'The Simpsons' darker strains 
of satire, ultimately it's a celebration of America and the 
American family in its exuberance and absurdity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad gig for the kid who wanted to stay in the sandbox and  
make up stories. And now ``Futurama'': Groening's trip to tomorrow, 
pushing his mind toward fresh frontiers where the next-door 
neighbors may have two heads and six stomachs, but are just trying 
to put worms on the table and save enough to send the larvae off to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Matt Groening's world, where people reach for happiness  
but usually latch onto something a bit less, what more can anyone 
really ask?

<HEADLINE> Boys Accused of School Assault Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBERLEY, Texas (AP) -- Gunpowder, crude bombs and computer  
disks with bomb-making information were found in the homes of three 
14-year-old boys accused of plotting an assault at their junior 
high school, investigators said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the statements given, it is clear that these young  
men were serious about targeting fellow students and teachers,'' 
Hays County Sheriff Don Montague said of the alleged plot that was 
similar to the Colorado high school rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Five eighth-grade boys were taken into custody Friday afternoon  
and held on juvenile charges of conspiracy to commit murder, 
conspiracy to commit arson and conspiracy to manufacture 
explosives, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three boys whose homes were searched remained in juvenile  
detention Saturday along with another boy, the sheriff said. He 
would not reveal the location of the fifth boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three homes were searched Friday night because that's all  
authorities had probable cause to check, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the bomb parts, deputies and agents from the U.S.  
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found how-to instructions 
downloaded from the Internet, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged plot, believed to have been conceived in January,  
came to light Friday when school officials were contacted by 
students who had overheard discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing unusual was found at the Danforth campus of Wimberley  
Junior High, which has more than 400 students, said Wimberley 
schools Superintendent David Simmons. The five boys were expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials did not release the boys' names or their written  
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Wimberley is about 40 miles southwest of Austin.

<HEADLINE>  Morris Returns To LPGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- Marianne Morris had rather modest  
expectations for her first LPGA tournament in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be honest, I didn't even think I'd break 80,'' she said.  
``I haven't touched a club in so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris considered giving up the game after her brother was  
gunned down in a February robbery. But she returned to the tour 
Friday, somehow managing a 5-under-par 67 that put her just two 
shots behind leader Maria Hjorth after the first round of LPGA's 
Chick-fil-A Charity Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty emotional,'' Morris said. ``Now I feel I'm  
playing for both of us. Maybe I'll play more like him: play 
aggressive and enjoy being out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Spalding and Kelly Robbins were tied at 66. But the most  
remarkable performance of the day belonged to Morris, one of four 
players grouped two shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Morris, his sister's mentor, business partner and best  
friend, was shot to death Feb. 21 in an apparent robbery at their 
suburban Atlanta golf shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 34, was unsure if she still wanted to play the game  
after her brother's death. But two weeks ago, she picked up a sand 
wedge and started chipping. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to resume her career at Eagles Landing Country Club  
south of Atlanta, where her brother took time away from their 
business a year ago to serve as her caddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Her round was highlighted by a couple of 25-foot birdie putts  
and another from 20 feet on greens quickened by unseasonably warm, 
dry weather. Each time, she wondered if her brother was guiding the 
ball into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not known for draining a lot of long putts,'' said Morris,  
a native of Middletown, Ohio. ``I honestly think there was 
something going on. Every day that goes by now, he'll be 
watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hjorth bogeyed her final hole, missing a 3-foot putt. That was  
the only slip for the 25-year-old Swede, who had the best round of 
her two-year career and finds herself leading an LPGA tournament 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will go out and try to forget today,'' she said. ``I'll be  
focused and not look too far into the future. That's been a problem 
for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spalding, who missed the cut four times in her first nine  
tournaments and hasn't finished higher than 31st this year, also 
put together a career-low round despite a triple-bogey at No. 9. 
She compensated with 10 birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love fast greens,'' Spalding said. ``All you have to do is  
pick your line and hit it there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' brother, five years her senior, encouraged her to play  
more aggressively and have fun. Last Christmas, he sent his sister 
a card that said, ``1999 is going to be your year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Morris remembered those words and felt a sense of  
calm each time she stood over a difficult putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was going to make them,'' she said. ``I felt as  
good on the golf course as I ever have. I don't think I'll be as 
hard as myself as I used to. I'm fortunate to play golf for a 
living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Crafter, who was part of the group at 67 that also included  
Rachel Hetherington and Lorie Kane, said Morris' game will benefit 
from a new perspective on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grieving process takes time, but it makes coming back and  
playing so much easier,'' said Crafter, recalling the deaths of her 
parents. ``You can take the pressure of a 3-foot putt. It doesn't 
matter if you miss it. There are more important things in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone seemed to be cheering for Morris -- even those who are  
trying to beat her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a good player,'' Hetherington said, ``and she deserves  
to play well with what she's been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Divots:* Nancy Lopez, who won the Chick-fil-A in 1997, becomes the  
official host next year. The tournament name will change to the 
``Chick-fil-A Charity Championship Hosted by Nancy Lopez.'' The 
honor didn't help her Friday as she shot 73. ... Defending champion 
Liselotte Neumann was nine shots off the lead after a 74. ... 
Karrie Webb, a winner three times and a top-10 finisher in all 
seven of her tournaments this year, was five shots off the lead.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Seeks Inclusion in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring ethnic Albanians are ``not just  
innocent lambs,'' Ukraine's president Leonid Kuchma said Saturday 
any peace force in Kosovo should include Russian troops and respect 
the Serbian side of the dispute over the province. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Russian and Ukrainian  
troops would be welcomed into a peacekeeping force to assure the 
security of refugees returning home after a hoped-for setttlement 
of the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	But Solana said there must be a ``robust force,'' and that means  
having NATO troops at its core. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma, a former rocket designer seeking re-election in October,  
attended the NATO summit here as head of one of the larger European 
countries that remain outside the growing trans-Atlantic alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got no right to stand aside,'' Kuchma said of the  
Balkans conflict. ``The main point is that all of us work in the 
same direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and Ukraine established a joint commission in 1997. Kuchma  
met Saturday with allied leaders to formalize the use of a former 
Soviet military base in western Ukraine, Yavoriv, for NATO training 
exercises. It also will be used for Ukrainian and Romanian forces 
to make joint preparations to respond to emergencies in eastern and 
central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In an APTN interview, Kuchma, whose foreign policy generally has  
been balanced between Russia and Western Europe, offered his 
formula for a quick end to the conflict in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NATO should end its bombing campaign simultaneously with  
withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo under arrangements that also 
would permit return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	It is essential that an armed peacekeeping force, established  
through the United Nations, move into the province, Kuchma said, 
comprising troops from nations that did not participate in the NATO 
bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should try to respect the Serbian side and respect the  
territorial integrity of Kosovo,'' Kuchma said, and should not 
blame only Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for the conflict 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Albanians also are to blame,'' he said. ``The Albanians  
are not just innocent lambs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchma said he is willing to go to Belgrade to try to arrange a  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not go there just to breathe the fresh air,'' he said.  
``There should be a certain formulation before such a trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a peace force to succeed, he said, it must gain the  
confidence of the Serbs. And that, he said, means participation of 
Russian troops is essential. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a joint news conference, Solana said ``to guarantee  
the security of the refugees, I cannot imagine a robust force under 
any other form'' than the one proposed by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana praised Kuchma's ``tireless diplomatic efforts'' and said  
the Ukrainian president and NATO ``are both committed to a lasting 
political settlement.''

<HEADLINE> Duchess To Hawk British Fine China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah Ferguson has been named the spokeswoman  
for Wedgwood, the 240-year-old British maker of fine china. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duchess of York says she can now pay tribute to the same  
china she eats from each day at home in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``China doesn't have to be kept in the cupboard for rainy  
days,'' she said Friday. ``I'm a working mother with two kids, but 
I can fit china into my day.'' 
</P>

	Ferguson has written several books, including her bestseller,  
``Dieting with the Duchess.'' Since 1997, she has been the 
spokeswoman for Weight Watchers International. 
</P>
<P>
	No financial details of the two-year agreement were disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Crowd Rallies for Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With a bullhorn in hand, Obanion Gordon  
wanted to make sure his message Saturday was loud and clear: A 
corrupt legal system put former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal on 
death row, not the bullet that killed a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state has always lynched black males, especially black  
males who have been passionate about the liberations of their 
people,'' said Gordon as he led 30 protesters over a bridge from 
Camden, N.J., into Philadelphia on Abu-Jamal's 45th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's group was among more than 3,000 people who traveled  
from as far away as France to demand a new trial for Abu-Jamal, who 
was convicted in the 1981 death of police Officer Daniel Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
	Three groups of protesters marched with police escorts to City  
Hall, where more than 50 people were scheduled to speak. The 
peaceful rally drew a crowd smaller than organizers had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has been on Pennsylvania's death row since 1982, when  
he was convicted of shooting Faulkner after coming upon his brother 
struggling with the officer after a traffic stop. Faulkner also 
wounded Abu-Jamal, and the two were found bleeding a few feet from 
each other with Abu-Jamal's gun lying nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	No execution date has been set.  
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system -- and  
efforts to win a new trial -- have made him a worldwide celebrity. 
He has contended that his conviction sprung from a biased judge and 
an ineffective counsel, which have become focal points for death 
penalty critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say Abu-Jamal, who has never given his version of  
events, was framed in Faulkner's slaying because he was a black 
activist who supported the radical MOVE organization and helped 
found Philadelphia's chapter of the Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's conviction was upheld in 1989 by the state Supreme  
Court. In 1995, it also let stand a ruling that denied a new trial 
he sought based on new evidence. His lawyers have said they will 
appeal the decision.

<HEADLINE>  Friends Mourn Teen Killed in Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They lined up next to the pulpit, aside  
the white casket covered with the felt-tipped signatures and 
farewell wishes that will be buried with her. And one by one, they 
told Littleton and the nation the story of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	On police lists, she was Rachel Scott, 17, victim. But these  
young men and women knew somebody far more resonant: a prom date 
who was trying to quit smoking. An actress and budding playwright 
who talked of decorating the apartment she'd have one day. Rachel 
Joy Scott -- the girl who befriended strangers, the girl with the 
ideal middle name. 
</P>
<P>
	And suddenly she was gone. On Saturday, weeping and hollow-eyed,  
they mourned her in a sad parade, their reminiscences melting 
together into a portrait of a truly extraordinary girl. 
</P>
<P>
	One sobbing blond girl told of how Ms. Scott would always  
jump-start her car in the Columbine High School parking lot. A 
muscular boy said he wished he could have protected her. Her 
handsome prom date, Nick Baumgart, thanked her for sharing her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``A truer friend you couldn't find,'' said Baumgart, who took  
her to the prom just a week ago. ``You could be having the worst 
day of your entire life. All she had to do was smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott was one of 12 students slain by Dylan Klebold and Eric  
Harris in their rampage through Columbine on Tuesday. Her funeral 
was held at Trinity Christian Center, a church less than a 
half-mile from Columbine. Its front door affords a clear view of 
the school library. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bruce Porter lamented the removal of prayer from  
America's public schools but said the violence at Columbine may 
have changed matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prayer was re-established in our public schools last  
Tuesday,'' Porter said to applause. ``What the judiciary couldn't 
do, what the churches couldn't do, the children did themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott's teachers remembered a dedication and verve that  
elevated her from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so proud of that girl. She was talented and beautiful,  
and I know that she's with us still,'' said Paula Reed, Ms. Scott's 
forensics teacher. ``But she took part of me with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The choreographed funeral, complete with a montage of family  
pictures from Ms. Scott's earlier childhood and happier times, 
featured a continuous tape loop of Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go 
On,'' the ``Titanic'' theme song. A female mime and a youth group 
also performed. 
</P>
<P>
	In one picture, Ms. Scott mugged with a fedora and bright  
lipstick; another showed her grinning with friends, her face 
flushed. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days before the shooting, Ms. Scott wrote in her  
cousin's yearbook that ``it's hard to find God through these 
halls.'' But she urged her cousin, Sarah Scott, to keep on trying. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of teens in the audience wiped streaming tears from their  
faces and dropped their heads into their hands. One diminutive girl 
buried her head in the burly shoulder of her companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends signed Ms. Scott's closed casket by the dozen in black  
felt-tip marker, leaving their words with her permanently. Some 
promised they'd see her in heaven. ``You are my hero,'' one wrote. 
Others tried to make sense of the death. Her parents simply said 
goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honey, you are everything a mother could ask the Lord for in a  
daughter. I love you so much!'' her mother wrote. And from her 
father: ``I love you. Dad. Forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott, friends said, knew her own mind. She was a spirited  
actress in school plays, a devout Christian who wanted to go on a 
mission this summer to Africa. And she had a playful streak a mile 
wide. If she wanted to wear a sailor hat or pajama bottoms to 
school, why not? 
</P>
<P>
	``If she liked it, she would wear it,'' said Heide Johnson, her  
friend since fourth grade. ``She didn't care what other people 
thought of her. She just wanted to be true to herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day, she showed up at school with especially strange attire  
-- for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just wanted to see how people responded to her. She wanted  
to know who her true friends were,'' Ms. Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last week, Ms. Johnson and Ms. Scott saw each other and  
made plans to get together after school one day soon. It was the 
last time Ms. Johnson saw her friend alive. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, outside the school, Ms. Scott's red Acura remained  
parked where she left it Tuesday morning. It had become a shrine, 
barely visible beneath flowers, cards, balloons and stuffed 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	On the hood sat a small Teddy bear, clutching a sign:  
</P>
<P>
	``Never forget.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Leaders Show Change in Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italy's premier was a rising young Communist  
in the years of turbulent student protest. The Spaniard serving as 
NATO's secretary general campaigned against the alliance earlier in 
his career. A young Bill Clinton marched against the Vietnam War 
and managed to not get drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the NATO leaders now exercising air power were far more  
interested in the likes of flower power in their youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have shed their old skins like some mammals do,'' says  
historian Henry Graff, ``and they're wearing new ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time and circumstance have brought together a diverse collection  
of leaders who cut their teeth in the European antinuclear 
movement, protested war and in some cases opposed the very 
institution they now celebrate and wish to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is explained in part by the efforts of leaders such  
as President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to move 
political parties with liberal traditions closer to the center. 
Graff, professor emeritus at Columbia University, says it also is 
an example of people on the outside adjusting to the realities of 
leadership once they take power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't that they got smarter,'' he said. ``The trouble with  
all of them is that they read history. Each one sees in himself a 
Churchill or Franklin Roosevelt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, an air campaign launched with the humanitarian  
justification of safeguarding ethnic Albanians in Kosovo is easier 
for leaders of various political leanings to support than a war for 
territory. ``That fits the position of all these guys ... a kind of 
moral grandeur,'' Graff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their early years did not necessarily point to this sort of  
rendezvous with destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Premier Minister Massimo D'Alema, 49, was raised on the  
precepts of Marxism, became a Communist Party youth leader and rose 
through the party even as he exerted a moderating influence on it. 
As a boy of 13, he gave flowers to Palmiro Togliatti, a party 
founder who had railed against his country's decision to join NATO 
at its creation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that same party has a different name along with a commitment  
to free-market ideas. And Italy, though one of the more nervous 
partners in the campaign, is now a prime base for NATO bombers 
hitting Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's hawkish defense and foreign ministers were antiwar  
activists in the 1960s. Gerhard Schroeder, 55, the first German 
chancellor without personal memory of World War II, was prominent 
in the 1980s movement against the deployment of U.S. nuclear 
missiles in Europe. And he opposed the Vietnam War while taking no 
active part in protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never a 68er,'' he says, referring to a year of  
particular social turmoil. ``It was all too theoretical for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an opposition Socialist politician in the late 1970s and  
early 1980s, Javier Solana, now 56, campaigned against Spain's 
entry into NATO. Now he is the alliance's secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was wrong about NATO,'' Solana said once when asked about  
his harsh remarks in the past about the organization and the United 
States. ``What do you do when you are wrong? Change. That is what I 
did, change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Socialists ultimately changed their position about NATO  
after winning power and gradually led Spain into full membership 
after a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair, 45, came to Parliament in 1983, when the Labor Party had  
a left-wing, antiwar platform that included scrapping Britain's 
nuclear weapons. His foreign minister, Robin Cook, was an outspoken 
pacifist in the 1980s; now second to none in the alliance in 
pushing for resolve in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	For Americans, differences in the Vietnam generation are no more  
apparent than in the divergent paths of the president and NATO's 
top military commander in their youth. Like Clinton, 52, Army Gen. 
Wesley Clark, 54, grew up in Arkansas and went off to Oxford. But 
Clark toured Britain making speeches supporting the war and then 
went to Vietnam to fight in it.

<HEADLINE>  Friends Mourn Teen Killed in Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They lined up next to the pulpit, aside  
the white casket covered with the felt-tipped signatures and 
farewell wishes that will be buried with her. And one by one, they 
told Littleton and the nation the story of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	On police lists, she was Rachel Scott, 17, victim. But these  
young men and women knew somebody far more resonant: a prom date 
who was trying to quit smoking. An actress and budding playwright 
who talked of decorating the apartment she'd have one day. Rachel 
Joy Scott -- the girl who befriended strangers, the girl with the 
ideal middle name. 
</P>
<P>
	And suddenly she was gone. On Saturday, weeping and hollow-eyed,  
they mourned her in a sad parade, their reminiscences melting 
together into a portrait of a truly extraordinary girl. 
</P>
<P>
	One sobbing blond girl told of how Ms. Scott would always  
jump-start her car in the Columbine High School parking lot. A 
muscular boy said he wished he could have protected her. Her 
handsome prom date, Nick Baumgart, thanked her for sharing her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``A truer friend you couldn't find,'' said Baumgart, who took  
her to the prom just a week ago. ``You could be having the worst 
day of your entire life. All she had to do was smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott was one of 12 students slain by Dylan Klebold and Eric  
Harris in their rampage through Columbine on Tuesday. Her funeral 
was held at Trinity Christian Center, a church less than a 
half-mile from Columbine. Its front door affords a clear view of 
the school library. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bruce Porter lamented the removal of prayer from  
America's public schools but said the violence at Columbine may 
have changed matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prayer was re-established in our public schools last  
Tuesday,'' Porter said to applause. ``What the judiciary couldn't 
do, what the churches couldn't do, the children did themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott's teachers remembered a dedication and verve that  
elevated her from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so proud of that girl. She was talented and beautiful,  
and I know that she's with us still,'' said Paula Reed, Ms. Scott's 
forensics teacher. ``But she took part of me with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The choreographed funeral, complete with a montage of family  
pictures from Ms. Scott's earlier childhood and happier times, 
featured a continuous tape loop of Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go 
On,'' the ``Titanic'' theme song. A female mime and a youth group 
also performed. 
</P>
<P>
	In one picture, Ms. Scott mugged with a fedora and bright  
lipstick; another showed her grinning with friends, her face 
flushed. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few days before the shooting, Ms. Scott wrote in her  
cousin's yearbook that ``it's hard to find God through these 
halls.'' But she urged her cousin, Sarah Scott, to keep on trying. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of teens in the audience wiped streaming tears from their  
faces and dropped their heads into their hands. One diminutive girl 
buried her head in the burly shoulder of her companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends signed Ms. Scott's closed casket by the dozen in black  
felt-tip marker, leaving their words with her permanently. Some 
promised they'd see her in heaven. ``You are my hero,'' one wrote. 
Others tried to make sense of the death. Her parents simply said 
goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honey, you are everything a mother could ask the Lord for in a  
daughter. I love you so much!'' her mother wrote. And from her 
father: ``I love you. Dad. Forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott, friends said, knew her own mind. She was a spirited  
actress in school plays, a devout Christian who wanted to go on a 
mission this summer to Africa. And she had a playful streak a mile 
wide. If she wanted to wear a sailor hat or pajama bottoms to 
school, why not? 
</P>
<P>
	``If she liked it, she would wear it,'' said Heide Johnson, her  
friend since fourth grade. ``She didn't care what other people 
thought of her. She just wanted to be true to herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day, she showed up at school with especially strange attire  
-- for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just wanted to see how people responded to her. She wanted  
to know who her true friends were,'' Ms. Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last week, Ms. Johnson and Ms. Scott saw each other and  
made plans to get together after school one day soon. It was the 
last time Ms. Johnson saw her friend alive. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, outside the school, Ms. Scott's red Acura remained  
parked where she left it Tuesday morning. It had become a shrine, 
barely visible beneath flowers, cards, balloons and stuffed 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
	On the hood sat a small Teddy bear, clutching a sign:  
</P>
<P>
	``Never forget.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Wins Women's Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Georgia edged Michigan to win its fifth  
NCAA gymnastics championship on Friday night at the University of 
Utah's Huntsman Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gym Dogs repeated as national champs, but the Super Six  
competition wasn't decided until Georgia's last competitor on 
balance beam, senior Jenni Beathard, bailed out classmate Karin 
Lichey by avoiding a fall on Georgia's last beam routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lichey, Georgia's top-ranked individual gymnast, had  
uncharacteristically fallen earlier. Beathard scored a 9.8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every championship is totally different. There was so much  
heart and so much guts on this team, they weren't going to quit,'' 
Georgia coach Suzanne Yoculan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia's 196.850 score also extended its winning streak to 67  
straight meets. The Gym Dogs haven't lost a meet since the 1997 
NCAA championships and are the first repeat winners since Utah in 
1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Lichey, who finished second in the all-around Thursday night,  
bounced back from her fall on beam to score a 9.95 on floor to help 
her team post a 49.250. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so excited because everyone else was excited,'' Lichey  
said. ``This year has been full of so many ups and downs, but we 
never quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs became the 12th top seed in history to win the  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan finished second with a score of 196.550, its best  
finish in school history. The Wolverines tied for second with 
Alabama in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan opened the competition on beam, traditionally the most  
difficult event psychologically. Kathy Burke was the only Wolverine 
to fall, and the team scored an impressive 49.0. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, which finished third last year, finished third again  
with a 195.95. After a strong bars set to open the meet, the 
Crimson Tide moved to beam, where two of its athletes fell. 
</P>
<P>
	That took them out of the championship hunt, but Alabama  
responded by posting a 49.025 on floor and a 49.125 on vault. 
Alabama made its 11th top-three finish in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona State, the 10th seed coming into the tournament,  
finished fourth with a score of 195.90. UCLA, which fell twice on 
beam, finished fifth with 195.85 and Nebraska was sixth with 
194.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins couldn't seem to mentally overcome the problems  
suffered by teammate Alison Stoner, who injured her knee during her 
floor routine in UCLA's first rotation. Stoner, who may have torn 
several ligaments in her knee, was taken to University Hospital for 
X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia was also the top seed in 1993 and 1998 when it  
prevailed. The Gym Dogs can increase its title haul Saturday night 
during the individual event finals. Seven athletes will compete, 
with Lichey competing in all four events.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Victim Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Makai Hall was shot in the leg, 10 bullet holes in  
all. But when a homemade explosive landed near him and several 
other injured students, he didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw it away from us,'' the 16-year-old Columbine High  
School student said quietly, his eyes cast downward. 
</P>
<P>
	The dark-haired teen didn't want to be portrayed as a hero. He  
told reporters at St. Anthony Central Hospital on Friday he just 
wanted to give thanks for the outpouring of support and be with his 
friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found it really easy to think of all the bad things that  
have come from this, but it really makes you feel good to think of 
the human compassion and how everyone came together to help us 
out,'' Hall said. ``I just wanted to thank everyone. It's made me 
feel really good and it's helped my recovery very much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it's a great tragedy, I'm not going to let it  
bring me down. I'm going to use it to motivate myself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall spoke to reporters before being discharged from the  
hospital. He arrived at the briefing in a wheelchair. A blue and 
white ribbon was pinned to his green fleece pullover. His face was 
young and clear, except for an injury to the left side of his jaw 
where he had been hit with shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was one of 23 people injured when two students dressed in  
long, black trench coats blazed into the school Tuesday, showering 
it with bombs and bullets. Fifteen people, including the two 
killers, died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember a teacher running into the library screaming that  
some kids had guns,'' Hall said. ``Everybody got under their desks 
really quick and then soon after that, not more than five minutes 
after that two people came in and started shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall knew one of the shooters, Dylan Klebold, and had him in a  
French class the year before. He said Klebold was an ``all right 
guy. ... He never treated me bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said he doesn't know if he looked Klebold in the eye when  
Klebold and fellow gunman Eric Harris stormed into the library 
where Hall was hiding under a desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``They fired a number of shots and one hit me and I lay on the  
ground. They moved towards me and that's all I can remember,'' Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said his friend Patrick Ireland, who dangled desperately  
from a library window before being saved by SWAT team members, 
tried to help him. But Hall was reluctant to say much about his 
friend or some other events. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things I just don't feel that people should  
know. It's a tragedy, yeah, but how far do you have to go with 
it,'' said Hall, who was joined by his father, David, and his 
mother, Sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall is expected to make a full recovery. He said he's focusing  
on his emotional well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see some of the people that were there and I want to  
go to some of the services and stuff and start healing 
emotionally,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to keep active and use it to motivate myself.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Takes Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Michigan men's gymnastics team took the  
lead after its first event Friday and never relinquished it en 
route to winning its first national title since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines scored a season-best 232.55. Ohio State,  
Michigan's Big Ten Conference rival, was a distant second at 
230.850. Host Nebraska was third with 229.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The three teams qualified after Thursday's preliminary round.  
Michigan had the top preliminary score. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed optimistic coming into tonight,'' Michigan coach  
Kurt Golder said. ``I don't think we were intimidated by anyone at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The title comes just three years after a winless season by the  
Wolverines. Golder took over the program the following year and 
built it into a national powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plan was to get here in the fourth year and be in  
contention in the fifth year,'' Golder said. ``We got lucky and got 
some great recruits. Everything fell into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan began the night on pommel horse. Freshman Scott Vetere  
said it was important for the Wolverines to do well in the first 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous,'' he said. ``But it got the adrenaline  
going, and we took it from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolverines' winning performance also included a season high  
on floor exercise (39.075). 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we would do well on floor,'' sophomore Justin Toman  
said. ``We should, because it's one of stronger events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan also merited strong individual performances from  
all-arounders Toman and Vetere. Toman scored a 58.075, the night's 
top all-around score. Vetere had a second-best 57.925. 
</P>
<P>
	Toman's showing comes one night after he just missed winning the  
national all-around title. He finished second to Nebraska sophomore 
Jason Hardabura by one tenth of a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I much rather would have a national championship ring than a  
little (all-around) plaque,'' he said.

	Americans Expect More Shotings  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four out of five Americans expect more  
shootings like the attacks at a Colorado high school to occur 
elsewhere in the country over the next year or so, says a new poll. 
In another poll, about that many said high school shootings are a 
sign something is seriously wrong in this country. A CNN/USA 
Today/Gallup poll taken this week indicated 79 percent believe 
Tuesday's shootings in Littleton, Colo., that left 15 dead -- 
including the two assailants -- are a sign of serious national 
problems rather than isolated incidents. In a CBS poll, 80 percent 
said they expect more shootings.

	5 Charged in Texas Shooting Plot  
</P>
<P>
	WIMBERLEY, Texas (AP) -- Five junior high school students have  
been charged with conspiring to kill students and teachers in an 
alleged plot similar to the Colorado rampage, authorities said. The 
boys, all age 14, were taken into custody yesterday and are being 
held on juvenile charges of conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy 
to commit arson and conspiracy to manufacture explosives, said 
sheriff's Sgt. Allen Bridges. Officials believe the boys had been 
planning since January to carry out an assault at Danforth Junior 
High School in Wimberley, a 450-student school about 40 miles 
northeast of San Antonio.

	NATO Strikes Yugoslav Army Base

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes today bombarded the  
home base of Yugoslav forces operating in Kosovo, less than a day 
after the United States announced it was sending more troops to 
Albania to bolster the campaign against Slobodan Milosevic's forces 
in the province. Also, American diplomats have begun drafting a 
U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the demilitarization 
of Kosovo and an international military force. The move appears 
aimed at silencing European critics who had complained that the 
alliance ignored the United Nations in launching its air campaign 
March 24.

failed to adopt a U.S. resolution censuring Beijing's human rights 
record. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said the 
commission's 22-17 vote to dismiss the resolution showed worldwide 
recognition of China's human rights progress. ``The United States 
stands alone in this anti-China farce. The motion against China was 
naturally doomed to fail,'' Sun said in a statement read to 
reporters and splashed on the front page of People's Daily, the 
Communist Party's flagship newspaper.

	New Computer Bug To Strike Monday

and prevent the equipment from restarting is poised to strike on 
Monday, but experts say off-the-shelf antivirus software can 
prevent infection, and several companies are offering free 
inoculation tools on their Web sites. The virus has been dubbed 
Chernobyl because its most common version was programmed to

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear La. School Board Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Monday  
in a Louisiana dispute about how school board members are elected, 
a case that will affect the federal government's ability to 
challenge election laws that hurt minority voting power. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the court is an 8-year-old lawsuit challenging how the  
district map is drawn for election of Bossier Parish's 12 school 
board members. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Bossier Parish's 12-member school board was totally  
white. In 1996, two blacks were elected. A third, first appointed 
to fill a vacancy, was elected last year to a full term. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was chosen from majority white districts, and  
Superintendent Jane E. Smith says that fact alone should be enough 
to sway justices to end the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We followed the law and achieved what the Justice Department  
wanted us to do without gerrymandering,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's eventual decision will determine how easy or  
difficult it will be for the Justice Department to reject proposed 
election law changes that hurt minority voting power in nine 
Southern states and parts of other states which must get federal 
approval of changes in voting practices under the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for George Price and the local chapter of the NAACP say  
despite the recent election of blacks to the school board, 
minorities are still not adequately represented. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 1990 census required a redrawing of the board's  
election map, Price, then president of the civil rights group, 
proposed creating two districts with black majorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had never been a black elected to the parish school  
board in the parish's history,'' said Price, 55, an administrative 
director of environmental services at LSU Medical Center in 
Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned about the mounting problems, the declining  
number of black teachers and administrators, the overall plight of 
black students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of doing as Price asked, the school board adopted the  
same districts that had been adopted by the police jury, the 
parish's chief governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	The police jury's plan had already received the Justice  
Department's approval, but the school board's duplicate of it did 
not. Justice Department lawyers decided this time it would dilute 
minorities' voting strength. 
</P>
<P>
	A legal battle ensued, and in 1997 the Supreme Court used the  
Bossier Parish case to make it harder for the Justice Department to 
withhold approval of proposed election changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices then sent the case back to a three-judge federal  
court in Louisiana so it could decide whether federal approval can 
be withheld for a discriminatory ``purpose'' other than leaving 
minority voters worse off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We drew the lines according to state law,'' Ms. Smith said.  
``They wanted us to gerrymander to ensure that two minorities would 
be elected. Gerrymandering is unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Brannan, who represents Price and will argue before the  
high court, said the board's current makeup does not worsen the 
condition of minority voters in light of the Supreme Court's 
ruling. ``But we believe evidence shows there was discrimination, 
which was part of the motivating purpose behind the plan, and we 
think that should be sufficient enough to bar it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price said he could not understand the continued opposition to  
creating at least two minority districts in a parish whose 
population is about 20 percent black.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for money  
and stricter gun laws to help stem school violence such as the 
attack last week at a Colorado high school in which 15 people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said in his weekly radio address Saturday that he wants  
to keep guns away from juveniles and will seek $12 million for 
emergency teams ``to help communities respond when tragedy 
strikes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack in Littleton, Colo., was the seventh at schools  
around the country in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun-control legislation the president is requesting would focus  
on keeping guns out of the hands of juveniles and providing money 
to help schools hire counselors and mentors and buy metal 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government must take responsibility,'' Clinton said in the  
address. ``We must do more to prevent violence in our schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his Safe Schools Bill would crack down on gun shows  
and illegal gun trafficking, prohibit ``violent juveniles'' from 
being able to buy guns and close ``the loophole that lets juveniles 
own assault rifles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must do more to keep guns out of the hands of violent  
juveniles,'' Clinton said. ``We must do more to prevent violence in 
our schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill provides money to school systems across the nation to  
help prevent repeats of last week's Littleton violence, in addition 
to the $12 million to finance emergency teams to help communities 
in similar crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who delivered the Republicans' weekly  
radio address, said the episode in a quiet Denver suburb warns of 
problems eating at the American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Events like this one warn us there is a virus loose within our  
culture,'' Owens said. ``Too may of our young people are 
susceptible to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens urged parents to play more active roles in their  
children's lives, particularly to pay more attention to what their 
children may be watching on television, what video games they play, 
what World Wide Web sites they log onto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know if your child has a home page?'' Owens asked. ``Do  
you know what is on your child's home page, or whom they talk with 
on the Internet? 
</P>
<P>
	``If not, please find out.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Eyes Precautions for Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baseball officials asked federal authorities to  
restrict the air space over Camden Yards on May 3 during the game 
between the Baltimore Orioles and a Cuban national team, The 
Washington Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said they made the request earlier this  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Their concern stemmed from a Miami-based pilot's apparent  
intention during the Orioles-Cuba game on March 28 to drop leaflets 
over the stadium in Havana, The Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working together with the Cuban delegation and we've  
gone over all sorts of security issues,'' Pat Courtney, a baseball 
spokesman told The Post. ``On the question of airspace, we haven't 
received an answer yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Levin, another baseball spokesman, said Saturday that it  
was ``normal procedure for any of our big events'' such as World 
Series games, to ask for restrictions on planes flying over. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Peters, FAA spokesman for the eastern region, confirmed  
Saturday that the FAA had received a request to keep traffic away 
from the stadium during the game, but said he didn't know where it 
came from or the reason it was made. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA told ``the party that made the request that they should  
contact the U.S. Secret Service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Extraordinary circumstances usually surround these kinds of  
restrictions,'' Peters said, citing restrictions around the 
Washington D.C. area during the NATO summit as an example. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Basulto, the pilot who planned to drop literature on the  
Havana stadium, told The Post he had no intention of trying again 
in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the May 3 game as an ``insult that trivializes the  
suffering of the Cuban people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basulto, a veteran of the failed U.S.-sponsored invasion of Cuba  
in 1961, founded a humanitarian group called Brothers to the Rescue 
in 1994 to assist Cubans escaping the island on rafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, four of his followers were killed when Cuban  
air force jets shot down two of the group's planes in international 
airspace over the Straits of Florida. Basulto, piloting a third 
plane in the area, escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Basulto dropped leaflets from the air to  
commemorate the third anniversary of the 1996 downing. Some floated 
into downtown Havana, according to a story in a Spanish-language 
paper published by the Miami Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Basulto told The Post his plan to do the same on March 28 was  
interrupted by an unscheduled FAA inspection as two planes were 
seeking clearance for takeoff from Opa-Locka airport in Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Basulto said he acknowledged to inspectors who found half a  
million leaflets in the two planes his intention to drop them on 
the stadium that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes eventually were cleared for takeoff, but when  
Basulto's planes reached the spot 10 miles north of Havana where he 
planned to release the leaflets, wind conditions had changed. The 
plan was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA's regional office in Atlanta said in a statement that  
all flights south of the Straits of Florida are ``monitored 
closely'' and that the inspection was ``not out of the ordinary,'' 
The Post reported.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Massachusetts man says he rushed to register  
three World Wide Web addresses after the Colorado school shooting 
rampage -- all to keep them out of the wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Troche of Taunton managed to register trenchcoatmafia.net  
and trenchcoatmafia.org, but someone beat him by several minutes to 
the name trenchcoatmafia.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want someone to use those names to come up with a  
neo-Nazi Web page, saying 'Let's blow up the world,''' said Troche, 
29, who owns a beeper company. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the person who registered trenchcoatmafia.com was also  
trying to prevent misuse of the name. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teens, dressed in black trench coats, killed 13 people and  
injured 23 others before killing themselves at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo. Both boys belonged to a group that 
called themselves the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Troche said he wanted to prevent others from making money off  
the 'trenchcoatmafia' name. He said two people interested in buying 
the Web addresses have already approached him. He claimed one man 
offered $30,000 and another offered $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	LAKE STEVENS, Wash. (AP) -- The Trenchcoats used to be anything  
but controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	The mellow a capella singing group was booked as the headliner  
for a May 13 concert at the high school Performing Arts Center in 
this town about 25 miles north of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that two members of the group calling itself the Trenchcoat  
Mafia has been blamed for the shooting deaths of 15 people at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., the concert is getting a 
second look. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it,'' Mayor Jay Echols said Friday. ``We've been  
struck by lightning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group of cleancut men in their late 20s and early 30s don't  
even wear trench coats, Echols said. 
</P>
<P>
	Echols said the band's manager has been out of town and  
unavailable for discussion of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	A discussion is likely Tuesday at a meeting of the town's  
Performing Arts Commission, the mayor added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I totally understand that everyone wants to respect what  
happened in Littleton,'' said Echols, ``but I am concerned about 
what to do because we have already sold tickets and we have a 
contract with the band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the group's problems, a student mistakenly gave the  
Seattle singing group's Web address -- www.trenchcoats.com -- as the 
site of those who planned the shootings and booby trapping of the 
school with bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our server has just been lighting up like a Christmas tree  
since Wednesday night,'' bass singer Kerry Dahlen told The Seattle 
Times. ``It's been pretty interesting traffic.'' 
</P>

	WATERFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Three Oakland County students  
asked that their high school's flag be flown at half-staff in 
respect for the victims of last week's mass killings at a Colorado 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Waterford district refused, saying it would  
violate flag etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Ivory, Matt Redmond and Aaron Hiner asked that the flag be  
lowered at Mott High School, as it has been at countless other 
schools since last Tuesday's shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivory said the principal told him it could not be done.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said `no' because we have to have an order from the  
president or governor to fly it at half-staff,'' Ivory told The 
Oakland Press of Pontiac. ``I called Congressman (Dale) Kildee, and 
a guy checked it out and said the president or governor can issue 
an order, but it is up to the organization or group to decide if 
they want to fly the flag lowered.''

<P>
	PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- The Colorado school shootings have  
prompted Portsmouth schools to ban black trench coats and dark 
clothing associated with shock singer Marilyn Manson and the gothic 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``When kids come back from vacation, they better not even think  
about wearing Marilyn Manson'' or anything else related to the 
gothic movement -- a look defined by white face paint and black or 
dark-dyed hair, said Superintendent Suzanne Schrader. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents are welcome to challenge me in court,'' Schrader told  
the Portsmouth Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrader said she hopes banning divisive clothes will help  
students feel less of a separation from one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Parent Anastasia Parker disagrees with the ban. Her daughter  
Rachel went to the media last year because students were tormenting 
her for her Marilyn Manson-wear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marilyn Manson is 75 percent of my daughter's wardrobe,'' she  
said. ``Does this mean I have to go out and buy all new clothes?''

	An April 22 Associated Press story and list about the  
fastest-growing companies in America's inner cities contained 
erroneous information supplied by the Initiative for a Competitive 
Inner City and published in Inc. magazine.

<HEADLINE> FBI Claims INS Worker Took Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An immigration official has been charged with  
taking bribes from Albanians and other foreigners seeking political 
asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	John Shandorf, one of eight supervisors for the Asylum Division  
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Queens, was 
charged with conspiracy and accepting bribes, according to the FBI 
and the INS. 
</P>
<P>
	Shandorf was arrested at his office April 8 and is free on bail.  
He did not return a telephone message seeking comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Special Agent Daniel Lyons said Shandorf accepted between  
$500 and several thousand dollars from at least 30 foreigners, and 
then either approved their asylum applications himself, oversaw a 
subordinate who did so, or overturned someone else's denial of an 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	``One alien in particular admitted to me that his asylum  
application contained specific allegations of persecution that were 
purportedly directed at the alien and his family when they resided 
in Albania,'' Lyons said. ``At the time that the acts of political 
persecution had allegedly occurred in Albania, this alien had 
already entered, and was residing in, the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least two other unidentified people also have been charged in  
connection with the scheme, the FBI said. One individual pleaded 
guilty to bribery of a public official and another was arrested for 
conspiracy to influence, obstruct and impede a governmental 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Political asylum is supposed to be reserved for immigrants who  
would likely suffer political or religious persecutions if forced 
to return to their native countries.

<HEADLINE> NATO Looks to Future of Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders, having declared their  
determination to bomb Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into 
submission, moved on today to key questions of the alliance's 
future -- and the possibility of more Kosovos. President Clinton 
said the current crisis underscored ``the imperative of modernizing 
our alliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question of how to deal with Kosovo, the province where  
Yugoslav army and special police forces are attempting to force out 
the ethnic Albanian majority, dominated the first day of the 
three-day NATO summit and put a damper on what was to have been a 
celebration of the alliance's 50 years of maintaining the peace in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said today that discussions  
included the future of the region and ``how we are going to stop 
the former Yugoslavia from being the permanent bleeding wound of 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday evening, NATO defense ministers approved a plan to stop  
oil imports from reaching Yugoslavia via Montenegro, said German 
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Scharping told reporters, ships suspected of  
carrying oil would be stopped and searched at harbor entry and 
turned back if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has concentrated much of its air campaign on bombing oil  
storage and refining capabilities, but has been frustrated that 
while pilots risk their lives to bomb these facilities, refined oil 
continues to enter the country. The 15-nation European Union 
already has agreed on an oil embargo, but that does not cover all 
potential oil shippers. 
</P>
<P>
	As the alliance leaders opened today's session, Clinton said,  
``The crisis in Kosovo has underscored the importance of NATO and 
the imperative of modernizing our alliance for 21st century 
challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Clinton with brief remarks before today's discussions  
were closed to the media, Javier Solana, the alliance's 
secretary-general, said that in Kosovo, NATO is facing ``the same 
challenges to stability, security and well-being in Europe'' that 
it faced when it was founded 50 years ago to counter the Soviet 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day devoted to discussions of Kosovo, alliance leaders  
were moving to approval of an overall NATO strategic concept: basic 
principles that they term the European Security and Defense 
Identity. The program would allow European countries freedom to 
conduct operations in which the United States was not interested, 
but using NATO assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The program includes a new Defense Capability Initiative, an  
attempt to head off a growing technology gap between U.S. military 
forces and the rest of the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategic concept outlines the threats of the future against  
which NATO might have to defend, among them regional and ethnic 
conflicts like Kosovo, terrorism, and proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the agenda is a program setting out required steps for  
aspiring members, a sort of road map to joining NATO; the enhanced 
Partnership for Peace program, wherein non-member countries get 
involved in NATO activities which may or may not lead to 
membership; increased dialogue with Mediterranean countries; and 
creation of a new center to deal with weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The major difference over the new strategic concept, which will  
replace the one last revised in 1991, concerns the alliance's 
relations with the United Nations. Essentially, France and a number 
of other European countries want to set out specifically the 
conditions under which NATO can take military action outside its 
traditional Euro-Atlantic area. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, while agreeing the United Nations should play  
a pre-eminent role, feels the issue is adequately addressed in 
NATO's founding treaty and prefers to leave the details vague. This 
would allow the alliance to act on its own under special 
circumstances -- Kosovo being the perfect example. A Russian veto 
would have prohibited any NATO action in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a wide difference between President Clinton and me on  
the need to ask the United Nations (before taking action),'' French 
President Jacques Chirac said after meeting with Clinton on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies dismissed a Russian initiative to settle the conflict  
since Belgrade still refused to accept a NATO-led military force to 
enforce peace. Still, the leaders said they wanted to work 
constructively with Russia and that Moscow had ``an important role 
to play in the search for a solution to the conflict in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the 19 NATO nations were expected to acknowledge the  
nine countries now seeking membership in the alliance. Each 
candidate will be asked to provide NATO with an action plan, and in 
return will receive feedback, advice and help in defense planning.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Notre Dame Basketball Coach Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Former Notre Dame basketball coach Johnny Dee died  
Saturday of cancer, his son said. Dee, who had a second career as a 
lawyer, was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee was basketball coach at Notre Dame from 1964-71. He led his  
team to the NCAA tournament in his first season and to an overall 
record of 116-80 in seven seasons. During his tenure, Notre Dame 
played in four NCAA tournaments and one NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee attended Notre Dame from 1944-46. He earned his  
undergraduate degree in philosophy and history from Loyola of 
Chicago in 1947 and returned to Notre Dame to earn a law degree in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
	At 28, Dee was hired as coach at Alabama, at the time the  
youngest in NCAA history. He coached there for four seasons before 
heading to Denver to coach the D-C Truckers from 1956-62. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee returned to Denver after leaving Notre Dame in 1971. He  
worked as a private practice lawyer and was Denver's city auditor 
from 1975-79. He had previously held a public office as the manager 
of parks and recreation in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee is survived by children Melinda Dee, Dennis Dee and John Dee  
III, all of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> US Veteran Seeks Mercy for Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A hardscrabble childhood put Manuel Babbitt  
on the receiving end of life's hard blows. Two bloody tours of duty 
in Vietnam programmed him to deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
	The fractured halves of Babbitt's life blew apart one foggy  
December night in 1980. He broke into the home of Leah Schendel, 
hammering her with punches that shattered her dentures, split the 
skin on her forehead to the bone and jolted her 78-year-old heart 
into fatal arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 4, a day after he turns 50, Babbitt is scheduled to pay  
for that crime with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	His family and his lawyers say Babbitt, who was awarded a Purple  
Heart in a rare death-row ceremony, is a casualty of war. 
</P>
<P>
	They are asking for mercy from another Vietnam vet, Gov. Gray  
Davis, on the grounds that Babbitt was in the grip of a flashback 
when he attacked Mrs. Schendel; in an eerie detail, Babbitt wrapped 
a leather strap around her ankle like a soldier tagging battlefield 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Vietnam that killed Leah Schendel,'' says Babbitt's  
sister, Donna Kendricks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're feeling betrayed,'' adds brother Bill Babbitt, the man  
who first suspected Manuel Babbitt of murder -- and went to police 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schendel's relatives have a problem with Babbitt's  
execution, too. They want to know why it has taken so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tired,'' says John Rizzotti, Mrs. Schendel's  
great-grandson. ``He was clearly guilty back then; he's clearly 
guilty now. This man deserves to die, there is no way around it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Pina Babbitt's alcoholic father, an immigrant from Cape  
Verde off the western coast of Africa, beat his children with a 
strap he made himself, three strips at the bottom for extra sting. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat, food and clothing were scarce at the family's tumbledown  
home in Wareham, Mass.; when the children were big enough to carry 
a box, they worked picking the New England cranberry bogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt left school illiterate at age 17. In 1967, he failed the  
Marines screening exam. The second time, the recruiter helped him. 
</P>
<P>
	The defining moment of Babbitt's life, his defenders say, was  
the January 1968 siege of Khe Sanh, 77 days of bombardment, mud and 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
	After a while, wrote Navy Chaplain Ray W. Stubbes, many young  
recruits ``developed a flat, blank expression we called 'the 
thousand-yard stare.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt was wounded in March when two rockets exploded next to  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Khe Sanh, Babbitt said this week, ``made a ... teen-ager into a  
person who has a side of him that he didn't understand at the time 
-- anxiousness and a sadness that was even sadder than it was before 
he got there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He remembers loading shells filled with thousands of darts. ``A  
bunch of little tiny nails hit little tiny humans and all the 
humans fell. There'd be nothing but blood and guts on the landscape 
and that was the kind of things I had to look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, ``the Manny that came back from overseas was nuts,''  
childhood friend Phil Gomes told defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was discharged in 1970 for ``instability.''  
</P>
<P>
	In March 1973, he was arrested for robbery. He ended up in a  
mental hospital, where he later attempted suicide after learning 
that his wife of five years was leaving him. He was paroled in 1975 
and moved to Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt started a new family with a new girlfriend.  
</P>
<P>
	But soon, he became the neighborhood crazy. He wore battle  
fatigues and would crouch in the middle of the street like a 
soldier on patrol. He once ran through the house, screaming ``We've 
got to get the baby out!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1980, he was accused of raping and beating a  
prostitute. He was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the family sent Babbitt to live with brother Bill in  
Sacramento. They hoped to jump-start his life. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 18, 1980, fog hung low over Sacramento as it had in Khe  
Sanh. Sometime after 10 p.m., drunk and stoned, Babbitt walked 
along a brightly lit strip; he would later tell doctors the car 
headlights looked like incoming aircraft. He reached the complex 
where Mrs. Schendel was watching TV, probably a war movie called 
``Tokyo Joe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When she was found the next morning, Mrs. Schendel was nude from  
the waist down. A mattress had been pulled over the top half of her 
body, a tea kettle placed on her pelvis and a leather strap tied 
around her ankle. She died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 24 hours later, Babbitt attacked a 60-year-old woman,  
but broke off when a friend rushed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt says he has no memory of the attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers believe the fog, the drugs, contact with an  
Asian vet during the day, and the war movie propelled Babbitt back 
to the kill-or-be-killed world of combat. They say his efforts to 
cover the body mirror the battlefield practice of covering the dead 
with whatever is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On March 20, 1998, a Marine officer pinned a Purple Heart on  
Babbitt's chest. Shackled by manacles, Babbitt bent at the waist, 
bringing his forehead to his hand in a stiff salute. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen months later, he approaches death philosophically.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never begged for my life -- it's just a life,'' he said.  
``For the time I have been on this planet it hasn't been a very 
happy situation.''

<HEADLINE> Court Bars Use of Rival Trademark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal appeals court outlawed a stealth  
weapon in the Internet commerce wars by forbidding companies from 
using their rivals' trademarks to steal business through Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involves  
the practice of including a competitors' trademark or brand name in 
an Internet site, either as the address or through what are known 
as ``meta-tags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``meta-tags'' are embedded in a Web page's coding. They  
can't be seen but a search program can detect them. The result is 
that millions of consumers looking for a particular trademark may 
find themselves pointed to the competitor's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court compared the practice to ``posting a sign with  
another's trademark in front of one's store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thursday ruling, which is binding in California and eight  
other Western states, is one of the latest to interpret trademark 
law for the high-stakes field of electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because e-commerce is new, some businesses feel there are no  
laws in place that govern their actions,'' said Jonathan Rosenoer 
of the consulting firm Arthur Anderson. ``The court is saying this 
is not the Wild West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved Brookfield Communication Inc., a Los  
Angeles-based company that sells entertainment industry software. 
In a suit filed last year, it accused West Coast Entertainment of 
infringing on its trademark, ``MovieBuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brookfield said the company, one of the nation's largest video  
rental chains, improperly took the Web address www.moviebuff.com 
and included it in the coding. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge initially ruled against Brookfield, saying West  
Coast Entertainment registered the address first and thus had some 
right to use it. But the appeals court ordered the judge to issue a 
permanent injunction barring West Coast from using the Web address 
or meta-tags. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivals still would be permitted to use competitors' trademarks  
for product comparisons and other legitimate uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision helps to protect intellectual property, which is  
driving our booming economy,'' said Richard Lee Stone, a lawyer for 
Brookfield. ``Brand names have value, and this helps companies 
preserve that value.''

<HEADLINE> Tatis Makes History With Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mark McGwire never did it. Neither did Babe  
Ruth nor Hank Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody in baseball history had ever hit two grand slams in one  
inning. Until Fernando Tatis came along. 
</P>
<P>
	With home run king McGwire playing setup man, Tatis hit a pair  
of bases-loaded homers in the same inning Friday night. Both were 
off Chan Ho Park in the third inning of the St. Louis Cardinals' 
12-5 win over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an accomplishment; I get goose pimples just thinking  
about it,'' said St. Louis manager Tony La Russa, who also had a 
great seat last year during McGwire's 70-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	``What have they got, 100 years of baseball, and this is the  
first time it's ever been done? Wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, who had never hit a grand slam and totaled just 24 homers  
in his previous 225 major league games, also set a record with 
eight RBIs in one inning. 
</P>
<P>
	He was stunned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it happened. I did not expect to hit another  
one. I've never been a home run hitter. I just try to meet the 
ball. I'm not like Mark McGwire,'' said Tatis, who at 5-foot-10 and 
170 pounds is 7 inches shorter and 80 pounds lighter than the St. 
Louis first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything fell into place for Tatis to make baseball history.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Davis was out with an injury, so Tatis moved up a spot to  
bat cleanup. McGwire singled to load the bases once, then flied out 
to leave them loaded the next time. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis missed his second full game with an injured left hand,  
hurt when he was hit by a pitch in the seventh inning of Tuesday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his contribution -- being out of the lineup -- Davis  
shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had nothing to do with it, man,'' he said. ``You trying to  
say that would have been me? I might be walked and he might have 
still been up with the bases loaded. Who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only nine other players in major league history have hit two  
grand slams in an entire game. Tony Cloninger, a former Atlanta 
pitcher, was the only NL player to do it, with a pair in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, whose homers were his only hits in five at-bats, sent a  
2-0 fastball from Park 450-plus feet into the left-field bullpen 
with no out in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after McGwire flied out to shallow right to leave the  
bases loaded with two out, Tatis lined Park's 3-2 slider into the 
lower seats in the left-field pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was going out. I just kept on running, then  
I thought, `Oh, wow!,''' said Tatis, who didn't know he had set a 
record until he got back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the first, with a 2-0 count, I was looking for my pitch, a  
fastball inside. He threw it and I hit it. The second time, he 
threw a slider in and I was not expecting it and I tried to just 
line it''. 
</P>
<P>
	His second homer wasn't nearly as imposing, but it did clear the  
375-foot sign in left field with room to spare during the 11-run 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good month for most guys,'' said teammate Darren  
Bragg, who was on base for both homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Park made history, too, although he has to share the dubious  
distinction of giving up two grand slams in one inning with a 
pitcher from more than 100 a years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a terrible day,'' said Park, who gave up 11 runs,  
six earned, in the disastrous inning. ``I did a lot of studying on 
McGwire before the game, but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other pitcher who gave up two grand slams in an inning was  
Bill Phillips of the Pittsburgh Pirates, tagged for bases-loaded 
homers by Tommy Burns and Malachi Kittredge in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
	Park (1-2) faced 13 batters in the inning, three batters after  
manager Davey Johnson was thrown out of the game for protesting a 
call at home plate. Park finally got the hook after Tatis' second 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, a Dominican who came to the Cardinals in a trade with  
Texas last July, has a .270 career average after slightly more than 
1 1/2 years in the majors. He's hitting .264 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for RBIs in one inning was six, shared by a  
long list of players. Matt Williams did it most recently, on Aug. 
27, 1997, for Cleveland. The last NL player to match the record was 
Atlanta's Dale Murphy on July 27, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, out 1 1/2 games with a tight left hamstring, was 1-for-5  
as he became a footnote to another bit of homer history in his 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire waved reporters away after the game, saying they should  
go talk to the guy with all the RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The seats in the outfield pavilion were jammed for the game,  
with young and old wearing baseball gloves, most in hopes of 
catching a ball hit by McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lerner, who attended the game with his two sons, wound  
up with Tatis' second homer ball after paying $80 to the young fan 
who caught it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ball belongs in the Hall of Fame. That's what's  
important,'' Lerner said in a hallway leading to the Cardinals' 
clubhouse. ``This was history. It was bedlam there. Everybody knew 
what was going on. I got a few bruises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa had plans for the historic lineup card.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have the players autograph it, then we'll auction it  
off. So somebody will have to reach into their pocket to get it,'' 
he said. ``We'll give the money to charity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBORO, Pa. (AP) -- A year ago today, 14-year-old Andrew Wurst  
opened fire on a banquet hall full of his eighth-grade classmates, 
killing a teacher and wounding two students. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack destroyed students' sense of security, and the year  
that has passed hasn't restored the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``My one daughter can't walk across the back patio yet where he  
bled to death,'' said James Strand, referring to teacher John 
Gillette. ``I would have thought a year would have eased some of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the experience here is any guide, the people of Littleton,  
Colo., are facing a long emotional convalescence, a period when 
seemingly little things can unexpectedly bring back large fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Hoover, a high school freshman who attended the dance  
last year that Wurst attacked, recalled how a simple scheduling 
statement triggered tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an announcement that a trial was coming up for Andy,  
and I was sitting next to my friend and she started bawling her 
eyes out,'' she said. ``I've got a lot of friends who are really 
upset about it and cry every time it comes up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pain exists close to the surface calm for many of Edinboro's  
5,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Zemcik, 15, who was shot in the toe at the dance, tries  
not to think about Wurst, the dance -- or what happened this week in 
Colorado. Choking up, he asked not to be told about the shootings 
at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather not know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Students were dedicating a memorial garden to Gillette today and  
planning to hold a prayer vigil. 
</P>
<P>
	Wurst's attorney, Phil Friedman, said his client committed the  
shooting but has a mental illness that makes him believe he is the 
only real person alive. Wurst has pleaded innocent, and no trial 
date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoover sat in a vacant lot after school with two 16-year-old  
friends, Nick Ferguson and Levi Kuczaj. Both boys are sophomore 
punk-rock fans who pride themselves on not fitting in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen this town go to hell,'' Ferguson said. ``That kid  
went goofy last year. The school came down on us real hard. We're 
kids. We should be allowed to be kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boys rattled off a list of friends they say have been  
disciplined for minor offenses since the attack. One was kicked out 
of school for repeated backtalk; others are on probation for 
breaking light bulbs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's forcing us to grow up faster. And when you grow up  
faster, you don't grow up right,'' Kuczaj said. 
</P>
<P>
	Therese Walter, superintendent of the school district, agreed  
the schools have become more strict, and she says most parents are 
grateful.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Wins Night Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Defending champion Georgia stayed on  
course for its fifth national title by winning the night session in 
the NCAA Gymnastics Championships Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gym Dogs, Michigan and Nebraska will compete in Friday's  
Super Six competition at the University of Utah's Huntsman Center. 
UCLA, Alabama and Arizona State qualified in the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia's team score of 197.025 topped both sessions. The Gym  
Dogs closed the competition with a stunning 49.400 combined score 
on the beam and confirmed their status as Friday's team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of teams that are a lot deeper than Georgia,  
but I don't think any team digs as deep as Georgia,'' Gym Dogs 
coach Suzanne Yoculan said. ``They just won't quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's Theresa Kulikowski became the first freshman to win the  
individual all-around title since Kentucky's Jenny Hansen in 1993. 
Kulikowski posted an overall score of 39.675, edging Georgia senior 
Karin Lichey (39.575). 
</P>
<P>
	But the night session's biggest surprise came when the Utes,  
winners of a record nine national championships, fell three times 
on the beam and failed to qualify for the Super Six for the second 
time in three years. Utah (195.475 points) finished fourth, 0.75 
points behind Nebraska (196.225) for the final spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a bittersweet moment, because I'd like to  
celebrate as a team,'' Kulikowski said. ``We all put in the work 
together. It's kind of tough right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA and Alabama were the highest-ranked teams in the afternoon  
session, and didn't disappoint. Despite serious miscues on beam, 
UCLA (196.425 points) and Alabama (194.950) both easily advanced 
into the Super Six. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't competed like that on balance beam all year,''  
Alabama coach Sarah Patterson said of her team's season-low 47.850 
beam score, which included three falls. ``The first day is always a 
lot of nerves. The pressure is so much to get to (Friday) night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Alabama and UCLA was Arizona State (194.525), the  
surprise team of the afternoon. The Sun Devils needed a 48.275 on 
vault -- their final event -- to pass LSU for the final spot in the 
Super Six. 
</P>
<P>
	They got it when Amy Shelton, their last competitor, registered  
a 9.775. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you could see tonight, vaulting is not our strongest event,  
so I was pretty nervous,'' Arizona State coach John Spini said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan performed best in floor exercises, posting a team score  
of 49.375, the highest of the day. Sarah Cain and Lisa Simes each 
finished with all-around scores of 39.275 to lead the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska knocked out the host Utes despite not winning any of  
the night session events. The Huskers' Heather Brink was third in 
the night all-around rankings with a score of 39.400. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins' Heidi Moneymaker was the highest-scoring  
all-arounder in the afternoon session and finished third in the 
overall standings behind Kulikowski and Karin Lichey. 
</P>
<P>
	Moneymaker needed a 9.775 on beam, her final event, to tie  
Alabama's Andree Pickens for the all-around lead. Pickens already 
had finished the competition with a 39.45, but Moneymaker's smooth 
9.875 propelled her into the lead at 39.55. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing what adrenaline can do,'' said Moneymaker, or  
``Cash,'' as her teammates call her. 
</P>
<P>
	During last Friday's practice, the junior sprained both ankles  
while practicing her floor routine. Despite overcoming the nagging 
injury, she wasn't completely satisfied with her performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I performed to perfection like I'd like to, but  
I think I had a solid meet,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moneymaker had a 9.85 on vault, 9.95 on bars, 9.875 on beam and  
9.875 on floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana State, Stanford and West Virginia failed to qualify in  
the afternoon session, while Penn State and Florida will join Utah 
on the sidelines from the night session.

<HEADLINE> Morris Abandons Comeback at LPGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- Stomach churning and emotions spent,  
Marianne Morris picked up her ball after missing an 18-inch putt 
and walked off the course Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	She could go no further.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing in her first tournament since her brother was shot to  
death in a robbery, Morris dropped out of the LPGA's Chick-fil-A 
Charity Championship midway through the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris opened with a 5-under-par 67, putting her just two  
strokes off the lead, but she had bogeys on the first two holes 
Saturday and never recovered. She withdrew with a 42, having 
bogeyed six of nine holes at Eagles Landing Country Club south of 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went right yesterday,'' said her mother, Barbara  
Morris, tears streaming down her cheeks. ``Nothing went right 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' caddie, Jeff King, said the golfer had a queasy stomach,  
but her condition seemed more emotional than physical as she played 
her first tournament in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	She hasn't been able to eat and had a restless night of sleep  
after her remarkable opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to take time,'' her mother said. ``This is her  
job. She loves it. But it's hard right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the short par putt at 18 -- she played the back  
nine first -- Morris stopped off at the clubhouse to inform 
officials of her withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Her playing partners, Rachel Hetherington and Jane Crafter,  
waited for a few minutes at No. 1 before Morris pulled up on a cart 
to tell she couldn't finish the round. Both gave her a hug and 
Morris, red-eyed, hopped back in the cart and returned to the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least she was able to salvage some pride and go out with a  
67 on her scorecard,'' King said. ``There was no reason to stay out 
there. If she was playing decent, maybe she would have tried to 
finish out. But there's no sense staying out there and punishing 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's been enough of that already. Mike Morris, her mentor,  
business partner and best friend, was gunned down Feb. 21 in a 
robbery at the suburban Atlanta golf shop they owned together. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old golfer considered quitting the tour after her  
brother's death, unsure if the game still had meaning. But two 
weeks ago, she picked up a sand wedge and started chipping. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris decided to resume her career at the same event where her  
brother served as her caddie a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a bad place to start again,'' Barbara Morris said.  
``She can't eat. She can't keep anything down. There's still stuff 
she's got to settle as far as business. She's got a lot on her 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That made the first round even more remarkable. Morris made a  
couple of 25-foot birdie putts and another from 20 feet, feeling 
each time that her brother's presence was guiding the ball into the 
cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm playing for both of us,'' she said after the  
round. ``Maybe I'll be more like him -- play aggressive and enjoy 
being out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the burden was too much to bear two days in a row.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there was pressure,'' Barbara Morris said. ``She  
wanted to do so well after yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was consoled by her mother in the locker room, then emerged  
with golf shoes in hand and headed to her car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't feel like saying anything,'' she said, eyes  
still red. ``I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who has yet to win in nine years on the LPGA tour, hopes  
to play next weekend at the Myrtle Beach Classic in South Carolina, 
her mother said. There is still grieving and healing to do, but 
maybe the worst is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, she's got to be proud of herself,'' King said.  
``This was a big step.''

<HEADLINE> Severinsen Still Going Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Big-band trumpeter Doc Severinsen isn't  
slowing down years after Johnny Carson signed off ``The Tonight 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife tugs at my coattails every once in a while about it,''  
said the 72-year-old Severinsen. ``But why would I want to slow 
down when I'm having this much fun? You don't slow down a race car 
when it's going 185.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Severinsen is performing this weekend at the Cerritos Center for  
the Performing Arts, playing high-energy swing music and big-band 
contemporary songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Severinsen said the revival of swing music makes sense to him,  
though he is still amazed by all the young people who come to his 
band's shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music is perfectly valid today,'' he said. ``It has a  
compelling beat and darn good melodies.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Off to Flying Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- As the 298th straight sellout crowd files  
through the exits at Jacobs Field in a sea of smiling Chief Wahoo 
caps and red, white and blue Indians garb, there is little 
celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome hit another 400-foot-plus homer into the right-field  
seats. Roberto Alomar made another great play behind second base. 
The bullpen did its job. The Indians beat the Oakland Athletics 
5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ho-hum.  
</P>
<P>
	It's much the same downstairs in a subdued Cleveland clubhouse.  
The CD player is off, and while a small group of Indians players 
sit at a table eating, most of the starters are across the hall 
pumping iron and pounding treadmills in the Tribe's 
state-of-the-art strength and conditioning room. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Cleveland Indians are all business. This year,  
the Indians are taking nothing for granted. This year, anything 
short of winning the World Series is a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't say it too loud, but this year, the 1999 Indians don't  
want to be like Cleveland teams of the past four years. No, this 
season, the Indians want to be like the '98 New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	And so far, Cleveland is doing a pretty good imitation of the  
World Series champions, who won a record 125 games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, challenged by manager Mike Hargrove to win 100  
regular-season games AND the World Series, are off to one of their 
best starts ever. Entering Saturday, they were 12-3 and leading the 
AL Central, a k a Comedy Central, by 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland already has had an eight-game winning streak and a  
couple of comeback wins that brought back memories of 1995, when 
the Indians seemed to win every game in their final at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys continue to show how good they are night in and  
night out,'' Hargrove said following one such dramatic victory over 
the A's. 
</P>
<P>
	These guys may have the best 1-through-9 lineup in baseball, and  
were leading the majors in virtually every offensive category going 
into the weekend. They still don't have a legitimate No. 1 starter 
-- not yet anyway -- but their starters were a combined 7-1 to start 
the season. They have the majors' deepest bullpen and may have the 
best middle infield in history. 
</P>
<P>
	However, what has been most impressive about Cleveland's fast  
start is how the team is doing the little things -- moving up 
runners, hitting the cutoff man -- to win. Just like a certain AL 
East team did last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just doing everything very well right now,'' Thome said.  
</P>
<P>
	After the Indians' batting average and runs scored dropped  
significantly last season from the year before, Hargrove wanted his 
players to be more selective at the plate. Instead of ripping the 
first pitch that's close to the strike zone, the Indians are being 
finicky. They're sitting back and waiting. Patient hitters make 
pitchers make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tactic the Yankees used so effectively last season. They  
wore out opposing starters and then teed off on thin bullpens. 
</P>
<P>
	So what's the deal. Have the Indians copied a page from New  
York's '98 playbook? 
</P>
<P>
	``No, no, no,'' Hargrove insists. ``We're trying to be like the  
Indians. We have a lot of intelligent hitters in this lineup who 
are patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intelligent and intimidating, that's the Indians.  
</P>
<P>
	With leadoff hitter Kenny Lofton followed in the batting order  
by Omar Vizquel and Robbie Alomar -- both switch-hitters -- the 
Indians are scoring runs early and often. In their first 13 games, 
the Indians outscored opponents in the first four innings 48-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Lofton and Alomar are among the league leaders in walks, and  
when they've gotten on, Jim Thome and Manny Ramirez, who leads the 
majors in RBIs, have been driving them in. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Fryman, Richie Sexson, Wil Cordero and Sandy Alomar round  
out a Cleveland lineup that hasn't given opposing pitchers a 
moment's rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I faced the Yankees last year, and they were very good. This  
lineup could be a little tougher,'' Oakland's Kenny Rogers said 
after losing to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's defense is another big reason the Indians have owned  
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Alomar has stopped grounders up the middle and run down  
popups that were singles the past 2 1/2 years as the Indians tried out 
16 different second baseman to play alongside Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
	During Cleveland's recent homestand, the Indians avoided at  
least three losses with great defense. Lofton threw out runners at 
the plate in two games with Sandy Alomar blocking the plate 
perfectly both times. 
</P>
<P>
	``On paper, this club has a chance to be the best defensive club  
we've had since I've been here,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had some special teams in his nine seasons in Cleveland,  
including one that came within two outs of winning it all in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's team is being compared with the '95 Indians, a young  
group that had Albert Belle and attitude. Hargrove said that while 
this year's Indians may not have the same swagger, it has a 
confidence similar to the '95 team, which finished 100-44 and won 
the Central by 30 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland clearly showed some attitude Friday night, with two  
bench-clearing brawls in a 7-6 victory over Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The first came when Cleveland starter Jaret Wright hit Darren  
Lewis in the right shoulder in the fifth inning. Boston reliever 
Rheal Cormier retaliated by hitting Thome with a pitch in the ribs 
an inning later, setting off the second brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying this team isn't cocky,'' Hargrove said.  
``There's a difference between arrogance and cocky. This team has 
the same belief in itself as the '95 team, but the difference is 
that this team is not as arrogant as the '95 team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is an air of quiet confidence about this year's Indians  
that's similar to last year's Yankees -- they're good and they know 
it. And unlike the past few Cleveland teams, this one seems to have 
a single-minded sense of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Players are arriving at the ballpark early and staying late. The  
only lines you'll find after the game are at the Stairmasters, not 
at the buffet table. 
</P>
<P>
	During spring training, Cleveland's players were given T-shirts  
with the words: ``100+ Go Hard or Go Home'' printed on the back. 
Hargrove has come under criticism for setting the 100-win goal for 
the team but felt it was necessary to keep the Indians motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever's behind the Indians' fast start, it's working.  
</P>
<P>
	``They believe in themselves and they believe in each other,''  
Hargrove said. ``And they play hard.''

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Farmers Seek Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With many states once again close to depleting  
money available for farm loans, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
is urging Congress to move quickly to pass emergency funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress must act,'' Glickman said late last week. ``We're  
going to be out of money or are (already) out of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The farm credit problem has been brewing for months as farmers  
try to prepare for the spring planting season. Low prices last 
season, affected by the Asian economic crisis and lagging exports, 
left farmers in a serious economic pinch. 
</P>
<P>
	States have reported record numbers of farmers coming in for  
loans, which are administered by state offices of USDA's Farm 
Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand is significantly in excess of the demand of last  
year,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has proposed $153 million in  
emergency money for the Agriculture Department. Most of the money 
would be used for direct loans or loan guarantees for an estimated 
10,000 producers unable to get credit from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	But the money, part of a $1.3 billion supplemental bill that  
also includes hurricane aid for Central America, has stalled as 
lawmakers battle over proposed GOP cuts to offset the spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The money could be further slowed as lawmakers debate an  
emergency funding measure that deals with U.S. efforts in Kosovo, 
according to some congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
	To help the situation, Glickman earlier this month authorized  
shifting $30 million allocated for other uses to temporarily ease 
the loan situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over 3 weeks later, that temporary money has also been  
depleted, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That money is already gone. It's gone,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton in early March signed a stopgap measure that  
allowed $450 million, originally targeted for another program, to 
be used for farm loans. But demand has exceeded funding. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, officials in Arkansas, which was hit hard by last  
year's drought, said they received about $26 million from the 
government covering about 226 new loans. But USDA officials in 
Arkansas say another $55 million is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas' Farm Service Agency approved nearly $130 million in  
guaranteed and emergency loans just in the first half of this 
budget year, a 132 percent increase over 1998, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Moser, a farm loan manager in Nebraska's Wayne County, said  
his office was told by state officials that ``maybe another week to 
two weeks is probably about all the funding that's available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of funds comes as his office is trying to deal with a  
50 percent increase in the number of loan requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand has definitely been greater than in the past,''  
Moser said. ``We've had to shift some priorities around and maybe 
not complete some of the day-to-day things we normally would 
complete. We're just letting those slide until we have some time to 
get to them.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rod Strickland of the Washington Wizards was  
arrested on charges of drunken and reckless driving early Saturday 
-- three weeks after his probation ended for a 
driving-while-impaired conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was pulled over by police who said his gold Mercedes  
Benz was speeding on a District of Columbia street at about 3:45 
a.m. Police said he ran three red lights and changed lanes without 
signaling. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was given a sobriety test and ``apparently did not  
pass,'' Police Commander Charles Fonville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was booked at a precinct and released on  
recognizance. He has a May 7 court date. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Wizards organization is disappointed ... because Rod has  
been exceptional this year in terms of the fans and his commitment 
to the franchise,'' general manager Wes Unseld said. ``We hope to 
garner more information, but for now the situation is in the hands 
of the legal authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was stopped about six hours after the Atlanta Hawks  
defeated the Wizards 89-78, Washington's fourth successive loss. 
Strickland, who averages 15.7 points a game, scored 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland joined the NBA in 1988 and came to Washington in a  
1996 trade with Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 3, 1998, he was convicted of driving while impaired and  
was fined and ordered to complete a driver's alcohol-awareness 
program. He also had to perform 30 hours of community service and 
serve a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	District of Columbia Superior Court Judge John Hess dismissed a  
disorderly conduct charge stemming from Strickland's early-morning 
arrest on Sept. 3, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's latest arrest was the second in two days of an NBA  
star on drunken-driving charges. In Houston, Rockets forward 
Scottie Pippen was accused of running a stop light. Police said he 
failed a field sobriety test and refused to take a Breathalyzer 
test. Pippen denied being drunk.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Violence Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for money  
and stricter gun laws to help stem school violence such as the 
attack last week at a Colorado high school in which 15 people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said in his weekly radio address Saturday that he wants  
to keep guns away from juveniles and will seek $12 million for 
emergency teams ``to help communities respond when tragedy 
strikes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack in Littleton, Colo., was the seventh at schools  
around the country in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun-control legislation the president is requesting would focus  
on keeping guns out of the hands of juveniles and providing money 
to help schools hire counselors and mentors and buy metal 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government must take responsibility,'' Clinton said in the  
address. ``We must do more to prevent violence in our schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said his Safe Schools Bill would crack down on gun shows  
and illegal gun trafficking, prohibit ``violent juveniles'' from 
being able to buy guns and close ``the loophole that lets juveniles 
own assault rifles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must do more to keep guns out of the hands of violent  
juveniles,'' Clinton said. ``We must do more to prevent violence in 
our schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill provides money to school systems across the nation to  
help prevent repeats of last week's Littleton violence, in addition 
to the $12 million to finance emergency teams to help communities 
in similar crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who delivered the Republicans' weekly  
radio address, said the episode in a quiet Denver suburb warns of 
problems eating at the American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Events like this one warn us there is a virus loose within our  
culture,'' Owens said. ``Too may of our young people are 
susceptible to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens urged parents to play more active roles in their  
children's lives, particularly to pay more attention to what their 
children may be watching on television, what video games they play, 
what World Wide Web sites they log onto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know if your child has a home page?'' Owens asked. ``Do  
you know what is on your child's home page, or whom they talk with 
on the Internet? 
</P>
<P>
	``If not, please find out.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From NATO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the signing of a declaration reaffirming  
their 50-year alliance, President Clinton led NATO leaders as host, 
stepping to a red carpet lined by 20 stony-faced flag bearers. His 
own Cabinet, seated off to the side in an auditorium filled with 
foreign delegations, rose to applaud. 
</P>
<P>
	For the others, the standing part of the ovation only caught on  
in a slow trickle, as officials in front rows happened to glance 
over their shoulders to see the back rows on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's ceremony was translated on the spot into 10 languages --  
English, French, Czech, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, 
Spanish and Turkish. And even though most of the leaders spoke in 
English, organizers took no chances. 
</P>
<P>
	When an announcer instructed the leaders on stage -- 19 of the  
world's most powerful men -- to turn and face the flags, a stage 
director rushed to the foot of the podium and frantically twirled 
his fingers at them. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Too many late nights plotting the campaign against Yugoslavia?  
</P>
<P>
	Ninety minutes and 20 speeches seemed too much for the  
battle-fatigued Clinton. Right around speaker No. 7, Iceland's 
Prime Minister David Oddsson, the president betrayed the 
eyes-closing, head-flopping-forward symptoms of a man dozing off. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's most monumental struggle to stay alert came as Prime  
Minister Wim Kok of the Netherlands (No. 11) took the lectern. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton put his chin in his hand, crossed and uncrossed his  
legs, propped his elbows on his knees. But nothing, not even the 
click-clicking of photographers close by at stage left, could keep 
his eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's posture sprung ramrod straight and his face bore an  
envious smirk, when his friend, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, 
46, opened his remarks with the announcement: ``I am younger than 
NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highly competitive Clinton is 52.  
</P>
<P>
	But Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a newcomer to NATO,  
had everyone beat. He celebrated his 35th birthday just last week. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving his speech, the boyish Orban folded his notes into  
his pocket, turned to Blair, let out a deep breath and raised his 
eyebrows as if to say, ``Whew!'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the U.S. Senate. NATO may be the world's most exclusive  
men's club. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 100 U.S. and foreign officials seated according to rank  
in the Andrew Mellon Auditorium's front five rows, Albright was the 
only woman. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful world assembly turned some of Washington's own  
power brokers into starry-eyed tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., took a cheap, disposable camera to  
the front of the room and insistently gestured for the Czech 
foreign minister and a NATO undersecretary to get Albright to turn 
and face the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Could former Polish President Lech Walesa still be smarting from  
his 1995 defeat at the polls by Aleksander Kwasniewski? 
</P>
<P>
	When Kwasniewski, leader of another new NATO member, was  
introduced, Walesa, who was seated in the third row, did not clap. 
He faintly -- and belatedly -- tapped one hand against his 
translation handset. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The ornate Andrew Mellon Auditorium, with its grand columns  
lined by crushed oysters, is the same room where President Truman 
and his Western counterparts signed the 1949 treaty creating NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers had the leaders' gold chairs reupholstered for  
Friday's occasion, and the polished-cherry wood lectern and 
matching signing table were made new by Hargrove Inc. of Maryland -- 
``designed to fit in with the overall look and feel of the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That room, then called the Departmental Auditorium, is also  
where draft numbers were drawn for young American men during World 
War II.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah Ferguson has been named the spokeswoman  
for Wedgwood, the 240-year-old British maker of fine china. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duchess of York says she can now pay tribute to the same  
china she eats from each day at home in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``China doesn't have to be kept in the cupboard for rainy  
days,'' she said Friday. ``I'm a working mother with two kids, but 
I can fit china into my day.''

<P>
	Ferguson has written several books, including her bestseller,  
``Dieting with the Duchess.'' Since 1997, she has been the 
spokeswoman for Weight Watchers International. 
</P>
<P>
	No financial details of the two-year agreement were disclosed.

<HEADLINE> $200M Earmarked for Water Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Agriculture is promising  
more than $200 million for clean water improvements in rural 
communities in 44 states and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount is the largest single announcement for rural  
wastewater projects in USDA's history, Agriculture Secretary Dan 
Glickman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About $155 million of the money will come in the form of loans  
and grants from USDA. An additional $52.4 million will come from 
other public and private sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of us take the luxury of clean and safe drinking water  
and adequate waste disposal for granted,'' Glickman said. ``Even as 
we approach the year 2000, more than 2.3 million rural Americans 
live in homes without safe running water or no pipes running in it 
at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 4 million rural residents are connected to substandard  
sewage disposal systems that often pollute their drinking water, 
rivers and streams, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grants and loans will be used primarily to improve  
wastewater systems. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, McKee, Ky., will get about $1.4 million to improve  
its water system, Glickman said, noting that the infrastructure in 
that area has had virtually no upgrades. As a result, deteriorated 
and collapsed sewage lines cause problems for local residents, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to help the health situation in the area, prevent  
groundwater contamination and might encourage some economic 
development as well,'' Glickman said.

	Today is Sunday, April 25, the 115th day of 1999. There are 250  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On April 25, 1959, the St. Lawrence Seaway opened to shipping.  
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1792, highwayman Nicolas Jacques Pelletier became the first  
person under French law to be executed by the guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1859, ground was broken for the Suez Canal.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1898, the United States formally declared war on Spain.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1901, New York became the first state to require automobile  
license plates; the fee was $1. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, delegates from some 50 countries met in San Francisco  
to organize the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, during World War II, U.S. and Soviet forces linked up  
on the Elbe River, a meeting that dramatized the collapse of Nazi 
Germany's defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, Soviet leader Yuri V. Andropov invited Samantha Smith  
to visit his country after receiving a letter in which the American 
schoolgirl expressed fears about nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, the Pioneer 10 spacecraft crossed Pluto's orbit,  
speeding on its endless voyage through the Milky Way. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was inaugurated as  
president of Nicaragua, ending 11 years of leftist Sandinista rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita  
announced his resignation in order to take responsibility for his 
involvement in Japan's Recruit stock scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Terrorist bombers struck twice on the eve of  
South Africa's first all-race election, killing about a dozen 
people. Conservative Tsutomu Hata became prime minister of Japan, 
succeeding Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Whitewater prosecutors questioned first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton on videotape about her work as a private 
lawyer for the failed savings and loan at the center of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Birthdays: Country musician Vassar Clements is 71. Movie

</P>
<P>
	Thought for Today: ``I think that the glorious thing about the  
human race is that it does change the world -- constantly. The world 
or `life' may seem to more often overwhelm the human being, but it 
is the human being's capacity for struggling against being 
overwhelmed which is remarkable and exhilarating.''-- Lorraine 
Hansberry, American author-dramatist (1930-1965).

<HEADLINE> NBA Exec Runs Marathons for 'Fun' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Gingerbread Man ran his fourth Boston Marathon last Monday  
and, as usual, he did not win. That hardly mattered to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime NBA executive Pat Williams runs Boston and New York and  
other marathons just for fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first Boston Marathon was the 100th,'' he said. ``There  
were 40,000 runners, double the usual field. I ran it in five hours 
and it was an amazing experience, running through all the 
neighborhoods, running Heartbreak Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it is regular part of his regimen.  
</P>
<P>
	``By the time I get in,'' he said, ``the Kenyans have showered,  
eaten dinner and are on their way back home, but I've got three 
hours more of memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Memories are what Williams' latest book, ``Ahead of the Game,''  
is all about. In it, the senior executive vice president of the 
Orlando Magic, who won consecutive NBA lottery drafts and delivered 
Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway to the Magic, tells a very 
personal story of a life in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	A long time ago, when he was just getting started, Williams  
called himself the Gingerbread Man because he felt like the 
character in the children's story, spending his life on a 
treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Run, run, run  
</P>
<P>
	As fast as you can!  
</P>
<P>
	You can't catch me --  
</P>
<P>
	I'm the Gingerbread Man!''  
</P>
<P>
	That was Williams' style when he was general manager of the  
Spartanburg Phillies, a Class A farm club. He was 24, a long way 
from running NBA teams in Philadelphia, Chicago and Orlando, and 
helping the 76ers win the 1983 NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He was eager to succeed, determined to make his minor league  
team the hottest ticket in the state of South Carolina. He decided 
that he would offer fans more than baseball. He'd give the 
customers a show. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tradition of Bill Veeck, perhaps baseball's greatest  
showman, Williams planned all kinds of promotions, each designed to 
shake up Spartanburg and call attention to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams met Veeck through a mutual friend and the two hit it  
off immediately. This was the original baseball Barnum, the man who 
invented exploding scoreboards to celebrate home runs, and once 
sent a midget to bat for the St. Louis Browns, defying the Detroit 
Tigers to throw strikes to a guy who was 3-foot-7. They couldn't, 
of course. 
</P>
<P>
	Veeck would be Williams' guru.  
</P>
<P>
	``For 25 years, he was my mentor, my role model,'' Williams  
said. ``Every time a brainstorm hit me, I'd call Veeck in Easton, 
Maryland. Everything I did was Veeck-inspired and 
Veeck-consulted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would include bringing in Little Arlene, who ate 76 hot  
dogs and 21 medium pizzas and washed them down with 25 sodas in an 
eating contest, and Victor the Wrestling Bear, who pinned Williams 
one night. It was an unfair match. The bear, after all, weighed 700 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' favorite idea came early in his tenure at Spartanburg.  
He decided that on opening night, he would have a skydiver deliver 
the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1965, a skydiver at the ballpark was not commonplace,''  
Williams noted. ``I went over it with Veeck and we had it down to a 
T.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It sounded like a fine opening-night act to Veeck, who always  
cautioned Williams to add a gag, a little kicker for every idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The skydiver stunt worked because Dick Montgomery, a local  
citizen who jumped out of airplanes from time to time, was 
available on opening night. He wanted a clause in the deal, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not coming down with the lights on,'' he told Williams.  
``If I hit a wire, it could be all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was no problem for the innovative GM.  
</P>
<P>
	On schedule, the skydiver arrived over Duncan Park. Williams, a  
one-man operation, raced to turn off the lights. This was a 
surprise to the fans as well as the visiting Greenville Mets. 
Fireballing Dick Selma was warming up at the time and nearly killed 
the catcher with a pitch when the ballpark went dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Details, details. The big picture was what counted and here came  
Montgomery, floating down exactly as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just then, a wind kicked up,'' Williams said. ``The last time  
we saw him, he was drifting over the trees beyond the left field 
wall, still clutching the baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, Williams had his public address announcer deliver the  
Veeck-ordered gag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dick Montgomery,'' the PA man intoned. ``You can pick up your  
tickets at the will-call window.''

<HEADLINE> Spice Girls Sue for Shirt Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What do the Spice Girls really, really want?  
Profits from T-shirt sales would be nice. 
</P>
<P>
	Spice Girls Ltd., the licensing agent for the popular British  
music group, sued Polygram Merchandising Inc. and another 
distributor Friday, asking for at least $100,000 in compensation 
for shirts it says the companies sold without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, says Polygram  
Merchandising and the Troy, Mich.-based Trevco Sportswear made and 
sold T-shirts with the images of the four Spice Girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of authorized Spice Girls merchandise totaled $150 million  
over the past year, including $25 million from clothing, the 
licensing agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to Polygram Merchandising and Trevco on Friday  
were not returned.

<HEADLINE> No Sacred Cows for Groening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At first glance, he's living an unexceptional  
Chamber of Commerce existence: league bowling on the weekends, 
singing in a barbershop quartet and operating the best-known 
convenience store in metropolitan Springfield, USA. 
</P>
<P>
	But Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has a darker side: the chutney  
Squishees he once tried to force upon an unsuspecting populace. His 
role in the off-off-off-off-off-Broadway production of 
``Streetcar!'' (liberally adapted from Tennessee Williams). The 
flash-frozen senior citizen who once inhabited his dairy case. 
</P>
<P>
	You know Apu. He's a lot like you and me -- his successes pinned  
proudly to his polyester Kwik-E Mart frock, his failures stashed 
furtively under the counter behind the food-service cans of 
Reagan-era nacho cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Except Apu exists only in a cosmos of pen and ink, of bright  
yellows and popping eyes. He's a member of an unusual animated 
flock, sprung from the mind of an even more unusual genius: the man 
whose brain produced ``The Simpsons'' -- and the new sci-fi cartoon 
``Futurama''; the man whose pointed humor has, for more than a 
decade, made lots of people laugh and lots of people uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a particular ax to grind,'' he insists.  
</P>
<P>
	So instead, with smiles and jabs and idealism and sarcasm, Matt  
Groening grinds them all. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	Utterances by Homer Simpson, fatty foods aficionado, errant  
nuclear-plant employee and incompetent if loving father: 
</P>
<P>
	--''I used to rock and roll all night and party every day. Then  
it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a 
week in which to get funky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Maybe, for once, someone will call me `sir' without adding,  
`You're making a scene.''' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Ooh! Barbecue!''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One day, somewhere in the middle of the baby boom, a young boy  
in a sandbox looked around at his playmates. Suddenly, he saw their 
futures: lawyers, investment bankers, grown-ups in grown-up suits. 
And Matt Groening realized being a kid wasn't such a bad gig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that other kids were going to get serious and go on and  
be professionals,'' says Groening (rhymes with ``raining''). ``I 
never wanted to go to an office and carry a briefcase. I said, 
`That's no fun. I want to play. I want to make up stories.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Four decades later, at 45, he still does.  
</P>
<P>
	He made up ``Life in Hell,'' a weekly comic strip that  
chronicles the travails of a rabbit named Binky and a nihilistic 
gay couple in fez hats named Akbar and Jeff. He created ``The 
Simpsons,'' the delightfully astute late 20th-century family sitcom 
and a winner of 12 Emmys. Now he has hatched ``Futurama,'' an 
equally offbeat cartoon that blends ``The Simpsons'' with ``The 
Jetsons,'' ``The Three Stooges'' and a hodgepodge of sci-fi 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
	Groening's vision, rounded out by a team of animators and  
writers from across the political spectrum, evokes many 
descriptions: absurdist theater; crackling cultural commentary; a 
vast collage of American pop and high culture; the rapid-fire 
dialogue of Marx Brothers movies and the lunacy of Warner Bros. 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly Saturday-morning ``Josie &AMP; the Pussycats'' or ``Smurfs''  
fare. View an episode of ``The Simpsons'' and watch the background. 
Little treats abound -- rewards, Groening says, for paying 
attention. Hidden in plain view are indictments of consumerism, 
jabs at bureaucracy and pokes at pretension. It is, quite simply, 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider these recent nuggets: an art museum named ``Louvre --  
American Style'' (``No shirt, no shoes, no Chardonnay''); an 
unrepentantly carnivorous steakhouse with a slab of beef called 
``Sir Loinalot'' and a Heimlich machine in case of emergency; a 
sign that says, ``Welcome to Atlanta -- Home of Ted Turner's mood 
swings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Groening and his writers (his official title is executive  
producer, but he retains great creative control) push to the edge 
of hilarity but never complete implausibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of television shows ... don't deal with the things  
people are ashamed to admit. We can do that,'' says Dan 
Castellaneta, who voices Homer Simpson and an array of other 
characters, including belching barfly Barney Gumble and 
flame-bearded, Scottish-brogued Groundskeeper Willie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first television show that has an underground comic  
sensibility,'' Castellaneta says in a decidedly un-Homeric voice. 
``Very rarely do people talk about major corporations and companies 
taking away people's rights. In `The Simpsons,' it just sneaks in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the exclusionary in-jokes of ``Seinfeld,'' Groening's  
work is both accessible and deliciously obscure: Baby Maggie's 
attempt to break out of a day-care center would be hilarious even 
if it didn't feature the theme from ``The Great Escape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridiculing mass media is a ``Simpsons'' staple. Local TV news is  
skewered with glee, as are violent cartoons: ``The Itchy and 
Scratchy Show,'' a cat-and-mouse cartoon within a cartoon, features 
graphic dismemberment and titles like ``Scar Trek: The Next 
Laceration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Groening's own network isn't safe. One episode featured  
Homer and Bart watching ``Nonstop Fox,'' featuring ``When Buildings 
Collapse'' and ``World's Funniest Tornados.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we all share is laughing at the Elmer Fudds of  
the world -- authorities who don't like to be laughed at,'' Groening 
says of his writers. 
</P>
<P>
	This notion -- that no cow is sacred -- renders the Simpsons  
affectionately benign. Sure, Apu is a broad parody of an Indian 
convenience-store owner, but Homer is an equally broad parody of a 
second-rate suburban white American father. In the end, everybody's 
good, everybody's bad and everybody's a bit ridiculous -- sort of 
like real life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you reflect and say, `Yeah -- that's me too. I've been  
there,''' says Cherie Kerr, a founding member of the Groundlings, 
the West Coast comedy troupe that has produced such favorite 
``Simpsons'' guest voices as Jon Lovitz and the late Phil Hartman. 
``But it's in an animated form, and that makes it less 
in-your-face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such humor is bound to raise hackles, though, and producers of  
``The Simpsons'' have become accustomed to strong reactions; last 
month's episode of Simpsons-spun Bible stories elicited more. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Bart annoyed people most; schoolteachers said his  
``underachiever and proud of it'' attitude fostered mediocrity and 
rebelliousness. Now, Homer's bathetic travails dominate the show 
and he has become a target. U.S. Rep. Joseph Pitts, a conservative 
Pennsylvania Republican, recently blamed Homer and his ilk for 
contributing to the decline of fatherhood in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really missing the boat on this,'' says Robert  
Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular 
Television at Syracuse University. ``If I had a choice between an 
8-year-old watching a literate, artistic, densely packed comedy 
like the Simpsons or one of these supposedly friendly, 
family-oriented `TGIF' programs like `Full House,' tell me which is 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Simpsons could serve for a kid today what Mad magazine did  
for me,'' Thompson says. ``It awakened a political consciousness, 
made me realize I could read something and have an opinion about it 
-- all the useful intellectual tools you get from reading satire.'' 
</P>

<P>
	Lisa and Maggie are his sisters, Homer and Marge his parents. He  
favors sarcasm and cutting repartee, but his mischief is 
good-natured. He distrusts authority. He seems forever young. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Bart. Matt.  
</P>
<P>
	Groening, who names characters after relatives (``Life in Hell''  
also features his sons, Will and Abe, depicted as rabbits), says he 
aimed to create a universe where people screw up but must rely upon 
each other to survive, where ``you can have a great life if you're 
second best -- or in Homer's case, in last place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The characters in `The Simpsons' love their lives, and Homer  
loves his life more than anyone,'' Groening says on a recent day 
from the Los Angeles offices of ``Futurama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He follows his passions 100 percent. It gets him into a lot of  
trouble, but there's a part of us that wishes we had the guts to be 
like Homer and really savor that doughnut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savoring, whether doughnuts or life, is what Groening's work is  
about. He still can't believe he's making a living at an activity 
that people warned would be his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	During high school in the late 1960s and early '70s, the  
Portland, Ore., native watched as music and film and underground 
comics flourished. He absorbed popular culture like a sheet of 
Bounty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a perfect age to turn out the way I did,'' Groening says.  
</P>
<P>
	After college, he photocopied his own cartoon magazine, ``Life  
in Hell.'' It became his first success and today is syndicated 
nationally. He got his world view moving from job to job: 
record-store clerk, movie extra, chauffeur and dishwasher -- ``the 
standard stuff you do when you're trying to live by your wits and 
nobody's hiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Tracey Ullman enlisted Groening to do a few shorts  
about a dysfunctional family called the Simpsons for her variety 
show. Those first tries were rough, angular versions of the 
rounded-out family we know today. 
</P>
<P>
	The humor stuck, and the Simpsons' own show debuted in December  
1989 and became a regular series the following month. It succeeded 
in part because Groening, a media junkie, drew from myriad cultural 
sources -- high, middle and lowbrow -- for his humor. Everybody 
understood something. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything he likes, he's willing to twist into his version,''  
says longtime collaborator David X. Cohen, co-executive producer of 
``Futurama,'' which debuted last month with a similar sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama,'' as absurdist and caustic as ``The Simpsons,'' is  
more ambitious. Groening and Cohen wanted to create a distinctive 
future that could accommodate both comedy and science fiction. But 
how to design it? A happy, cornball Jetsons utopia or a dark, 
drippy, smelly ``Blade Runner'' landscape? 
</P>
<P>
	They compromised.  
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it should be a dark, drippy, cartoony, smelly  
Jetsons utopia,'' Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Like much sci-fi, ``Futurama'' deals with other times and  
places, making sensitive issues seem more oblique than in the 
Simpsons. As Katey Sagal puts it, ``there is no politically correct 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sagal (``Married ... With Children'') voices Leela, the  
tough-but-sexy alien ship captain in ``Futurama.'' Despite her 
large and only eye, Leela is a 31st-century woman balancing career 
and love. Fry (Billy West, who voiced both Ren and Stimpy) is a 
pizza delivery boy cryogenically frozen for a millennium, coping 
with a not-so-brave new world. Together with a cast of 
neo-Springfieldian oddballs, they face life. 
</P>
<P>
	Theirs is a cosmos ruled by DOOP (the Democratic Order of  
Planets), where a wisecracking alcoholic robot lives among humans, 
the moon is a theme park and New Yorkers commute in pneumatic 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' has its melancholy side, too: Fry walks through  
what was Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and sees the ancient ruins 
of his 20th-century world. His face falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just this human quality to everybody, this  
vulnerability,'' Sagal says. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the famous voices ``The Simpsons'' has featured, from  
Paul McCartney to Rod Steiger to Michelle Pfeiffer, Groening 
anticipates and welcomes celebrity appearances on ``Futurama.'' One 
catch: This is an era where famous people's brains are kept alive 
in a disembodied head museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ``Futurama'' premiere, Leonard Nimoy's voice speaks from  
his pickled head; he tells of living ``a life of quiet dignity,'' 
then sucks up some fish food dropped into his tank. The year 3000 
version of ``New Year's Rockin' Eve'' appears on TV -- with Dick 
Clark's head as host. 
</P>
<P>
	And a couple of craniums down from Richard Nixon's sits a jar  
containing the face of a bearded, bewildered-looking man. The jar's 
plaque, visible for only a micromoment, says ``Matt Groening'' -- 
another little reward for those paying attention. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Prime time today is stuffed with cartoons, from the mordant  
``Family Guy'' to the suburb-skewering ``King of the Hill'' to the 
cubicle-bound nerdfest ``Dilbert.'' And ``The Simpsons'' has helped 
pave the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Groening has managed to blend humor and substance into  
something rare -- a world full of flawed characters easy to care 
about, each with a specific personality, from Apu to Homer, from 
Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel to Uter the Germanic exchange student. 
Dysfunctional, yes, but a community nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're inviting yourself into someone's home when you do a TV  
show,'' Groening says. ``For all of 'The Simpsons' darker strains 
of satire, ultimately it's a celebration of America and the 
American family in its exuberance and absurdity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad gig for the kid who wanted to stay in the sandbox and  
make up stories. And now ``Futurama'': Groening's trip to tomorrow, 
pushing his mind toward fresh frontiers where the next-door 
neighbors may have two heads and six stomachs, but are just trying 
to put worms on the table and save enough to send the larvae off to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Matt Groening's world, where people reach for happiness  
but usually latch onto something a bit less, what more can anyone 
really ask?

<HEADLINE> Critics Worry Over Cable Colossus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Will Ma Bell become Ma Cable?  
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen years after the government broke up the telephone  
monopoly, critics worry that AT&AMP;T's $58 billion offer to buy 
MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest cable TV operator, could 
create a new colossus controlling cable rates, Internet access and 
phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T contends its proposal to buy Media One actually would spark  
competition, forming a powerful rival to the regional phone 
monopolies and driving local phone rates. AT&AMP;T plans to use cable 
systems to deliver local and long-distance phone service, 
high-speed Internet access and interactive entertainment to 
millions of U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T launched its bid Thursday to thwart an existing agreement  
by cable competitor Comcast to buy MediaOne. Comcast and MediaOne 
remained silent on the offer Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If AT&AMP;T succeeds in outbidding Comcast, regulators are sure to  
closely scrutinize the transaction more closely than AT&AMP;T's 
recently completed purchase of another giant cable company 
Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquiring both TCI and MediaOne would make AT&AMP;T -- already the  
nation's largest telecommunications company -- also its largest 
cable operator. It would have ownership stakes in cable systems 
that could be hooked up to nearly half the homes in the United 
States, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T obviously was sad to lose its telephone monopoly and is  
doing everything possible to rebuild it in the cable industry 
instead,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the deal would give AT&AMP;T disproportionate influence  
over cable TV rates and the type of entertainment, news and other 
programming seen by many cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is considering limiting  
the number of customers a single cable company can control 
nationwide and could issue a final decision this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, the FCC planned to forbid a single cable  
company from owning systems that cover more than 30 percent of all 
U.S. cable customers. The rule was never put into effect because of 
concern about its legality. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court in Washington is expected to consider  
the constitutionality of such a limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Several anti-trust experts said Friday they believed that  
federal regulators would permit an AT&AMP;T-MediaOne deal. They pointed 
to the approval of the AT&AMP;T-TCI merger last month and Bell 
Atlantic's acquisition last year of Nynex, a rival Baby Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, federal officials have favored deals that trigger new  
local phone competition. Three years after a telecommunications law 
took effect that was intended to generate consumer rivalry and 
drive down rates, local phone companies retain their monopolies and 
rates haven't dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a given on antitrust laws that competition must be  
protected. So long as there's adequate competition, larger size is 
not inherently bad,'' said Robert Burka, an antitrust attorney with 
the Washington law firm of Foley &AMP; Lardner. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a matter like this, the antitrust division of the Justice  
Department may view this transaction as potentially procompetitive 
in many respects,'' Burka said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the FCC did not return  
phone calls. Many government offices in Washington were closed 
Friday to make way for NATO's 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's bid drew a lukewarm response from key U.S. senators.  
</P>
<P>
	``This proposed purchase of MediaOne Group by AT&AMP;T is a big roll  
of the dice for consumers,'' said Republican Senator Mike DeWine, 
chairman of the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, business rights 
and competition, and Democratic senator Herb Kohl, D-Wi., ranking 
member of the subcommittee, in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	While the proposal could increase local telephone compeition, it  
also raises questions about whether AT&AMP;T would be too powerful, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the AT&AMP;T offer also emerged from U S West, a  
regional phone monopoly that would face new competition from AT&AMP;T. 
U S West protested AT&AMP;T's dominance of cable television lines. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the nation's largest provider of Internet  
access, is also likely to protest the deal. AOL and other Internet 
services have so far been unsuccessful in convincing the government 
to force AT&AMP;T to grant them broad access to its cable subscribers 
as potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	An AOL spokesman had no comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher  
Friday, boosted by another record rally overnight on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 257.37  
points, or 1.54 percent, to close at 16,923.25. On Thursday, the 
average gained 170.86 points, or 1.04 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors bought shares encouraged by overnight gains in New  
York stocks after a higher-than-expected profit report by computer 
giant International Business Machines. IBM said it had posted a 42 
percent gain in first-quarter profits and across-the-board growth 
in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed  
145.76 points, or 1.37 percent, closing at 10,727.18, a record 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the Japanese market were hopes for more  
government stimulus measures, sparked by a newspaper report that 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi would disclose a plan to put together a 
new package of economic measures in his meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton early in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.58 yen at late  
afternoon, down 0.38 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its 
late New York level of 119.55 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed slightly lower Friday after two  
straight days of sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, slipped 28.24 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 
12,905.30. On Thursday, the index had surged 389.78 points, or 3.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the index rose more than 400 points in early  
trading in reaction to record gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index reversed course in the afternoon as  
investors took profits. Despite Friday's decline, the index has 
gained 18 percent so far this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as investors renewed their

Weighted Stock Price Index rose 118.20 points or 1.6 percent to 
7,612.80. 
</P>

points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,384.47. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed at a record high, but

percent, to 3,121. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher, boosted by strong gains in  
overseas markets. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 10.59

<HEADLINE> Collins To Plead No Contest to DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Quarterback Kerry Collins, who is  
starting a new phase of his NFL career with the New York Giants, 
plans to plead no contest Monday to driving while impaired in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney George Laughrun said Collins doesn't want to fight the  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry said, `I made a mistake. I want to pay my price. And I  
don't want to be treated any different than anybody else. I want to 
get this behind me,''' Laughrun said. ``I wanted to try it. But 
that's his call -- not mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins will not be in court for the trial in Mecklenburg  
District Court. Laughrun will enter Collins' plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants pleading no contest don't admit guilt but also don't  
challenge the charges. They are sentenced as if they pleaded 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 26, likely faces a $100 fine, the maximum monetary  
penalty for a first DWI conviction. He was signed in February by 
the Giants to a four-year, $16.9 million free-agent contract after 
being cut by the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Collins said alcohol had played too much a part in his  
life, though he had not been diagnosed an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
	``My focus right now is to try and be the best quarterback I can  
be, and alcohol plays no part in that,'' Collins told reporters 
after signing with the Giants. ``It's not going to play any role in 
my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins has been working at the Giants mini-camp.  
</P>
<P>
	Collins was arrested about 1 a.m. Nov. 2, just hours after being  
taunted by Carolina Panthers fans. The Panthers' first-ever draft 
choice in 1995 had returned to Charlotte with his new team, the 
Saints. He had the team's permission to stay in the city after the 
Saints' 31-17 loss to the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	A state trooper reported that Collins' car had weaved and  
crossed the center line. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins refused to take a breath test at the Mecklenburg County  
Jail. He acknowledged his guilt later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I broke the law. It's a matter of taking what's coming to  
me,'' he told the Charlotte Observer.

<HEADLINE> Tatis Sets Grand Slam Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mark McGwire never did it. Neither did Babe  
Ruth nor Hank Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody in baseball history had ever hit two grand slams in one  
inning. Until Fernando Tatis came along. 
</P>
<P>
	With home run king McGwire playing setup man, Tatis hit a pair  
of bases-loaded homers in the same inning Friday night. Both were 
off Chan Ho Park in the third inning of the St. Louis Cardinals' 
12-5 win over Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an accomplishment; I get goose pimples just thinking  
about it,'' said St. Louis manager Tony La Russa, who also had a 
great seat last year during McGwire's 70-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
	``What have they got, 100 years of baseball, and this is the  
first time it's ever been done? Wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, who had never hit a grand slam and totaled just 24 homers  
in his previous 225 major league games, also set a record with 
eight RBIs in one inning. 
</P>
<P>
	He was stunned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it happened. I did not expect to hit another  
one. I've never been a home run hitter. I just try to meet the 
ball. I'm not like Mark McGwire,'' said Tatis, who at 5-foot-10 and 
170 pounds is 7 inches shorter and 80 pounds lighter than the St. 
Louis first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything fell into place for Tatis to make baseball history.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Davis was out with an injury, so Tatis moved up a spot to  
bat cleanup. McGwire singled to load the bases once, then flied out 
to leave them loaded the next time. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis missed his second full game with an injured left hand,  
hurt when he was hit by a pitch in the seventh inning of Tuesday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about his contribution -- being out of the lineup -- Davis  
shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had nothing to do with it, man,'' he said. ``You trying to  
say that would have been me? I might be walked and he might have 
still been up with the bases loaded. Who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only nine other players in major league history have hit two  
grand slams in an entire game. Tony Cloninger, a former Atlanta 
pitcher, was the only NL player to do it, with a pair in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, whose homers were his only hits in five at-bats, sent a  
2-0 fastball from Park 450-plus feet into the left-field bullpen 
with no out in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after McGwire flied out to shallow right to leave the  
bases loaded with two out, Tatis lined Park's 3-2 slider into the 
lower seats in the left-field pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was going out. I just kept on running, then  
I thought, `Oh, wow!,''' said Tatis, who didn't know he had set a 
record until he got back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the first, with a 2-0 count, I was looking for my pitch, a  
fastball inside. He threw it and I hit it. The second time, he 
threw a slider in and I was not expecting it and I tried to just 
line it''. 
</P>
<P>
	His second homer wasn't nearly as imposing, but it did clear the  
375-foot sign in left field with room to spare during the 11-run 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good month for most guys,'' said teammate Darren  
Bragg, who was on base for both homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Park made history, too, although he has to share the dubious  
distinction of giving up two grand slams in one inning with a 
pitcher from more than 100 a years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a terrible day,'' said Park, who gave up 11 runs,  
six earned, in the disastrous inning. ``I did a lot of studying on 
McGwire before the game, but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other pitcher who gave up two grand slams in an inning was  
Bill Phillips of the Pittsburgh Pirates, tagged for bases-loaded 
homers by Tommy Burns and Malachi Kittredge in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
	Park (1-2) faced 13 batters in the inning, three batters after  
manager Davey Johnson was thrown out of the game for protesting a 
call at home plate. Park finally got the hook after Tatis' second 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatis, a Dominican who came to the Cardinals in a trade with  
Texas last July, has a .270 career average after slightly more than 
1 1/2 years in the majors. He's hitting .264 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, Tatis homered leading off the seventh inning,  
his seventh of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record for RBIs in one inning was six, shared by a  
long list of players. Matt Williams did it most recently, on Aug. 
27, 1997, for Cleveland. The last NL player to match the record was 
Atlanta's Dale Murphy on July 27, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, out 1 1/2 games with a tight left hamstring, was 1-for-5  
as he became a footnote to another bit of homer history in his 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire waved reporters away after the game, saying they should  
go talk to the guy with all the RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The seats in the outfield pavilion were jammed for the game,  
with young and old wearing baseball gloves, most in hopes of 
catching a ball hit by McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lerner, who attended the game with his two sons, wound  
up with Tatis' second homer ball after paying $80 to the young fan 
who caught it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ball belongs in the Hall of Fame. That's what's  
important,'' Lerner said in a hallway leading to the Cardinals' 
clubhouse. ``This was history. It was bedlam there. Everybody knew 
what was going on. I got a few bruises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa had plans for the historic lineup card.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have the players autograph it, then we'll auction it  
off. So somebody will have to reach into their pocket to get it,'' 
he said. ``We'll give the money to charity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A car bomb exploded in a busy street Saturday in  
east London, injuring seven people. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb exploded in late afternoon in Brick Lane, the center of  
one of the city's biggest Bangladeshi communities and the site of a 
popular Saturday market. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the blast was caused by a bomb in a car that had  
been parked in the street shortly before the explosion. It was 
unclear if the person driving the car was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal London Hospital in nearby Whitechapel treated two  
women and three men for minor injuries, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. Police said a total of seven people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	They ruled out any connection with terrorism from groups in  
Northern Ireland and said the explosive device was similar to a 
nail bomb that injured 39 people April 17 in Brixton, a racially 
mixed south London neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	A neo-Nazi group later claimed responsibility for the Brixton  
blast. 
</P>
<P>
	The area surrounding Brick Lane was sealed off, and a Scotland  
Yard anti-terrorist squad began an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking from the NATO summit in  
Washington, said of the blast: ``These things are outrageous and we 
will not tolerate them, and we will make every effort to find out 
those responsible and bring them to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Allan, 29, from New Zealand, said she was 60 feet away  
from the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard a hollow sound and I said to my friend that it sounded  
like a bomb,'' she said. ``We went down the road and saw smoke. The 
whole of the road was filled with thick black smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said they saw a man run toward a car in the street and  
place a bag in the truck moments before the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a car ablaze with pieces of shrapnel and debris all over  
the place. I saw several people with blood from glass injuries on 
their face,'' said Raja Miah, a local politician. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press photographer who lives near Brick Lane said  
the explosion blew the roof and windows off the car.

<HEADLINE> Snow Leopard To Have Hip Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- On their native ground in the Russian  
steppes, snow leopards are known to leap distances up to 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so with Pasha, a Kansas City Zoo denizen with hip troubles.  
</P>
<P>
	Both of the 8-year-old cat's hips are degenerating. It's a  
common and easily corrected condition among dogs and humans, but 
rare among cats. Hip replacement surgery has been performed on a 
snow leopard just once. 
</P>
<P>
	In the coming months, Pasha will become the second.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting, especially because this is only the second  
one, said Wm. Kirk Suedmeyer, senior staff veterinarian at the 
Kansas City Zoo. ``To return him to normal, this is his best 
alternative. But it's not a routine type of surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pasha is one of 250 snow leopards in captivity in the United  
States. The spotted, muscular cats range in the upper mountains of 
Russia and Asia and have seen their numbers dwindle to about 7,000 
worldwide, placing them on the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
	Janis Joslin, veterinary adviser for the snow leopard Species  
Survival Plan, said the only other such leopard to have a hip 
replaced was at a zoo in Calgary, Alberta, in the mid-1980s. Joslin 
also is the chief veterinarian at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``His line is too valuable to the population,'' Joslin said.  
``If the arthritis gets too bad, we would have to euthanize him. 
This procedure can extend his life and I applaud them for doing it. 
I think it's something we have an obligation to do.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Puts Strawberry on `Leave' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry was suspended indefinitely  
Saturday while baseball investigates his arrest this month on 
charges of cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig put the 37-year-old outfielder on  
``administrative leave,'' which isn't defined by baseball's rules 
but carries the same penalties as a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry can't participate in workouts or games with the New  
York Yankees or their farm teams until the inquiry is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the hands of the legal system in Florida and it will  
depend on what happens there,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-ranking baseball official familiar with the situation,  
speaking on the condition he not be identified, said, ``This is a 
suspension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how to respond to this,'' said Yankees pitcher  
David Cone, who played with Strawberry on the Mets and is one of 
his closest friends on the Yankees. ``It's pretty vague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's security department is investigating the  
circumstances surrounding Strawberry's April 14 arrest and is 
talking with Tampa prosecutors, the two baseball officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry is tested regularly for drug use as part of the  
aftercare program stemming from his previous drug problems. He was 
suspended for 60 days in 1995 after testing positive for cocaine 
and another positive test would be cause for another suspension, 
several baseball officials have said since the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The two baseball officials said there was no conclusive  
agreement between owners and the players' association on the 
results of his most recent tests. Part of the problem, one official 
said, may have been the timing of the test following his arrest -- 
the test may have occurred too late to detect any cocaine is his 
urine. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has a home in Tampa, Fla., where the arrest occurred.  
The 37-year-old outfielder, getting back into playing shape 
following colon cancer surgery last October, had wanted to resume 
workouts at the Yankees' minor league complex there. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees general manager Brian Cashman declined comment before  
Saturday's game against Toronto. After the game, the Yankees 
players and coaches had little to add. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't no lawyer, I don't know anything about it,'' interim  
manager Don Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual arrangement designed to avoid baseball's luxury  
tax, the team signed him to a minor league contract and a 
consulting deal during the offseason, a package worth $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	New York advanced Strawberry money due him under the consulting  
deal but stopped the advances after his arrest, several sources 
familiar with the arrangement have said on the condition they not 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's lawyer, Joseph Ficarrotta, said his client intends  
to plead innocent to the charges of cocaine possession and 
solicitation of a prostitute. A hearing date has not been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was arrested a few miles from the Yankees' extended  
spring training camp. The eight-time All-Star was charged with 
possession of 0.3 grams of cocaine and offering an undercover 
female officer $50 for sex. He was released on a $6,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the cocaine found wrapped in a $20 bill inside  
his wallet did not belong to him. And while he acknowledged 
discussing sex with the undercover officer, he insisted he was 
joking and did not intend to meet her at a motel. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has a long history of drug and alcohol problems and  
run-ins with the law, including a conviction on federal tax 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .257 with 24 homers in 101 games for the Yankees last  
season. Strawberry is not on the 40-man roster and has not traveled 
with the team this season, except in spring training.

<HEADLINE> Limits on Y2K Lawsuits Spark Feuds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A giant, buzzing insect menaces San Francisco  
and New York City in a televised warning to Congress to pass 
legislation restricting lawsuits over the Year 2000 computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500,000 ad campaign debuting Sunday is the latest push to  
limit businesses' liability for fallout from Y2K computer glitches. 
Business leaders sought out likely sponsors, helped draft the bills 
and have made them a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The millennium issue is the latest twist in a long-standing feud  
between business leaders and trial lawyers, another powerful 
lobbying group, over proposed limits on lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the looming deadline may give the issue more urgency  
and force a decision that would frame future debates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to make Y2K the poster child for liability  
reform for 1999,'' said Joan Mulhern, legislative counsel for 
Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group affiliated with Ralph 
Nader. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the legislation say that without limits, lawsuits  
related to computer glitches could cost all sorts of businesses $1 
trillion and swamp the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 businesses that formed a coalition to push the bill  
meet weekly. The National Association of Manufacturers has told 
lawmakers that this vote would help determine their rankings on the 
group's annual legislative scorecard. Seventy-eight executives 
signed a letter urging the Senate to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, part of the business coalition, is  
spending $500,000 for the TV ad campaign. Viewers are urged to 
support ``a bill that will protect consumers with legitimate 
problems, while preventing a swarm of frivolous lawsuits over minor 
glitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials were scheduled to debut in Washington on the  
Sunday talk shows, then air nationally on the cable news networks 
CNN, MSNBC and CNBC, chamber officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K glitch could occur when computers that use only two  
digits to read dates mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900. 
That could result in computer errors or shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, sponsored by John McCain, R-Ariz., and Ron  
Wyden, D-Ore., would require a 90-day waiting period in which 
companies could try to resolve complaints before a Y2K lawsuit is 
filed against them. The legislation also would limit class action 
lawsuits and cap punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses would be liable for only $250,000 or three times the  
amount of compensatory damages awarded, whichever is greater. Small 
companies with fewer than 25 workers would not have to pay more 
than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys' fees would be capped at $1,000 an hour in similar  
legislation introduced in the House, sponsored by Reps. Tom Davis, 
R-Va., and Jim Moran, D-Va. Both represent districts in Northern 
Virginia, home to a booming high-tech industry. Davis is a former 
vice president and general of a high-tech company. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups seeking Y2K legislation started the process by  
targeting Davis, Moran and California lawmakers who represent 
high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached out to many Democrats who traditionally side with  
trial lawyers. In the Senate, they won the support of Republican 
McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has 
jurisdiction over the issue, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	They gave the lawmakers a list of what they wanted in the  
legislation and were delighted when most of their requests were 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' spokesman, Trey Hardin, said the business groups made a  
compelling case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They represent the people on the front lines of the business  
community,'' Hardin said. ``They have the real-life examples so 
they can provide the real-life input.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and many Democrats oppose the bills,  
which they contend would strip consumers of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers, meanwhile, are fighting back with horror stories of  
computer companies refusing to take responsibility for selling 
equipment that is not Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	They told lawmakers about grocers whose cash registers would not  
accept credit cards having ``00'' as an expiration date, and a 
doctor who was not told his new software would have problems until 
the company offered to fix it for $2,410. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills would reward ``irresponsible corporate executives who  
ignored the millennium bug for years and now are demanding special 
immunity protection,'' said Mark Mandell, president of the 
Association of Trial Lawyers of America.

<HEADLINE> Black Workers Nix $15M Boeing Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A proposed $15 million settlement in a racial  
discrimination lawsuit against The Boeing Co. is insufficient and 
won't improve race relations at the nation's largest aerospace 
company, a lawyer for black workers told a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memorandum filed Friday in U.S. District Court, Alan B.  
Epstein of Philadelphia, a lawyer for more than 2,000 black Boeing 
workers, told Judge John C. Coughenour that lawyers who represented 
his clients could have won far better terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar Desper III and Bruce Harrell, who represented the black  
workers in the original class-action, said Epstein's objections 
were ``baseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All (Epstein) did was tap into people who never came forward  
in the first place, unhappy people who never had anything to do 
with this case in the first place, and they've given him false 
information,'' Desper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was the deadline for those covered by the proposed  
settlement, blacks who worked for Boeing during the past two to 
four years, to file objections or opt out of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Those filing objections retain their shares in any eventual  
payout. Those who opt out would get nothing but may file separate 
claims on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12,000 Boeing workers and about 8,000 retirees and former  
employees are potential class members. The largest payments would 
go to about 237 individuals who would get $5,500 to $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, those covered by the decree would  
share $7.3 million after legal fees and the cost of Boeing 
affirmative action programs are subtracted from the total. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughenour scheduled a fairness hearing May 26 to consider  
objections to the consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 237 individuals named in the original suit, Epstein said  
72 have asked his law firm to present their objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Desper said ``the vast majority'' of class members support the  
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Cavs' Knight Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers playoff hopes took a  
blow Saturday when the team announced guard Brevin Knight will miss 
the rest of the season because of a fractured left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight had surgery Saturday in which doctors inserted two screws  
into the hand, which will be kept in a splint. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, who averaged 9.6 points and 7.7 assists per game in 39  
games this season, suffered the injury in the third quarter of 
Friday night's 79-75 loss at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavaliers were just one game behind New York and Toronto for  
the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference after 
Friday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's injuries are mounting. The Cavs lost center Zydrunas  
Ilgauskas early in the season to a broken foot and leading scorer 
Shawn Kemp missed Friday's game and is doubtful for Monday's game 
against Miami with a sprained left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Derek Anderson, who has a bruised right knee, and forward  
Corie Blount, who has tendinitis in his left knee, are expected to 
practice on Sunday.

<HEADLINE>  Even First Kentucky Derby Was Smash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The famed Twin Spires had yet to be  
built, and it wasn't even the first Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
	But even without Churchill Downs' most famous landmark or the  
mystique of the most famous date in horse racing, the first 
Kentucky Derby still was historic. 
</P>
<P>
	On a bright and sunny Monday -- May 17, 1875 -- an estimated  
10,000 people gathered at the Louisville Jockey Club, three miles 
from downtown, to watch Aristides' shocking upset over stablemate 
Chesapeake. 
</P>
<P>
	This May 1, more than 140,000 fans will show up at the same  
place -- the track became Churchill Downs in 1883 -- for the 125th 
running of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Many things have changed since that Monday: General admission  
prices have risen from 50 cents in 1875 to $35, the race has been 
shortened from 1 1/2 miles to 1 1/4 miles and the purse has increased 
from $3,100 to more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of the first Derby were focused as much on the lively  
and colorful crowd as on the somewhat bizarre way the race 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	William T. Porter of the Louisville Courier-Journal seemed to  
have more of an eye for the women than the horses. His report on 
the Derby began: ``It was made up of every element; but place aux 
dames et demoiselles before the pen shall treat of another feature 
...
</P>
<P>
	``Blondes and brunes there were, stately beauties and petite  
matrons and maids, in such bewildering number as to daze the eye, 
except that the cumulative effect was striking and even glorious to 
such a degree as may not be seen twice in a lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Live Stock Record's opening words were: ``Today  
will ever be historic in the turf annals of Kentucky, as the first 
`Derby Day' of what I hope to see a long series of turf 
festivities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ulysses S. Grant was president and the United States was  
beginning its recovery from the `great financial panic' of 1873. 
Just a few years earlier, talk of reviving racing in Louisville had 
really heated up. 
</P>
<P>
	Horse breeders looked for help from Meriwether Lewis Clark, a  
young Louisville businessman and grandson of William Clark of Lewis 
and Clark expedition fame. With no racing background, Clark decided 
a trip to Europe would give him a quick education in the sport of 
kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, in 1874, Clark returned with a plan: Pattern a  
set of races after England's tradition-rich stakes, including the 
Epsom Derby, the Epsom Oaks, the St. Leger Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He formed the Louisville Jockey Club and Driving Park  
Association, raised $32,000 and leased land own by his two uncles, 
John and Henry Churchill. With borrowed money, a small wooden 
grandstand was built, but it took until Derby Day morning for the 
final nails to be hammered into place. The Twin Spires came later, 
in 1895, when a new grandstand was built. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing fans from all over flocked to the track, riding in  
mule-drawn street cars, fringed-topped buggies, elegant carriages, 
milk wagons and ice wagons, many of which convened in the infield. 
Others arrived by railroad or by foot in what turned into 
Louisville's largest traffic jam in its 95-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, who were encouraged to attend and even had their own  
section in the grandstand, were dressed in their Sunday finest -- 
flowing gowns, expensive bonnets and carrying large parasols. 
Betting was unthinkable for women, but some made wagers anyway, 
sending their husbands down to place bets on their favorite horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of four races went off at 2:30 p.m. Then came the  
Derby, which for weeks had been greatly anticipated. A field of 15 
3-year-olds lined up for the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Chesapeake, coming off a big win just three days earlier in the  
2-mile Citizens' Stakes in Lexington, was considered the favorite. 
Ten Broeck was last in the Citizens' Stakes, and that took some 
luster off his victory in the Phoenix Hotel Stakes in Lexington a 
week before the Derby. Aristides was last in the Phoenix Hotel 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Parimutuel wagering was just being introduced, and the most  
popular method of wagering was auction pools. Two-dollar bettors 
didn't have much chance in these pools, with low bids in the $20 
range. One pool, it was said, had a $260 bid for the 
Chesapeake-Aristides entry, owned by H. Price McGrath, one of 
Kentucky's most colorful horsemen. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath had a familiar racing strategy: Aristides, ridden by  
Oliver Lewis, who like most of the top jockeys of the time was 
black, would be the rabbit. The little chestnut colt would start 
out quickly, tire out the leaders and set up Chesapeake for a 
come-from-behind victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan didn't work out but there still was a happy ending for  
McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby began on the backstretch at the half-mile pole. The  
starter made sure the horses were in line (he actually drew a line 
through the dirt), then banged a drum to signal the start. At the 
same time, a red flag was lowered to alert timekeepers to start 
their watches. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered and the start was clean as Volcano and  
McCreery dueled for the early lead. Aristides was just off the pace 
and Chesapeake was back in the pack. Around the clubhouse turn they 
went, and Aristides took the lead from a tiring McCreery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis pushed Aristides down the backstretch to keep the pace  
fast, and approaching the far turn the jockey eased up on his 
horse. It was time for Chesapeake to move into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	As the field came out of the turn, though, McGrath was  
surprised. Standing near the head of the stretch, he saw no sign of 
Chesapeake among the leaders but Aristides was still in the lead. 
Lewis, not knowing what to do, looked over at McGrath for advice. 
``Go on!'' McGrath shouted, and Lewis did, easing Aristides' reins 
and going on for a two-length victory over Volcano. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 13 colts and two fillies in the first Derby. And the  
winning time of 2:37 3-4 for the 1 1/2 miles was a record for 
3-year-olds. Aristides would go on to win three other stakes on his 
way to recognition as the finest 3-year-old in the land. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, though, what counted was that he had won the Derby,  
the very first one.

<HEADLINE> Elway Leaning Toward Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway is ready to join Michael Jordan and  
Wayne Gretzky in retirement -- the third transcendent athlete to 
leave his game in the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
	The peerless Denver Broncos quarterback, the architect of a  
record 47 game-saving drives, told friends he has had enough after 
16 seasons of pro football, sources close to Elway told The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, playing in a golf tournament at Pebble Beach, Calif.,  
wouldn't talk about a retirement announcement when contacted at the 
resort by an Associated Press reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know everybody wants to know, but I'm not going to talk  
about it right now,'' Elway said Saturday night on his way to 
appear at a private dinner. ``There'll be an announcement next 
week. That's all I have to say about it for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway all but announced his retirement during an interview  
earlier Saturday with Denver TV station KCNC. 
</P>
<P>
	``For so many years everything in my family has revolved around  
me. It's time for that to change,'' Elway said in the interview. 
``I really accomplished everything I wanted to. There's no real 
upside to coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His announcement could come as early as Monday, but KCNC said it  
could be delayed to Wednesday so as to let more time pass since the 
school shootings at a suburban Littleton high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway reportedly considered announcing his decision last week  
but delayed it, first because Broncos owner Pat Bowlen was out of 
town and then because of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to him and he told me what he's going to do,''  
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said Saturday. ``But I'm not going to 
comment. I'm going to let John make his announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen did not return a phone call.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, the winningest and perhaps most durable quarterback  
in NFL history, won his second straight Super Bowl title and the 
MVP award in his final game on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	So, he is leaving on top, just like Jordan, who hit the  
championship-winning shot for the Chicago Bulls against the Utah 
Jazz last June. Jordan announced his retirement in January and 
Gretzky played his final NHL game last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see him retire as a champion,'' Miami Dolphins  
quarterback Dan Marino said Saturday. ``I'm sure it was a tough 
decision, knowing how much John enjoys competing on the football 
field, but I know he did what was best for him and his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the NFL draft last weekend, Shanahan said he expected  
Elway to announce his decision before minicamp, which opens Friday. 
It wasn't the one Shanahan wanted to hear, but he was bracing for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach has said that if his Hall of Fame-bound quarterback  
retired, he would be confident turning to veteran Bubby Brister as 
his new starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister insists Elway has not confided in him about his plans.  
In fact, of a dozen or so Broncos players interviewed during 
informal workouts the past two weeks, none said he knew Elway's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is true, then it's the opportunity of a lifetime, that's  
for sure,'' Brister told The Denver Post. ``I'm going to miss John 
being around just like everybody else because we have such a great 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``By no means am I John Elway. I just think if I can fill my own  
shoes that will be good enough to get us where we want to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where they want to go is back to the Super Bowl for a try at an  
unprecedented third straight crown. 
</P>
<P>
	That possibility was alluring to Elway. After winning his first  
Super Bowl title in 1998 -- after three losses in the championship 
game -- Elway spent four months pondering his future, finally 
deciding to come back for what he said would be his final season. 
</P>
<P>
	After the second title last January, he admitted the chance to  
three-peat had thrown a ``kink'' into his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the kink wasn't enough to sway him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you lose a player of that magnitude, we all suffer,''  
Jacksonville Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several teammates, marveling at Elway's ability to absorb  
punishment and keep bouncing back, said in recent weeks they 
expected him to retire because he had nothing left to prove, having 
capped his career with the only achievements that had eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Elway's trademark game-saving drives, perhaps the best was  
the 98-yard march in the final five minutes to tie Cleveland in the 
1986 AFC championship game. The Broncos won in overtime, sending 
Elway to his first of five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	He guided his team to more victories (148) than any other  
quarterback, and he threw for 51,475 yards and accounted for 54,882 
total yards -- second only to Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only player to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for 200  
yards in seven straight seasons (1985-91). 
</P>
<P>
	He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and honored as the NFL's MVP  
in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season and postseason 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	In beating Atlanta 34-19 in Miami on Jan. 31, he became the  
first quarterback to start in five Super Bowls. The Broncos' 23-10 
win over the New York Jets in the AFC championship game two weeks 
earlier gave him a 5-1 record in conference championship games -- 
the best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino may have better numbers, and others such as Joe Montana  
and Terry Bradshaw more titles, but Elway leaves with another 
legacy all his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to be the most durable quarterback ever,'' former  
Broncos coach Wade Phillips said. ``He's the Lou Gehrig of that 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was hit more than any quarterback in NFL history,  
absorbing 559 sacks in 256 games, but he missed only 15 starts 
because of illness or injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The pounding finally caught up with him. He needed long massages  
every day just to get through the week. 
</P>
<P>
	And through it all -- every season since 1983 -- he has been  
synonymous with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Elway is the Denver Broncos,'' former NFL quarterback Joe  
Theismann once said. ``When you turn on the TV and the Denver 
Broncos are playing, you expect to see John Elway playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore.

<HEADLINE> Limits on Y2K Lawsuits Spark Feuds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A giant, buzzing insect menaces San Francisco  
and New York City in a televised warning to Congress to pass 
legislation restricting lawsuits over the Year 2000 computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500,000 ad campaign debuting Sunday is the latest push to  
limit businesses' liability for fallout from Y2K computer glitches. 
Business leaders sought out likely sponsors, helped draft the bills 
and have made them a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The millennium issue is the latest twist in a long-standing feud  
between business leaders and trial lawyers, another powerful 
lobbying group, over proposed limits on lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the looming deadline may give the issue more urgency  
and force a decision that would frame future debates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to make Y2K the poster child for liability  
reform for 1999,'' said Joan Mulhern, legislative counsel for 
Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group affiliated with Ralph 
Nader. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the legislation say that without limits, lawsuits  
related to computer glitches could cost all sorts of businesses $1 
trillion and swamp the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 businesses that formed a coalition to push the bill  
meet weekly. The National Association of Manufacturers has told 
lawmakers that this vote would help determine their rankings on the 
group's annual legislative scorecard. Seventy-eight executives 
signed a letter urging the Senate to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, part of the business coalition, is  
spending $500,000 for the TV ad campaign. Viewers are urged to 
support ``a bill that will protect consumers with legitimate 
problems, while preventing a swarm of frivolous lawsuits over minor 
glitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commercials were scheduled to debut in Washington on the  
Sunday talk shows, then air nationally on the cable news networks 
CNN, MSNBC and CNBC, chamber officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K glitch could occur when computers that use only two  
digits to read dates mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900. 
That could result in computer errors or shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, sponsored by John McCain, R-Ariz., and Ron  
Wyden, D-Ore., would require a 90-day waiting period in which 
companies could try to resolve complaints before a Y2K lawsuit is 
filed against them. The legislation also would limit class action 
lawsuits and cap punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses would be liable for only $250,000 or three times the  
amount of compensatory damages awarded, whichever is greater. Small 
companies with fewer than 25 workers would not have to pay more 
than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys' fees would be capped at $1,000 an hour in similar  
legislation introduced in the House, sponsored by Reps. Tom Davis, 
R-Va., and Jim Moran, D-Va. Both represent districts in Northern 
Virginia, home to a booming high-tech industry. Davis is a former 
vice president and general of a high-tech company. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups seeking Y2K legislation started the process by  
targeting Davis, Moran and California lawmakers who represent 
high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached out to many Democrats who traditionally side with  
trial lawyers. In the Senate, they won the support of Republican 
McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has 
jurisdiction over the issue, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	They gave the lawmakers a list of what they wanted in the  
legislation and were delighted when most of their requests were 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' spokesman, Trey Hardin, said the business groups made a  
compelling case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They represent the people on the front lines of the business  
community,'' Hardin said. ``They have the real-life examples so 
they can provide the real-life input.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and many Democrats oppose the bills,  
which they contend would strip consumers of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers, meanwhile, are fighting back with horror stories of  
computer companies refusing to take responsibility for selling 
equipment that is not Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	They told lawmakers about grocers whose cash registers would not  
accept credit cards having ``00'' as an expiration date, and a 
doctor who was not told his new software would have problems until 
the company offered to fix it for $2,410. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills would reward ``irresponsible corporate executives who  
ignored the millennium bug for years and now are demanding special 
immunity protection,'' said Mark Mandell, president of the 
Association of Trial Lawyers of America.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Commissioner Bud Selig ordered baseball owners  
to give him their list of candidates for future job openings in 
five positions, including general manager and manager, in an effort 
to increase minority hiring, The New York Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig sent a letter to owners after being pushed by National  
League president Leonard Coleman and Hall of Famer Frank Robinson 
to take steps to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics hired 
for major jobs, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a club has an opening in any of these positions, the club  
owner must notify me personally,'' Selig said in the letter 
obtained by the paper. ``In addition, your list of candidates must 
be provided to me. I expect the list to include minority candidates 
whom you and your staff have identified. I will provide assistance 
to you if you cannot identify candidates on your own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig added that he would discipline clubs that did not  
``aggressively pursue equal opportunities and initiatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig acknowledged writing the letter to owners but declined to  
comment further to the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The positions he listed in his letter were manager, general  
manager, assistant general manager and directors of player 
development and scouting. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently no minority general managers, and only one  
of the last 36 manager openings have been filled by a minority, 
Jerry Manuel of the Chicago White Sox. He is one of three minority 
managers.

<HEADLINE> Brown's Meeting with Chinese Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- FBI agents investigating Democratic Party  
fund-raiser Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie sought evidence that Commerce 
Secretary Ronald Brown met with a Chinese arms dealer the same day 
that the dealer attended a White House coffee with President 
Clinton, according to court documents unsealed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie faces federal charges in the campaign fund-raising probe.  
Agents searched his Little Rock home in October 1997 after 
obtaining a search warrant that alluded to a Feb. 6, 1996, meeting 
attended by Brown and Wang Jun just weeks before Brown's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, a central figure in the controversy over foreign-linked  
campaign donations to Democrats, arranged for Wang to attend a 
White House coffee with President Clinton the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang's company, Poly Technologies, has been implicated in  
smuggling of arms into the United States. He is identified as an 
adviser to the Chinese government in the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee's report on its investigation into illegal 
campaign fund raising in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang's visit to the White House was previously reported and  
Clinton has said it was inappropriate. Previous reports, however, 
did not mention a meeting the same day between Brown and Wang. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was a major player in Democratic politics. He was killed  
in April 1996 when the military transport he was aboard crashed 
into a mountainside in Croatia. Thirty-four others aboard the plane 
as part of a government trade mission also died. 
</P>
<P>
	The reference to a meeting between Brown and Wang adds a new  
twist to the investigation into fund-raising irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie, a longtime friend of Clinton and a former Little Rock  
restaurateur, is scheduled to go on trial May 17 on charges he made 
and arranged illegal contributions to the Democratic National 
Committee to buy access to Clinton and other top officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also claims Trie obstructed justice by ordering  
an employee to destroy documents subpoenaed in 1997 by a federal 
grand jury and by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie asked a judge to unseal the court file Thursday, claiming  
that an FBI agent mislead the court in an affidavit that prompted a 
judge to issue a warrant for a search of Trie's local residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie's lawyers said he had learned in late March or early this  
month that, contrary to FBI Agent Daniel J. Wehr's affidavit, Wehr 
did not participate in an interview of Dia Maria Mapili. 
</P>
<P>
	The longtime employee of Trie told agents she was instructed by  
Trie in 1996 to get rid of fund-raising-related documents stored at 
his home and garage office. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents seized computers and accessories, records, books,  
business papers, photographs, mail and other documents in the 
search of Trie's home, according to court papers that U.S. District 
Judge George Howard Jr. unsealed Friday.

<HEADLINE> Crystal Ann Wins Melair Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Crystal Ann, who shipped in from  
Arizona, defeated Dusty Heather by 3 1/2 lengths to win Saturday's 
$100,000 Melair Stakes for California-breds at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Esteban Gomez, also based in Arizona, Crystal Ann  
covered 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:17 1-5 and paid $18.20, $8.40 and $5.80 
while carrying 118 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the great things about this filly is that she settles  
into stride so nicely,'' Gomez said. ``But getting her going ... 
sometimes that's a little problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dusty Heather returned $5.80 and $4, while Memoranda was another  
1 3/4 lengths back in third and paid $4.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $60,000, increased Crystal Ann's career  
earnings to $114,520, with six wins in nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Rollins saddled Crystal Ann in the absence of his  
79-year-old father, Lyman Rollins, who watched the simulcast at 
Turf Paradise in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bob Baffert-trained entry of Success in Excess and Big Noise  
was sent off as the favorite and second-choice, respectively. But 
Success in Excess wound up fourth, while Big Noise was eased. Also 
eased was Emerging Class after Mojave Bay broke down turning for 
home, causing Big Noise and Emerging Class to veer and fall out of 
contention.

<HEADLINE>  United on Kosovo, NATO Looks Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders, having declared their  
determination to bomb Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into 
submission, moved on today to key questions of the alliance's 
future -- and the possibility of more Kosovos. President Clinton 
said the current crisis underscored ``the imperative of modernizing 
our alliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question of how to deal with Kosovo, the province where  
Yugoslav army and special police forces are attempting to force out 
the ethnic Albanian majority, dominated the first day of the 
three-day NATO summit and put a damper on what was to have been a 
celebration of the alliance's 50 years of maintaining the peace in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said today that discussions  
included the future of the region and ``how we are going to stop 
the former Yugoslavia from being the permanent bleeding wound of 
Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Konrad Freytag, the NATO military briefer, said that  
alliance forces struck during the preceding 24 hours at targets in 
Serbia and at Yugoslav forces on the ground in Kosovo. Targets 
included command-and-control facilities, including two radio relay 
and television transmission towers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air defense targets included airfields, petroleum production and  
storage depots and the Novi Sad refinery, said Freytag. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday evening, NATO defense ministers approved a plan to stop  
oil imports from reaching Yugoslavia via Montenegro, said German 
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Scharping told reporters, ships suspected of  
carrying oil would be stopped and searched at harbor entry and 
turned back if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has concentrated much of its air campaign on bombing oil  
storage and refining capabilities, but has been frustrated that 
while pilots risk their lives to bomb these facilities, refined oil 
continues to enter the country. The 15-nation European Union 
already has agreed on an oil embargo, but that does not cover all 
potential oil shippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said the searches of ships would be designed ``to tighten  
the taps, switch off the oil tap completely. And I heard this 
morning that the Serbs are now going around to all of the abandoned 
refugees' cars -- and there are many of them inside of Kosovo -- 
and are siphoning the petrol out of the tanks. I mean, they are 
that desperate now to find fuel wherever they can that they are 
going to those extreme measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the alliance leaders opened today's session, Clinton said,  
``The crisis in Kosovo has underscored the importance of NATO and 
the imperative of modernizing our alliance for 21st century 
challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Clinton with brief remarks before today's discussions  
were closed to the media, Javier Solana, the alliance's 
secretary-general, said that in Kosovo, NATO is facing ``the same 
challenges to stability, security and well-being in Europe'' that 
it faced when it was founded 50 years ago to counter the Soviet 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day devoted to discussions of Kosovo, alliance leaders  
were moving to approval of an overall NATO strategic concept: basic 
principles that they term the European Security and Defense 
Identity. The program would allow European countries freedom to 
conduct operations in which the United States was not interested, 
but using NATO assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The program includes a new Defense Capability Initiative, an  
attempt to head off a growing technology gap between U.S. military 
forces and the rest of the allies. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategic concept outlines the threats of the future against  
which NATO might have to defend, among them regional and ethnic 
conflicts like Kosovo, terrorism, and proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the agenda is a program setting out required steps for  
aspiring members, a sort of road map to joining NATO; the enhanced 
Partnership for Peace program, wherein non-member countries get 
involved in NATO activities which may or may not lead to 
membership; increased dialogue with Mediterranean countries; and 
creation of a new center to deal with weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The major difference over the new strategic concept, which will  
replace the one last revised in 1991, concerns the alliance's 
relations with the United Nations. Essentially, France and a number 
of other European countries want to set out specifically the 
conditions under which NATO can take military action outside its 
traditional Euro-Atlantic area. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, while agreeing the United Nations should play  
a pre-eminent role, feels the issue is adequately addressed in 
NATO's founding treaty and prefers to leave the details vague. This 
would allow the alliance to act on its own under special 
circumstances -- Kosovo being the perfect example. A Russian veto 
would have prohibited any NATO action in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a wide difference between President Clinton and me on  
the need to ask the United Nations (before taking action),'' French 
President Jacques Chirac said after meeting with Clinton on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies dismissed a Russian initiative to settle the conflict  
since Belgrade still refused to accept a NATO-led military force to 
enforce peace. Still, the leaders said they wanted to work 
constructively with Russia.

<HEADLINE> Possible Gunmen Suicide Note Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Police received in an e-mail what may be  
a suicide statement from one of the teen-age gunmen that blames 
this week's bloody rampage at a high school on parents, teachers 
and ``your children who have ridiculed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail was received by the Jefferson County Sheriff's  
Department either Thursday or Friday, sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said today at a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared to have been written by Eric Harris the day before  
he and Dylan Klebold stormed Columbine High School armed with 
sawed-off shotguns and homemade bombs, the Denver Rocky Mountain 
News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The two killed 12 students and one teacher before shooting  
themselves Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``By now, it's over. If you are reading this, my mission is  
complete,'' the note says. 
</P>
<P>
	It warns against blaming the massacre on the music the shooters  
listened to or the clothes they wore, placing the responsibility 
with teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your children who have ridiculed me, who have chosen not to  
accept me, who have treated me like I am not worth their time are 
dead. THEY ARE (expletive) DEAD,'' the note says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may have taken their lives and my own -- but it was your  
doing. Teachers, parents, LET THIS MASSACRE BE ON YOUR SHOULDERS 
UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The note ends with a warning of more bloodshed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You may think the horror ends with the bullet in my head, but  
you wouldn't be so lucky. All that I can leave you with to decipher 
what more extensive death is to come is `12Skizto.' You have until 
April 26th. Goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators ``have some ideas'' about the ``12Skizto''  
reference but have not yet pinned it down. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper did not explain how it obtained the note.  
</P>
<P>
	Police also are trying to trace the shotguns and semiautomatic  
weapons the teen-agers used. They hope surveillance tapes might 
shed light on whether Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, had any help. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, meanwhile, temporarily withdrew from Columbine in  
order to let the bomb squad search more efficiently today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, authorities released emergency 911 tapes that provide  
the first real-time glimpse into what was happening inside the 
school as the siege began. 
</P>
<P>
	In one tape, a teacher, her voice tight with panic, implored  
police to hurry and tried to keep her students safe as gunfire 
echoed in the background. ``Kids -- JUST STAY DOWN!'' the teacher 
yelled. ``My God -- the gun is right outside my door!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's outside in the hall,'' said the teacher, identified only  
as Peggy. ``There's alarms and things going off and smoke. My God -- 
smoke is coming into this room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From students to teachers to political leaders, the community  
geared up for a weekend of funerals and memorials, including one 
Vice President Al Gore planned to attend. Many in the region still 
struggled to cope. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time passes, and as numbers mount, we tend to depersonalize  
and become less sensitive,'' said Gov. Bill Owens. ``I'll never be 
able to depersonalize this tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 900 mourners gathered Friday at Foothills Bible Church  
for a memorial service for 16-year-old John Tomlin, who worked 
after school in a gardening store and belonged to a church youth 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are disintegrating, partly because prayer has been  
removed from them,'' said his mother, Doreen Tomlin. 
</P>
<P>
	A makeshift memorial near Columbine has continued to grow, with  
hundreds of bouquets, stuffed animals, signs and cards. One sign 
contained finger-painted images of children's hands. Said another, 
``Silence contributes to moral decay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As mourners grieve, a picture of what went on during the siege's  
initial moments was becoming clearer with the release of the 911 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher had called from the school library, which became the  
scene of the worst carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The school is in a panic and I'm in the library,'' Peggy said.  
``I've got students down. Kids -- under the table! My kids are 
screaming. Under the table, kids! And my teachers are trying to 
take control of things. We need police here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another call, apparently moments earlier, came from a female  
student. ``I just saw everyone running. I just saw the smoke,'' the 
student said. ``People are saying there's a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived to chaos outside and inside. Tapes released  
Friday of their radio communications revealed that one officer 
spotted a gunman on the southwest end of the school almost 
immediately. ``It's a big gun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, investigators said surveillance tapes from security  
cameras at Columbine may show whether the gunmen had accomplices. 
Although the library had no cameras, police planned to review tapes 
from other cameras around the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally they would show the movement and also the actual  
placement perhaps of some of the explosive devices, prior to the 
incident,'' said sheriff's Lt. John Kiekbusch. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes, which contain footage filmed periodically rather than  
continuously, have not yet been viewed, said sheriff's spokesman 
Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also interviewed at least 500 people --  
teachers, friends and fellow students, including members of the 
Trenchcoat Mafia, a group of Columbine outcasts who wore black. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the large amount of explosives and firepower has  
authorities considering the possibility of accomplices, sheriff's 
Lt. Dave Taylor said investigators have not identified specific 
suspects. ``There are a lot of names coming up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key task is tracing the guns: two sawed-off shotguns, a  
9 mm carbine rifle and a TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol, an assault 
weapon that is now illegal to manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Bettendorf, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms, said tracing the weapons will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``These weapons were originally purchased in the late 1960s or  
early 1970s, and there is no indication they belong to the 
parents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students and faculty will return to classrooms, though  
not their own, next Thursday. They will share nearby Chatfield High 
School, with Columbine classes taking place in an afternoon split 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County authorities were checking reports that phones  
inside Columbine were programmed to block 911 calls because of 
previous prank emergency calls by students. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools spokeswoman Kay Pride said there were reports some  
students had trouble reaching authorities. A check showed pay 
phones could reach 911 -- as they must under federal law -- but Pride 
said tests haven't yet been run on the internal school system. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a question that hasn't been answered yet,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	David Biegie, spokesman for the phone company U S West, said the  
school's internal system could be set up to block numbers. He said 
students also might not have dialed the correct number to reach an 
outside line. 
</P>
<P>
	One shooting victim, Makai Hall, was discharged from the  
hospital Friday, temporarily in a wheelchair and recovering from a 
bullet wound that shattered his right knee. He said he was ready to 
resume his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting better and a lot of my healing's been done,'' said  
the 16-year-old. ``I'm not going to let it bring me down. I'm going 
to use it to motivate myself.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	As expected, the Detroit Red Wings and Dallas Stars are looking  
pretty good in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Buffalo Sabres are 
looking even better. 
</P>
<P>
	All three teams won the first two games of their first-round  
series, but the Sabres are taking their 2-0 lead back home 
following Friday night's 3-2 double-overtime victory at Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming out of here with a split would have been great for  
us,'' Buffalo's Jason Woolley said. ``But after winning that first 
game without really playing as well as we can gave us hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, meanwhile, pounded Anaheim 5-1 and the Stars beat  
Edmonton 3-2 before going on the road against their lower-seeded 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs continued today with Pittsburgh at New Jersey and  
St. Louis at Phoenix. Tonight, it's Boston at Carolina, 
Philadelphia at Toronto and Colorado at San Jose. New Jersey, St. 
Louis, Boston and Philadelphia all lead their series 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado-San Jose series is opening late because of the  
shooting deaths at a suburban Denver high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Miroslav Satan scored his second goal of the game at 10:35 of  
the second overtime period to give the Sabres a victory over the 
favored Senators, who finished second in the Eastern Conference and 
were 12 points better than Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	After a turnover in the neutral zone, Woolley took a shot that  
Damian Rhodes kicked out with his left pad. The rebound came out to 
Satan, who slapped it into the empty net. 
</P>
<P>
	The series shifts to Buffalo for Game 3 on Sunday and Game 4 on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt (Friday night's victory) was just a matter of time,''  
Buffalo's Joe Juneau said. ``We were really confident and we made 
sure nobody thought otherwise. Obviously, it's a great advantage 
going home up 2-0 with a chance to make it 3-0. I don't know what 
will happen, but we'd love to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in the series, Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek  
played a big role for the Sabres. He made 40 stops in Wednesday 
night's 2-1 victory, and stopped 45 on Friday night, giving up 85 
saves on 88 shots in the two games. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Red Wings 5, Mighty Ducks 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Brendan Shanahan had two goals and an assist for Detroit against  
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, who swept the first two games of only one series  
last season en route to their second straight Stanley Cup, head to 
Anaheim for Game 3 on Sunday. The Ducks have only been in two 
playoff series before, winning one, and have never overcome a 2-0 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Fedorov had two assists for the second straight game, and  
Tomas Holmstrom, Doug Brown and Steve Yzerman, who had three goals 
Wednesday, added a goal each. Teemu Selanne scored for Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings were 3-of-9 on the power play, while the Ducks,  
who had the top power-play unit in the NHL this season with a 25.5 
percent success rate, were 1-of-4. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Stars 3, Oilers 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Jere Lehtinen and Guy Carbonneau both scored for the second game  
in a row for Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Langenbrunnner scored the game-winner with his first goal  
of the playoffs. His goal at 14:22 of the third period made it 3-1 
before Edmonton's Doug Weight scored with 3:11 left to make it a 
one-goal game again. 
</P>
<P>
	Both goalies were strong, as Edmonton's Tommy Salo stopped 31  
shots and Dallas' Ed Belfour turned back 17. Dallas outshot the 
Oilers 34-19.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Wishes Salt Lake Games Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada says the Salt  
Lake games will endure an Olympic scandal and reap the rewards of 
the Olympic legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure you will be able to overcome the scandal and have  
successful Games, too,'' he said through an interpreter on Friday. 
``The citizens of Salt Lake City will support the Olympic Games 
just like those in Nagano did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tsukada shrugged off suggestions his city did anything improper  
in bidding for the Olympics, even though it has been revealed that 
Salt Lake bid officials gave cash payments, lavish gifts and 
scholarships to International Olympic Committee members and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a host city, the most important thing to do is to host  
successful Games,'' he said. ``We did that. It's over, and we 
didn't have any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Nagano residents, led by former assemblyman Kaoru Iwata,  
are suing Tsukada, Nagano's governor and the head of the Japanese 
Organizing Committee, to reveal how the Nagano bid team spent $6.9 
million in taxpayer funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's bid committee records were burned, but bidders  
acknowledged providing IOC officials with expensive trips, gifts 
and geisha companions in the campaign to win the 1998 Winter Games. 
Iwata's group also sued the IOC, demanding reimbursement of the 
$6.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsukada presented city officials with an 8-foot-long origami  
sculpture of Salt Lake's Olympic symbol constructed by Nagano high 
schoolers. He smiled as children from Hillside Intermediate played 
``Oh Susannah'' on Japanese flutes. And he chuckled when Hawthorne 
Elementary student Kiesha Day winced about eating turtle soup. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the cultural connection part of the Olympic legacy and  
his trip to Utah was intended to see how the seeds of the ``One 
Country One School'' program started in Nagano have sprouted. 
</P>
<P>
	The program paired each Nagano elementary and middle school with  
a country participating in the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was for students to learn about other countries through  
friendship before and after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 Salt Lake Valley schools have picked up the program,  
which is being administered by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
Next year, SLOC will expand it to all 807 schools in the state, 
SLOC educational director Dianne Hesleph said.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kathy Ireland is campaigning for babies'  
health this weekend as honorary chairperson of the March of Dimes' 
WalkAmerica, a nationwide fund-raiser that has raised more than 
$970 million for medical research over 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just amazing,'' Ireland said Friday from Cedars-Sinai  
Medical Center where the supermodel was touring the neonatal 
intensive care unit. ``These babies who are born at 24, 25 weeks, 
some of them weighing just over one pound ... not that long ago 
these babies wouldn't have survived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ireland, mother of Lily, 5 1/2 months, and Erik, 5, planned to join  
walkers today in Los Angeles' Griffith Park. The event raises money 
for research on ways to prevent birth defects, reduce infant 
mortality and eliminate childhood disease.

<HEADLINE> Oilers Down Two but Buoyed by Home / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Down two games to none and outshot by a  
margin of 2-1, the only thing the Edmonton Oilers have going for 
them is home ice -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers got bogged down on the humid, mushy ice at Dallas'  
Reunion Arena in the first two games of the NHL Western Conference 
quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars used the ice to their advantage, earning a 2-0 lead  
with a punishing, trapping style of play that allowed just 13 shots 
on goalie Ed Belfour in the first game and 19 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their game plan is not going to change much,'' Edmonton coach  
Ron Low said Saturday. ``They're going to try and keep it as tight 
as possible in the neutral zone and we'll have to find ways through 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers are a young, fast-skating, hard-hitting team and  
figure a long series of quick strides and board-bending hits is 
their only chance of beating the Stars, who have 14 players over 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be able to make a lot more passes and do different  
things we couldn't do down there,'' Oilers defenseman Tom Poti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ice here doesn't wear down as much as it does in Dallas.  
It was like trying to stickhandle on grass (there). It's just 
impossible to play on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Doug Weight added: ``You've got 20 minutes (in a period)  
to make passes here where you have about an eight-minute window 
there'' before the ice turns to slush. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas's blue-line corps, led by Richard Matvichuk and Sergei  
Zubov, has allowed few rebounds, few bodies in front of the net and 
has blocked a ton of shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``They block 10, 15, 20 shots a game,'' Oilers forward Todd  
Marchant said. ``We've got to get those shots through and get the 
rebounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weight agreed. ``They get into your head a bit with their  
blocked shots. You see three or four in the first couple of shifts, 
then guys try to make extra moves and passes to the middle, which 
they want us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers goal drought continued in Game 2 even though their  
two top scorers, Bill Guerin and Josef Beranek, returned from knee 
injuries. They've lost by 2-1 and 3-2 scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Low said the Oilers game plan remains hit and hit often. The  
Oilers have 129 hits over two games compared with 81 by Dallas, 
about the only statistical category in which the Oilers have an 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have been playing like seasoned playoff veterans. They  
have controlled the tempo in both games from start to finish. The 
only concern has been their power play, which is 0-for-10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers, an inconsistent team all season, now face the task  
of beating the NHL's best team four times in five games to extend 
the season.

<HEADLINE> Mom, Daughter Found Dead in Van </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- The bodies of a mother and her  
3-year-old daughter were found in a van and police were seeking a 
motive for their slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators combed streets and fields for clues Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a small child, a victim like that, you need to  
pull out all the stops,'' said Officer Paul Villanueva, a police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Kopatz, 35, and her daughter, Carley, were discovered  
Thursday about a mile from home by a relative who went looking for 
them after Ms. Kopatz failed to show up at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had no motives or suspects. Ms. Kopatz didn't  
appear to have been robbed or sexually assaulted, Villanueva said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police didn't reveal the cause of death but described them as  
brutal. Villanueva said there are indications that Mrs. Kopatz may 
have been killed before she was placed in the van, though 
investigators believe the 3-year-old was killed in the van. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were last seen earlier Thursday when Mrs. Kopatz took  
the van to run errands.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Launch Codes Left Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton departed the NATO summit in  
such haste Saturday that he left behind perhaps the most important 
piece of luggage in the world -- the ``nuclear football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's military aide, who constantly shadows Clinton  
and carries the briefcase containing U.S. nuclear launch codes, was 
mistakenly left at the International Trade Center when Clinton's 
motorcade sped off 45 minutes early and without notice. 
</P>
<P>
	The aide walked the 4 1/2 blocks back to the White House without  
incident. ``We're safe,'' said White House press secretary Joe 
Lockhart. He said Clinton left so quickly because his last summit 
meeting of the day broke up early and ``rather than wait for 
everyone to gather, he just took off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pool of reporters that always travels with Clinton also was  
left behind.

<HEADLINE> Patience Game Wins Derby Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Patience Game, making his stakes debut in  
only his fourth start, wrested the lead from Yes It's True and 
Straight Man at the top of the stretch and won the Derby Trial on 
opening day Saturday at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three 3-year-old colts hit the quarter pole almost as one.  
Then Patience Game, ridden by Corey Nakatani, opened a daylight 
lead and went on to win by 2 1/4 lengths over Prime Directive, who 
closed to take the place by 2 3/4 lengths over Straight Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes It's True finished another half-length back in the  
nine-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the nine are set to compete in the 125th Kentucky Derby  
next Saturday. Plans called for Patience Game, trained by Alex 
Hassinger Jr., to run in the Illinois Derby on May 8 at Sportsman's 
Park or in the Preakness on May 15 at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Patience Game carried 114 pounds, eight pounds less than Prime  
Directive, over one mile in 1:37.86 and paid $9, $4.60 and $3.40 to 
his backers in a crowd of 17,323 on a cool, sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner earned $71,176 from a purse of $114,800 for his  
owner, Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi Arabia, who will try to win the 
Derby with Desert Hero. 
</P>
<P>
	In his three races before the Trial, all this year, Patience  
Game finished second in two maiden races at Santa Anita, then broke 
his maiden in a mile race March 27 at that track. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Directive, ridden by Pat Day, returned $6.60 and $4.  
Straight Man (122) was worth $3.80 to show. He was ridden by David 
Flores and is trained by Bob Baffert, who will saddle General 
Challenge and Prime Timber in a bid for an unprecedented third 
straight victory in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish were Lead Em Home, Kutsa,  
Donerail Court, Hector and Nebrasska.

<HEADLINE>  Nomo Released by Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- With four pitchers on the disabled list,  
including Kerry Wood who is out for the season, the Chicago Cubs 
might have adopted a what-have-we-got-to-lose philosophy with Hideo 
Nomo. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, when Nomo refused to make two more starts in the minors  
on top of the three he's already had with their Triple-A farm club, 
the Cubs released the former NL rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our opinion he was not ready to join our major league  
club,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said Friday, one day after 
Nomo was wild in his third start at Class AAA Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the Cubs, Nomo was to make three starts  
for Iowa and then Chicago would either promote him to the majors 
with an $800,000 base salary plus incentives that could total 
another $2 million, ask him to stay longer in the minors or release 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch asked Nomo's agent, Don Nomura, if his client would agree  
to two more starts at Iowa. Nomura said no and so the Cubs released 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really didn't seem interested in any additional time in  
Triple-A,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nomo's third start with Iowa on Thursday, he walked six,  
struck out five and gave up three hits and two runs in six innings 
during a 3-1 loss to Memphis. He threw 51 strikes and 47 balls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at the quality of his pitches and command,'' said  
Lynch, a former major league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have someone who has either very good command or  
overpowering stuff, one of the two, you could justify bringing him 
to your major league club. We just didn't see the command or stuff 
that we felt was good enough to get major league hitters out. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our opinion. I'm sure he has a different opinion of his  
command and his stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo and Nomura were not available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was waived by the New York Mets this spring and the Cubs,  
hungry for pitching with Wood out for the season following elbow 
surgery, signed Nomo to a Triple-A deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Starters Kevin Tapani and Jeremi Gonzalez and reliever Terry  
Adams are also on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said he was disappointed that it didn't work out with  
Nomo, acknowledging that he might be ready for a return to the 
majors by summer. He said he expected Nomo to re-enter the free 
agent market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a nice boost to add a pitcher of his name  
to our staff,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was fair to our club right now to bring him  
to the major leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's previous two outings at Iowa were more encouraging than  
his third. He allowed five earned runs in 11 innings. In his second 
appearance against Las Vegas, he pitched six shutout innings and 
struck out 10. 
</P>
<P>
	In his three Triple-A starts, he was 1-1 with a 3.71 ERA,  
striking out 18 and walking 12 while allowing 12 hits and seven 
runs in 17 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo's major league record is 49-41 with a 3.66 ERA in four  
seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Mets, but he faltered last 
season. He went 6-12 with a 4.92 ERA last year with the Dodgers and 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in  
four appearances, before the Mets gave up on him. They sent him to 
Triple-A Norfolk outright March 24 and put him on unconditional 
release waivers two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was the NL's Rookie of the Year in 1995 when he struck out  
236 and allowed hitters just a .182 average.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Discusses Colo. Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, Calif. (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan said  
the entertainment industry is partly to blame for filling the young 
gunmen in the Colorado school massacre with violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what is happening in our public schools that didn't used  
to happen 30 years, I think Hollywood bears a measure of 
responsibility,'' Buchanan said Friday after a speech to 
conservative activists in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican said Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, were  
``empty vessels'' devoid of moral values. 
</P>
<P>
	``And what was poured into those vessels? All the dreck of  
modernity,'' he said. ``All that Hollywood can produce in terms of 
raw violence and sex and filth and all the rest of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in Littleton, Colorado, was a product of that  
culture of death that we've got to resist,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he would do as president, Buchanan offered no  
specifics, saying instead that he would use the power of the 
presidency to urge filmmakers to exercise restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	He also didn't mention by name any movies that he thought  
merited condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan addressed the California Republican Assembly, a  
conservative arm of the state GOP. Four other conservative 
presidential candidates are scheduled to attend the meeting this 
weekend, including Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Sen. 
Bob Smith of New Hampshire.

	Colo. Sheriff: Parents Share Blame  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The local sheriff said today that he  
believes the parents of two gunmen who went on a shooting spree at 
Columbine High School should ``be accountable'' for their kids' 
actions after authorities found a diary, shotgun barrel and 
bomb-making materials inside one of the boys' bedroom. ``A lot of 
this stuff was clearly visible and the parents should have known,'' 
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone. ``I think parents should be 
accountable for their kid's actions.'' The parents have not 
commented beyond separate written statements released by their 
attorneys. The statements expressed sorrow and sympathy for the 
victims' families.

	Clinton Pushes Violence Prevention  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for money  
and stricter gun laws to help stem school violence such as the 
attack last week at a Colorado high school in which 15 people were 
killed. Clinton said in his weekly radio address today that he 
wants to keep guns away from juveniles and will seek $12 million 
for emergency teams ``to help communities respond when tragedy 
strikes.'' The attack in Littleton, Colo., was the seventh at 
schools around the country in two years.

	Thousands Protest Attack on Serb TV

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of Belgrade residents  
marched today to a church near the bomb-shattered headquarters of 
Serb TV, protesting a NATO attack that authorities say killed 15 
people and injured 30. From the march route, search crews could be 
seen digging through the jumble of concrete and steel where 
missiles struck early yesterday in what NATO called an attack on 
the Serbian government's ``propaganda machine.'' NATO staged more 
attacks tonight, causing heavy damage in regions southeast and 
southwest of Belgrade, according to the Yugoslav news agency 
Tanjug.

day of their summit, NATO leaders said military commanders were 
laying plans under orders issued last night for sea searches to 
``switch off the oil tap'' fueling Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic's military machine. But Russia, angry about 32 days of 
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, indicated it would ignore an 
embargo.

	Forbes Pushes Abortion Ban  
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Steve  
Forbes urged conservative activists today to lay the groundwork for 
banning abortions by turning public opinion against the procedure. 
Forbes favors a constitutional ``human life'' amendment to outlaw 
abortions. But he acknowledged in a speech that ``many people do 
not yet agree with our ultimate goal -- a life amendment.'' Forbes 
was the second of five GOP White House hopefuls to address the 
conservative CRA, which will endorse a candidate in November and by 
doing so mobilize thousands of its activists.

<HEADLINE> Miler Lassiter Stars at Penn Relays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Forget Michael Johnson, Marion Jones and  
Maurice Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas senior Seneca Lassiter did just that Saturday in the  
Penn Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter wasn't awed or intimidated by the presence of three of  
the world's greatest sprinters before a Franklin Field crowd of 
44,639 that brought the three-day attendance to a meet-record 
96,358. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, rapidly becoming the nation's best miler, anchored  
Arkansas to relay championships in the 4-mile race and 3,200-meter 
event, after having anchored the Razorbacks to the distance medley 
relay title Friday. Those victories earned Lassiter the award as 
the outstanding track athlete in the meet for the second time in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	His sensational performance Saturday included a scintillating  
mile of 3 minutes, 55.6 seconds in the 4-mile relay, helping 
Arkansas set a collegiate record of 16:07.96, breaking the mark of 
16.08.9 by the 1962 Oregon team that featured world-class miler 
Dyrol Burleson on anchor. It was Arkansas' sixth straight title in 
the event and 14th in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was really into it,'' Lassiter said after his  
brilliant effort in the 4-mile race. ``The crowd got me through the 
last 800. The fans at Penn always want to see a record broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking at the clock as I was coming down (the final  
straightaway). I wanted to break the record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weary Lassiter came back less than 3 1/2 hours later and ran  
1:48.9 for 800 meters, helping Arkansas win the 3,200 relay for the 
first time in the Penn Relays at 7:13.87, the fastest in the meet 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif Karie also ran both relays, and he broke open the 3,200  
race. His second leg of 1:48.7 gave Arkansas an 8-meter lead, after 
trailing SMU by 25 meters after the first 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion and 200 world  
record-holder, ran an unofficial 19.2 for 200 meters in anchoring 
Nike International to a 9-meter victory in the open 800 relay. When 
Johnson got the baton from Greene, his advantage was only two 
meters. He then breezed over the final 200 without pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world's top-ranked 100-meter runner and the 1997  
world champion, also competed in the open 400 relay, but his swift 
anchor leg was only good for a third-place finish for Nike HSI at 
39.50, behind Nike Elite (39.20) and Nike International (39.35). 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, top-ranked in the world in the women's 100 and 200, also  
ran on two open relays and, like Greene, won one. Jones ran the 
second leg of the 400 relay team for Nike International that 
finished second, .01 seconds behind an Adidas team anchored by Toya 
Brown. Adidas was timed in 43.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, running anchor, overcame a 2-meter deficit and sped to a  
7-meter victory in the 800 relay. The team finished at 1:30.23, 
nearly a second ahead of Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
	An Adidas team of Michael McDonald, Antonio Pettigrew, Milton  
Campbell and Jerome Young ran the fastest 1,600-meter relay in the 
world this year, 2:58.53, while also becoming the first team to 
break the 3-minute barrier in the relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, led by Shawn Crawford, won two men's college relay  
titles. The Tigers, with Crawford running anchor, took the 400 
relay in 39.48 and, with Crawford leading off, won the sprint 
medley in 3:18.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's and women's sprint medley relays were scheduled to be  
run Friday, but were postponed a day because of lightning and rain. 
That apparently played havoc with the runners, because the men's 
time was the slowest in 12 years in the relays, and women's 
champion Seton Hall's clocking of 3:49.52 was the slowest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida thwarted Clemson's bid for a third relay title, winning  
the men's 800 in 1:21.50, as the Tigers, who had the fastest 
qualifying time, slipped to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU, spurred by Peta Gaye-Dowdie's swift anchor leg, raced to  
its fifth consecutiver victory in the women's 800 relay in 1:32.46. 
Collegiate record-holder Texas dropped the baton on the first 
handoff from LeKeesha White to Suziann Reid and didn't finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane registered its first-ever victory in the relays, taking  
the women's distance medley championship in 10:55.71, with Hanne 
Lyngstad outkicking BYU's Lindsay Jones. It was the first Penn 
title for Tulane coach Ron Bazilsince since 1971, when his Adelphi 
team won two championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final two relays on the program, Mississippi edged East  
Carolina in the men's 1,600 in 3:05.19 and Texas took the women's 
1,600 for the fifth consecutive year at 3:31.48, helped by Suziann 
Reid's come-from-behind 50.8 anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's Coby Miller, the fastest American this year in the 100,  
won the event at 10.22, much shower than his best of 10.03. 
Tennessee's Kelli White took the women's 100 in 11.32. 
</P>
<P>
	In the invitational miles, Karl Paranya was the men's winner in  
4:00.59 and Cheri Goddard Kenah was the women's champion in 
4:38.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Another record was broken by Tim Seaman, winner of the men's  
10-kilometer race walk in 39:43.85. In becoming the first Americn 
to crack 40 minutes, he smashed the American record of 40:20.57 by 
Tim Lewis in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Must Pay $9.5M Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A division of Korean giant Hyundai  
Group must pay $9.5 million to a corporate headhunter fired for 
refusing to discriminate against women, a jury decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai Semiconductor America Inc. came out the loser on Friday  
in a lawsuit filed by Jeff Abraham, owner of Technical Resources 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hyundai's payment, the jury ruled that Menzie  
must pay Abraham nearly $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The verdict is the truth. The award is beyond my wildest  
expectations,'' Abraham said. ``This has never been about money. I 
did this because I wanted the record to show what they're all 
about, and it's on the record today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai said in a statement that it would appeal the verdict and  
``has not ever, nor does it now, discriminate in hiring or 
contracting practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai hired Abraham's recruiting firm in 1996 to find  
engineers and other professionals for a computer chip manufacturing 
plant in Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his lawsuit, Abraham was told by James F. Menzie, a  
Hyundai human resources manager, to stop sending resumes from 
blacks or women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean managers had indicated ``they would hire as few as  
possible,'' the suit said.

<HEADLINE> Warnings of New Computer Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A virus that can erase a computer's hard-drive  
and prevent the equipment from restarting is poised to strike on 
Monday, but experts say off-the-shelf antivirus software can 
prevent infection, and several companies are offering free 
inoculation tools on their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus has been dubbed Chernobyl because its most common  
version was programmed to activate on computers using Windows 95 
and Windows 98 on Monday, the 13th anniversary of the nuclear 
disaster in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Another, less common, version, strikes computers on the 26th day  
of any month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much just another virus. It's been around for  
quite a while,'' said Kathy Fithen, manager of the Computer 
Emergency Response Team, or CERT, at Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh. ``As long as people stay current with their antivirus 
software, they should be in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The viruses, believed to originate in Taiwan, attempt to erase a  
computer's hard-drive and write gibberish to the computer's system 
settings, called its Bios, preventing the machine from being 
restarted. 
</P>
<P>
	But warnings from many experts lacked any sense of panic or  
impending doom because the virus was discovered last summer, giving 
antivirus companies many months to develop free software updates to 
identify and destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of those products will be protected only if they've  
retrieved the free updates. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Associates Inc., for example, said its popular McAfee  
software recognized Chernobyl as early as June 1998, and Symantec 
Corp. said its Norton Antivirus program identified Chernobyl before 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT issued a warning this week about the virus because of  
questions from computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting requests for information about it rather than  
reports of machines infected with it,'' Fithen said. ``This has 
been around so long that the antivirus vendors have picked this 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the recent ``Melissa'' scare, which automatically  
propagated via e-mail, this virus doesn't spread as quickly because 
it requires a person to launch an infected program file to 
contaminate a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at Symantec's Antivirus  
Research Center, said one big risk stems from a potential infection 
on a company's computer network, which could then spread to 
individual computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it gets on a corporate network and the volumes are not  
protected, it could spread very, very rapidly,'' Nachenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Hodges, a vice president for security at Network  
Associates, said the company was hoping for the best but bracing 
for the worse. ``It can be fairly significant,'' he said. ``You 
don't know until the bomb actually goes off.''

<HEADLINE> Cable-Car Charges Remain for Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military trial will proceed next  
week to determine whether a Marine pilot obstructed justice after 
his jet clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge refused Friday to dismiss the obstruction charges  
against Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Col. Alvin Keller, rejected arguments by Ashby's  
lawyers that high-ranking Marine officers improperly influenced the 
decision to prosecute Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	During a low-level training mission on Feb. 3, 1998, Ashby's  
four-man EA-6B Prowler jet severed the gondola cable in the Italian 
Alps, and 20 people plunged to their deaths. He was acquitted of 
manslaughter charges in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In the obstruction case, Ashby is accused of destroying a  
videotape shot during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby testified during his manslaughter trial that he removed  
the tape after the flight and handed it to his navigator, Capt. 
Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. Schweitzer said he threw 
the tape into a bonfire, fearing images of him smiling into the 
camera would be shown on Italian television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts will show that Captain Ashby ultimately returned the  
tape to the person who owned the tape,'' Ashby's attorney, Frank 
Spinner, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty earlier this month to obstruction of  
justice and conspiracy charges. The judge recommended his dismissal 
from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection in Ashby's trial is to start Monday.

<HEADLINE> Francis Out of Carolina Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Carolina's Ron Francis, the hottest  
scorer for the Hurricanes in the second half of the season, tested 
his sprained ankle Saturday but was unable to play in Game 2 
against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, 36, appeared in all 82 regular-season game for Carolina  
and scored 36 points over his final 41 games. But the center was 
held out of the playoff game against the Bruins after injuring his 
right ankle in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis suffered the injury in the first period of Boston's 2-0  
victory over Carolina on Thursday night when Bruins defenseman 
Steve Heinze fell on him behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were negative later than night. But the 18-year NHL  
veteran who won two Stanley Cups for Pittsburgh in the early 1990s, 
said the ankle was just too tender to go in Saturday night's 
Eastern Conference playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said he tested the ankle twice before the game, but came  
to the conclusion he couldn't help the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain areas where I can't do what you need to do  
on the ice,'' said Francis, who led the team in minutes played and 
power play points. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said he didn't feel very good in his first test on the  
ice at the Greensboro Coliseum about 2 1/2 hours before game time, 
then tried it again minutes later with more support in his boot. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this business you are competitive by nature and you want to  
try different ways to see if you can't make it work. We tried 
something else and it just didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis will be replaced in the Carolina lineup by Robert Kron,  
who was a healthy scratch for Game 1 and scored only nine goals in 
75 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said he didn't address the team prior to the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a distraction or a sideshow at this  
point,'' he said. ``I decided to test it early so it wouldn't 
happen right here (in front of everybody).'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's still unclear if the ankle will be ready for Game 3 in  
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could say 100 percent one way or the other, but I  
really don't know. Does it feel better today than it did two night 
ago? Yeah. Does that mean it will be good enough by Monday? 
Hopefully, but I can't say that with any certainty.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Leaders Enjoying Plush Hotels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO Secretary General Javier Solana sleeps in  
a plush six-room suite with crystal chandeliers and furnishings 
just a shade lighter than ``NATO blue.'' Romanian President Emil 
Constantinescu strolls across marble to enter his regal 
red-and-gold hotel room. French President Jacques Chirac's suite 
has a oval dining room and four bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign leaders at NATO's 50th anniversary are staying in more  
than a dozen of Washington's fanciest hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	The 143 sleeping rooms at the Hay-Adams Hotel were booked solid  
a year ago by three foreign delegations. Spokeswoman Jennifer 
Girgus wouldn't identify the VIPs, but said multi-lingual ``lobby 
ambassadors'' are helping guests find anything from a photocopy 
machine to a city landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales managers fluent in Arabic, German, French and Italian also  
mill through the lobby of the Hotel Washington from 6 a.m. to 8 
p.m. to assist foreign guests staying in more than 100 of its 355 
rooms. ``The sales managers just happen to know the languages and 
so it was a very good plus for us,'' said manager Walid Harb. 
</P>
<P>
	While foreign visitors are being treated like royalty, hotel  
managers say they've tried to temper their hospitality. Parties are 
taboo because of the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia and the 
plight of hundreds of thousands of Kosovars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to honor the historic occasion without being  
excessive in light of the events in Yugoslavia,'' said Kristina 
Messner, spokeswoman for the Willard Inter-Continental Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the hotel had gifts waiting for Solana, Chirac and  
Constantinescu: two replicas of the Capitol -- one in crystal that's 
about the size of a paperweight and another in chocolate.

	``The chocolate Capitol dome was 8 to 10 inches high,'' she  
said. ``It was on a pastry display surrounded by petit fours and a 
variety of French pastries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Like a gaggle of unsure ducklings, 20 world leaders on their way  
to lunch Saturday followed a path that NATO summit organizers had 
paved with red carpets laid at angles: out toward a riser of news 
cameras, hard left turn, straight line across a courtyard, another 
left, and back into the International Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
	It was plotted for maximum ``photo-op.'' And so, at dead center,  
President Clinton halted the cluster and tried to get everyone to 
more or less spread out and face the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski pointed to the carpet  
yet ahead and asked: ``But aren't we supposed to walk that way?'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	What to buy for America's foreign friends?  
</P>
<P>
	Silver, porcelain and crystal, according to the White House  
press office. 
</P>
<P>
	To: NATO leaders -- a medallion, made by Tiffany &AMP; Co.,  
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the alliance and white 
porcelain bowls decorated with the flags of NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	To: Leaders of NATO partner countries -- a crystal bridge  
sculpture titled ``Partnership'' set on a granite base. 
</P>
<P>
	Their spouses received white porcelain plates decorated with the  
flags, sterling silver compacts or hand-painted porcelain boxes of 
the White House or vice president's residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers, defense ministers and members of their  
delegations received crystal globes, 3 inches in diameter, cherry 
stationery boxes with commemorative coins or pewter desk boxes 
decorated with flags of member nations. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Flag bearers have a hectic job shuffling the national banners of  
the various countries when NATO dignitaries arrive for dinner at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Official cars cruise up the drive of the executive mansion.  
White-gloved military men open the doors. The first thing the 
foreign officials see is their country's flag and Old Glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a challenge when the motorcades come,'' says Thomas  
Groppel, director of ceremonies and special events for the Military 
District of Washington, which is responsible for Army activities in 
the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	With only a few minutes of notice, flag workers must identify  
the arriving guest -- not an easy job with more than 40 foreign 
leaders zigzagging around Washington. Then, they have to grab the 
proper national flag, making sure, for example, not to mistake 
Luxembourg's red-white-and-LIGHT blue flag for the Netherlands' 
red-white-and-DARK blue one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have to be quick,'' Groppel says. ``We have to decide  
who it is, which flag is his and get it in place before he gets 
there.''

</P>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- German industrialist Konrad Henkel,  
who for five decades oversaw the expansion of his grandfather's 
soap business into a worldwide chemical concern, died Saturday at 
age 83. 
</P>
<P>
	The Henkel Group is the maker of some of Europe's best known  
soap and cosmetic products, including Persil laundry detergent and 
Schwarzkopf hair products. 
</P>
<P>
	Henkel's grandfather, Fritz, founded the business in 1876.  
Henkel took it over in 1961 after the death of his brother Jost, 
and worked to establish the company worldwide. Currently, Henkel 
employs 56,300 people in 70 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A trained chemist, Henkel worked first as a researcher before  
going to work at the family business in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	While pushing the company's expansion, Henkel encouraged  
research on ways to make its products more environmentally safe. 
Under his leadership, the company created substitutes for 
phosphates in its laundry detergent. 
</P>
<P>
	Henkel stepped down in 1980, and the company went public in  
1985. He was named honorary chairman in 1990.

 *Sir Laurence Kirwan    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Laurence Kirwan, who led the Royal Geographic  
Society for three decades and helped organize the first conquest of 
Mt. Everest, died April 16. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	As director and secretary of the society from 1945 to 1975,  
Kirwan was deeply involved in organizing three major expeditions: 
the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic expedition of 1949-52 led 
by John Giaever; the 1953 Everest expedition led by John Hunt; and 
the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1955-57 led by Vivian Fuchs. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving Oxford University without a degree, Kirwan spent a  
season in Egypt working for the British Museum. In 1929, he was 
appointed assistant director of the Egyptian government's 
archaeological survey of Nubia. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1934 to 1937, Kirwan was field director of Oxford  
University expeditions to the Sudan, carrying out excavations of 
the royal tombs of the 4th and 5th centuries A.D. at Ballana and 
Qustal. From 1937 to 1939 he continued extensive fieldwork as 
Tweedie Fellow in Archaeology and Anthropology at Edinburgh 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirwan was co-author, with W.B. Emery, of ``Excavations and  
Survey between Wadi-es-Sebua and Adindan,'' published in 1935, 
detailing the survey's work. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Emery teamed again to write ``Oxford University  
Excavations at Firka'' in 1938, which also led to Kirwan gaining at 
master's degree in literature from Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirwan's association with the two Antarctic expeditions inspired  
his book, ``The White Road,'' published in 1959, which surveyed the 
history of polar exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he retired as director and secretary of the Royal  
Geographical Society in 1975, he continued to edit the Geographic 
Journal for three more years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirwan was knighted in 1972, and received the Knight Cross of  
the Order of St. Olav from Norway in 1975.

	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Shirley Ware, a nurse who later became a

</P>
<P>
	In 1971, Ware joined Health Care Workers Union/SEIU Local 250 as  
the first black female representative since the union formed in 
1934 at San Francisco General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Under her leadership, the union grew by 20,000 members. Its  
46,000 members makes it the nation's second-large health care local 
union behind a counterpart chapter in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Stars Come Out at Penn Relays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With its biggest live audience on hand,  
headliners Marion Jones and Michael Johnson are ready to take 
center stage at the Penn Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Jones and the rest of their Nike teammates plan to hit  
the track today, the final day of the 105th running of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 31,904 braved cold temperatures and thunderstorms  
Friday and sat through delays that hadn't occurred in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet was delayed by lightning, but resumed after a 20-minute  
stoppage. Competition continued for 30 minutes, but had to be 
halted again for 1:20. After another restart, competition continued 
for 1:15. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the program, including the men's and women's  
sprint medley relay finals, was postponed until today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penn Relays, the best-attended meet in the United States,  
was expected to draw upwards of 40,000 for its final day of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too often as American athletes, we can stay home and  
go to a track meet,'' Jones said. ``We love to compete in front of 
all the people, and the Penn Relays is definitely a highlight for 
me and I'm sure probably for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who briefly ignited interest in track and field here at  
home when he starred during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, shared the 
sentiment on this storied meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the greatest track meet in America,'' said  
Johnson, who was scheduled to run with another world champion, 
Maurice Greene, in today's 800-meter relay. ``It's always just a 
great crowd, a knowledgeable crowd about track and field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just fun to be able to walk into a stadium here in  
America for a track meet and see that many people in the stands. 
It's a great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In results from Friday's relays, Seneca Lassiter, the most  
valuable male track athlete in the 1997 Penn Relays, who was 
severely hampered last year by illness and allergies, anchored 
Arkansas to victory in the distance medley relay. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Arkansas' seventh in the distance medley relay  
during the 1990s and its 13th in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, led by Janet Westphal, repeated as women's  
6,000-meter relay champion at 17:37.15, beating BYU by 15 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, which has won the most men's 440 shuttle hurdles  
relays, added its 11th title at 56.35, while LSU's women won their 
third 400 shuttle hurdles relay championship, the first since 1992, 
at 54.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas ended LSU's four-year winning streak in the women's 400  
relay and won the event for the first time since 1989 at 43.33, 
setting Penn Relays and Franklin Field records. The previous record 
for both was 43.42 by LSU last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns' foursome of Kim McGruder, Nanceen Perry, LaKiesha  
White and LaKeisha Backus beat LSU by nearly a second at 44.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the world No. 1 in the 100- and 200-meter races and in  
the long jump, was scheduled to run with Inger Miller, Gail Devers 
and Susanthika Jayasinghe in today's 400-meter Olympic Development 
relay and with Miller, Jayasinghe and Falilat Ogunkoya in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Another world champion Maurice Greene, was scheduled to run in  
the Olympic Development 400 and join Johnson to make up half of the 
Nike entry in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Greene, although the top runners come from the  
United States, there aren't enough chances to show the home folks 
how good they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give us the stages to run, and let us do our jobs,'' he said.  
``If they give us places to run and put out what we need to have a 
good meet, we'll do our jobs. It's up to us to bring in the fan 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was announced Thursday at the opening of the Penn Relays that  
Johnson, who became a household name at the Atlanta Olympics, will 
be a principal attraction in the new Track and Field Association, a 
professional circuit that hopes to improve fan interest in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will debut in June with the TFA Pro Championships in  
Uniondale, N.Y., the site of the track and field competition at 
last year's Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a new venture on the horizon, Johnson and his fellow  
competitors recognize what the tradition of the Penn Relays means 
to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have people who have planned their schedules in the spring  
around the Penn Relays, so it's very important,'' Johnson said. 
``It's a very significant stop on the American circuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of track around the world makes these stars more  
famous elsewhere, compared to at home where they can go virtually 
unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we're seen, the more we're known,'' Greene said.  
``We're seen all the time in Europe, that's why we're so well 
known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If American fans could be enticed to come out, the performers  
are ready to deliver a top product. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it weren't for the fans, there wouldn't be any need for  
us,'' Greene said. ``We go out there and do our jobs, but the fans 
make it that much easier. The fans here at the Penn Relays are just 
great.''

<HEADLINE> Police Discount 'Suicide Note' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Police today discounted what had  
appeared to be the suicide note of a teen-age gunman -- a note that 
dripped with anger at the world and a threat of more violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The note was contained in an e-mail that was received by police  
Thursday or Friday, days after two gunmen turned Columbine High 
School into a killing ground. At first, authorities said they took 
it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	But later, Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis  
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little reason to believe that either one of  
them'' -- Eric Harris, whose name was on the message, or Dylan 
Klebold -- ``had anything to do with sending that e-mail,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purported suicide note blamed parents, teachers and students  
for the massacre, and suggested that more violence could be 
forthcoming on April 26. By way of explanation, it offered the word 
``12Skizto,'' which authorities said came from a song by the group 
Insane Clown Posse. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Kelbold killed 12 students and one teacher before  
shooting themselves Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also are trying to trace the shotguns and semiautomatic  
weapons the teen-agers used. They hope surveillance tapes might 
shed light on whether Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, had any help. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, meanwhile, temporarily withdrew from Columbine in  
order to let the bomb squad search more efficiently today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, authorities released emergency 911 tapes that provide  
the first real-time glimpse into what was happening inside the 
school as the siege began. 
</P>
<P>
	In one tape, a teacher, her voice tight with panic, implored  
police to hurry and tried to keep her students safe as gunfire 
echoed in the background. ``Kids -- JUST STAY DOWN!'' the teacher 
yelled. ``My God -- the gun is right outside my door!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's outside in the hall,'' said the teacher, who was not  
identified. ``There's alarms and things going off and smoke. My God 
-- smoke is coming into this room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From students to teachers to political leaders, the community  
geared up for a weekend of funerals and memorials, including one 
Vice President Al Gore planned to attend. Many in the region still 
struggled to cope. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time passes, and as numbers mount, we tend to depersonalize  
and become less sensitive,'' said Gov. Bill Owens. ``I'll never be 
able to depersonalize this tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family today wrote their goodbyes on the casket of  
Rachel Scott, one of the victims, prior to her funeral. Among the 
messages: ``See you in Heaven,'' ``You are my hero,'' and ``You 
always brought a smile to my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 900 mourners gathered Friday at Foothills Bible Church  
for a memorial service for 16-year-old John Tomlin, who worked 
after school in a gardening store and belonged to a church youth 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are disintegrating, partly because prayer has been  
removed from them,'' said his mother, Doreen Tomlin. 
</P>
<P>
	A makeshift memorial near Columbine has continued to grow, with  
hundreds of bouquets, stuffed animals, signs and cards. One sign 
contained finger-painted images of children's hands. Said another, 
``Silence contributes to moral decay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As mourners grieve, a picture of what went on during the siege's  
initial moments was becoming clearer with the release of the 911 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher had called from the school library, which became the  
scene of the worst carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The school is in a panic and I'm in the library,'' the teacher  
said. ``I've got students down. Kids -- under the table! My kids are 
screaming. Under the table, kids! And my teachers are trying to 
take control of things. We need police here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another call, apparently moments earlier, came from a female  
student. ``I just saw everyone running. I just saw the smoke,'' the 
student said. ``People are saying there's a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived to chaos outside and inside. Tapes released  
Friday of their radio communications revealed that one officer 
spotted a gunman on the southwest end of the school almost 
immediately. ``It's a big gun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, investigators said surveillance tapes from security  
cameras at Columbine may show whether the gunmen had accomplices. 
Although the library had no cameras, police planned to review tapes 
from other cameras around the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally they would show the movement and also the actual  
placement perhaps of some of the explosive devices, prior to the 
incident,'' said sheriff's Lt. John Kiekbusch. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis today said a tape from a cafeteria camera was being  
reviewed by the FBI and local officials. He said there were cameras 
outside the school but it was unclear if they were running during 
daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also interviewed at least 500 people --  
teachers, friends and fellow students, including members of the 
Trenchcoat Mafia, a group of Columbine outcasts who wore black. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Davis said one of the gunmen was found without a  
trenchcoat, which may have spurred witness accounts of a third 
gunman wearing a white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the large amount of explosives and firepower has  
authorities considering the possibility of accomplices, sheriff's 
Lt. Dave Taylor said investigators have not identified specific 
suspects. ``There are a lot of names coming up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another key task is tracing the guns: two sawed-off shotguns, a  
9 mm carbine rifle and a TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol, an assault 
weapon that is now illegal to manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Bettendorf, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms, said tracing the weapons will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``These weapons were originally purchased in the late 1960s or  
early 1970s, and there is no indication they belong to the 
parents,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students and faculty will return to classrooms, though  
not their own, next Thursday. They will share nearby Chatfield High 
School, with Columbine classes taking place in an afternoon split 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County authorities were checking reports that phones  
inside Columbine were programmed to block 911 calls because of 
previous prank emergency calls by students. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools spokeswoman Kay Pride said there were reports some  
students had trouble reaching authorities. A check showed pay 
phones could reach 911 -- as they must under federal law -- but Pride 
said tests haven't yet been run on the internal school system. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a question that hasn't been answered yet,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	David Biegie, spokesman for the phone company U S West, said the  
school's internal system could be set up to block numbers. He said 
students also might not have dialed the correct number to reach an 
outside line. 
</P>
<P>
	One shooting victim, Makai Hall, was discharged from the  
hospital Friday, temporarily in a wheelchair and recovering from a 
bullet wound that shattered his right knee. He said he was ready to 
resume his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting better and a lot of my healing's been done,'' said  
the 16-year-old. ``I'm not going to let it bring me down. I'm going 
to use it to motivate myself.''

<HEADLINE> 'Another World' Fans Fight for Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Will Joe get blamed for Freeman's death? Just  
what mystery does the secret garden hold? And who REALLY shot 
Grant? 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of the NBC daytime drama ``Another World'' had a bigger  
worry at their annual luncheon Saturday than the outcome of those 
ongoing cliffhangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is pulling the plug on 35 years of triumph and  
tragedy in fictional Bay City, Ill. The soap goes off the air June 
25. 
</P>
<P>
	But longtime followers of the Cory, Hudson and Carlino family  
sagas aren't letting their old friends go without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	They protested at NBC studios Saturday morning and have launched  
a letter-writing campaign pleading for network execs to change 
their minds about replacing ``Another World'' with a new soap 
called ``Passions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa called the decision  
``very tough,'' but said the change, coupled with a new morning 
news lineup on NBC, will help the network establish a pattern in 
programming he called ``critical to our success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to lobbying NBC, AW fans are also pitching the show  
to ABC and Fox in hopes one of them might pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens next will be really interesting because now  
it's in the hands of the fans,'' said Victoria Wyndham, whose 
character, Rachel, is the longest-running on AW. Viewers have 
watched for 26 years as she grew from resident witch into the role 
of admired mom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had the rug pulled out from under us, but I don't think  
that NBC is the only outlet in town,'' Wyndham said. ``I'm an 
actor. We believe that you can find a bunny in the hat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her hopes are resting with people like Kerri Isaacson of Newtown  
Square, Pa.; Amelia Georgiana of Hopewell, N.J.; and Harriette 
Grant of New York. The trio of nannies were among the 800 people at 
the New York Hilton for their fan club's first meeting since NBC 
announced it's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgiana, 39, said she started watching the show when she sat  
down with her grandmother one summer afternoon rather than going to 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was it,'' she recalls. And it was 27 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	She has been watching the shenanigans of characters like Grant  
Harrison -- who framed his ex-wife for murder, faked his own death 
and set a fire that nearly killed the police commissioner's wife -- 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's such a deliciously evil character!'' Isaacson gushed.  
``He's just so incredibly morally corrupt, I just love it!''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The briefing, like so many before it in  
recent days, was over. But District Attorney Dave Thomas had 
something more to say -- something other than a fresh factoid about 
the Columbine High School shooting investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Something more personal.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the prosecutorial poker face remained firm, the voice was  
Dave Thomas, citizen -- a man whose children both graduated from 
Columbine, who has spent his entire life in this community, who 
wanted it to be remembered for something other than a day of 
senseless violence that stripped 15 families of loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be some meaning to this,'' the 50-year-old career  
law-enforcement officer said Friday morning. ``These deaths,'' he 
said, ``cannot be in vain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 minutes he talked into the cameras, live across the land  
in his own nationwide bully pulpit. He said America isn't taking 
care of its children. He wondered about video games, movies, 
Dungeons &AMP; Dragons and how they influenced young people. And he 
urged everyone, the media and the public, to join him in finding 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
	He even acknowledged his emotion might be jarring. ``I'm not a  
zealot,'' he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not an important person. I'm not the president. I'm not  
the attorney general. I'm not even the attorney general of 
Colorado. I'm just a person who's very, very concerned about the 
deaths of these people. And I want to do something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors often come across as tough-guy dispassionate, or  
attempt to. But trying times often call for unusual measures, and 
for Jefferson County this is the most trying time of all. 
</P>
<P>
	``To take this horrific situation and turn it into a call for  
responsibility and action is extraordinary -- and should be 
applauded,'' said Ray Slaughter, executive director of the Colorado 
District Attorneys Council, who has known Thomas for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone would do this sort of thing, acquaintances say, it  
would be Dave Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	A sedate man with a thin, angular face and tousled gray hair and  
mustache, Thomas has spent his entire life in Jefferson County. He 
worked as a Denver prosecutor and an assistant U.S. attorney. He 
sent his children, Justin and Carrie, to Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	He became Colorado's head of public safety in 1987, but brought  
his professional life back down the road to this Denver suburb in 
1992 to be elected district attorney. As DA, he started the 
Jefferson County Juvenile Assessment Center, which has been used as 
a national model for dealing with youths in trouble with parents, 
teachers or police. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you saw today was the real Dave Thomas,'' said Bob Grant,  
Thomas' counterpart in Adams County, another collection of 
Denver-area suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think that we get numbed to it,'' Grant said. ``But you  
never get numbed. No matter how many autopsies you attend, no 
matter how many multiple homicide cases you're involved in, you 
never lose the sense of humanity if you're going to do the job 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The week hasn't been easy for anyone involved. Jefferson County  
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said he is having trouble sleeping. 
SWAT team members were spent after Tuesday. Investigators haunted 
by the sight have told Thomas that they, like him, are struggling 
to cope. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's being honest when he says he doesn't have the answers,  
because none of us do,'' said Andrew Cohen, a Denver attorney and 
legal analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Against that backdrop, many say a show of emotion from a  
community leader is candid and appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what a president or a governor -- a leader -- does. This  
is the same sort of reflection, but on a more localized level,'' 
said Joseph Hartzler, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted 
Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	That seemed to be what Thomas was hammering home -- the  
connection between his community and the larger one to which an 
entire nation belongs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These deaths cannot be in vain. We cannot walk away from here  
and wait for the next incident to occur,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want my community ... to be remembered forever as the  
place where that terrible tragedy occurred,'' he said. ``I want it 
to be remembered as the place where we started to change.''

<TEXT>
<P>
        DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Burn struck for two first-half goals  
and goalkeeper Matt Jordan recorded his fourth shutout as the Burn 
beat Columbus 2-0 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
        Midfielder Oscar Pareja opened the scoring in the fourth minute  
with an assist from Dante Washington. It was the first MLS goal for 
the native of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
        Forward Jason Kreis, coming off his second MLS player of the  
week honor, made it 2-0 before halftime on an unassisted goal. After 
a shot by Washington bounced off the post, Crew defenders failed to 
clear it from in front of the goal, leaving Kreis with a clear shot. 
</P>
<P>
        Jordan made nine saves on his way to the shutout.  
</P>
<P>
        ``He had no work in the first half and a lot in the second,  
'' said Burn coach Dave Dir. ``We needed to do a better job defending 
in the second half with a 2-0 lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
        Dallas improved to 4-2. Columbus slipped to 3-2.

<HEADLINE> Friends Mourn Teen Killed in Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They lined up next to the pulpit, aside  
the white casket covered with the felt-tipped signatures and 
farewell wishes that will be buried with her. And one by one, they 
told Littleton and the nation the story of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	On police lists, she was Rachel Scott, 17, victim. But these  
young men and women knew somebody far more resonant: a prom date 
who was trying to quit smoking. An actress and budding playwright 
who talked of decorating the apartment she'd have one day. Rachel 
Joy Scott -- the girl who befriended strangers, the girl with the 
ideal middle name. 
</P>
<P>
	And suddenly she was gone. On Saturday, weeping and hollow-eyed,  
they mourned her in a sad parade, their reminiscences melting 
together into a portrait of a truly extraordinary girl. 
</P>
<P>
	One sobbing blond girl told of how Ms. Scott would always  
jump-start her car in the Columbine High School parking lot. A 
muscular boy said he wished he could have protected her. Her 
handsome prom date, Nick Baumgart, thanked her for sharing her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``A truer friend you couldn't find,'' said Baumgart, who took  
her to the prom just a week ago. ``You could be having the worst 
day of your entire life. All she had to do was smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott was one of 12 students slain by Dylan Klebold and Eric  
Harris in their rampage through Columbine on Tuesday. Her funeral 
was held at Trinity Christian Center, a church less than a 
half-mile from Columbine. Its front door affords a clear view of 
the school library. 
</P>
<P>
	Her teachers remembered a dedication and verve that elevated her  
from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so proud of that girl. She was talented and beautiful,  
and I know that she's with us still,'' said Paula Reed, Ms. Scott's 
forensics teacher. ``But she took part of me with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The choreographed funeral, complete with a montage of family  
pictures from Ms. Scott's earlier childhood and happier times, 
featured a continuous tape loop of Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go 
On,'' the ``Titanic'' theme song. 
</P>
<P>
	In one picture, Ms. Scott mugged with a fedora and bright  
lipstick; another showed her grinning with friends, her face 
flushed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of teens in the audience wiped streaming tears from their  
faces and dropped their heads into their hands. One diminutive girl 
buried her head in the burly shoulder of her companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends signed Ms. Scott's closed casket by the dozen in black  
felt-tip marker, leaving their words with her permanently. Some 
promised they'd see her in heaven. ``You are my hero,'' one wrote. 
Others tried to make sense of the death. Her parents simply said 
goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honey, you are everything a mother could ask the Lord for in a  
daughter. I love you so much!'' her mother wrote. And from her 
father: ``I love you. Dad. Forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scott, friends said, knew her own mind. She was a spirited  
actress in school plays, a devout Christian who wanted to go on a 
mission this summer to Africa. And she had a playful streak a mile 
wide. If she wanted to wear a sailor hat or pajama bottoms to 
school, why not? 
</P>
<P>
	With a mischievous smile and eyebrows arched in a knowing look,  
she could pull it off, said Heidi Johnson, her friend since fourth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she liked it, she would wear it,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``She  
didn't care what other people thought of her. She just wanted to be 
true to herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day, she showed up at school with especially strange attire  
-- for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just wanted to see how people responded to her. She wanted  
to know who here true friends were,'' Ms. Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, she cut her shoulder-length light-brown hair, shaving  
it in back, dying it darker and adding highlights -- her fun look. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked cute on her,'' Ms. Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Early last week, Ms. Johnson and Ms. Scott saw each other and  
made plans to get together after school one day soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the last time Ms. Johnson saw her friend alive.

<HEADLINE> Students Pay Homage to Dead Teen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- In stocking feet, teen-ager after  
teen-ager entered Cassie Bernall's bedroom, glimpsing pieces of a 
life cut short. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue sparkly nail polish. Black woolen clogs. Pictures of  
kittens. Clothes on the floor. A love poem on the wall. A teacher's 
note, ``I cannot see how you missed the purpose of the assignment 
completely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mourners were a busload of friends from the 17-year-old's  
church youth group. In all, 40 teen-agers went late Friday to pay 
their respects to her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve of the visiting students were at Columbine when the  
shootings took place. They had been forced to flee, stepping over 
bodies to escape, or hide in closets. Their friend Cassie was among 
those who didn't make it out alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's in good hands,'' said one girl, breaking the silence,  
after stooping to examine photos on the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bus, members of the group looked and acted like typical  
teen-agers. After the visit, some threw snowballs at the church's 
donated, pale military green bus parked down the street. Teen-agers 
inside shrieked and taunted them. 
</P>
<P>
	But before they approached the house, some held hands and  
slapped shoulders. Some hugged. Others were bleary from crying. As 
they entered, the 40 took off their shoes so they wouldn't track 
snow from that day's storm through the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Some closed their eyes and mouthed the words to Christian music  
that blared over the roar of the bus. Some shed tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver, group leader and pastor David McPherson, said:  
``Death is not our friend, but it is our companion. It's always 
hanging around.''

<HEADLINE>  Crowd Rallies for Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With a bullhorn in hand, Obanion Gordon  
wanted to make sure his message Saturday was loud and clear: A 
corrupt legal system put former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal on 
death row, not the bullet that killed a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state has always lynched black males, especially black  
males who have been passionate about the liberations of their 
people,'' said Gordon as he led 30 protesters over a bridge from 
Camden, N.J., into Philadelphia on Abu-Jamal's 45th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's group was among more than 3,000 people who traveled  
from as far away as France to demand a new trial for Abu-Jamal, who 
was convicted in the 1981 death of police Officer Daniel Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
	Three groups of protesters marched with police escorts to City  
Hall, where more than 50 people were scheduled to speak. The 
peaceful rally drew a crowd smaller than organizers had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has been on Pennsylvania's death row since 1982, when  
he was convicted of shooting Faulkner after coming upon his brother 
struggling with the officer after a traffic stop. Faulkner also 
wounded Abu-Jamal, and the two were found bleeding a few feet from 
each other with Abu-Jamal's gun lying nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	No execution date has been set.  
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system -- and  
efforts to win a new trial -- have made him a worldwide celebrity. 
He has contended that his conviction sprung from a biased judge and 
an ineffective counsel, which have become focal points for death 
penalty critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say Abu-Jamal, who has never given his version of  
events, was framed in Faulkner's slaying because he was a black 
activist who supported the radical MOVE organization and helped 
found Philadelphia's chapter of the Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's conviction was upheld in 1989 by the state Supreme  
Court. In 1995, it also let stand a ruling that denied a new trial 
he sought based on new evidence. His lawyers have said they will 
appeal the decision.

<HEADLINE> Friends Say John Elway To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway, the master of the late-game rally, has  
apparently run out of comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity Friday told The  
Associated Press the 38-year-old Elway has told family and friends 
that he won't be back for the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway led the Denver Broncos to Super Bowl victories the past  
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post also cited  
unidentified sources who said Elway's retirement was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway considered making an announcement this past week, but  
delayed it, sources said, first because Broncos owner Pat Bowlen 
was out of town, and then because of the school shootings in 
suburban Denver on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said Elway could announce his retirement as early as  
Monday. He was out of town Friday and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano said he could not confirm the  
reports until he heard from Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, during the NFL draft, Broncos coach Mike Shanahan  
said he expected Elway to make his decision known before the team's 
minicamp, which opens April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous for improbable late-game magic, Elway rallied his team  
with 47 game-saving drives in his career, more than any quarterback 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's retirement is the third in four months of a transcendent  
figure in sports, following Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls just before the  
lockout-shortened NBA season started in January, and Gretzky 
announced last week that he was retiring following the New York 
Rangers' last regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway considered retiring after winning his first Super Bowl in  
January 1998. Four months later, he elected to return for another 
season but said he was 99.9 percent sure it would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	Last January, after winning a second Super Bowl as well as the  
game's MVP award, he hedged slightly, saying the possibility of an 
unprecedented third straight title had thrown a ``kink'' in his 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	With Elway's departure, the Broncos will turn to veteran Bubby  
Brister, who had a 4-0 record as a starter last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who turns 39 on June 28, compiled the best passer rating  
of his career in 1998, but the season was interrupted by hamstring, 
back and rib injuries that caused him to uncharacteristically miss 
all or part of six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his toughness, durability and productivity may never be  
equaled. Nor may his ability to rally a team to victory in the 
final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	In perhaps his best-known comeback, he directed a 98-yard drive  
in the final five minutes to tie the 1986 AFC Championship game in 
Cleveland. The Broncos won the game in overtime and went on to 
Elway's first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 16 seasons, Elway guided his team to more victories (148)  
than any other quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 51,475 
yards and accounted for 54,882 total yards -- second only to Miami's 
Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only player to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for 200  
yards in seven straight seasons (1985-91). 
</P>
<P>
	He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and was named the NFL's MVP in  
1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season and postseason records. 
</P>
<P>
	But until late in his career, one goal consistently eluded  
Elway. He suffered through three increasingly lopsided Super Bowl 
losses and, at 37, had begun to wonder if he would get another 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	He got two.  
</P>
<P>
	The first came on Jan. 25, 1998, in San Diego against the  
defending champion Green Bay Packers. Despite mediocre statistics, 
Elway set the tone by scrambling and diving into two defenders for 
a first down to set up a Denver touchdown late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the closing minutes, Elway accounted for his 45th game-saving  
drive, completing a 23-yard pass to Howard Griffith to help set up 
Terrell Davis' go-ahead scoring run in the 31-24 victory.	   ``I know that I've been labeled as the guy who's never been on 
the winning Super Bowl team,'' a jubilant Elway said. ``Boy, am I 
glad to get rid of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 31, he earned Super Bowl MVP honors in leading the  
Broncos past the Atlanta Falcons 34-19 in Miami. With the Falcons 
intent on stopping Davis and daring Elway to beat them, he 
completed 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway became the first quarterback to start in five Super Bowls,  
and the Broncos' 23-10 win over the New York Jets in the AFC 
championship game two weeks earlier gave him a 5-1 record in 
conference championship games -- the best in NFL history.

<HEADLINE> William Blake Book Brings $2.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of eight known copies of William Blake's  
``The First Book of Urizen'' -- a volume so rare one professor spent 
35 years looking for it -- sold at Sotheby's auction house on Friday 
for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It was thought to be the highest price ever paid for a piece of  
English literature, said Selby Kiffer, Sotheby's senior vice 
president. The book was originally expected to sell for no more 
than $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume was sold to an anonymous bidder.  
</P>
<P>
	Blake's book, printed in 1794, was part of socialite Betsey  
Cushing Whitney's estate being auctioned off at Sotheby's through 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The edition's 24 color etchings by Blake are what make it so  
unusual. They include powerful images of a man surrounded by flames 
and another in shackles, and were each printed from a single copper 
plate Blake painted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each page has a picture,'' said Jerry Bentley, a leading Blake  
scholar. ``It is a very, very beautiful book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bentley began searching for the book in 1963, phoning anyone who  
might have inherited it and searching through desks of its former 
owner in case the rare find had been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's auction, several parties shared the professor's  
enthusiasm enough to stay in the bidding war well past the $1 
million mark, something Kiffer said was unusual in itself. Bentley 
did not make a bid for the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items included a collection of letters sent by Oscar Wilde  
to Helena ``Nellie'' Sickerts, the sister of artist Walter Richard 
Sickerts. They sold to an anonymous bidder for $51,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Another set of letters -- from Claude Monet to his wife, Alice --  
sold for $21,850. A fragment of Thomas Wolfe's ``Look Homeward 
Angel,'' went for $79,500.

<HEADLINE> Indians, Red Sox Back to Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After a night of baseball that more closely  
resembled a WWF wrestling match, gave way to normalcy Saturday when 
the Boston Red Sox beat the Cleveland Indians 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an isolated incident,'' Indians manger Mike  
Hargrove said before the game, referring to two bench-clearing 
fights in Cleveland's 7-6 victory on Friday night. ``I didn't see 
any bad blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That stuff that happened last night is a part of the game.''  
</P>
<P>
	After giving up a leadoff homer to Troy O'Leary in the fifth  
inning and putting the next two Red Sox hitters on base, Indians 
starter Jaret Wright set off the first brawl by hitting Darren 
Lewis in the right shoulder to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw a curveball to Darren and I guess he thought it was a  
fastball,'' Wright said. ``He said something, I said something, and 
you saw what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and Wright exchanged words, and Lewis charged the mound.  
Both benches and bullpens cleared, and Lewis and Wright were 
ejected after punches were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't blame Darren Lewis at all,'' said Indians third  
baseman Travis Fryman. Once you've been hit in the head, you 
remember it. Your first reaction is anger,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright previously hit Lewis in the head in Game 1 of last year's  
division series. Both players also were ejected then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Jaret Wright is a headhunter,'' Hargrove said.  
``I don't think he hit Darren Lewis on purpose this time or last 
year in the playoffs. Jaret is a good kid and a very competitive 
pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams implied that American League pitchers are more apt to  
throw at hitters because they don't have to hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of it has to do with the designated hitter.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the top of the sixth, reliever Rheal Cormier hit Jim Thome in  
retaliation with a pitch in the ribs, setting off the second brawl 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching inside is part of the evolution of the game,'' said  
Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``In the 50's and 60's, 
hitters weren't as strong as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now hitters are bigger and stronger and have to decide which  
side of the plate they want. They can't have both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the second melee, Hargrove and Williams had words, and  
Williams was restrained by Pedro Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you anything that was said because I couldn't  
hear him,'' Hargrove said. ``The question I asked him was, 'Why all 
this over a breaking ball?' I wondered why all the brouhaha over a 
breaking ball. When I got back to the bench, (coach) Jeff Newman 
reminded me Jaret hit Lewis last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who spent 12 years in the major leagues, said he had  
been hit in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a fun thing to have happen,'' he said. ``I don't  
think there is any room in this game for headhunting.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton NATO Text-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON: Yes, ma'am.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. President, how much of a guarantee can countries  
in the southeast Europe region get that they will actually be an 
important part of the reconstruction once the Kosovo conflict is 
over? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, that is what we will deal with tomorrow when we  
meet with the leaders of all those nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week I went to San Francisco to speak to the American  
newspaper editors, to outline what I believe is an essential part 
of the long-term solution to the problems of the Balkans and 
southeast Europe generally. They are not yet sufficiently a part of 
the future we all imagine for Europe in the 21st century, which is 
not only peace and stability, but also prosperity and shared 
decision making. 
</P>
<P>
	So my view is that we should do more to draw those nations  
closer to one another, to give them a positive reason to work 
together and to properly treat the ethnic minorities within their 
borders, and work out ways for them to participate in the life of 
their country, as well as to maintain their own religious and 
cultural traditions. And we should work out ways for the nations of 
that region to relate more closely to all the European 
institutions, and to Canada and the United States in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	So to me, this will not work over the long ride. If you don't  
want to see this repeated -- what we're doing now -- it is not enough 
to defeat this moment of aggression, and to reverse it, and to send 
the Kosovars back home. 
</P>
<P>
	We are going to have to create an alternative, positive future.  
</P>
<P>
	We know what the history of ethnic animosity in the Balkans is.  
We know that there is not a single ethnic group, even the Serbs, 
who cannot cite some historic example of legitimate grievance but 
can be manipulated by an unscrupulous politician. 
</P>
<P>
	So what we need, with all these magnets pulling the people  
apart, we need a powerful set of magnets pulling the people 
together, and those have to be economic, as well as political, and 
security; so the NATO open-door policy, the European Union's 
open-door policy, the prospect of new cooperation with all of the 
states of southeastern Europe among themselves, and with Europe, 
and the United States and Canada: I think this a very, very 
important thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the long run, we have to do this -- we have to create a  
positive future for this part of Europe if we want to avoid being 
in the very position we are in today, again, in a few years, in 
another place. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Larry.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. President, there seems to be a great deal of  
concern about the oil embargo that NATO has endorsed. The French 
express a concern, that is military force is used to enforce, it 
would amount to an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm wondering, do you agree with that with that assessment? And  
are you concerned that, on one hand, you're encouraging the 
Russians to try to negotiate a settlement, and on the other hand, 
then you'd be caught in the middle of an oil embargo clash? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, of course, I hope that won't happen. But let me  
tell you where we're coming from. We sent our pilots into the air 
to destroy the oil refinery and supply systems of Serbia, and they 
did so successfully. They risked their lives to do it. How can we 
justify risking the lives of the pilots to go up and destroy the 
refinery and the supply capacity of Serbia and then say but it's 
okay with us if people want to continue to supply this nation and 
its outlaw actions in Kosovo in another way? 
</P>
<P>
	So what we have done is we've asked our ministers of defense to  
come up with a plan that will apply in an evenhanded way. 
Obviously, we don't expect it to and we will not do anything to try 
to see that it leads to violence. But we have to be firm about it. 
And if we want this campaign to succeed with economic and political 
pressure and with the air action, then we have to take every 
reasonable means to give it a chance to succeed, and that's what we 
intend to do. Yes, sir? 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Former Prime Minister Franz Vranitzky was proposed by  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is a possible candidate for a peace 
mission to Kosovo. Would you kindly explain to us whether this has 
your approval and what you would expect from such a mission. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I can't respond to your specific question for a  
very simple reason. I did not know which individuals were being 
considered by the secretary-general until, oh, a couple of hours 
ago. So I have no direct -- I've had no direct communication with 
the secretary-general, nor have I even discussed it with the 
members of my staff. 
</P>
<P>
	I have, as it happens, known Mr. Vranitzky for many years. I  
knew him before I was president, before I was a candidate for 
president. I have an enormously high regard for him personally, but 
in order to make a judgment about that, I would have to have a 
clear idea about exactly what it is -- what is the mission and what 
would be the parameters. 
</P>
<P>
	So I can't really comment on the specifics, but I do have a very  
high regard for him personally. I think he is an excellent man. 
Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President.  
</P>
<P>
	Mr. President, a lot of people have clear understanding when you  
authorize bombing missions against military targets, tanks, armor, 
military headquarters. But they have a little bit more difficulty 
understanding why you would authorize bombing Serb television in 
the middle of the night, knowing there are journalists working 
there, knowing there are cleaning crews there, knowing these people 
have no choice but to work there, and also knowing that within a 
matter of hours Serb TV would be back on the air from other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	So the question is: What goes through your mind, knowing you're  
going to, in effect, authorize the killing of these people for 
questionable military gains? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Our military leaders at NATO believe, based on what  
they have seen and what others in the area have told them, that the 
Serb television is an essential instrument of Mr. Milosevic's 
command and control. 
</P>
<P>
	He uses it to spew hatred and to basically spread  
disinformation. He does not use it to show all the Kosovar villages 
he's burned, to show the mass graves, to show the children that 
have been raped by the soldiers that he sent there. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not, in a conventional sense, therefore, a media outlet.  
That was a decision they made, and I did not reverse it, and I 
believe I did the right thing in not reversing that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, sir.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) that practically legitimates NATO action  
beyond the borders. How far geographically NATO will go? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: I don't think it's a geographical issue. I think that  
what we tried to do was to say that there are some things which can 
occur in Europe in nonmember nations that can affect the security 
and stability of all of Europe, including NATO members. And I think 
the language should speak for itself.

<HEADLINE> Revolution 3, United 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ivan McKinley scored two first-half goals as  
the New England Revolution edged D.C. United 3-2 on Saturday night, 
halting a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Giovanni Savarese had a goal and an assist for New England  
(2-3), which beat the United for the fourth time in 11 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter and A.J. Wood scored for D.C. (3-2), which lost its  
second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. played without goalkeeper Tom Presthus, who was been  
sidelined with a virus that has caused him to lose 15 pounds. 
Presthus' replacement, Mark Simpson, was undone by poor defensive 
play that led to a 3-1 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Rich Grady issued seven yellow cards, four to New  
England, and the United played the final 14 minutes a man down 
after Carlos Llamosa was ejected for tackling New England's Johnny 
Torres from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter gave D.C. a 1-0 lead in the 26th minute, taking a lead  
pass from Marco Etcheverry at the top of the penalty area. Lassiter 
evaded a tackle at the top of the crease and forced Revolution 
goalie Walter Zegna down before sliding the ball into an empty net 
for his team-high fifth goal 
</P>
<P>
	New England tied the game five minutes later on McKinley's first  
goal, which began a barrage that saw the Revolution convert three 
consecutive shots in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley knotted the score from the left side of the penalty  
area, where he got a step on defender Eddie Pope and looped a long 
shot past Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defensive miscue by Pope led to Savarese's goal in the  
37th minute. Pope didn't stay close enough to Savarese on a run 
down the middle and Savarese was able to punch the ball past 
Simpson despite falling flat on his back 15 feet in front of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley made it 3-1 in the 45th minute. Moving through the far  
left side of the penalty area, he knocked a header off Brian 
Dunseth's free kick from just inside the midfield line. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood notched his first goal of the season in the 87th minute.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Book Tour Hits Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Apparently rattled by a couple of  
tough interviews, Monica Lewinsky's publicist says the former White 
House intern is done with American reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	After a grilling by Matt Lauer on NBC's ``Today'' show Friday,  
Lewinsky left the studio and canceled an interview she promised to 
ABC News Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Brickhouse of St. Martin's Press -- the company that  
published ``Monica's Story'' and has sponsored Lewinsky's book tour 
-- later told The Washington Post that Lewinsky would complete 
appearances in Miami, New Orleans, and Dallas this week, but 
planned no more interviews in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Lewinsky's spokesperson nor one for NBC immediately  
returned telephone messages left by The Associated Press, but 
Brickhouse told the Post that the interview with Lauer ``was very 
emotional'' for Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just felt like she was not prepared that they were going  
to ask those kinds of questions,'' Brickhouse said in Saturday's 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauer asked her if she understood that her affair with President  
Clinton brought the country to a halt for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	And why, Lauer asked, if she says she doesn't want to ``make a  
career out of being Monica Lewinsky,'' did she attend the Vanity 
Fair Academy Awards party. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a smiling Lewinsky signed nearly 1,000 books for  
throngs of people who waited in line outside Coral Gables bookstore 
for hours.

<HEADLINE> Clinton NATO Text-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's statement and news conference  
Saturday at the NATO 50th anniversary summit, transcribed by the 
Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to read a brief statement,  
after which we will entertain questions, alternating from the 
American press corps and from the international press corps here. 
</P>
<P>
	We have just about completed the first two days of our NATO  
meeting, welcoming new members, adopting very important changes to 
make NATO operations more relevant and more effective in meeting 
the new challenges of the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	We also reaffirmed our determination on Kosovo to get the Serb  
forces out, to get the refugees back home, under the protection of 
an international security force, moving toward self-government. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday, we sent a strong message of support to the front-line  
states, who have risked and sacrificed so very much in this crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO will respond to any actions by Serbia against its neighbors  
as a result of NATO presence on their territory during this crisis 
or to any move to undermine the democratically elected government 
of Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	We also expressed our support for a genuine democratic  
transition in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	For five years now we have been working to build a new NATO  
prepared to deal with the security challenges of the new century. 
Today, we have reaffirmed our readiness and appropriate 
circumstances to address regional and ethnic conflicts beyond the 
territory of NATO members. 
</P>
<P>
	I am pleased that our strategic concept specifically endorses  
the actions such as those we are undertaking in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, this afternoon, we will meet with President Kuchma to  
advance our cooperation with Ukraine. Tonight and tomorrow we will 
gather with 23 of NATO's partner nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership for peace launched in 1994, the Euro-Atlantic  
partnership started in 1997, have clearly exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen partner nations are now serving with NATO in Bosnia. Our  
forces have conducted literally hundreds of exercises with forces 
from partner countries. These are the nations of central and 
eastern Europe and the Caucasus in central Asia, whose futures are 
clearly intertwined with ours. 
</P>
<P>
	Our lives also recognizes the tremendous importance of Russia to  
Europe's future. And we are determined to support Russia's 
transition to stronger democracy and more effective free markets 
and to strengthen our partnership with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	We worked closely with Russia for a peaceful solution for Kosovo  
in Rambouillet. 
</P>
<P>
	While our allied nations all agreed that the offer Mr. Milosevic  
has apparently made to former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin on 
Thursday was inadequate, nevertheless we welcome Russia's efforts 
and hope they will continue and ultimately result in Serb agreement 
to our conditions, so that we can reverse the ethnic cleansing in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	That concludes my statement.  
</P>
<P>
	Go ahead, Sandra.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) more tanks and more troops to the Balkans,  
American reserves will be called up, NATO may well end up searching 
ships as part of an oil embargo, and still Milosevic is not backing 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	What specific assurances can you give the American people that  
we are not drifting into a long and endless conflict with no end in 
sight? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, we're not drifting. We are moving forward with a  
strategy that I believe strongly will succeed -- one that we have 
reaffirmed here and intensified. I think the important thing for 
everyone to understand is that in order for this strategy to 
succeed, we need two things. One, vigorous execution, and two, 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	Keep in mind, we now know from the evidence that has come out  
that the campaign Mr. Milosevic and the Serb leaders have carried 
against the people of Kosovo was planned in detail last year. It 
was not executed in October in no small measure because of the 
threat of action by NATO. It was executed when we began our air 
campaign. They have 40,000 troops in and around Kosovo and almost 
300 tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes time to reverse that, but we are working on it and we  
will prevail if we execute well with real determination and if we 
have the patience. I would remind all of you that this may seem 
like a long time. I don't think that this air campaign has been 
going on a particularly long time. In the Persian Gulf, there were 
44 days of bombing before there was any kind of land action. And 
the land was flatter, the targets were clearer, the weather was 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	We're doing what needs to be done here with great vigor, and I  
am convinced we will prevail if we have the patience. We have to be 
prepared not only to execute with determination but to pay the 
price of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. Secretary General (OFF-MIKE) on the European  
pillar in NATO. Are you satisfied that the outcome in the statement 
will not allow a split to occur between the European forces and the 
American forces, and specifically, what role will the Western 
European Union, WEU, play? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all, I think the language speaks for  
itself. Europe will have to decide exactly how to constitute this 
force and also how to make it effective. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the things I think that will receive nearly no publicity  
during this meeting, obviously because of the dominance -- the 
appropriate dominance of Kosovo in the news, is the document we 
adopted today that deals with the European security initiative but 
also deals with what we can do to make all of our efforts more 
effective, including enhancing the defense capabilities of all of 
our allies. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as this operation, however it's constituted by the  
Europeans, operates within in cooperation with NATO, I think it 
will strengthen the capability of the alliance, and I think it will 
actually help to maintain America's involvement with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	We have members of the Congress here today that -- Senator Roth  
sitting here on the front row has been one of the strongest 
supporters of our partnership with NATO and our European allies. 
But I believe this is a very, very positive thing. The details are 
for the Europeans to decide and you should ask them that. But as 
long as it's consistent with the Berlin principle, that is 
separable but not separate from NATO, I think it will work very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: (OFF MIKE) the build up of American troops and allied  
troops in Macedonia and Albania, seem to have smacked of the 
potential intervention, this military intervention, just by ground 
troops, all your protestations. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Is that a question.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: That's a question.  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: The...  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: I mean, is that...  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	(UNKNOWN): She doesn't know what she's talking about...  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: No. The short answer is no. Let me remind you we are in  
Macedonia and Albania to try to help them, two very brave countries 
with very strong-willed leaders, operating under extreme duress. 
We're trying to help them manage a massive refugee problem. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Albania, we have troops there also to secure the  
helicopter operation we have put in there, and to make sure that we 
can secure not only as it's moved in, but as it becomes 
operational.

<HEADLINE> Russia Objects to NATO Oil Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO ran into defiant objections from Russia  
and questions from its own members Saturday about enforcing an oil 
embargo against Yugoslavia by searching ships at sea. President 
Clinton urged Americans to be patient with the bombing strategy in 
the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that this air campaign has been going on for a  
particularly long time,'' the president said. The allies must be 
willing to prosecute the war with determination and ``pay the price 
of time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day of their summit, NATO leaders said military  
commanders were laying plans under orders issued Friday night for 
sea searches to ``switch off the oil tap'' fueling Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic's military machine. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia, angry about 32 days of airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia, indicated it would ignore an embargo. ``According to 
international law, sanctions cannot be imposed unless they are 
approved by the (U.N.) Security Council,'' Russian Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov said on a trip to Egypt. ``We will continue delivering 
oil in keeping with our international commitments.'' Russia and 
Libya are Yugoslavia's key oil suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Moscow, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said  
the world ``may slip toward a third world war, the final war'' as a 
result of NATO's bombing. Chernomyrdin, Russia's mediator on 
Kosovo, also said he had received invitations from the leaders of 
several NATO countries to discuss his recent efforts to end the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about stopping ships also were heard at the summit.  
``According to international rules, it is an act of war'' to stop 
and forcibly search ships on the seas, French President Jacques 
Chirac said. ``So we must be very cautious.'' He said France 
supports NATO's determination to prevent any material useful to 
Yugoslav military forces from reaching them and he urged all 
democratic nations to support the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton defended the idea of searches, saying it was  
unreasonable to ask pilots to risk their lives attacking oil depots 
when Milosevic could get fuel from ships. Clinton said he did not 
expect that sea searches would lead to violence ``but we have to be 
firm about it'' and ``take every reasonable means'' to ensure the 
success of any embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance would do  
``whatever is in our means and our capabilities'' to enforce such 
an embargo. He said he hoped it would not be necessary to challenge 
Russian ships. Solana would not state a legal basis for 
interdicting ships at sea, but he told reporters, ``I will give you 
an answer before I leave Washington tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a naval embargo took center stage on a day that NATO  
leaders were agreeing to enlarge the alliance's mission so as to 
confront crises beyond its borders -- such as other Kosovos -- and to 
intensify the battle against ethnic conflict, terrorism and weapons 
of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also brought up the three American servicemen captured  
by Serb forces. He complained that Milosevic has denied the 
soldiers Red Cross visits while telling American television 
audiences he would permit them. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders -- each sitting beside his foreign minister -- met  
around a massive pentagonal table, the center filled with folds of 
blue fabric gathered together by a gold star, an arrangement 
resembling the NATO flag. The talks were held in the Mellon 
auditorium where, 50 years ago, President Truman led allies in 
signing NATO's founding treaty, pledging a one-for-all, all-for-one 
common defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit expanded beyond the 19 NATO countries to include  
leaders of 23 nations in a partnership with the alliance. They all 
were invited to the White House for dinner under a huge tent on the 
South Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite objections from Russia to NATO expansion, the leaders  
agreed to leave the door open to more new members. The alliance 
expanded to 19 countries this year with the inclusion of former 
Russian satellites Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	At an afternoon news conference, Clinton said the month of  
airstrikes against Yugoslavia might seem long to some, but he noted 
that allies bombed Iraq for 44 days before beginning a ground 
assault. He said ``it takes time'' to force Serb forces from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not drifting,'' Clinton asserted. ``We are moving  
forward with a strategy that I believe strongly will succeed.'' He 
said, ``I am convinced we will prevail if we have the patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said NATO's new blueprint -- its first update since 1991  
-- would permit the alliance to ``advance security and freedom for 
another 50 years by enhancing our capacity to address conflicts 
beyond our borders, by protecting our citizens from terrorism and 
weapons of mass destruction, by deepening our partnerships with 
other nations and helping new members enter through NATO's open 
doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acting on instructions issued late Friday by defense ministers,  
NATO military commanders began drafting plans to search ships in 
the Adriatic Sea as part of an oil embargo against Milosevic. 
German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said ships suspected of 
carrying petroleum products would be stopped and searched at harbor 
entry and turned back if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without oil, the Yugoslav military machine will come to a halt  
and very quickly,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said. He said the 
alliance believes Yugoslavia's two oil refining facilities -- at 
Pancevo and Novi Sad -- ``are out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said the searches of ships would ``tighten the taps, switch  
off the oil tap completely. And I heard this morning that the Serbs 
are now going around to all of the abandoned refugees' cars -- and 
there are many of them inside of Kosovo -- and are siphoning the 
petrol out of the tanks. I mean, they are that desperate now to 
find fuel wherever they can that they are going to those extreme 
measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Konrad Freytag, NATO's military briefer, said the alliance  
had struck during the preceding 24 hours at targets in Serbia and 
at Yugoslav forces on the ground in Kosovo. Targets included 
command-and-control facilities, including two radio relay and 
television transmission towers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After expressing determination to prevail over Milosevic and  
require his troops to leave Kosovo, the leaders turned to the task 
of redefining NATO's missions for the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Their agreement took into account concerns in Europe that the  
United States was advocating a global role for NATO, U.S. officials 
said. There was an understanding that the challenges NATO would 
address would fall in the broad European theater, although U.S. 
officials said the vague language did not explicitly rule out 
involvement elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Man Shot After Holding Son Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIVE POINTS, Ala. (AP) -- Police shot a man who told authorities  
he had to decapitate his 4-year-old son to keep from going to hell. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Lindsey, 39, was killed Friday at his home after a standoff  
of nearly three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The standoff began when Lindsey's mother told authorities that  
he was threatening to kill himself and his son, said Lt. Larry 
Flippo, the Alabama Bureau of Investigation agent in charge. She 
said Lindsey told her he was going to take the child to heaven with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lawrence County Sheriff's deputy Nathan Reeves went to the  
home, Lindsey came to the door and began swinging a sword at 
Reeves, who threatened him with a shotgun, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey came outside with the boy holding what appeared to be a  
shotgun and the sword to his son's throat, officials said. Soon 
after, a SWAT team stormed the house and Lindsey met them waving 
the sword. He was shot and died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was unharmed.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Washington Declaration Text </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the Washington Declaration, signed and issued by the  
heads of state and government at the NATO summit: 
</P>
<P>
	1. We, the heads of state and government of the member countries  
of the North Atlantic Alliance, declare for a new century our 
mutual commitment to defend our people, our territory and our 
liberty, founded on democracy, human rights and the rule of law. 
The world has changed dramatically over the last half century, but 
our common values and interests remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
	2. At this anniversary summit, we affirm our determination to  
continue advancing these goals, building on the habits of trust and 
cooperation we have developed over 50 years. Collective defense 
remains the core purpose of NATO. We affirm our commitment to 
promote peace, stability and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	3. We pay tribute to the men and women who have served our  
Alliance and who have advanced the cause of freedom. To honor them 
and to build a better future, we will contribute to building a 
stronger and broader Euro-Atlantic community of democracies -- a 
community where human rights and fundamental freedoms are upheld; 
where borders are increasingly open to people, ideas and commerce; 
where war becomes unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
	4. We reaffirm our faith, as stated in the North Atlantic  
Treaty, in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United 
Nations to reiterate our desire to live in peace with all nations, 
and to settle any international dispute by peaceful means. 
</P>
<P>
	5. We must be effective in the future in dealing with new  
challenges as we were in the past. We are charting NATO's course as 
we enter the 21st century: an Alliance committed to collective 
defense, capable of addressing current and future risks to our 
security, strengthened by and open to new members and working 
together with other institutions, Partners and Mediterranean 
Dialogue countries in a mutually reinforcing way to enhance 
Euro-American security and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	6. NATO embodies the vital partnership between Europe and North  
America. We welcome the further impetus that has been given to the 
strengthening of European defense capabilities to enable the 
European Allies to act more effectively together, thus reinforcing 
the trans-Atlantic partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	7. We remain determined to stand firm against those who violate  
human rights, wage war and conquer territory. We will maintain both 
the political solidarity and the military forces necessary to 
protect our nations and to meet the security challenges of the next 
century. We pledge to improve our defense capabilities to fulfill 
the full range of the Alliance's 21st century missions. We will 
continue to build confidence and security through arms control, 
disarmament and nonproliferation measures. We reiterate our 
condemnation of terrorism and our determination to protect 
ourselves against this scourge. 
</P>
<P>
	8. Our Alliance remains open to all European democracies,  
regardless of geography, willing and able to meet the 
responsibilities of membership, and whose inclusion would enhance 
overall security and stability in Europe. NATO is an essential 
pillar of a wider community of shared values and shared 
responsibility. Working together, Allies and Partners, including 
Russia and Ukraine, are developing their cooperation and erasing 
the divisions imposed by the Cold War to help to build a Europe 
whole and free, where security and prosperity are shared and 
indivisible. 
</P>
<P>
	9. Fifty years after NATO's creation, the destinies of North  
America and Europe remain inseparable. When we act together, we 
safeguard our freedom and security and enhance stability more 
effectively than any of us could alone. Now, and for the century 
about to begin, we declare as the fundamental objectives of this 
Alliance enduring peace, security and liberty for all people of 
Europe and North America.

<HEADLINE>  Schrader Wins Talladega Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- Kenny Schrader doesn't get excited about  
winning poles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to start up front, but what we really want to do is  
finish there,'' Schrader said Friday after leading the qualifying 
for the DieHard 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrader now has 23 poles in his Winston Cup career, but only  
four victories -- the first of which came on this same 2.66-mile, 
high-banked track on July 31, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that win, though, Schrader's overall record in races at  
Talladega has not been very successful, with only four other 
top-five finishes in 28 starts at NASCAR's longest and fastest 
oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can (win),'' Schrader said. ``There's a lot of guys that  
can. You just have to stay out of trouble all day, and that ain't 
easy at this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for winning the pole with a lap of 197.765 mph, Schrader gave  
most of the credit to his crew and his Chevrolet, the same car in 
which he won the pole here last October, then qualified third and 
finished sixth in the Daytona 500 in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driver didn't do much today,'' he said. ``It makes a big  
difference what kind of ride you have. The guys at the shop had the 
car all geared up. It was good in practice and the guys don't put 
the whole (qualifying) package on it in practice, so we knew it 
would be close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte, who won this race from the pole a year ago, was  
close behind in a Pontiac at 197.488, followed by the Ford of 
series points leader Jeff Burton at 197.252. 
</P>
<P>
	With the cars nearing 200 mph again, despite the carburetor  
restrictor plates required by NASCAR at Talladega and Daytona, 
Schrader was asked why the speeds keep increasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's just done a good job of getting the cars down to  
the ground and everybody's done a good job of getting more 
horsepower,'' he said. ``They just keep making the cars slicker. 
Nobody backs up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, almost totally healed from shoulder he broke sustained  
in a crash earlier this season in Darlington, S.C., said, ``You 
just expect to be fast at Talladega. The numbers don't mean much. 
If it's 193 or 196 or 199, it's fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His record at Talladega is considerably better than Schrader's,  
with finishes of eighth or better in six of his last eight starts 
here. That includes his victory last spring and finishing runner-up 
to Dale Jarrett in the fall race. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nemechek was fourth in the opening qualifying session at  
197.187, followed by Rusty Wallace at 196.616, Mark Martin at 
196.584, Ricky Rudd at 196.362, rookie Tony Stewart at 196.346, 
Chad Little at 196.065 and, rounding out the top 10, Michael 
Waltrip at 195.989. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion, was a  
little disappointed after qualifying 13th at 195.880. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pole at Daytona and now 13th here,'' Gordon lamented.  
``We're starting further back than I'd like to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran about what we tested here, but we thought when it came  
to qualifying we'd pick up. It felt like it was going to be a good 
lap, but we've been a little off all day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we'll go to work on the race setup. I think we'll be good  
Sunday,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 qualifiers nailed down starting spots in the race,  
with fan favorites Dale Earnhardt and Bill Elliott 17th and 18th, 
series runner-up Jarrett 23rd and John Andretti, last Sunday's 
winner in Martinsville, 24th.

<HEADLINE> Movie Prices Protested in NY City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A committee of the New York City Council has  
called for a boycott of Friday night movies to protest what one 
member called the ``madness'' of the city's high ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``For families living on a $30,000 a year budget, the cost of a  
night out at the movies would cost a day's wage after taxes, rent 
and utilities,'' said City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who 
railed against the ``movie madness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Loews Cineplex Entertainment Co. raised  
ticket prices to $9.50 -- the nation's highest price -- leaving many 
movie lovers fuming. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Loews did not return telephone messages left  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the price hike, Vallone called for a federal  
investigation of the 1998 merger between the Loews Theaters and 
Cineplex Odeon chains. In February -- a few months after the merger 
-- the new conglomerate raised prices in Manhattan, ushering in the 
age of the $9.50 movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council Committee on Consumer Affairs voted Friday to  
urge citizens to mount the boycott, a suggestion that might not 
appeal to today's teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Liston, 14, and a group of girlfriends who ``took the day  
off'' from school Friday, nixed the idea. ``If we boycotted movies 
on Fridays, we wouldn't have any dates,'' she said.

	``Everybody's just done a good job of getting the cars down to  
the ground and everybody's done a good job of getting more

Nobody backs up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, almost totally healed from shoulder he broke sustained  
in a crash earlier this season in Darlington, S.C., said, ``You 
just expect to be fast at Talladega. The numbers don't mean much. 
If it's 193 or 196 or 199, it's fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His record at Talladega is considerably better than Schrader's,  
with finishes of eighth or better in six of his last eight starts 
here. That includes his victory last spring and finishing runner-up 
to Dale Jarrett in the fall race. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nemechek was fourth in the opening qualifying session at  
197.187, followed by Rusty Wallace at 196.616, Mark Martin at 
196.584, Ricky Rudd at 196.362, rookie Tony Stewart at 196.346, 
Chad Little at 196.065 and, rounding out the top 10, Michael 
Waltrip at 195.989. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion, was a  
little disappointed after qualifying 13th at 195.880. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pole at Daytona and now 13th here,'' Gordon lamented.  
``We're starting further back than I'd like to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran about what we tested here, but we thought when it came  
to qualifying we'd pick up. It felt like it was going to be a good 
lap, but we've been a little off all day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we'll go to work on the race setup. I think we'll be good  
Sunday,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 qualifiers nailed down starting spots in the race,  
with fan favorites Dale Earnhardt and Bill Elliott 17th and 18th, 
series runner-up Jarrett 23rd and John Andretti, last Sunday's 
winner in Martinsville, 24th.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Makes $58B Bid For MediaOne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp.'s offer to buy the nation's  
fourth-largest cable company for $58 billion received a cool 
reaction from Wall Street this morning, with AT&AMP;T stock plunging as 
much as 7.5 percent as some analysts worried how the phone giant 
will absorb all its acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest telephone company delivered its unsolicited  
offer to Media One Thursday afternoon in an attempt to thwart a 
merger agreement between the cable-TV operator and No. 3 cable 
company Comcast reached last month. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, AT&AMP;T would become the largest cable company in  
the United States with the ability to reach more than 40 percent of 
the nation's cable households, bolstering its emerging network for 
delivering local-phone service to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said its rival bid, a combination of cash and stock,  
exceeded the value of the Comcast deal by 17 percent, which was 
valued at about $49 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstrong said he had no indication how  
MediaOne would respond to its bid, but called it ``a very superior 
offer'' to Comcast's. But some analysts wonder if the phone giant 
can swallow MediaOne after just completing its acquisition of cable 
company Tele-Communications Inc. last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong repeatedly reassured analysts in a teleconference this  
morning that a MediaOne acquisition would be its last major 
cable-TV deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We absolutely do not have any plans, considerations, any  
thoughts or discussions for another signficant transaction,'' 
Armstrong said. He also stressed that AT&AMP;T plans significant cost 
cuts, including $2 billion in savings next year, to help the 
acquisition pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne spokeswoman Cathy Fowler said the AT&AMP;T proposal is  
under review and ``We have nothing to add at this time.'' Comcast, 
based in Philadelphia, had no response to the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AT&AMP;T were down 5.1 percent, or $2.87 1/2 at $53.87 1/2 by  
late morning, recovering a bit from the day's lows in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. MediaOne's stock was up 11 percent, or 
$7.50, at $77 while Comcast shares were up $2.12 1/2 at $69.75. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, with its acquisition of TCI, has 12.5 million cable  
subscribers. MediaOne has 5 million. Time Warner, currently the 
largest, has 12.6 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Kagan, an independent industry analyst in Atlanta, said  
such a move by AT&AMP;T was to be expected. ``Since AT&AMP;T decided that 
cable was the pathway of choice in the home, they need as much 
cable as they can get their hands on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne is a spin-off of the U S West regional phone company,  
which decided in late 1997 to get out of the cable TV business. 
AT&AMP;T said the deal would expand its cable TV coverage in several 
key cities including Boston, Atlanta, Richmond, Va., and Los 
Angeles, putting it in 18 of the top 20 U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has been in the market for cable TV companies because it  
plans to use the cable systems to deliver a combination of local 
and long-distance phone service, high-speed Internet access and 
interactive entertainment to millions of U.S. homes. Other cable 
companies have been merging to make them more competitive in 
offering the same package. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has sought to offer local service by leasing telephone  
lines from the regional Baby Bells, but has stumbled in those 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	If AT&AMP;T's bid succeeds, it would reach more than 40 percent of  
U.S. cable households, estimated Gary Arlen, president of Arlen 
Communications Inc. in Bethesda, Md. ``It's a deal that could 
transform the telecom industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That estimate includes cable companies that AT&AMP;T would own  
outright, along with partial ownerships and joint ventures. Most 
importantly, MediaOne owns 25 percent of Time Warner Entertainment, 
which controls Time Warner's cable business. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said in a conference call with reporters that the deal  
will also diversify AT&AMP;T's businesses. Consumer long-distance, 
which currently represents 45 percent to 50 percent of revenues, 
would fall to about 15 percent in the next four to five years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T officials said they do not expect the deal to have any  
problems meeting regulatory approval and analysts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	The counteroffer was made by Armstrong in a letter Thursday to  
Charles Lillis, chairman and chief executive of MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said the deal would save it $175 million to $200 million in  
the first year of operations. While there will be some work force 
reductions, AT&AMP;T officials wouldn't specify their scope. 
</P>
<P>
	The company acknowledged the cost of the deal would cut its  
profits by about 30 cents per share in the first full year after 
completion, but it said profits would rise after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the profit reduction would be due to the issuance of an  
additional 626 million shares to help pay for the deal, along with 
the cost of borrowing money. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T earned $6.4 billion, or $2.38 per share in 1998, on revenue  
of $53.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has structured the deal so that if its share price drops as  
much as 10 percent below $57, the amount paid MediaOne shareholders 
-- equivalent to $85 a share -- would not decline. 
</P>
<P>
	That could cost AT&AMP;T as much as $3.5 billion more in cash,  
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T would also assume $4.5 billion in MediaOne debt and other  
obligations.

<HEADLINE> Husband Arrested in Bludgeoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An investment manager was in critical condition  
Friday with a fractured skull after her husband allegedly 
bludgeoned her with a barbell while she slept. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Aftab Islam may have become enraged after Theresa  
Havell asked him for a divorce. Islam, 58, was ordered held without 
bail on charges including attempted murder and assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Havell, 52, made a name for herself in investment circles while  
working for Neuberger Berman Management Inc., where she oversaw a 
$12 billion portfolio. She left there in 1996 and founded Havell 
Capital Management. She also had appeared as an occasional guest on 
CNN's ``Your Money'' show about personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to the couple's four-story townhouse on  
Manhattan's Upper East Side before dawn Thursday after receiving 
several calls, including one from the couple's teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	They found Havell beaten around the head and face with a  
barbell, Detective Walter Burnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's skull was fractured and she needed more than 100  
stitches to close head wounds. She also had several teeth knocked 
out.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Peerless Price Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Just 10 minutes into his first Buffalo  
Bills minicamp, rookie wide receiver Peerless Price injured his 
knee running a pass route. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, Buffalo's second-round pick out of Tennessee, was carted  
away for an MRI after hyperextending his right knee on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first prognosis is not major, but we're going to see,''  
Buffalo coach Wade Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Price helped the Volunteers win the national title last season  
with four catches for a Fiesta Bowl-record 199 yards and a 71-yard 
touchdown against Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Bills' second choice behind Ohio State cornerback  
Antoine Winfield and the 53rd selection overall in last weekend's 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he caught his toe in the turf,'' Bills  
quarterback Doug Flutie said. ``They're guessing that he sprained 
his knee, which isn't really a big deal. But it's got to be 
frustrating for him. It probably seems like the end of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price was running his second route of the day indoors at the  
Bills' field house when his left foot got caught in the turf. 
``When I went to pull it up, it just stuck and my right leg 
over-extended and I felt it pop,'' said Price, who returned to 
Ralph Wilson Stadium on crutches after his MRI. ``I should get the 
results tomorrow. I just pray to God it isn't bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price broke his ankle and tore two ligaments in the spring of  
1997. ``My ankle hurt a lot worse than this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills running back Antowain Smith sat out much of the first day  
of minicamp with a groin injury that has been nagging him since 
last season, when he led the team in rushing. ``It's just a little 
bit sore,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only no-show for the Bills on Friday was receiver Andre  
Reed, who Phillips said was in the midst of a disagreement with the 
team over his contract. Reed probably won't attend any of the 
three-day camp.

<HEADLINE> Even Home Ice May Not Save Ducks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Mighty Ducks, stunned in their series  
with Detroit, finally get some fan support. It's too bad their fans 
can't cross-check, deflect shots or clear the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fans are great but they can't go on the ice and make us  
play better,'' Anaheim's Teemu Selanne said after the Mighty Ducks 
fell behind 2-0 in the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want to win, we've got to play at least at the level of  
our best hockey all season. We have a lot of things to fix and 
we've only got 36 hours to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ducks, who have won just once (1-7-2) since clinching a  
playoff berth, need more than a quick fix to compete against the 
two-time defending NHL champions Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim, who returns home Sunday for Game 3, was outscored 10-4  
in the opening two games in Detroit, including a 5-1 drubbing 
Friday in the second game -- which wasn't even as close as the score 
might indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We better learn from our mistakes pretty quickly if we want to  
get back in this series,'' Selanne said. ``With the talent on that 
team, if they play well and we play badly it's all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His linemate, Paul Kariya, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly not the more talented team in this series, so  
if we let them outwork us, they'll just kill us,'' said Kariya, who 
got off just one shot in Game 2 after his 429 this year were the 
second-most ever by a player in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to simplify things and get our work ethic back. We're  
giving an honest effort,'' Kariya added. ``But when you're playing 
against the Stanley Cup champions and they're playing at 110 
percent, that's not going to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, whose sweep of the Mighty Ducks in the playoffs  
two years ago included three overtime wins, are 6-0 against Anaheim 
in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do a lot of little things well in our own end,'' said  
Detroit's Brendan Shanahan, who had two goals and an assist in the 
Red Wings' four-goal opening period in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw guys still lying down to block shots and finishing  
checks, that's just as important for us. We always say, you come 
back to the bench you get as big a pat on the back for a goal as 
you do for a blocked shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Shanahan expects the Mighty Ducks to be considerably more  
competitive on their home ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've really played well in their building,'' he said. ``So  
we know they're going to be excited and their fans are going to be 
excited, so it's going to be a really big game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Mighty Ducks have gone into a tailspin recently, the  
Red Wings are rolling. Detroit is 11-2-1 since acquiring Chris 
Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson, Wendel Clark and Bill Ranford at the trade 
deadline, and has outscored opponents 47-24.

<HEADLINE>  Protesters Seek End of NATO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Serbian-Americans joined with antiwar  
demonstrators outside the White House on Saturday to condemn the 
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and urge renewed peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-afternoon, the crowd at Lafayette Park grew to more than  
2,000 people, many of whom carried the red, white and blue flag of 
Serbia and denounced President Clinton and NATO leaders as 
warmongers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not far from where NATO officials were celebrating the  
alliance's 50th anniversary, the demonstrators released dozens of 
black balloons amid wild cheers. The balloons symbolized the lives 
lost in the NATO bombing, according to organizers. 
</P>
<P>
      	Some in the crowd carried signs saying ``KosovoVietnam'' and 	
</P>
<P>
          ``N-A-T-ONorth American Terrorist Organization.'' 	
</P>
<P>
	``The misguided polices of this administration and NATO are  
bringing a terrible calamity to our people,'' said Nikola 
Ristivojevich of Detroit. ``The solution won't be found in bombs 
but in serious negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slavia Pesakovic of Phoenix said the bombing of Yugoslavia could  
ignite another Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud to be an American but I'm disgusted by this  
policy,'' Pesakovic said. ``Clinton has stepped into a small civil 
war and created a larger mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally dwarfed a smaller demonstration at Lafayette Park a  
day earlier by Albanian-Americans who supported the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point Saturday, the protesters marched from the park down  
a local street and booed a group of NATO officials standing outside 
a downtown hotel. Some in the crowd yelled ``NATO means Nazis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like others in the crowd, Dave Stevens, of Highland Ind., said  
he is opposed to the leadership of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. But he said NATO bombing has become a unifying force for 
Serbian-Americans, which is helping Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton is turning anti-Milosevic people into solid Milosevic  
people,'' Stevens said. ``They are making him a hero.''

<HEADLINE> Stars' Carbonneau Out With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Stars center Guy Carbonneau will be out of  
the lineup for 7-10 days with an injury to his right knee, missing 
the rest of the Stars' best-of-7 series against the Edmonton 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau suffered a first-degree strain to the medial  
collateral ligament in his right knee during Friday's 3-2 victory 
over the Oilers in Dallas. Carbonneau was attempting to hit an 
Edmonton defender late in the third period when he twisted his knee 
and crashed into the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau, who at 39 is the oldest skater on any team in the  
playoffs, had scored in both games of the Stars' first-round series 
against the Oilers, accounting for two of Dallas' five goals thus 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the game-winner in Wednesday's 2-1 victory and opened the  
scoring in Friday's win, which gave the Stars a 2-0 series lead 
headed into Sunday's game in Edmonton.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Head Home With 2-0 Lead / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The upstart Buffalo Sabres are at it again,  
giving a favored opponent fits in the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not just Dominik Hasek's acrobatic saves that are  
throwing off the Ottawa Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh-seeded Sabres returned home with a 2-0 series lead  
over No. 2 Ottawa in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals, looking 
like lottery winners with Friday's 3-2 double-overtime victory. The 
teams play Games 3 and 4 in Buffalo on Sunday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have been criticized as a bad team with a great  
goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been times this year when we've been a bad team,''  
Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``What's frustrating for a lot of 
teams is our key player plays 60 minutes a game. But we've got a 
great supporting cast, and there are some guys who are starting to 
stick their heads up and get noticed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miroslav Satan sent Friday's game into overtime and then won it  
by knocking in Jason Woolley's rebound. Joe Juneau, playing in his 
first game Friday since recovering from a concussion, added a goal 
and two assists. And Sabres captain Michael Peca has done all but 
sit on Alexei Yashin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have ridden Hasek's 88 saves as Ottawa now faces the  
difficult task of winning a seven-game series after losing the 
first two games at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping just to win one game and now we've won both,''  
Satan said. ``We just have to keep playing hard and stay patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators hope to become the first team since the 1966  
Montreal Canadiens to come back after losing the first two games of 
a series at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be done,'' Senators coach Jacques Martin said. ``We  
have to get some more goals, but I think when we look back there's 
a lot of good things we did and we just have to finish better 
around the net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa won just three of its last 10 regular season games and  
dropped the first game of the series to the Sabres 2-1 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are trying not to indulge in overconfidence.

	``Our focus is to keep our feet in the ground,'' said Ruff,  
whose team upset the Flyers in the first round on its way to the 
conference finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	For a second game in a row, Yashin, the Ottawa captain, was held  
without a point under Peca's close checking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure his spirits were hurt, but a guy with his talent  
isn't going to be kept down too long,'' Peca said.

	``We still think it's going to be a very difficult series,''  
Ruff said. ``They have one of the best road records in the league 
and they're a team that can frustrate you from game to game. And 
the pressure is off them now.''

	Juneau, acquired just before the trading deadline to add spark  
to the Sabres' sputtering offense, suffered a concussion April 13 
when he was hit by Philadelphia's Dan McGillis. He was so groggy 
afterward that he could barely sit up for the team picture, and was 
finally cleared to play Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Text of Colorado 'Suicide Note' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The text of a note received by e-mail by police  
late this week. At first, authorities said it was being taken 
seriously, but they later said there was little reason to believe 
that was written by either Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	It was obtained by the Denver Rocky Mountain News.  

</P>
<P>
	By now it's over. If you are reading this my mission is  
complete. I have finished revolutionizing the neoeuphoric 
infliction of my internal terror. Your children who have ridaculed 
(sic) me, who have chosen not to accept me, who have treated me 
like I am not worth their time are dead. THEY ARE (expletive) DEAD. 
Surely you will try to blame it on the clothes I wear, the music I 
listen to, or the way I choose to present myself -- but no. Do not 
hide behind my choices. You need to face the fact that this comes 
as a result of YOUR CHOICES. Parents and Teachers, YOU (expletive) 
UP. You have taught these kids to be gears and sheep. To think and 
act like those who came before them, to not accept what is 
different. YOU ARE IN THE WRONG. I may have taken their lives and 
my own -- but it was your doing. Teachers, Parents, LET THIS 
MASSACRE BE ON YOUR SHOULDERS UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE. Am I insane? 
Maybe. Is it my fault? No. I did not choose this life, but I have 
indeed chosen to exit it. You may think the horror ends with the 
bullet in my head -- but you wouldn't be so lucky. All that I can 
leave you with to decipher what more extensive death is to come is 
``12Skizto.'' You have until April 26th. Goodbye. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fan Returns Tatis Grand Slam Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All month long, fans in the Dodger Stadium  
pavilion seats have thrown back home runs hit by opposing players. 
Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lerner, who works in the fish business and lives in Simi  
Valley, Calif., snagged the biggest catch of his life on Friday 
night -- even though someone else actually made the grab. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lerner, who attended the game with his two sons, wound  
up with the ball Fernando Tatis hit into the left field pavilion 
for his second grand slam of the third inning. It made the 
Cardinals' third baseman the first player in history to hit two 
slams in one inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ball belongs in the Hall of Fame. That's what's  
important,'' Lerner said in a hallway leading to the Cardinals' 
clubhouse after the 12-5 victory over the Dodgers. ``This was 
history. I mean, this has never been done in the history of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Tatis' second slam landed in the lower seats of the left  
field pavilion, a mad scramble for the ball ensued. A young fan got 
his hands on the precious ball first, but Lerner negotiated it away 
from him with offers of $40, $60 and then $80. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bedlam there. Everybody knew what was going on,''  
Lerner said. ``I got a few bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	An usher who was on the scene wrote something on Lerner's ticket  
stub to authenticate it, then escorted Lerner and his party to the 
Cardinals' clubhouse, where the ball was placed inside a bag. It 
was then taken up to the stadium security department, where it was 
locked up until the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	After the final out, in front of a horde of media, Tatis  
autographed the uniform shirt he wore in the game and handed it to 
Lerner as a reward for the ball. Six baseballs were then brought 
out to Tatis, which the Cardinals' third baseman also autographed 
in front of Lerner and his sons, Kevin, 7, and Randy, 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to tell you that we're big-time baseball fans,''  
Lerner told Tatis, ``and I hope you put the ball in the Hall of 
Fame.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Pitcher Hit in Face With Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Trainer Dave Tumbas was in the Chicago Cubs  
lockerroom showing reporters Kerry Wood's surgical scar and 
explaining how his rehabilitation would unfold. Just as he was 
finishing the presentation, an urgent call summoned him to the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	There, yet another pitching mishap awaited his attention  
Saturday -- pitcher Jon Lieber had been hit in the right eye with a 
ball thrown from the outfield during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was helped off the field with a towel on his face,  
Lieber was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital where tests 
revealed no major damage to his eye. He will miss his scheduled 
Sunday start, however, and be re-evaluated Monday. Brad Woodall 
will start in his place 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a freak thing,'' said Lieber, who sported a shiner  
after the game and also suffered some small broken bones in his 
nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my back turned and the ball was in the air and it hit me  
square in the eye ball. I felt like I had been sucker punched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The throw from Curtis Goodwin bounced first and then knocked  
Lieber down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to make my next start after Sunday's,'' Lieber said.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest injury came one day after the pitching-shaky Cubs  
released Hideo Nomo, who declined to stay in the minors for two 
more starts on top of the three he'd already made. 
</P>
<P>
	What else can happen?  
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers Wood, Kevin Tapani, Jeremi Gonzalez, Terry Adams and  
Kurt Miller are all on the disabled list. And the bullpen, before 
four relievers combined Saturday with starter Terry Mulholland on 
an eight-hit shutout of the New York Mets, had been struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani will throw on the side Sunday. He underwent an MRI Friday  
that showed no structural damage in his sore right shoulder. His 
problem is muscular. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me I could pitch another 10 years. The structure of  
the joint is healthy and it eliminated anything else,'' Tapani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who earlier this month underwent ``Tommy John surgery,''  
where a ligament from his wrist replaced the torn one in his elbow, 
is already doing extensive rehab -- range of motion and grip 
strength exercises and isometrics to keep his shoulder strong. He's 
also started lower leg work and conditioning drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's NL Rookie of the Year said he watched a video replay  
of his own surgery and listened to the scraping of bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was not a good sound,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wood, whose arm is still swollen, remained upbeat about his  
chances of returning and being a top pitcher again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you do something for a living and that's taken away  
from you, it changes your perspective,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bird's Amiability Leads to Capture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A California condor that has a penchant for  
people, even allowing someone to pick it up, has been returned to 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual behavior alarmed overseers of a federal program who  
had released the giant bird to the wild in northern Arizona five 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an unusual condor. It walked right up to people,''  
said Bill Heinrich of the Peregrine Fund, an Idaho-based 
organization that's heading the reintroduction program in 
partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scavenger species like condors are attracted to areas of high  
activity. In nature, activity signals the possibility of a food 
source,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But contact with humans can be dangerous for condors and vice  
versa. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-old male, labeled Condor 86, approached people at three  
different locations. It was picked up at an airport near the Grand 
Canyon, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of fear of humans put the condor in danger -- a  
behavior that could have jeopardized other condors if he had taught 
them to approach humans,'' said Shawn Farry, the fund's condor 
field team leader. ``When cornered, condors will use their powerful 
beak for protection. That's another reason not to approach them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peregrine Fund biologists first recaptured Condor 86 on March 25  
after it spent an afternoon and an evening in a mulberry tree at a 
resort parking lot in Hurricane, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	It was kept in a kennel until being released again April 2 at  
the horseshoe-shaped Vermilion Cliffs near the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	But on April 4, the condor was seen approaching river rafters at  
Travertine Canyon on the Hualapai Indian Reservation and the 
following day spotted at the small airstrip and terminal area at 
Grand Canyon West. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy at the airport picked it up and took it inside so  
coyotes wouldn't get at it,'' Heinrich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bird was placed in the Peregrine Fund's propagation center  
in Boise, Idaho. Eventually, it will be integrated into a captive 
breeding program n either at the Idaho center, the Los Angeles Zoo 
where it was hatched or the San Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
	California condors, among the most ancient of North America's  
birds, were nearly shot, poisoned and electrocuted to extinction 
until biologists launched a multimillion-dollar recovery program in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	They trapped all 22 surviving wild condors and brought them into  
zoos, setting their offspring free in California and Arizona. The 
carrion-eating birds with a nearly 10-foot wingspan had been absent 
from Arizona's skies since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	Condor 86 was one of eight birds released last Nov. 18 at  
Hurricane Cliffs near the Arizona-Utah border. Fourteen other 
condors have been set free over the past three years at Vermilion 
Cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the birds are monitored by radio transmitters attached to  
their wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-two condors fly free in California. Two others drowned  
and two were shot by poachers after their 1998 release. Of the 28 
condors released in Arizona since December 1996, only 20 remain in 
the wild.

<HEADLINE> Canada Regrets Indian Student Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Canada has apologized for abuses of students in  
its system of boarding schools for Indian students. Darlena Watt is 
angry that the United States has not done the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had more boarding schools, more missionary schools, than  
Canada ever had,'' said Watt, a Colville tribal council member who 
attended the Chilocco Indian School in Oklahoma in the 1960s. 
``Whatever happened there, you can triple it and it was a reality 
in our schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of issuing an apology for boarding school abuses hasn't  
come up in Congress, said Senate Indian Affairs Committee spokesman 
Chris Changery. 
</P>
<P>
	In Canada, a flood of lawsuits and a royal commission's report  
``created an environment that absolutely demanded that action be 
taken,'' said Shawn Tupper of the Department of Indian and Northern 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Indians themselves are split over whether  
an apology would be a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson Zah, a former Navajo Nation president who attended the  
Phoenix Indian School in the 1950s, said: ``The United States owes 
an apology to the Indian people that were damaged by the boarding 
school system so they ended up alcoholics or total failures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What point would an apology be?'' countered Claudeen  
Bates-Arthur, a Navajo attorney who attended a Methodist boarding 
school. ``It would sound good. It would make everybody feel better, 
but sometimes those kinds of words allow people to say, 'We 
apologized. Let's get on with things.'''

<HEADLINE> Clinton NATO Text-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON: Sam.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. President, before the air campaign began, Pentagon  
planners advised you, according to reports that have not been 
denied, that the air campaign could degrade, it could damage, it 
could diminish, but it could not by itself stop the killing on the 
ground in Kosovo if Milosevic intends to persevere. You have said 
again today that you will continue the air campaign, and that you 
believe it will prevail. Have the Pentagon planners given you 
advice, have they changed their mind? And if not, sir, on what do 
you base your optimism? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all, I believe that the report that you  
have from the Pentagon planners is an accurate one, and it is what 
I believe to be the case at the time. Keep in mind, and I think I 
made this clear at the time, the reason we went forward with the 
air actions is because we thought there was some chance it would 
deter Mr. Milosevic based on two previous examples. 
</P>
<P>
	Number one, last October in Kosovo when he was well-poised to do  
the same thing. And number two, in Bosnia where there were 12 days 
of NATO attacks over a 20-day period. However, I also well 
understood that the underlying facts were somewhat different. I 
still believe we did the right thing, and I believe, as one of the 
area's leaders said in the last couple days, it would have been 
much worse had we not taken action. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there is a literal sense, Sam, in which from the air you  
cannot take every Serbian body and uniform on the ground in Kosovo 
and extract them from Kosovo and put them back in Serbia. That, I 
think, is self-evident to everyone. So when I tell you that I think 
this will work, what I mean by that is I think if we execute well, 
if we're determined, and if we spend enough time doing it, we will 
either break down his military capacity to retain control over 
Kosovo, or the price of staying there will be far greater than the 
perceived benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the logic behind the campaign. Not that it will  
physically extract every person and put them back across the 
border. Everyone knows that's not true. And I believe -- I'm glad 
you asked the question because I think it's very important that 
every one be clear on this. 
</P>
<P>
	This is -- my belief is that if we vigorously, comprehensively,  
execute the air campaign, and if we are prepared to take the time, 
and do our very best to care for the refugees as best we can in the 
meanwhile and to provide stability and support for the front-line 
states, and especially to Albania and to Macedonia, that we will 
prevail. That is what I believe and I believe we will do it because 
we have the capacity to dramatically degrade his military 
operation, which is the instrument of his control. And because we 
have the capacity to make this policy very, very expensive for him 
militarily and economically and in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, sir, in the back.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. President, then under this scenario that you just  
laid out doesn't mean that he would necessarily comply with the 
five conditions which would also mean that it might be too high to 
keep his forces there, the cost, but then you would have to be 
willing to move some forces in to take the ground that they could 
no longer hold. And it seems at the moment there's no willingness 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Our position on that, I think, is the correct one. The  
secretary general has recommended a reassessment of what would be 
required. I think that everybody in the alliance agrees with his 
decision. That is the correct decision. But we have not weakened 
our conditions, nor will we. If anything, I think this meeting has 
seen not only a reaffirmation, but an intensification of our 
determination to see the refugees back in, the Serb forces out, and 
an international force to protect them, and a movement toward 
self-government for the Kosovars. Thank you very much.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Tyrone Marshall scored in the 19th  
minute as the Miami Fusion began life without Carlos Valderrama 
with their first victory in regulation this year, beating the 
Kansas City Wizards 1-0 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami hadn't led a game this season until Marshall ran onto a  
long cross from midfielder Henry Gutierrez and one-timed a shot 
past goalkeeper Chris Snitko. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Miami's second consecutive victory without Valderrama,  
who was benched by coach Ivo Wortmann four games into the season 
amid accusations of ignoring instructions and playing his own 
tactical game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat Dallas the day after Valderrama's benching, and the  
mop-haired midfielder stayed away from the club thereafter. On 
Friday, Major League Soccer reassigned the Colombian World Cup star 
to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion (3-3) continued the worst start in franchise history  
for Kansas City (0-6). 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards played their second game under interim coach Ken  
Fogarty, who returned to Lockhart Stadium 15 years after starring 
for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in the defunct North American 
Soccer League. Fogarty took over as coach after Ron Newman resigned 
two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> American Indians Describe Beatings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAHPETON, N.D. (AP) -- It was the beating she didn't get that  
still haunts Joyce Burr. 
</P>
<P>
	She and several friends were hiding from a dormitory matron in  
the coat room of the Wahpeton Indian School. They peeked from 
behind the coats as the enraged matron, herself an Indian, caught 
up with an older Chippewa girl named Judy Karvonen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the worst beating I've ever seen. That woman used coat  
hangers and everything on her,'' said Burr, a Turtle Mountain 
Chippewa/Oglala Sioux. ``You can imagine not trying to move, trying 
not to make a sound, when you're seeing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burr was just one of thousands of American Indian children sent  
to boarding schools run by the government or by Christian 
denominations. The coat room beating was just one of thousands 
administered in the name of keeping order, of crushing Indian 
identity, of immersing Indian children in white American society. 
Today, about 10,000 Indian children are enrolled in the schools, 
though their mission has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Burr herself had suffered through plenty of thrashings at  
Wahpeton, where she lived from 1952 to 1959. Dormitory workers beat 
her for climbing trees, or for not making her bed quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Karvonen became Burr's mentor and protector after Burr's mother  
died during her first year away from home. Burr and her friends 
also were like sisters to Karvonen, who spent five years at 
Wahpeton without seeing her family on the Turtle Mountain 
reservation. So she never told the matron where her friends were 
hiding, and never again mentioned the coat room beating to her 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just withheld everything inside me and wouldn't cry for  
nobody or nothing,'' Karvonen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst abuse, Burr said nearly 45 years later, came from  
Indian dormitory workers who had attended boarding schools 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``They personally took great glee in beating you. Some of them  
were very sadistic,'' Burr said. ``... I suppose the same thing 
happened to them, so they turned around and did the same thing to 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a century, tens of thousands of American Indians  
surrendered their childhoods at boarding schools like Wahpeton, a 
prairie outpost 45 miles south of Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs began opening boarding  
schools in the 1870s, joining a parallel system of religious 
boarding schools for Indians run by Christian missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal boarding school enrollments swelled from 6,200 at 60  
schools in 1885 to more than 17,000 in 153 schools at the turn of 
the century. By 1931, nearly one-third of Indian children were in 
boarding schools, a total of about 24,000. Enrollments have 
declined to less than half that number at 52 federal boarding 
schools today. 
</P>
<P>
	At both government and mission schools, the goal was the same:  
obliterating all that was Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	Former students and boarding school historians say the methods  
were often violent and humiliating -- forcing children to eat lye 
soap for speaking their tribal languages, cropping their long hair, 
paddling them for having Indian medicine bundles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were never going to be like the white man, no matter how  
hard we tried, but they forced us to try to be like the white 
man,'' said Jo Anna Meninick, a Yakama. She attended the 
government-run Chemawa Indian School in Salem, Ore., in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``They stripped us of our language. They stripped us of our  
religious beliefs. They stripped us of our family life, our family 
values. They stripped us from our culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some former boarding school workers say much of the abuse  
stemmed from ignorance and overwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Miriam Shindelar was a dorm attendant from 1967 to 1970  
at the Marty Indian School, a Roman Catholic institution on the 
Yankton Sioux reservation in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first year, I was in charge of 91 high school girls,''  
said Shindelar, who also taught at the school from 1974 to 1984. 
``You didn't have the kinds of time that a family would have. You 
ended up being largely a disciplinarian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every school worker was abusive, said Esther Horne, 89, a  
Shoshone who taught at Wahpeton from 1930 to 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some people who were harsh on the children, but  
there were also a great many others who were very solicitous, 
creating a happy environment in the dormitory,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other boarding school officials approved of the beatings.  
Phoenix Indian School Superintendent John B. Brown objected in 1928 
when his bosses in Washington ordered a halt to corporal 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deal with a primitive race, with persons who often lack  
appreciation of the reasons for good behavior,'' Brown wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada had its own system of boarding schools for Indian  
children, and the Canadian government has acknowledged that 
physical and sexual abuse was widespread. Last year, Canada 
formally apologized and set aside more than $230 million to pay for 
counseling programs developed by tribal groups. 
</P>
<P>
	A flurry of lawsuits and a royal commission's report detailing  
the abuses forced the Canadian government's hand, said Shawn Tupper 
of Canada's Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obvious that the government had to take some action and  
focus on helping these people recover,'' Tupper said. 
</P>
<P>
	No similar action by the United States has been proposed in  
Congress, said Senate Indian Affairs Committee spokesman Chris 
Changery. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the boarding school story is not just a tale of misery.  
Some former students saw the schools as a refuge from poverty, 
abuse or abandonment at home. Many say they gained the education 
and self-control needed to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	One is Ernie Stensgar, chairman of the Coeur d'Alene tribe in  
northern Idaho. He attended the Chilocco Indian School in 
north-central Oklahoma in 1963-64. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went into boot camp in the military, it wasn't too hard  
for me, because I had already in a sense been to boot camp,'' said 
Stensgar, who was wounded in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Kill the Indian, save the man.'' That was the motto of Gen.  
Richard Pratt, the former commander of an Indian POW camp who 
founded the first off-reservation federal boarding school in 1879. 
</P>
<P>
	The government bureaucrats and Christian missionaries who molded  
the boarding school system had the same idea. Indians must be 
forced to follow ``the superior methods of the white man,'' 
Wellington Rich, the first superintendent of the Phoenix Indian 
School, said in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
	At the very least, U.S. Indian Commissioner Thomas Morgan said  
that year, it was ``cheaper to educate Indians than to kill them.'' 
A predecessor, Carl Schurz, had done the math, calculating in 1882 
that it cost nearly $1 million to kill an Indian in battle, but 
$1,200 for eight years of schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	So students marched with military-style discipline. They  
exchanged their own buckskins or calico dresses for neck-to-toe 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Government boarding schools were particularly harsh, former  
students and government records say. The schools required students 
to attend Christian religious services on Sundays and renounce 
their tribal religions. Many children were sent into surrounding 
communities to work for white families -- the girls as domestic 
servants, the boys as farmhands. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1920s, federal boarding schools fed students thin  
gruel, moldy molasses and weak coffee for 11 cents per day, the 
equivalent of $1 today. Government inspectors in the 1930s cited 
the Haskell Institute, a federal boarding school in Lawrence, Kan., 
for having bathrooms that were nothing more than a row of chamber 
pots lined up in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Classroom instruction took up half of the day or less at most  
federal schools, with the rest devoted to hard labor. Students kept 
the schools running by doing everything from building the buildings 
to raising livestock and harvesting crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Former students tell of being forced to kneel on bare wooden  
floors for hours when they misunderstood commands barked in the 
unfamiliar English language. They remember beatings for crying out 
of homesickness. They speak of being chained in makeshift jails if 
they tried to run away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't like ourselves because we were Indian,'' said  
Meninick, now a cultural resource officer with the Yakama Nation in 
south-central Washington. ``We were bad. We were no good. We were 
uneducated, illiterate. We were not going to amount to anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools banned parents from visiting, lest they infect  
their children with tribal culture. Being separated from their 
families for months or years meant that many boarding school 
students never learned how to be good parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very strict. They were very stern. They were very  
cold,'' said Ida Amiotte, 77, an Oglala Sioux. She attended a Roman 
Catholic boarding school in Pine Ridge, S.D. in the 1920s and '30s. 
``My children always asked me, `Why are you so cold? Why don't you 
hug us?' I said, `I never learned how.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Boarding school staff also forced students to beat their  
classmates. Some schools used the ``hotline,'' in which the 
offending student was forced to walk a gauntlet of classmates 
wielding belts or sticks or hairbrushes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The girls had to walk the gauntlet and get the backs of their  
legs switched, and if the switcher was too light on the switch, 
they had to do it hard. These girls had legs that were swollen 
three times their size,'' said Vi Hilbert, who attended boarding 
schools in Washington and Oregon in the 1920s and '30s. Hilbert is 
a member of the Upper Skagit tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	Students died by the hundreds from epidemics, farm accidents and  
other causes, said Cleveland State University professor David 
Adams, an expert on the boarding school system. Firm numbers are 
unavailable because many schools sent seriously ill children home 
or never recorded student deaths, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cemetery at Haskell alone has 102 student graves. Government  
documents show at least 500 more students died and were buried 
elsewhere, said Charles Haines, a biology professor at what is now 
Haskell Indian Nations University. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students killed themselves. One was 18-year-old John  
Thomas, a Pima who shot himself in the head at the Phoenix Indian 
School in 1896. ``No reason for such act can be ascertained,'' 
school Superintendent Harwood Hall reported in a brief dispatch to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of the Marty Indian School, Glenn Holiday, became a  
dormitory supervisor there before killing himself in 1978 in his 
early 20s, Shindelar said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He left a message saying, `I don't know which world I belong  
in. Some of my best friends are white,''' Shindelar said. ``He said 
he was accused by his friends of being an apple -- red on the 
outside, white on the inside. And the struggle was too much for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Boarding school conditions improved as government and church  
policy gradually shifted away from forced assimilation and 
enrollments declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is beautiful, civilized human life we are chopping to  
pieces at sizeable cost to the taxpayer,'' reformer John Collier 
wrote about boarding schools in 1923. A decade later, Franklin 
Roosevelt picked Collier to head the BIA, and Collier tried to ban 
beatings and improve conditions at the schools. Later, Indians 
themselves began running the BIA. 
</P>
<P>
	Military discipline at boarding schools was mostly gone by the  
1950s. Schools abandoned most of their hard labor programs by the 
1960s. After a 1969 congressional report declared Indian education 
``a national tragedy,'' tribes got more say in their schools and 
began introducing aspects of tribal culture into the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 35 of the 52 government boarding schools are on the vast  
Navajo reservation, an area the size of West Virginia that includes 
parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Nine schools are on other 
reservations in South Dakota, Arizona, Washington and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight federal off-reservation boarding schools remain: In  
Wahpeton; Pierre and Flandreau, S.D.; Talequah and Anadarko, Okla.; 
Salem, Ore.; Riverside, Calif.; and Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The off-reservation schools have largely evolved into  
specialized treatment centers for troubled Indian youths. Wahpeton 
is now called Circle of Nations and is overseen by a tribal school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Burr has returned as superintendent of the school. Karen  
Gillis, an Arikara friend who hid with Burr in the coat room, is 
assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know how it was and how it can be, so we try to do it right  
for the kids this time around,'' Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Burr became superintendent in 1995, she looked up Judy  
Karvonen and hired her to oversee the girls' dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (students) seem to bond with you better, since you've  
been to a school like this that was more crude and harsh than this 
is,'' Karvonen said. 
</P>
<P>
	They are among many boarding school survivors working to heal  
the hurts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shindelar led a religious service last year at which Indians and  
whites prayed and sang at school sites where abuses occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Burr has enacted strict protections for her students at  
Wahpeton. ``You even verbally abuse these kids,'' she said, 
``you're out of here.'' She dreams of organizing a conference of 
healing for adults who were abused in the Indian boarding schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that hurt never goes away. I'm 52, and I still feel  
it.''

<HEADLINE> Elway Tells Friends He's Done </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway is ready to join Michael Jordan and  
Wayne Gretzky in retirement -- the third transcendent figure in 
sports in the last four months to leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The peerless quarterback of the Denver Broncos -- the architect  
of the game-saving drive -- has told friends he is retiring after 16 
seasons, and an announcement could come Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	And not even the prospect of a third straight Super Bowl title  
could entice him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway reportedly considered making the announcement this past  
week but delayed it, first because Broncos owner Pat Bowlen was out 
of town and then because of the school killings in suburban 
Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to him and he told me what he's going to do,''  
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan told The Associated Press on Saturday. 
``But I'm not going to comment. ``I'm going to let John make his 
announcement. I understand he may be doing something on Monday. 
I'll have something to say then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen did not return a phone call, and Elway was believed out  
of town on a golf trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old quarterback leaves the NFL at the height of his  
powers, having won his second straight Super Bowl title and the 
game's MVP award in his last outing. 
</P>
<P>
	During the NFL draft last weekend, Shanahan said he expected  
Elway to make his decision known before minicamp, which opens 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the decision Shanahan wanted to hear, but it was the  
one he was bracing for. The coach said at the NFL owners meetings 
in Phoenix last month that the odds were his Hall of Fame-bound 
quarterback would retire and that he was confident in turning to 
veteran Bubby Brister as his new starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Backing up Brister would be second-year pro Brian Griese. The  
Broncos also are believed interested in signing Chris Miller, who 
has not played since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister went 4-0 as a starter last season when Elway was  
injured. He insists Elway has not confided in him about his plans. 
In fact, of a dozen or so Broncos players interviewed during 
informal workouts the past two weeks, none said he knew Elway's 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is true, then it's the opportunity of a lifetime, that's  
for sure,'' Brister told The Denver Post. ``I'm going to miss John 
being around just like everybody else because we have such a great 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``By no means am I John Elway. I just think if I can fill my own  
shoes, that will be good enough to get us where we want to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where they want to go is back to the Super Bowl for a try at an  
unprecedented third straight crown. 
</P>
<P>
	That possibility was alluring to Elway. After winning his first  
Super Bowl title in 1998, Elway spent four months pondering his 
future, finally deciding to come back for what he said would be his 
final season. After the second title last January, he admitted the 
chance to three-peat had thrown a ``kink'' into his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the kink wasn't enough to sway him.  
</P>
<P>
	Several teammates, marveling at Elway's ability to absorb  
punishment and keep bouncing back, said in recent weeks they 
expected a retirement announcement because Elway had nothing left 
to prove, having capped his career with the only achievements that 
escaped him earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway produced 47 game-saving drives -- the most in NFL history.  
The best was the classic 98-yard march in the final five minutes to 
tie Cleveland in the 1986 AFC championship game. The Broncos won in 
overtime, sending Elway to his first of five Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	He guided his team to more victories (148) than any other  
quarterback, and he threw for 51,475 yards and accounted for 54,882 
total yards -- second only to Miami's Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only player to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for 200  
yards in seven straight seasons (1985-91). 
</P>
<P>
	He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and honored as the NFL's MVP  
in 1987. He holds 55 Broncos' regular-season and postseason 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	In beating Atlanta 34-19 in Miami last Jan. 31, he became the  
first quarterback to start in five Super Bowls. The Broncos' 23-10 
win over the New York Jets in the AFC championship game two weeks 
earlier gave him a 5-1 record in conference championship games -- 
the best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino may have better numbers, and others such as Joe Montana  
and Terry Bradshaw more titles, but Elway leaves with another 
legacy all his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to be the most durable quarterback ever,'' former  
Broncos coach Wade Phillips said. ``He's the Lou Gehrig of that 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was hit more than any quarterback in NFL history,  
absorbing 559 sacks in 256 games, but he missed only 15 starts 
because of illness or injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The pounding finally caught up with him. He needed long massages  
every day just to get through the week. 
</P>
<P>
	And through it all -- every season since 1983 -- he has been  
synonymous with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Elway is the Denver Broncos,'' former NFL quarterback Joe  
Theismann once said. ``When you turn on the TV and the Denver 
Broncos are playing, you expect to see John Elway playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not anymore.

<HEADLINE> NATO: 10 Yugoslav Generals Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least 10 fired Yugoslav generals have been  
placed under house arrest, a British spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Alastair Campbell, the press secretary for British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair, had no precise number for those being 
detained, saying only it was in ``double figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters, Campbell said that one sacked general  
was the former head of the army, fired shortly before the NATO air 
campaign against Yugoslavia began a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea was asked about such house  
arrests and said he had heard the same reports about Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic and his military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said, ``There are many retired generals in Yugoslavia  
because Milosevic retires generals all the time. He doesn't seem to 
have much trust in them. I wonder if they have much trust in him.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Pushes Abortion Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Steve  
Forbes urged conservative activists Saturday to lay the groundwork 
for banning abortions by turning public opinion against the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes favors a constitutional ``human life'' amendment to  
outlaw abortions. But he acknowledged in a speech that ``many 
people do not yet agree with our ultimate goal -- a life 
amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And while there will be times of disappointment, if you're not  
out there working on it, how do you make it happen? How do you turn 
people's minds?'' he asked more than 250 members of the California 
Republican Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was the second of five GOP White House hopefuls to  
address the conservative CRA, which will endorse a candidate in 
November and by doing so mobilize thousands of its activists. The 
group is holding its annual convention here this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Pat Buchanan before him, Forbes delivered an address that  
struck one conservative chord after another. 
</P>
<P>
	He denounced the Internal Revenue Service, urged a return to the  
moral values of an earlier era, called for choice in schools and 
health care providers and promised to expand the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion activist Gary Bauer was to address the group later  
Saturday. On Sunday, candidates Alan Keyes and Sen. Bob Smith of 
New Hampshire were expected to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	While Forbes called for a ``step-by-step'' elimination of  
abortion, Bauer bemoaned such ``incrementalism'' and made clear 
that outlawing abortion would be his top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been sentenced to nothing but incrementalism,'' he said  
at a press conference Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm certainly going to remind all of my rivals for the  
nomination that the next president doesn't have to talk about 
incrementalism -- the next president is likely to be able to appoint 
at least two Supreme Court Justices,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Labor Agreement Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The labor agreement between the WNBA and its  
players apparently has fallen apart, forcing the league to postpone 
Tuesday's draft indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The league blamed the fledgling union, the WNBA Players  
Association, for making new economic demands after the tentative 
agreement was reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, meanwhile, said the league had introduced last-minute  
terms and conditions in talks late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides reached an agreement in principle April 14 on a  
new four-year contract and had hoped to have it in final written 
form by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal included increases in the minimum salary from $15,000  
to $30,000 for veterans and $25,000 for rookies. Those figures 
would rise to $40,000 and $30,000, respectively, by 2002. The 
benefits package was to include year-round health and dental 
benefits, pension, maternity benefits and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	WNBA president Val Ackerman said Thursday the union is trying to  
renegotiate the rookie minimum salary, player bonuses and the 
rookie scale and reduce the number of appearances players make in 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	A union spokesperson said the league introduced five issues in  
talks Wednesday night and said that if the players' association did 
not agree to them, there would be no deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes was the right to extend the 32-game season  
without increasing salaries, the addition of random drug testing 
and no increase in the rookie wage scale for the duration of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	No agreement had been reached on any of those issues in the  
original bargaining, the spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had hoped to announce the signing of the WNBA's first  
collective bargaining agreement today,'' Ackerman said. ``Instead 
there is no deal and we have no choice but to postpone the draft 
indefinitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No further talks between the union and league were scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston Comets star Sheryl Swoopes isn't pleased with the  
union's stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're in a position right now to say if we don't  
come to these agreements, then we are just not going to play,'' 
Swoopes told Houston's KRIV-TV. ``Our season is three months. We 
can't afford to miss a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Ackerman had called the new agreement ``a landmark, a  
milestone'' for women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-year-old WNBA, which added franchises in Orlando and  
Minnesota for this season, plans for an unprecedented expansion of 
four more cities by 2000. That would increase the league's size to 
16 franchises.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen's Friends Deny Knowing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Police are interviewing them, over and  
over. Reporters are stalking them. Embittered classmates would like 
to talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder that members of the Trenchcoat Mafia, among the  
closest friends of the Columbine High gunmen, are feeling even more 
ostracized than they did before Tuesday's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the shooting, the group of about a dozen boys and girls  
were known around school as outcasts who favored long, black trench 
coats and adopted the trappings of ``Gothic'' subculture, with its 
penchant for black clothes, ghoulish makeup and macabre images. 
</P>
<P>
	Two girls who belonged to the Trenchcoat Mafia asked mourners at  
a memorial service not to blame them for the actions of Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sign they would do this,'' sobbed Nicole Makham.  
``We would just like to say that we're sorry for what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former leader of the Trenchcoat Mafia said the group discussed  
pipe bombs and read about explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a very intellectual group and wondered, are these  
really that easy to make,'' Joe Stair, 18, told the Denver Rocky 
Mountain News. ``Would it be possible to just walk in anywhere and 
buy a couple of things and make a pipe bomb? 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned about it. We went to the library. You can go to any  
library and find books about how to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stair said the group considered testing a bomb in the mountains,  
but says he never bought bomb-making materials and figured the 
interest was just a passing fancy for Harris and Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of the group told The Denver Post that he  
understood why the teens snapped: One of the reasons the Trenchcoat 
Mafia existed, he said, was to give its members a sense of 
belonging in the face of teasing and bullying by other students, 
especially athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't describe how hard it was to get up in the morning and  
face that,'' the 18-year-old, demanding anonymity, told The Denver 
Post. ``Hell ... pure hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that from the time he was a freshman, jocks at the  
school called him ``faggot,'' bashed him into lockers and threw 
rocks at him as he rode his bike home. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know of his friend's plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying what they did was OK,'' he said. ``But I know  
what it's like to be cornered, pushed day after day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the shooting, one member of the group was handcuffed  
and led away for questioning. He was released, but authorities said 
they were not eliminating any suspects as they explore the 
possibility that Klebold and Harris had help in planning or 
executing their attack. 
</P>
<P>
	By the weekend, investigators had conducted some 500 interviews,  
with a special focus on members of the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we know someone who either professes to be a part of that  
group or someone else who can tell us they are a part of that 
group, you bet we'd like to talk to them, probably more than 
anyone,'' said Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students also wanted to talk to the gunmen's friends.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd speak my mind,'' said Aaron Cohn, 15, who narrowly escaped  
being shot in the school library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd tell them they should have known what their friends were  
doing. If you hang out with someone for a year, you should know 
what they're doing. If they're threatening people, building bombs, 
you've got to know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first days after the shooting, Cohn and other students  
talked bitterly of making life even more difficult for members of 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. But Cohn's father, Steve, said the tough talk 
was born more of fear than malice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think kids were ever scared of the trench coats  
before,'' the elder Cohn said. ``They were just different. But now 
the word `trench coat' sends fear into them.''

<HEADLINE> Even First Kentucky Derby Was Smash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The famed Twin Spires had yet to be  
built, and it wasn't even the first Saturday in May. 
</P>
<P>
	But even without Churchill Downs' most famous landmark or the  
mystique of the most famous date in horse racing, the first 
Kentucky Derby still was historic. 
</P>
<P>
	On a bright and sunny Monday -- May 17, 1875 -- an estimated  
10,000 people gathered at the Louisville Jockey Club, three miles 
from downtown, to watch Aristides' shocking upset over stablemate 
Chesapeake. 
</P>
<P>
	This May 1, more than 140,000 fans will show up at the same  
place -- the track became Churchill Downs in 1883 -- for the 125th 
running of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Many things have changed since that Monday: General admission  
prices have risen from 50 cents in 1875 to $35, the race has been 
shortened from 1 1/2 miles to 1 1/4 miles and the purse has increased 
from $3,100 to more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of the first Derby were focused as much on the lively  
and colorful crowd as on the somewhat bizarre way the race 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	William T. Porter of the Louisville Courier-Journal seemed to  
have more of an eye for the women than the horses. His report on 
the Derby began: ``It was made up of every element; but place aux 
dames et demoiselles before the pen shall treat of another feature 
...
</P>
<P>
	``Blondes and brunes there were, stately beauties and petite  
matrons and maids, in such bewildering number as to daze the eye, 
except that the cumulative effect was striking and even glorious to 
such a degree as may not be seen twice in a lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Live Stock Record's opening words were: ``Today  
will ever be historic in the turf annals of Kentucky, as the first 
`Derby Day' of what I hope to see a long series of turf 
festivities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ulysses S. Grant was president and the United States was  
beginning its recovery from the `great financial panic' of 1873. 
Just a few years earlier, talk of reviving racing in Louisville had 
really heated up. 
</P>
<P>
	Horse breeders looked for help from Meriwether Lewis Clark, a  
young Louisville businessman and grandson of William Clark of Lewis 
and Clark expedition fame. With no racing background, Clark decided 
a trip to Europe would give him a quick education in the sport of 
kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, in 1874, Clark returned with a plan: Pattern a  
set of races after England's tradition-rich stakes, including the 
Epsom Derby, the Epsom Oaks, the St. Leger Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He formed the Louisville Jockey Club and Driving Park  
Association, raised $32,000 and leased land own by his two uncles, 
John and Henry Churchill. With borrowed money, a small wooden 
grandstand was built, but it took until Derby Day morning for the 
final nails to be hammered into place. The Twin Spires came later, 
in 1895, when a new grandstand was built. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing fans from all over flocked to the track, riding in  
mule-drawn street cars, fringed-topped buggies, elegant carriages, 
milk wagons and ice wagons, many of which convened in the infield. 
Others arrived by railroad or by foot in what turned into 
Louisville's largest traffic jam in its 95-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, who were encouraged to attend and even had their own  
section in the grandstand, were dressed in their Sunday finest -- 
flowing gowns, expensive bonnets and carrying large parasols. 
Betting was unthinkable for women, but some made wagers anyway, 
sending their husbands down to place bets on their favorite horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of four races went off at 2:30 p.m. Then came the  
Derby, which for weeks had been greatly anticipated. A field of 15 
3-year-olds lined up for the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Chesapeake, coming off a big win just three days earlier in the  
2-mile Citizens' Stakes in Lexington, was considered the favorite. 
Ten Broeck was last in the Citizens' Stakes, and that took some 
luster off his victory in the Phoenix Hotel Stakes in Lexington a 
week before the Derby. Aristides was last in the Phoenix Hotel 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Parimutuel wagering was just being introduced, and the most  
popular method of wagering was auction pools. Two-dollar bettors 
didn't have much chance in these pools, with low bids in the $20 
range. One pool, it was said, had a $260 bid for the 
Chesapeake-Aristides entry, owned by H. Price McGrath, one of 
Kentucky's most colorful horsemen. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath had a familiar racing strategy: Aristides, ridden by  
Oliver Lewis, who like most of the top jockeys of the time was 
black, would be the rabbit. The little chestnut colt would start 
out quickly, tire out the leaders and set up Chesapeake for a 
come-from-behind victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan didn't work out but there still was a happy ending for  
McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby began on the backstretch at the half-mile pole. The  
starter made sure the horses were in line (he actually drew a line 
through the dirt), then banged a drum to signal the start. At the 
same time, a red flag was lowered to alert timekeepers to start 
their watches. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered and the start was clean as Volcano and  
McCreery dueled for the early lead. Aristides was just off the pace 
and Chesapeake was back in the pack. Around the clubhouse turn they 
went, and Aristides took the lead from a tiring McCreery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis pushed Aristides down the backstretch to keep the pace  
fast, and approaching the far turn the jockey eased up on his 
horse. It was time for Chesapeake to move into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	As the field came out of the turn, though, McGrath was  
surprised. Standing near the head of the stretch, he saw no sign of 
Chesapeake among the leaders but Aristides was still in the lead. 
Lewis, not knowing what to do, looked over at McGrath for advice. 
``Go on!'' McGrath shouted, and Lewis did, easing Aristides' reins 
and going on for a two-length victory over Volcano. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 13 colts and two fillies in the first Derby. And the  
winning time of 2:37 3-4 for the 1 1/2 miles was a record for 
3-year-olds. Aristides would go on to win three other stakes on his 
way to recognition as the finest 3-year-old in the land. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, though, what counted was that he had won the Derby,  
the very first one.

<HEADLINE> DiMaggio Honored at N.Y. Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His career was the stuff of story and song, his  
accomplishments extraordinary: the 56-game hitting streak, the 10 
pennants and nine world championships, the retired No. 5, the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Cardinal John O'Connor, speaking Friday at a memorial  
service for New York Yankees great Joe DiMaggio, instead recalled 
what his father once said about the late center fielder: ``DiMaggio 
seems to me to be a very decent fellow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's class and dignity during six decades of public  
scrutiny were reflected in the somber service at St. Patrick's 
Cathedral, where New Yorkers gave Joe D. one final standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	There were celebrities, yes -- Woody Allen, George Steinbrenner,  
Henry Kissinger. But the altar was sparsely decorated, with a few 
tasteful sprays of flowers. There were only two speakers, one-time 
teammate Bobby Brown and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a very simple service,'' O'Connor promised -- and  
it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple yet elegant, much like the man it remembered.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would suggest that rarely was there ever seen such  
consummate skill, grace, power, speed and dignity in one person,'' 
Brown told an overflow crowd at the Manhattan church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Joe is in heaven,'' Brown continued. ``I suspect  
there's a committee up there right now trying to determine when to 
retire his number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seated in a front-row pew were Yankees owner Steinbrenner, Hall  
of Famer Yogi Berra, ex-Secretary of State Kissinger and Giuliani. 
Opposite them were DiMaggio's two granddaughters and his long-time 
friend and attorney, Morris Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Other celebrities paying their final respects included Allen,  
singer Michael Bolton, comedian Joe Piscopo, and sportscasters 
Bryant Gumbel and Bob Costas. Fellow Yankees Hall of Famer Phil 
Rizzuto sat behind Berra; nearby was ex-Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher 
Ralph Branca. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, immortalized in Ernest Hemingway's ``The Old Man and  
the Sea'' and Paul Simon's ``Mrs. Robinson,'' died March 8 of 
complications from lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was buried in California following a small funeral,  
family and friends wanted a service in New York, the city where the 
shy son of a Bay Area immigrant catapulted to national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	He was remembered during the one-hour service as a great leader  
and a great teammate during his 13-year career. Brown and Giuliani 
both predicted his 56-game hitting streak would remain unsurpassed. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was also remembered for his lifestyle after retiring in  
1951, for the way he behaved over the next 48 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always a gentleman, always had a very special style,  
class and dignity,'' said Giuliani, a lifelong Yankees fan. ``Joe 
DiMaggio ultimately transcended the Yankees and New York to become 
a symbol of a simpler America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani then quoted songwriter Simon's ``Mrs. Robinson,'' and  
provided his own answer to the question, ``Where have you gone, Joe 
DiMaggio?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've gone home,'' Giuliani said.  
</P>
<P>
	Simon will perform his song Sunday at Yankee Stadium, when the  
Yankees unveil a granite and bronze monument to DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the church, fans in Yankee hats and shirts milled about,  
hoping for a glimpse of somebody famous and bidding their own 
farewells to the great DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to pay tribute,'' said Jim McGonigle, 27, of Queens,  
who wore a Yankees shirt with DiMaggio's No. 5 on the sleeve. ``I 
was lucky enough to see him throw out the first ball on opening day 
last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the church, as O'Connor wrapped up the service, he  
encouraged the crowd to express its ``gratitude to Joe DiMaggio by 
your applause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church rocked with a roar more appropriate for the city's  
secular house of worship, Yankee Stadium.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Holds Sports Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Having distinguished themselves on the playing  
field for decades, it's time for blacks to claim a greater share of 
the multibillion-dollar sports industry, Olympic gold medalist 
Jackie Joyner- Kersee said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner-Kersee told a group of aspiring teen-age athletes to  
believe in themselves, but also begin to think beyond the actual 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that there's not a lot of African Americans that  
will get million-dollar endorsements,'' Joyner-Kersee said as a 
keynote speaker for a business and sports symposium. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, which attracted about 200 people, was sponsored by  
the Detroit chapter of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	To Joyner-Kersee, the images of the few black athletes seen on  
television and in advertising is supposed to be sufficient 
representation for blacks, but isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us think that when you cross that line and win a gold  
medal, the endorsements are going to be there,'' said 
Joyner-Kersee, who retired in 1998. ``No, it doesn't work that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in advertising company management will have to come  
before it is reflected in advertising endorsements, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where you come in,'' she told the youths. ``You have to  
be the ones that's in advertising that's making the decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she won six Olympic medals, including golds in the  
heptathlon in 1988 and 1992 and the long jump in 1998, 
Joyner-Kersee said she still had a difficult time being marketed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketing of it all is terrible,'' she said. ``You don't  
hear about us until the Olympics. And that's sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her solution was Elite Marketing, a sports marketing and  
management company she started in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always wanted to be a woman of power,'' she said. ``So I put  
my money into my own company.'' More than $500,000 to be exact, 
because she believes there is a major opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's youth-targeted symposium follows the national  
direction of getting young people more involved in the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to allow the young athletes here to see that they  
can do more than to just play the game but to own the game,'' said 
John E. Johnson Jr., executive director of the Detroit NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said it is time for blacks to get involved in other  
aspects of sports, such as front office administration and 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	There was plenty of advice being given to the attentive youth by  
black coaches, successful businessmen and players, who included 
former Detroit Pistons player John Salley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never relax,'' he said. ``Always be 10 times faster, 10 times  
better and 10 times smarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving the basketball court and becoming a businessman,  
Salley shared how he had to learn some expensive lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got burned enough to learn not to touch the stove,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the managing director and chief investment officer  
of No Limit Enterprises, an entertainment and sports conglomerate, 
told the youths to make choices for themselves and be different. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about empowering yourself for the 21st century, which  
means gaining knowledge,'' said Leland Hardy, the young executive 
of the black-owned company that generated over $400 million in 
revenue last year.

<HEADLINE> Human Remains Found in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) -- Human remains have been found on  
the property of a convicted rapist suspected in the deaths of two 
missing college students, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of one person were discovered about 150 miles  
northwest of Los Angeles on the remote property of Rex Allen Krebs, 
Capt. Bart Topham said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Krebs, 33, of Avila Beach, has not been charged but is the  
``sole suspect'' in the disappearances of Aundria Crawford, missing 
six weeks, and Rachel Newhouse, missing for more than five months, 
Topham said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Rex Krebs is responsible for the deaths of Rachel  
Newhouse and Aundria Crawford,'' the captain said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time police have confirmed that they believe  
the women are dead. Ms. Crawford, 20, a Cuesta College sophomore, 
was kidnapped in March from her duplex. Ms. Newhouse, 20, a junior 
at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, was 
assaulted last November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh God, oh God,'' said Krebs' mother, Connie Ridley, 53, of  
Sandpoint, Idaho. ``Why, why, why? I know he's been in trouble, but 
I never figured he'd do this. I'm so sorry for the families, for 
the girls. If there is something I could do for them, I would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krebs, a registered sex offender, has been in custody since last  
month for having a simulated weapon and alcohol, which are parole 
violations. In 1987, he pleaded no contest to rape charges and 
spent about decade in prison.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Panel Delays Slaney Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Mary Slaney will have to wait a  
little longer before track and field's ruling body rules on her 
drug case. 
</P>
<P>
	An arbitration panel was expected to rule Saturday on whether  
the star distance runner took a banned substance before the 1996 
U.S. Olympic trials. Now, the three-member panel won't decide until 
Monday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the International Amateur Athletic Federation  
told The Associated Press the panel is re-examining evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing will continue despite an attempt by Slaney's lawyers  
to stop it. They have sued the IAAF and U.S. Olympic Committee, 
which administered the original test. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, considered the greatest women's distance runner in U.S.  
history, gave a urine sample during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials 
that showed a testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio above the 
6-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF suspended Slaney, claiming USA Track and Field was slow  
to investigate. 

federation cleared the runner.  
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF also cleared Slaney to compete but referred the case to  
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E ratio is used by dozens of sports. It detects the  
presence of testosterone, a naturally occurring muscle-building 
hormone that is also taken in concentrated form to improve 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	A T-E ratio should normally be about 1-1, but Slaney's original  
sample was reportedly higher than the 6-1 ratio that triggers an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, 40, says recent research shows the T-E test is  
unreliable for women in their late 30s or 40s who are taking the 
birth control pill, an argument refuted by the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	The arbitration panel originally met in January, but reconvened  
after lawyers from both sides requested more time to collect 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges on the panel are: chairman Christoph Vedder of  
Germany, Robert Ellicott of Australia and Lin Kokloh of Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Sued for Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Four past and current black employees of  
Coca-Cola Co. are suing the soft-drink giant for discrimination, 
claiming blacks are paid less and have fewer opportunities to 
advance than white employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do barriers exist for African-American employees  
seeking upward advancement within the company, but similar barriers 
virtually segregate the company into divisions where 
African-American leadership is acceptable and divisions where it is 
not,'' the plaintiffs said in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta by  
Washington attorneys Cyrus Mehri and Pamela Coukos. Mehri, a 
veteran of corporate discrimination cases, represented black 
employees who sued Texaco in a case that resulted in a landmark 
$176 million settlement in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the next major glass ceiling case,'' Mehri  
said Friday. ``We expect this to be an epic struggle going on over 
a period of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke officials said the company's attorneys were still reviewing  
the suit. Three of the plaintiffs had filed earlier internal 
complaints, which the company said it had investigated and didn't 
find discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's chairman and chief executive officer, M. Douglas  
Ivester, said in a statement Friday: ``The Coca-Cola Co. was built 
over time by people of all races, colors and creeds. Discrimination 
at Coca-Cola is not tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an e-mail sent to employees, Ivester assured them that  
company policy is that any allegation of discrimination is 
investigated, and ``if we find it, we act to stop it. Our goal is 
the fair, equitable and honest treatment of all of our associates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want each of you to know that while we believe the lawsuit  
is without merit, I take these allegations seriously and our 
management team takes them seriously,'' Ivester wrote. ``As you 
have heard me say many times, we will do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks to include about 1,500 past and current salaried  
black employees at Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the plaintiffs still work at Coke. The complaint says  
that one of them, senior information analyst Linda Ingram, is on 
long-term disability because of depression blamed on her treatment 
at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Another plaintiff, Kimberly Gray Orton, is a former supervisor  
who worked 13 years at Coke. The complaint says she was underpaid 
for years, at times supervising white employees who made as much as 
$7,000 more than she did. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint has scattered anecdotal examples of racial  
insensitivity, from alleged workplace insults to Coke marketers 
relying on racial stereotypes such as blacks living in ghetto 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just at the beginning of this case,'' said Mehri, who  
said the complaint is buttressed by statistical evidence. It says 
the average black Coke employee at corporate headquarters earned 
$45,215 in 1998, compared with $72,045 for the average white 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Baskin said an estimated 27 percent of Coke's U.S. workers are  
minorities, including 15 percent of U.S. managers. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint says few of the black managers reach the highest  
salary levels and tend to be confined to divisions like human 
resources and corporate affairs, which lack the advancement 
potential of white-dominated divisions such as global marketing or 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
	It also says blacks tend to receive worse performance appraisals  
and are terminated at higher rates than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has ``failed to place the same importance on its  
African-American employees'' as it has on marketing to black 
consumers, who make about 25 percent of the purchases of Coke 
brands, the suit says.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- People still smoke in public places like  
classrooms and sometimes even elevators in Mexico -- at least for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved a bill Friday that would ban smoking in  
government offices and public buildings as part of changes to the 
country's health codes. It still must be approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But while internal regulations made the smoking ban effective on  
the floor of congress as of Friday, some legislators continued to 
light up in the legislative building, the daily newspaper Reforma 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican currently bans smoking on most domestic airplane flights  
and in hospitals.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Prosecutors have arrested a man on a U.S.  
extradition warrant for his alleged participation in a prostitution 
ring that took underage Mexican women to southern Florida and 
forced them to work as prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Attorney General's Office said it had arrested Abel Cadena  
Sosa, a Mexican citizen, on charges of international trafficking of 
minors and keeping the women and girls prisoners for the purpose of 
prostitution in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The women and girls -- some as young as 13 -- were promised jobs  
and a new start in the United States but instead found themselves 
enslaved in a prostitution ring run by the Cadena family. 
</P>
<P>
	Five members of that family face charges, most of which carry  
10-year sentences for each illegal immigrant smuggled and kept in 
servitude. The case was uncovered in November when two 15-year-old 
girls escaped from the home where they were kept as prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Abel Cadena was arrested this week in the Gulf coast state of  
Veracruz -- where many of the women were from -- and taken to Mexico 
City, where he faces preliminary extradition hearings. The 
hearings, and subsequent appeals, could delay an extradition for 
months or even years.

<HEADLINE> NBA's Strickland Charged With DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rod Strickland of the Washington Wizards was  
arrested early today in the District of Columbia when police said 
he was driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commander Charles Fonville said a gold Mercedes Benz was  
observed by officers traveling at a high rate of speed at about 
3:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was pulled over and Strickland was administered a field  
sobriety test, Fonville said, ``which he apparently did not pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was processed and released on his own recognizance  
for a later court date. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards lost Friday night to the Atlanta Hawks.  
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, Strickland was convicted of driving while  
impaired and was fined and ordered to complete a driver's 
alcohol-awareness program, perform 30 hours of community service 
and serve a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	District of Columbia Superior Court Judge John Hess dismissed a  
disorderly conduct charge stemming from Strickland's early-morning 
arrest in Septmber 1997.

<HEADLINE> Diary Details Colo. Massacre Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A detailed diary by one of the Columbine  
High School gunmen showed they were ``going for the big kill'' in a 
suicide attack that had been planned for a year before they struck 
on Adolf Hitler's birthday, the sheriff said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line of this thing is they wanted to do as much  
damage as they could possibly do, and destroy this school, and 
destroy as many children as they could and go out in flames,'' 
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the strongest official statement about the motive for  
Tuesday's murder-suicide rampage that killed 12 students, one 
teacher and two teen gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The handwritten diary, discovered in one of the gunmen's homes,  
uses German phrases and goes back a year. Stone said the assailants 
reasoning was: ``We want to be different, we want to be strange and 
we don't want jocks or other people putting (us) down. ... We're 
going to punish you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said he didn't know which of the gunmen kept the diary.  
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff also placed some blame on the parents of Dylan  
Klebold and Eric Harris. He noted that along with the diary, 
investigators found a shotgun barrel on a dresser and bomb-making 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of this stuff was clearly visible and the parents should  
have known,'' said Stone. ``I think parents should be accountable 
for their kid's actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parents have not commented beyond separate written  
statements released by their attorneys. The statements expressed 
sorrow and sympathy for the victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
	The diary shows that Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, had been  
planning the attack for a year. The teens also had a school map 
that noted where the school was ill-lit and pointed out possible 
hiding places. The diary also revealed that they monitored the 
lunch room to find out when the greatest number of people would be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were going for a big kill,'' said Stone. ``This had been  
on their minds and they've been planning this particular thing and 
they've been building bombs ... for a considerable period of time. 
They've been acquiring weaponry for a considerable period of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why they picked April 20, the sheriff said, ``It was  
Hitler's birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``It was a Nazi kind of thing.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stone brief reporters as a weekend of funerals began. At the  
Trinity Christian Center, a mile south of Columbine High, students 
walked to the pulpit one by one to mourn Rachel Scott, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobbing and hollow-eyed, they remembered a girl who loved life,  
adored acting and was nice to people she didn't know. ``A truer 
friend you couldn't find,'' Nick Baumgart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier friends and family wrote comments in black felt pen on  
the Miss Scott's casket. Friends said she was killed outside the 
school, one of the first to be shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidi Johnson, a friend of Miss Scott's since fourth grade,  
wiped tears as she kneeled and wrote on the casket, ``Rachel, I'm 
so proud of you! I will miss you dearly. You were truly one of my 
true best friends and I love you from the bottom of my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other messages said, ``See you in Heaven,'' ``You are my hero,''  
and ``You always brought a smile to my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her father wrote simply: ``I love you. Dad. Forever.''  
</P>
<P>
	Police have interviewed hundreds of witnesses and collected  
2,000 pieces of evidence, down to the smallest scraps of metal at 
the school, in the search not only for a motive but to determine 
whether Harris and Klebold had accomplices, before or during the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and police had described one gunman wearing a white  
T-shirt, while witnesses also spoke of two gunmen in dark dusters. 
But the body of one of the gunmen did not have a trench coat on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very possible, we're thinking now, that maybe the trench  
coat was shed at some point,'' said sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis. ``Now ... maybe we're back to two suspects instead of the 
white-shirt third suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But later Davis said that ``the chances are even increasing'' of  
``further involvement'' by others. He refused to give details, 
saying, ``We have to be very, very careful at this point of what we 
release.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made and no other suspects beyond the dead  
gunmen have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the same clique of trench coat-clad outsiders --  
called the Trenchcoat Mafia -- in which the gunmen belonged -- 
described being taunted by other students. 
</P>
<P>
	The youth told The Denver Post that life for members of his  
group as ``hell ... pure hell.'' He said that athletes at the 
school called him ``faggot,'' bashed him into lockers and threw 
rocks at him as he rode his bike home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't describe how hard it was to get up in the morning and  
face that,'' the 18-year-old, demanding anonymity, told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he did not know of his friends' violent plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying what they did was OK,'' he said. ``But I know  
what it's like to be cornered, pushed day after day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, police discounted a note purported to be from one of  
the assailants warning of more violence next week. Earlier, police 
had expressed fears about the threat and said they didn't think the 
note was a hoax. Hours later, they said they believed it didn't 
come from either of the gunmen.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Weeks, maybe months from now, little  
moments will remind them of what two misfit boys armed with very 
adult weapons stole from them. 
</P>
<P>
	A Kansas farmer won't harvest wheat with his grandson for the  
first summer in 12 years. A best friend won't be buying a fishing 
boat with his buddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Empty chairs in Bible study. Lighter grocery sacks and smaller  
laundry piles. Unfinished plays and shuttered piano keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
	Remove one person from the fabric of this world and it leaves a  
gap. Remove 15, and the void is enormous. But it is in the 
discovery of the little absences -- the small holes -- that 
heartbreak awaits the friends and families of the victims of Eric 
Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	For Columbine football coach Andy Lowry, it might be next August  
when it's time to hand lineman Matt Kechter his extra-large 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kechter's kid brother, it might be this week, when he steps  
off the school bus and finds nobody there to shoot hoops in the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt always waited by the mailbox for his little brother to  
come home from school,'' said Greg Barnes, a sophomore basketball 
player. ``He was the most innocent person I knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the parents of Steven Curnow, there will be a hollowness on  
May 19, when the latest installment of the ``Star Wars'' saga is to 
open in movie theaters with inescapable hype. 
</P>
<P>
	Curnow, 14, wanted to become a Navy top gun and pilot his own  
F16. But in a recliner armed with a remote control, he was 
transported to ``Star War's'' mythical world ``a long time ago in a 
galaxy far, far away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They could hear their son rewinding the trilogy's videos and  
precisely mimicking the characters' dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Obi-Wan Kenobi: ``Use the force, Luke.''  
</P>
<P>
	Darth Vader: ``I find your lack of faith ... disturbing.''  
</P>
<P>
	For Michelle Oetter, it will come on May 1. She had looked  
forward to wearing her new silver drop earrings and matching twisty 
necklace to the prom at Ponderosa High School. 
</P>
<P>
	In her dreams she danced with her boyfriend, John Tomlin. ``He  
treated me like I was queen of the world,'' she blurted through 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, somebody will return his rented tux -- black with a  
white vest and silver trim to match her jewelry -- while his remains 
return to his native Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those whose lives were spared are confronted with what they  
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	When Richard Castaldo awoke in Swedish Medical Center and was  
strong enough to speak, he asked his father to bring him his Led 
Zeppelin CDs to intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year old can nod his head as Robert Plant wails on  
``Whole Lotta Love.'' But he can't tap his foot or jam on an air 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	Castaldo is paralyzed from the shoulders down. He was eating  
lunch outside when he was cut down where he sat by a burst of 
semiautomatic weapons fire. Five bullets ripped through his chest 
and back, fragmenting two vertebrae between his shoulder blades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything north of that works,'' said trauma surgeon William  
Pfeifer. 
</P>
<P>
	Castaldo asked his father who was killed at Columbine. He cried  
as the names of his classmates were recited. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't lift his hand to wipe his tears.  
</P>
<P>
	Some try to force the issue, rather than wait to discover what's  
been stolen. Three days after Cassie Bernall's murder, 40 
teen-agers from her bible study group at the West Bowles Community 
Church boarded the same bus that she rode for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Their destination: Cassie's bedroom.  
</P>
<P>
	It looked as if she was expected home at any minute: Clothes  
scattered on the floor. Sparkly blue nail polish and a worn emory 
board. A love poem taped to the wall. A teacher's note: ``I cannot 
see how you missed the purpose of the assignment so completely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernall was executed in the library after she told one of the  
gunmen that she believed in God. On her backpack hung a bracelet 
engraved with the question, ``What would Jesus Do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her father climbed to the roof above her room Tuesday night to  
hold a vigil with high-powered binoculars trained on the library 
where his missing daughter lay slain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Death is not our friend,'' pastor David McPherson told the  
youths. ``But it is our companion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Claude Rohrbough's companion will be gone.  
</P>
<P>
	Since he was 3, freshman Danny Rohrbough had helped his  
grandfather harvest hard red winter wheat every July on 720 acres 
near Colby, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Other kids played with Tonka toys. But Danny would ride in the  
cab of the real McCoy, a diesel combine, perched nearly two stories 
above the amber waves of grain. Its giant blades can devour a man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, he wanted to drive,'' Claude Rohrbough said. ``It  
wasn't until last year that we allowed him to operate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 15, Danny was a quick study.  
</P>
<P>
	He learned to judge when the wheat was ready. First you snap the  
dry, hard head from the stalk. Then you carefully chew the pebbly 
kernels, feeling how they break. 
</P>
<P>
	He learned the right height to cut the wheat stalks, never  
exceeding 4 mph, and how to pivot the mechanized beast at the end 
of the row, trailing a golden wake of stalks and stubble. 
</P>
<P>
	He might have been the only kid at Columbine High who knew these  
things. 
</P>
<P>
	For that week, he was a world away from Nintendo, booming  
stereos and playing roller hockey in baggy shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny was shot holding an exit door open so others could flee.  
He died on the sidewalk a few steps from safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Claude Rohrbough paused for what seemed to be an eternity.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll miss his help,'' Danny's grandfather said, finally.  
``We'll have to find a way to do it without him.''

<HEADLINE> Push On for Vote on Campaign Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign reform is back, the idea whose time  
never seems to come, although the sponsors always say this is it. 
That's what they're saying now, as they look for routes around 
roadblocks in the Republican Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the push is on, largely by Democrats, to compel  
through petition action that the GOP leadership doesn't want at 
this point. With 218 signatures, a majority, a bill can be forced 
to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Under similar pressure last year, Republican leaders agreed to  
bring it up and the House approved a campaign finance bill, 
252-179. It was a safe vote for a popular cause; everybody knew the 
Senate wouldn't pass it. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be approved there, too, if it came to a vote. Fifty-two  
senators voted for the measure on a preliminary motion last time. 
But Republican opponents have filibustered to block it before, and 
would again. It would take 60 votes to get past them. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised a vote on the  
campaign bill again this year, but not yet. He wants to wait until 
later in the session, after appropriations and other major measures 
have been handled. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign bill would ban so-called soft money, the unlimited  
donations that can be made to political parties. The illegal 
foreign contributions to the Democrats during President Clinton's 
1996 re-election campaign were in the form of soft-money donations. 
</P>
<P>
	To underline that point, the Senate version of the bill would  
specifically prohibit contributions from foreign governments or 
foreign nationals to any U.S. election campaign -- federal, state or 
local. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures also would restrict the growing use of issue ads,  
in which corporations or unions skirt the bar against direct 
spending on campaigns by buying radio or television ads, supposedly 
on issues but effectively against a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocacy groups -- read special interests -- could continue  
advertising in campaigns but would have to disclose their 
expenditures and the sources of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to start somewhere and that place is here and that  
time is now,'' said Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House 
Democratic leader, urging prompt action. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Republican leaders have stifled reform bills for two  
years. ``First it was death by amendment,'' Gephardt said. ``Now it 
is death by delay. Well, it is now or never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it may be neither. The sponsors say they're not  
quitting, no matter the setbacks. ``The American campaign finance 
system is manifestly corrupt,'' said Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. 
``So we are back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona is the lead sponsor of  
the Senate bill, giving a bipartisan stamp to a bill that has that 
word in its title, ``The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1999.'' 
There is a GOP sponsor in the House, too: Rep. Christopher Shays of 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is a reformer with heavy fund-raising demands of his own  
this time, running for president in a crowded, high-cost campaign 
for the Republican nomination in 2000. He's reported raising $1.8 
million, and has transferred another $2 million from his Senate 
campaign to his current quest. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a beginning, but no match for the $7.6 million reported  
March 31 by Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore raised $8.9 million for his Democratic  
campaign, toward a target of $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For Bush, the fund-raising budget may be $50 million, enough to  
do without federal campaign aid, which carries with it limits on a 
candidate's spending in running for the nomination, overall and 
state by state. 
</P>
<P>
	By forgoing federal campaign money, he wouldn't be bound by  
limits on spending in the early primaries, the ones that really 
count, with big state primaries lined up on March 7 and the 
nomination likely to be won at the start.

	That doesn't fit the system Congress designed in 1974.  
State-by-state spending ceilings work when the campaign progresses

<P>
	There's been no talk of changing that system.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Talk Peace With China, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- North and South Korea opened a new phase in their  
peace talks Saturday, beginning what was to be their first 
substantive negotiations with China and the United States after 
more than a year of meetings to lay the groundwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a little bit of patience since it's a very complicated  
matter which has been in existence for almost half a century,'' 
said Qian Yong-nian, head of the Chinese delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	The four former combatants in the Korean War have said it is  
likely to take years to write a peace treaty to replace the 
temporary armistice that ended the 1950-53 conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	It already has taken four rounds, starting in December 1997,  
just to agree on how to proceed. After the opening session 
Saturday, the delegates were to work in two committees -- one to 
reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula and the other to decide how 
to put in place a permanent peace. The round was expected to 
conclude Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the procedural agreement, there remained a key  
difference. North Korea continues to insist that the talks include 
Pyongyang's demand that the United States withdraw its 37,000 
troops from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But Park Kun-Woo, head of the South Korean delegation, told  
reporters Saturday, ``The only thing I can tell you for sure is 
that the role of the U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula is not on 
the agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park did say, however, that ``the disposition of all forces''  
could be discussed once ``substantial progress'' was made on the 
peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the last session in January, the United States and North  
Korea have been able to resolve one dispute: North Korea agreed in 
New York last month to give the United States access to a site 
suspected of being an underground nuclear facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States reportedly agreed to provide the  
famine-stricken country with 600,000 tons of food. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has had less success in its efforts to curb  
North Korea's missile program. The United States maintains North 
Korea is the world's No. 1 exporter of missile equipment and 
technology, including sales to countries including Pakistan and 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea has said it will suspend its exports if the United  
States compensates it in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional tensions flared last month when North Korea sent spy  
ships into Japanese waters, triggering the first active deployment 
of Japanese warships since World War II.

	Diary Indicates Shooting Well Planned  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A diary found in one of the Colorado  
gunmen's home indicates that a year of planning went into the 
shooting spree, and the local sheriff says some of the blame must 
fall on the shooter's parents. Along with the diary, investigators 
found a shotgun barrel on a dresser and bomb-making materials. 
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone wouldn't say in which gunman's 
home these items were found. ``A lot of this stuff was clearly 
visible and the parents should have known,'' said Stone. ``I think 
parents should be accountable for their kid's actions.'' The 
shooting at Columbine High School claimed 15 lives, including the 
two gunmen.

	Friends Mourn Teen Killed in Colo.  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Friends of 17-year-old Rachel Scott  
remembered her as more than just a victim of the shooting spree 
that hit Columbine High: to one, she was a fun prom date, to 
another, a budding actress and playwright. And suddenly she was 
gone. On Saturday, weeping and hollow-eyed, they mourned her in a 
sad parade, their reminiscences melting together into a portrait of 
a truly extraordinary girl. ``I was so proud of that girl. She was 
talented and beautiful, and I know that she's with us still,'' said 
Paula Reed, Ms. Scott's forensics teacher. ``But she took part of 
me with her.''

	Oil Will Flow To Serbs, Russia Says  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the second day of their summit, NATO  
leaders said today that military commanders were laying plans under 
orders issued last night for sea searches to ``switch off the oil 
tap'' fueling Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's military 
machine. But Russia, angry about 32 days of airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia, indicated it would ignore an embargo. ``According to 
international law, sanctions cannot be imposed unless they are 
approved by the (U.N.) Security Council,'' Russian Foreign Minister 
Igor Ivanov said on a trip to Egypt. ``We will continue delivering 
oil in keeping with our international commitments.'' Russia and 
Libya are Yugoslavia's key oil suppliers. 

</P>
<P>
	Nuclear Launch Codes Left Behind  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton departed the NATO summit in  
such haste today that he left behind perhaps the most important 
piece of luggage in the world -- the ``nuclear football.'' The 
president's military aide, who constantly shadows Clinton and 
carries the briefcase containing U.S. nuclear launch codes, was 
mistakenly left at the International Trade Center when Clinton's 
motorcade sped off 45 minutes early and without notice. The aide 
walked the 4 1/2 blocks back to the White House without incident.

	U.S. Expecting Kosovo Refugees  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kosovo refugees are being processed in  
Macedonia by State Department and U.S. immigration officials, and 
thousands will be flown from Macedonia to the United States to join 
relatives who immigrated earlier, the White House said today. The 
United States is taking in some 20,000 ethnic Albanians of the 
estimated 800,000 to 1 million who fled or were forced to leave 
Kosovo by Serb troops. Priority is being given to refugees with 
relatives in the United States.

	Court Bars Use of Rival Trademark  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal appeals court outlawed a stealth  
weapon in the Internet commerce wars by forbidding companies from 
using their rivals' trademarks to steal business through Web sites. 
The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involves the 
practice of including a competitors' trademark or brand name in an 
Internet site, either as the address or through what are known as 
``meta-tags,'' which are embedded in a Web page's coding and will 
point a search program toward a particular site.

	Coyotes Tie Series  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Shane Doan scored the winning goal 8:58 into  
overtime today, and the Coyotes beat the St. Louis Blues 4-3 to end 
goalie Grant Fuhr's playoff domination of their franchise and tie 
the first-round series 1-1. It was a dramatic comeback for the 
Coyotes, who had their only lead at 3-2 on Keith Carney's 
unassisted goal late in the third period, only to see Pavol Demitra 
tie it with 3:18 left. Had the Coyotes lost, they would have faced 
a 2-0 deficit going into Game 3 tomorrow and the prospect of 
possibly not returning to their home arena.

	Giants Beat Rockies  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Charlie Hayes hit a two-run triple in his  
first game back from a suspension and Shawn Estes pitched seven 
strong innings today to give the San Francisco Giants a 8-4 win 
against the Colorado Rockies. Hayes went 2-for-4 and also scored 
two runs in his return from a four-game suspension for charging 
Arizona pitcher Todd Stottlemyre from second base last week.

<HEADLINE>  Crowd Rallies for Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With a bullhorn in hand, Obanion Gordon  
wanted to make sure his message Saturday was loud and clear: A 
corrupt legal system put former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal on 
death row, not the bullet that killed a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state has always lynched black males, especially black  
males who have been passionate about the liberations of their 
people,'' said Gordon as he led 30 protesters over a bridge from 
Camden, N.J., into Philadelphia on Abu-Jamal's 45th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's group was among the thousands of people who traveled  
from as far away as France to demand a new trial for Abu-Jamal, who 
was convicted in the 1981 death of police Officer Daniel Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
	Three groups of protesters marched with police escorts to City  
Hall to listen to speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to estimate the size of the crowd that attended  
the downtown rally and march. Organizers who had promised 
``hundreds of thousands'' would show up to ``shut down the city'' 
claimed afterward an attendance of about 25,000. Unofficial 
estimates placed the number at 8,000 to 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has been on Pennsylvania's death row since 1982, when  
he was convicted of shooting Faulkner after coming upon his brother 
struggling with the officer after a traffic stop. Faulkner also 
wounded Abu-Jamal, and the two were found bleeding a few feet from 
each other with Abu-Jamal's gun lying nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	No execution date has been set.  
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system -- and  
efforts to win a new trial -- have made him a worldwide celebrity. 
He has contended that his conviction sprung from a biased judge and 
an ineffective counsel, which have become focal points for death 
penalty critics. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say Abu-Jamal, who has never given his version of  
events, was framed in Faulkner's slaying because he was a black 
activist who supported the radical MOVE organization and helped 
found Philadelphia's chapter of the Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's conviction was upheld in 1989 by the state Supreme  
Court. In 1995, it also let stand a ruling that denied a new trial 
he sought based on new evidence. His lawyers have said they will 
appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and prosecutors say Abu-Jamal was fairly convicted based  
on physical evidence and testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown San Francisco, police said between 12,000 and 15,000  
people attended a march in support of Abu-Jamal.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Winds Sweep Across Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Winds gusting at more than 100 mph toppled  
tractor-trailers and cut power to about 10,000 people in northern 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	A gust of 113 mph was reported Friday at the Brigham City  
Airport while sustained winds of 50 mph were common. Police 
reported more than $750,000 in damage at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Eskelsen, spokesman for Utah Power, said as many as 10,000  
customers were without power at some point during the day. Crews 
hoped to have power restored by today. Schools throughout northern 
Utah closed because of the outages. 
</P>
<P>
	In Weber County, a crane being used to renovate the Ogden  
Municipal Building buckled and fell across the top of the 
nine-story building. The 500-pound wrecking ball attached to the 
crane landed on top of the jail, forcing some workers to evacuate 
for a short time. Inmates were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	A northern stretch of Interstate 15, the state's main  
north-south road, was closed for most of the day after winds tipped 
over more than 20 trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	William Alder, chief meteorologist with the National Weather  
Service in Salt Lake City, said the strong easterly winds are 
generally caused when a high-pressure system in western Wyoming 
bumps into a low-pressure system centered over the Great Basin. The 
winds were expected to calm today.
