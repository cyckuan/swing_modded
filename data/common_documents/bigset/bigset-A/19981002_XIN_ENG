<HEADLINE> Blair Urges Tough International Action on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Thursday called on the international community to take tough
actions over the worsening Kosovo situation after two recent mass
killings of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Blair told reporters Thursday: "It is clear that diplomatic
solution alone will not work. We have to send the strongest
possible message to (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic that
we will not tolerate any more of these atrocities."
</P>
<P>
Blair, who is attending the annual Labor Party conference in
Blackpool, noted that Britain had been calling on the
international community for months to take "more robust action in
relation to Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC Radio that
Britain was seeking international community agreement for possible
armed interventions in Kosovo, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Next week we get the (United Nations) report, next week if
that report makes clear that (Yugoslav President Slobodan)
Milosevic is not complying with the Security Council resolution,
then NATO is ready to act with air strikes," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is ready to act. We (are)now to seek the agreement of
the international community," Cook said, adding those possible air
attacks "may not stop in Kosovo".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Yugoslav government has flatly denied any
responsibility for the killings of some 30 Albanians at two sites in
Kosovo over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, Britain announced Wednesday it would
host an urgent meeting of senior officials of the Contact Group,
including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Germany in London Friday to discuss the worsening situation in
Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Duo Ji Cai Rang, China's
Minister of Civil Affairs, is the winner of 1998 Sasakawa Disaster
Prevention Award, The United Nations announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The award is in recognition of his distinguished contribution
to disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness, the U.N.
Department of Public information (DPI) in New York said in a press
release on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Angsheng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has
been designated as co-winner of the award, it said.
</P>
<P>
The award is being presented in the wake of the worst floods
China suffered this century, which claimed over 3,000 lives.
Economic damage is estimated to reach around 30 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The award is a tribute to the work of the Chinese Government in
reducing the human and economic impact of the floods, which could
have taken a far larger toll of the country, DPI said.
</P>
<P>
Duo Ji Cai Rang has played a key role in the establishment of
China's National Disaster Reduction Plan. He also led the planning
and building of the Chinese National Center for Natural Disaster
Reduction, and the creation of a network on national disaster
information and evaluation systems.
</P>
<P>
Wang Angsheng, a scientist and member of the Chinese Institute
of Atmospheric Physics and of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is
being recognized for his many activities to raise awareness about
the importance of natural disaster prevention and preparedness
both regionally and internationally.
</P>
<P>
The award will be presented to the winners at a ceremony at the
U.N. Office in Geneva on 14 October when World Disaster Reduciton
Day is observed.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not to Allow Others to Threaten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo said Thursday South Africa would not allow "rogue elements"
to scupper regional efforts to build peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the South African Institute of International
Affairs in Johannesburg here, Nzo said South Africa was not
prepared to allow the violent overthrow of the Lesotho
government.
</P>
<P>
"We were not willing to stand by... and see certain groups in
Lesotho refuse to explore all possible means of dispute
resolution, rather trying to win enough time to violently
overthrow the government," said Nzo when explaining Pretoria's
role in a military intervention in Lesotho last week.
</P>
<P>
"There is no greater threat to our collective efforts to build
peace and prosperity than these types of rogue elements," Nzo
said, noting that South Africa would act in an appropriate manner
in response to each situation that arose.
</P>
<P>
An 800-strong troops from South Africa and Botswana entered
Lesotho on September 22 at the invitation of Lesotho Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili to help restore law and stability in
the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho was in turmoil since early August, and its government
became paralyzed in mid-September when opposition parties and
mutinous soldiers in the country claimed the May 23 general
election was rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Nzo pointed out that human rights and democracy would not
automatically bring a better world. For these principles to
flourish, an environment of peace was required.
</P>
<P>
He said that South Africa would "continue to fight for the
transformation of international relations so as to eradicate
aggression, the usurping of power,... foreign occupation, and the
use force."

ADDIS ABABA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) called Thursday for a six-month
Extension of the cease-fire in Sudan and its inclusion of
provinces beside Bahr el Ghazal.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here by UNICEF's Addis Ababa Office
said the three-month cease-fire between the Sudanese Government
and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) must be
extended in time and broadened in scope.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire expires on October 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The release said, the cease-fire enabled the humanitarian
community to address the acute crisis in southern Sudan, adding
as this opportunity will end now, the result would be continued
sufferings for the nation as a whole and for the children and
women of southern Sudan in particular.
</P>
<P>
It said, "a prolonged cease-fire must include all areas of
southern Sudan and be seen as a step toward a permanent political
settlement -- so that the civilian population can escape a
continuation of the famine and war-related carnage that have
ravaged their lives."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, as the leading U.N. agency which has an office in
southern Sudan, is engaged in a wide range of humanitarian
activities in the country, the release added.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said on Thursday that progress was made during a three-way
summit in Washington early this week over the long-delayed Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks in Gaza upon returning from Cairo,
where he briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on his meeting
with the United States President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait and see until the next meeting which will take
place between me and Netanyahu and (U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine) Albright," Arafat said, referring to a question whether
he expects an agreement to be signed in the near future for the
Israeli troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to visit the Middle East next week to prepare
for another three-way summit in Washington in the middle of the
month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly called on Israel to hand over another
13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in return for
crackdown on Islamic militants by Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, but Israel has
not, citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that it would hand over 10 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians and turn the rest 3 percent into a nature
reserve, in which the Palestinians would have limited
administrative power.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeina, Arafat's senior adviser, told Voice of
Palestine radio on Thursday that the gap between Israel and the
Palestinians over the Israeli withdrawal "still exists and it is
big."
</P>
<P>
But he said that in the coming two weeks, the U.S. will make a
new round of mediation in the region and that "it will be an
opportunity to get a breakthrough."

<HEADLINE> Commercial Ship Kidnaped in N. E. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 1 (xinhua) -- Somali gunmen in the
northeastern port of Bossaso have kdnapedSomali commercial
vessel "Nur Star" heading for Yeman, informed sources said in
Mogadishu Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Aden Gelle, representative of the owner of the ship,
told reporters that six gunmen stormed into the ship Tuesday and
forced its captain to sail it into the main sea. The ship was
taken away as it was getting ready for taking goats and sheep to
Yemen for a commercial purpose.
</P>
<P>
Gelle said the gunmen have wounded one of the crew and threw
six others off the ship at seashores off Habo village, about 80
kilometers east of Bossaso. The six crew members were rescued by
fishermen on small boats.
</P>
<P>
The ship is owned by Somali businessman Mohamed Abdullahi Nur
from northwestern regions, while the kidnappers are from Majerten
clan which is very popular in the sea piracy business along the
northeastern coasts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the kidnapping is unknown. But sources said the
gunmen have demanded a ransom of 100,000 U.S. Dollars in return
for the release of the ship.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Peace Hampered by Arms Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of rival Northern Irish
parties on Thursday failed to end a disarmament stalemate that has
hampered the province's peace process.
</P>
<P>
After 75 minutes of talks, First Minister David Trimble said he
hoped Irish republican chief Gerry Adams would help his IRA
guerrilla allies face up to the need for scrapping arms. The Irish
Republican Army has spurned all such demands, according to
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Adams countered that pro-British stalwart Trimble should press
ahead with setting up structures to give Sinn Fein its first-ever
role in running the British province.
</P>
<P>
"We did have a good discussion. There obviously hasn't been a
breakthrough but I don't think anyone expected it," Reuters quoted
Adams as saying after his third round of talks with Trimble in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
But the talks were called "useful" and were expected to
continue.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work at it. If there is a political will
to resolve this within the context of the Agreement, then it can
be done," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who leads the powerful Protestant Ulster Unionist
Party (UUP), and Adams, whose Sinn Fein party draws support among
Catholics supporters of Irish unity, negotiated the Good Friday
Agreement along with other political groups in April in a bid to
end years of conflict over the future of British rule.
</P>
<P>
But a wrangle over long-standing demands for the IRA and
pro-British "loyalist" militias to disarm is delaying progress on
the formation of structures that are part of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Combatants called ceasefires which paved the way for agreement
on a new administration in which Protestants and Catholics would
share power in Belfast and creation of links with Dublin to
promote a new era of island-wide co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Trimble insisted that the IRA dismantles its vast armouries
before Sinn Fein gets a seat on the new institutions.
</P>
<P>
"There is a failure to realize on the part of Sinn Fein that
decommissioning (disarmament) is actually part of the Agreement,"
Trimble was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters.
</P>
<P>
"All of society is calling for this to happen and the problem
arises because a small element within the republican movement
can't face up to its responsibilities...I hope Mr Adams can help
them," the UUP leader said.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners are being freed early as part of the peace deal and
Britain has also reduced its military presence. The accord also
calls for arms decommissioning within two years.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein accuses unionists of trying to make early disarmament
a precondition of republicans' entry to government.
</P>
<P>
"There is at the moment a quite clear difference of
interpretation about what is in the Agreement," Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments are anxious that Trimble and
Adams quickly narrow the gap in time to meet an October 31 target
for action on all-Ireland co-operation.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Employing Local People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Labor and Social
Security Minister Peter Machungwa Thursday criticized some
employers for not utilizing the services of local human resources
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Opening the first annual convention of the Zambia Institute of
Human Resources Management (ZIHRM) here in Lusaka, the minister
said the employers do not accept the idea of maintaining a human
resources department with a Zambian employed as human resources
practitioner.
</P>
<P>
"The human resource is one of the important factors in the
production process. Its management, therefore, is crucial to the
success of any enterprise," said Machungwa.
</P>
<P>
He complained that some new employers have brought in their
own human resources practitioners or consultants from their own
countries of origin, who in most cases, are not registered with
the institutions concerned.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged workers of Zambia, employers and
organizations concerned with labor matters and the human
resources management and industrial relations fields in
particular, to exercise the highest possible degree of
discipline.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the maintenance of industrial democracy and good
labor-management relations in the work place lies in an effective
preventive mediation and conciliation machinery.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa advocated the principle of give-and-take, describing
it very important in maintaining industrial peace.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Airline Admits Carrying Nerve Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) - - Israeli El Al airline
confirmed on Thursday that its cargo plane that crashed in
Amsterdam six years ago was carrying the chemical used to produce
the deadly sarin gas.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, El Al spokesman
Nachman Klieman said that the plane was carrying dimethyl
methylphosphonate, a key component of sarin, when it crashed
into an apartment block and killed 43 people.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after a Dutch newspaper reported early this
week that the El Al plane was carrying 190 litters of dimethyl
methylphosphonate.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the Chemical was transported to
the Institute for Biological Research in the Tel Aviv suburb
of Ness Ziona to make chemical and biological weapons there.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Transport Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadiah said on
Thursday that though there was nothing new in the Dutch
newspaper's report, Israel's Civil Aviation Authority will look
into it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it will not be a new investigation of the
crash but only a check into the specific claim about nerve gas
components.
</P>
<P>
The airline spokesman claimed that immediately after the
accident Israel handed over the cargo manifest to the Dutch
government, on which the name of the chemical was listed.
</P>
<P>
Klieman also noted that the chemical dimethyl
methylphosphonate, which can also be used as a flame retardant
and in the manufacture of plastic, is approved for transport on
both passenger and cargo planes.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder to Be Confirmed as German Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Schroeder, who defeated
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany's general elections last Sunday,
is set to be formally elected as chancellor by parliament on
October 27, officials of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agenda worked out on Thursday by leaders of the SPD
and its potential coalition partner, the Greens, the two parties
plan to wind up their negotiations to form a center-left coalition
government by October 23.
</P>
<P>
Should the SPD and the Greens be able to agree on a coalition,
the new German Bundestag (lower house of parliament), in which the
SPD and the Greens together will hold a 21-seat majority, is due
to convene its first session on October 26 and will formally elect
Schroeder as chancellor the day after.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from an informal coalition talks between the SPD and
Greens, Schroeder told reporters that the talks had proceeded in a
"friendly atmosphere" and both sides agreed to push forward the
negotiations swiftly.
</P>
<P>
According to Schroeder, the distribution of future cabinet
posts, a potential bone of contention, has not been discussed
Thursday. "We have to agree upon a solid and financible common
program at first," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SPD and Greens, both in opposition in the past 16 years,
broadly agree on economic and social issues, including job
creation, tax reforms and immigration policy. However, the SPD
could have great difficulties to tackle some radical demands from
the Greens like the shutdown of nuclear power plants and its
opposition to the NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has said that he would pursue the coalition
negotiations to form a stable government under the guidelines of
"economic stability, social order and continuity in foreign
policy".
</P>
<P>
Under the current agenda, Schroeder will not represent Germany
at the European Union summit on October 24-25 in Portschach,
Austria. Kohl, who acts as a caretaker during the transitional
period, has made clear he would not attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
German press reports quoted government sources as saying that
Germany is mostly likely to be represented at the EU summit by the
incumbent foreign minister and vice-chancellor Klaus Kinkel.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The rebels fighting to oust
Congolese President Laurent Kabila captured Punia town Wednesday,
Rwanda News Agency reported in Kigali Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Punia town is located 200 km north of Kindu, a key base for
Kabila's loyalist forces and their allies targeted by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rebel-controlled radio Bukavu Thursday quoted a senior rebel
commander as claiming that a whole company of Kabila's troops
surrendered and joined the rebel side.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi-led rebels took up arms to fight Kabila since August 2
and their offensive in the west was routed by allied forces of
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of
invading to back the rebels but the two countries deny direct
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa and Bangui Wednesday confirmed Chadian troops are at
present in Congo (K) to help Kabila to cope with the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels have condemned France for not having
intervened to stop Chad from sending troops to prop up Kabila,
radio Bukavu said.
</P>
<P>
Chad dispatched about 1,000 soldiers to help Kabila in his war
against the rebels in the east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Blair's Visit to Bejing Marks New Chapter, Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, England, October 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's upcoming visit to Beijing "marks a new
chapter in British-Chinese relations," a Downing Street spokesman
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which begins on October 6, "comes at a time when
bilateral relations with China have been never so good," said
Blair's chief spokesman Alistare Campbell at a news briefing in
Blackpool, a coastal city in northwestern England where the annual
Labor Party Conference is holding.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the bilateral relations are no longer plagued by
the difficult past after Hong Kong was handed over to China last
year and the successful transition of Hong Kong has proved that
pesimism was wrong.
</P>
<P>
"Britain has also been struck by the new responsibility that
China is showing to the global financial crisis and the prime
minister believes the way is now open to Britain to forge a new
partnership relations with China," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On the purpose of the visit, Campbell said Blair will first of
all use the visit to expand a deepened relationship with China on
some specific international issues such as financial crisis,
crimes and drugs, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, global poverty
and environment.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the prime minister will strengthen commercial and
economic ties with China. Blair will be accompanied by a
substantial senior business delegation which will sign some
important contracts with China.
</P>
<P>
Blair also hopes to take the chance to further strengthen his
personal relationship with his Chinese counterpart Zhu Rongji, of
whom Blair has a great deal of admiration, according to Campbell.
</P>
<P>
"We are cooperating far more closely on the above-mentioned
issues and are building a modern relationship with China that is
very much looking forward to the 21 century rather than back to
the days of British Empire," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Britain and China have achieved
remarkable progress since Labor took power in May of last year,
with frequent exchange of visits of senior officials of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the commercial fields, according to Campbell, Britain's
trade with China rose by 15 percent in 1997, with export to China
increasing by 26 percent. Besides, Britain is Europe's leading
investor in China, to the amount of 5.3 billion U.S. dollars by
the end of last year, with another 8 million dollars on the way.
</P>
<P>
Britain's cooperation and exchange with China on cultural,
scientific, law and sports fields are also progressing, Campbell
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the British prime minister believes that
under Zhu's determined leadership, China is prepared to push very
radical reform in its bid to emerge as a great power in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Although the domestic challenges are enormous, Campbell said,
"China is showing responsibility and willingness to play a leading
role" in economic stage in the world community.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said Blair speaks highly of China's commitment not to
devaluate its currency RMB, saying that "has played a very
important part in avoiding even worse financial instability in the
region."
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister also believes that Britain and the West
have got to respond boldly and positively toward what China has
got to do, help them make the transition that they are trying to
make in the process of forging a new and more positive partnership
between East and West," he added.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia to Take Unpopular Measures in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said on Thursday that the Russian government might to
take "unpopular steps" to get out of the current crisis, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After a government meeting held on Thursday Primakov told
reporters that Russia was counting on the release of a new tranche
of International Monetary Fund, but if it was suspended or
canceled, the government "has to take measures, which may be
rather unpopular."
</P>
<P>
According to him, if the IMF releases a 4.3-billion-dollar
tranche, Russia could be able to get out of the current adverse
situation with minimum losses.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that the IMF "must take into consideration the
fact that up till today we have been working according to its
recommendations."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also noted that a Russian delegation is to
fly to Washington on October 2 for talks with the IMF. "We expect
that the IMF will give Russia the promised tranche, with the help
of which we want to launch the mechanism of getting out of the
current critical situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Denying the rumours about the government promoting a bill,
which provided for a state monopoly in the sphere of currency
circulation, Primakov said foreign currency will be freely sold
and purchased in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He spelled out the most important steps that the government is
planning to take to pull the country out of the financial and
economic crisis. These are, in particular, designed to stabilize
the ruble, rather than the whole program, he said.
</P>
<P>
The banking system should be normalized, and the prices of
natural and local monopoly products will be regulated, while the
state machinery must be strengthened, according to the premier.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank promised to provide to Russia
22.6 billion U.S. dollars as a package of financial aid in this
summer. By now, only part of the sum has been sent to the
economic-desolated country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of the West Bank
town of Hebron Thursday called for an immediate halt to the
blockade imposed by the Israeli troops on the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Voice of Palestine Radio, the mayor
Abdel Nabi Natsheh said that the blockade was not justified.
</P>
<P>
"Imposing a blockade on 130,000 Palestinian residents of the
old city is a kind of collective punishment," Natsheh noted.
</P>
<P>
An assailant threw two hand grenades at Israeli troops on
Wednesday in downtown Hebron and injured more than 10 soldiers
and several Palestinian passers-by.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Israeli troops imposed a curfew on the downtown
area and also sealed the Palestinian-controlled parts of town,
barring Palestinians from entering or leaving.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000
Palestinians living in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were clashes between dozens of Palestinian
demonstrators with Israeli soldiers in the Israeli-controlled
center of Hebron on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators threw stones and firebombs at Israeli
soldiers who responded with rubber bullets and stun grenades. The
radio said that six Palestinians were injured during the clash.

<HEADLINE> EC to Propose Working Time for Mobile Road Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that it now had to propose a working time for the mobile
road transport sector of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union, said
that it would rapidly prepare proposals for legislation after the
labor and management in the mobile road transport sector failed to
reach agreement on their own.
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to prepare proposals on working time
for truck, coach and taxi drivers or what the commission has
described as the mobile road transport.
</P>
<P>
European Employment Commissioner Padraig Flynn and Transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock said Thursday in a joint statement: "The
social partners have passed up an important opportunity to resolve
the key issues that have provoked uncertainty and unrest in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
"We are greatly disappointed that the health and safety
benefits secured in the rail and maritime sectors could not be
extended to road transport."
</P>
<P>
The commissioners welcomed the signature by the social partners
in the railway and maritime industries of agreements on working
time in their sectors which will be converted into commission
proposals to the European council of ministers for EU legislation.
</P>
<P>
French truck drivers staged a one-day strike earlier last month
to demand shorter working hours.
</P>
<P>
The commission urged the parties concerned to strive for an
accord on working time but the social partners failed to come out
with an agreement in their meeting on September 18.
</P>
<P>
The commission then set September 30 as the deadline for the
social partners to work out their solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
The commission has already worked out a regulation on working
time for the non-mobile road transport sector in July last year.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 3.5 million people involved in the road
transport industry in the European Union. The total includes both
the non-mobile and mobile transport workers.
</P>
<P>
French truckers launched a multi-day strike earlier this year
prior to the World Cup soccer tournament.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Annan to Present Report on Kosovo Early Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is expected to present his report on Kosovo to the
Security Council "as soon as possible early next week," U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This report would be presented to the 15-member council most
probably on Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan proposed the time framework for his report presentation
in his meeting with both the outgoing and incoming presidents of
the Security Council on Wednesday evening, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Succeeding Hans Dahlgren of Sweden, Britain's U.N. Ambassador
on Thursday became the council president for the month of October.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks just hours before an emergency
meeting by the Security Council to consider how to respond to
recent reports of massacre in Kosovo, Serbia's province of mainly
ethnic Albanians within the jurisdiction of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY).
</P>
<P>
The remarks also coincided with NATO's completion of a plan for
possible air strike on Serbian security forces and the withdrawal
of Serbian forces into their barracks at the end of their
anti-terrorist campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In Geneva on Thursday, United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights chief Mary Robinson called for an independent inquiry
into the "reprehensible" massacre of 30 civilians in central
Kosovo last weekend allegedly carried out by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
"These killings are particularly reprehensible because they
are evidence that despite expressions of international concern
and official assurances that civilians would be respected,
atrocities are continuing in Kosovo," she said in a statement
from her office at Geneva.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Annan, in a statement issued through his
spokesman's office, voiced his "outrage" at the reported
massacre in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians, who form a majority of
the province's population of 2 million, have been battling with
Serbians for independence since February this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovnovic told a
press conference here earlier this week that the international
community lacks comprehensive and fair information on Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday recommended that the
United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on UNIKOM, the Secretary-General said that
during the past six months, the mission, which is monitoring the
demilitarized zone along the Iraq-Kuwait border, continued to
contribute to the maintenance of calm and stability in the zone.
</P>
<P>
"The situation along the border was generally quiet." Annan
said, adding that UNIKOM received cooperation of the Kuwait and
Iraqi authorities in discharging its duty.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, UNIKOM carried out its normal
operation without interruption, Annan said in the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the number of violations in the
demilitarized zone dropped by more than fifty percent.
</P>
<P>
UNIKOM continued to dispose of unexploded mines and bombs in
the demilitarized zone, with a total of 5,823 unexploded devices
destroyed, the report said.

<HEADLINE> 30 Tons of Tomatoes Rotten at Akomadan, Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 tons of
tomatoes produced by growers are getting rotten at Akomadan,
Ghana due to lack of marketing facilities, Ghana News Agency
(GNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The famers said they are getting good harvests as a result of
the correct application of modern scientific methods of farming
and planting of improved tomato seeds given by the Akomadan
Irrigation Development Authority (IDA) and the Ministry of Food
and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Peter Obeng-Dabo, Offinso District Director of Food and
Agriculture said if farmers are not given an encouraging price
immediately, it will not only affect them financially but also
dampen their spirits to stop embarking on large-scale production
in future.
</P>
<P>
He said the local IDA has about 1,000 hectares but only 64.7
hectares have been cultivated with tomatoes due to financial
constraints.
</P>
<P>
Mr Obeng-Dabo said the establishment of processing and
preservation facilities in and around the project area will
enable small holders to benefit from their labor.
</P>
<P>
The farmers appealed to the government to establish a tomato
factory at Akomadan and to re-introduce subsidies on agricultural
inputs like spraying machines and insecticides.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Authorities close down Varsity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Authorities have closed down
the University of Science and Technology (UST) in Kumasi
following a violent demonstration by the students Wednesday
night, Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Academic Executive Council has ordered immediate closure
of the University after an emergency meeting Thursday "to protect
life and property... All the students were expected to leave
campus by 14:00 hours today (Thursday)." Ambrose Tuah, acting
Vice-Chancellor of the school, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Tuah said the students damaged the bungalows of the Acting
Vice-Chancellor and some lecturers.
</P>
<P>
He described as "flimsy" complaints by the students that the
university authorities had asked three students to sleep in a
room in the main halls of residence, while those in the annex are
paired.
</P>
<P>
"This is not enough to warrant vandalism.. I'd want to believe
that there is more to it," the acting Vice Chancellor said and
added that further investigation would be conducted into the
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Police sources told journalists that at about 20:45 hours
Thursday about 150 students, wearing red bands and armed with
clubs marched through the campus and caused some damage to the
bungalows.
</P>
<P>
They destroyed the source of water supply to lecturer's
bungalows. Louvre blades, flower pots, mosquito nets, water
meters and pens for sheep and goats were not spared, police
inspector Arthur said.
</P>
<P>
Inspector Arthur said there had been no arrest and no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The students and Education authorities have had disagreements
over payment of new fees for residential accommodation leading to
a series of demonstration in the capital, Accra.
</P>
<P>
However, at the beginning of the academic year which opened in
September, the school authorities tied admission to the payment
of 150,000 Cedis (Some 65 U.S. Dollars) which the students paid
but reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
Government said it was introducing the "user fees" to provide
accommodation for the students. Hitherto, at least four students
share one room in campus.

WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has tentatively scheduled a visit to Japan and South Korea late
next month, said the White House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expects to make stops in Japan and South Korea
following the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
meeting in Malaysia November 17-18.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton decided to make
the visit after canceling a long-planned trip to India and
Pakistan because of those countries' nuclear policies.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, we are exploring other destinations in the
region," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"The president decided to make stops in Japan and (South)
Korea. The governments of Japan and (South) Korea are receptive to
hosting the president," he added.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the visit is tentative, pending the reconciliation
of schedules with those countries' leaders, who also are attending
the APEC summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has finally reached a
trade agreement with the Southern African Customs Union (SACU),
Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister David Mpamba said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a German business delegation that the only
step remaining is for each government of the SACU member
countries to sign and ratify the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said once signed, the agreement will level the playing
field in terms of trade between Zambia and the SACU member
countries, especially South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba also urged German investors to come and invest in his
country, saying Zambia has put in place various incentives for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion George Chabwera, chairman of the Zambia
Association for Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) said
investment confidence is at the lowest in Zambia now because of
various economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation and interest rates are on the rise and
Zambia's currency has continued to fall in value against other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The national debt has made the government incapable of
financing development projects and providing basic needs for
Zambians.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the problems to the policies of the
International monetary Fund (IMF) which do harm to Zambia's
economy.
</P>
<P>
German business delegation leader Jens peter Breitengross said
his delegation has come to find out the economic situation
despite having heard so many negative things.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of political and economic stability
for foreigngross investments to be put in Zambia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday Yugoslavia must quickly withdraw forces from Kosovo to
avert a looming military strike by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Belgrade authorities need to act very quickly to remove the
security forces that have been deployed in Kosovo, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
He had been asked if it was possible for Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to avert air strikes being planned by NATO to
end hostilities in Kosovo, a Serbian province in the Yugoslav
federation.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said diplomatic possibilities for resolving the issue
had not been exhausted, and it would not be out of character for
Milosevic to yield to United Nations demands that he end
hostilities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"When faced with diplomacy backed by force, he has in the past
backed down," he said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke as top U.S. national security officials prepared to
brief the U.S. Senate on the Kosovo situation and preparations for
military action.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Air
Force General Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff, were to deliver a classified briefing scheduled
in the afternoon, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"They will brief on our understanding of whether or not
President Milosevic has met the commitments that he's publicly
said that he would make," McCurry said.

He added that any "expression of support" by Congress for the
U.S. position would be welcomed.

Organization (NATO).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rwandans Observe Heroes' Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A rally and other ceremonies
were held at the National Heroes' cemetery in Remera, near the
national Amahoro Soccer Stadium to commemorate the National
Heroes Day which falls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The festivities marking the day were officiated by Rwandan
president Pasteur Bizimungu, and Vice-President and Defense
Minister, Major General Paul Kagame, assisted by senior
government civil and military officials, foreign diplomats, heads
of religious denominations, and residents of the capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the day was the laying of wreaths of flowers
on two graves, one belonging to late Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA)
commander, Major General Fred Gisa Rwigema, and the other
dedicated to the Unknown Soldier, Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
October first is an important date in the history of Rwanda.
It actually marked the beginning of the struggle for liberation
launched by the RPA which was fighting to remove the former
regime which had denied more than one and a half million
Rwandans, mainly Tutsis their repatriation back to the country.
</P>
<P>
Major Fred Rwigema initiated the struggle, but died in the
early days of October 1990. His ideals were taken up by freedom
fighters who pursued the struggle and later drove out the
''genocidaire''regime in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Fred Rwigema is also best recalled for his pan-Africanist
ideals. He fought for the liberation of Mozambique alongside late
president Samora Machel and his Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique (FRELIMO) from the yoke of Portuguese colonists.
</P>
<P>
He was among the top military commanders of the National
Resistance Army in NRA's struggle against the dictatorship in
Uganda which swept to power president Yoweri Museveni in 1986.
</P>
<P>
It is in memory of late Fred Gisa Rwigema, and all the
soldiers who gave their lives on the battlefield, as heroes that
today's ceremonies were held.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the rally, Rwandan Minister of Culture
Jacques Bihozagara underlined that while commemorating the event,
all national heroes, ''those of the past, those who liberated
Rwanda, those who fought the genocide, those of history and
culture, those of economy,'' should be remembered.
</P>
<P>
President Pasteur Bizimungu in his speech reminded that Rwanda
was liberated because of the heroic acts of national heroes, and
that Rwandans should move into their foot steps so as achieve
total liberation.

ANKARA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Amid tension between Ankara and
Rome on a Kurdish political meeting in Italy, Turkey is to recall
its ambassador to Italy Inal Batu for consultation, the Anatolia
News Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official agency quoted reliable official sources,
whose names were not given, as saying that Batu is to return to
Ankara next monday. It remains unclear how long the ambassador
will stay in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry is expected to issue an official
statement regarding this issue soon, sources said.
</P>
<P>
This decision came as the Kurdish Parliament in Exile, a
political wing of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), was
holding a meeting in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the development, Turkey urged the Italian government
to stop the Kurdish meeting, but Italy said it was not able to do
so.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish deputies hold a discussion Wednesday in the Italian
parliament building on the future of the Kurds in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday accusing
Italy of supporting the separatist activities by the PKK which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the Italian authorities to handle this
issue in a cautious manner.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon announced a plan on
Thursday to set up a special state department aimed at handling
affairs of the country's 230,000 elderly people.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference marking the International Day for the
Elderly, Director General of the Social Affairs Ministry Nehmat
Kenaan said the government intends to turn the non-governmental
National Association for the Elderly into a state authority under
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Five committees will be formed under the association founded
last year and financed by the country's billionaire prime
minister, Rafik Hariri, Kenaan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the committees are to conduct studies and surveys
on the old citizens, provide them with services, draft related
laws and launch campaigns to raise national awareness to respect
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The elderly above age 64 in Lebanon are estimated at 6.85
percent of the whole population and the proportion is expected to
rise to 13 percent in the year of 2025.
</P>
<P>
Kenaan said the status of Lebanon's elderly in general is good
since "family ties are still strong."
</P>
<P>
But, the current economic hardships are depriving some of the
elderly of the basic medical and social help.
</P>
<P>
Kenaan called for close cooperation between official and
private sectors in securing better life for the advanced
citizens.

JOHANNESBURG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho Defense Force

battles between LDF mutinous soldiers and Southern African
Development Community (SADC) intervention troops last week.

</P>
<P>
Mosakeng said a press conference was due to be held to outline

Lesotho government officials said earlier this week that 47
civilians had been killed and 15 other seriously injured.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are free to develop,
import and use whatever cryptography products they wish, according
to a cryptography policy outlined by Industry Minister John Manley
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government will not implement mandatory key recovery
requirements or licensing regimes, Manley said.
</P>
<P>
Cryptography is a set of technologies used to provide security
for electronic transmissions and of information stored on computer
systems and networks such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is an essential part of Canada's electronic
commerce strategy designed to make Canada a world leader in the
use of electronic commerce by the year 2000, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, Canada will continue to implement
cryptography export controls in keeping with the framework of
international agreements, while taking into consideration of the
export practices of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"This policy is good for Canadian economy...It supports the
increased use of electronic commerce products and services in
Canada, as well as the export of Canadian information technology
to other countries," Manley said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure public safety, the Canadian government also proposes
amendments to the country's criminal code to criminalize the
wrongful disclosure of keys and deter the use of encryption in
crimes and cryptography in evidence concealing.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus Urges More Bolder Actions to Spur Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) here, Thursday
urged world powers to do more to spur economic growth and halt a
spreading economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
While briefing reporters prior to the IMF-World Bank joint
annual meetings of the 182-nation financial institutions, he said
the world's seven richest countries must push for stronger growth
to offset steep recessions in many Asian nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He endorsed the U.S. Fed's recent decision to cut a key U.S.
interest rate by a quarter-point and suggested that European
monetary authorities should take similar steps.
</P>
<P>
When asked why stock markets, particularly in the United
States, have reacted so negatively to the Fed rate cut, the IMF
chief said he believes confidence will soon be restored if
financial leaders take clear decisions during the upcoming
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 finance ministers and the central bank governors are
scheduled to meet Saturday. Camdessus said the discussions should
focus on ways to improve timely release of key economic data so
the IMF and investors can better spot troubles and a review of
proposals to upgrade banking regulation.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to make the world a better place, then we have to
go for transparency, go for strengthening of financial and banking
systems and the orderly integration of emerging markets into the
world economy," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
As the financial crisis triggered off in Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia and South Korea and recently rocked Russia and even
posing a threat to Latin America, the IMF took the lead in
launching a rescue package of over 100 billion U.S. dollars for
the affected nations.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus insisted that the IMF monitored the financial chaos
in the early stage and took proper actions at the time. But he
conceded that the speed of the spreading crisis has surprised him.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the virus was so strong and so quick in so many
places," he said. "We did not see... how the crisis in Russia
could prompt the lack of confidence in Latin America two weeks
later."
</P>
<P>
The threat that the current turmoil could turn into a global
recession was underscored by release Wednesday of an unusually
pessimistic economic forecast by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's "World Economic Outlook" said the economic turmoil
has already cost millions of jobs and more than 600 billion
dollars in lost output, which is equivalent to a country the size
of Canada shutting down for a year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Chief Defends Hedge Fund Bailout Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the U.S. Federal Reserve, said Thursday the rescue of the falling
hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a rare event.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's tune was in sharp contrast with his criticism of
the Hong Kong financial authority's protective move to step in the
market not long ago.
</P>
<P>
However, he suggested the central bank would not always step in
to help investors.
</P>
<P>
Defending the rescue before the U.S. House of Representatives
Banking Committee Thursday, Greenspan said it only occurred because
of potential market disruptions and because LTCM's failure could
have hurt the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"It should... be viewed as a rare occasion, warranted because
of the potential for serious disruptions to markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts last week were limited to facilitating a
private-sector agreement and had no implications for Federal
Reserve resources or policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Federal Reserve last week arranged a 3.6 billion
U.S. dollar private-sector bailout of the ailing Greenwich,
Connecticut-based fund, involving 14 of the world's top commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has been criticized for allowing the hedge fund to get
so close to the brink of bankruptcy and also for organizing the
rescue of an investment vehicle for rich individuals, which some
see as encouraging others to make more risky market bets.
</P>
<P>
But New York Federal Reserve President William McDonough said
simply letting the hedge fund close out its loss-making positions
would have posed "unacceptable risks" to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan emphasized that no public money had gone into the
LTCM rescue. "This agreement was not a government bailout, in that
Federal Reserve funds were neither provided nor ever even
suggested," he said.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the huge hedge fund would have risked a "severe
drying up" of liquidity, Greenspan said, adding the already
volatile situation in world markets required a swift resolution of
the fund's troubles.
</P>
<P>
"Had the failure of LTCM triggered the seizing up of markets,
substantial damage could have been inflicted on many market
participants, including some not directly involved with the firm,
and could have potentially impaired the economies of many nations
including our own," Greenspan added.

<HEADLINE> Rwandans Observe Heroes' Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A rally and other ceremonies
were held at the National Heroes' cemetery in Remera, near the
national Amahoro Soccer Stadium in Kigali to commemorate Rwanda's
National Heroes Day which falls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The festivities marking the day were officiated by Rwandan
president Pasteur Bizimungu, and Vice-President and Defense
Minister, Major General Paul Kagame, assisted by senior
government civil and military officials, foreign diplomats, heads
of religious denominations, and residents of the capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the day was the laying of wreaths of flowers
on two graves, one belonging to late Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA)
commander, Major General Fred Gisa Rwigema, and the other
dedicated to the Unknown Soldier, Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
October first is an important date in the history of Rwanda.
It actually marked the beginning of the struggle for liberation
launched by the RPA which was fighting to remove the former
regime which had denied more than one and a half million
Rwandans, mainly Tutsis their repatriation back to the country.
</P>
<P>
Major Fred Rwigema initiated the struggle, but died in the
early days of October 1990. His ideals were taken up by freedom
fighters who pursued the struggle and later drove out the
''genocidaire''regime in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Fred Rwigema is also best recalled for his pan-Africanist
ideals. He fought for the liberation of Mozambique alongside late
president Samora Machel and his Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique (FRELIMO) from the yoke of Portuguese colonists.
</P>
<P>
He was among the top military commanders of the National
Resistance Army in NRA's struggle against the dictatorship in
Uganda which swept to power president Yoweri Museveni in 1986.
</P>
<P>
It is in memory of late Fred Gisa Rwigema, and all the
soldiers who gave their lives on the battlefield, as heroes that
today's ceremonies were held.
</P>
<P>
In his address at the rally, Rwandan Minister of Culture
Jacques Bihozagara underlined that while commemorating the event,
all national heroes, ''those of the past, those who liberated
Rwanda, those who fought the genocide, those of history and
culture, those of economy,'' should be remembered.
</P>
<P>
President Pasteur Bizimungu in his speech reminded that Rwanda
was liberated because of the heroic acts of national heroes, and
that Rwandans should move into their foot steps so as achieve
total liberation.

LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Contact Group on former

</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, comprising the United States, Russia,
Britain, Germany, France and Italy, held a one-day meeting in
London to review the latest situation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting said, "The Contact Group
considered the elections represented modest but useful gains,
notably in development of political pluralism."
</P>

The Contact Group warned, "All office holders will be expected
to act in accordance with constitutional principles and the peace
agreement and to work for a strengthened and united Bosnia."

<P>
"Action that undermined, or threatened to undermine, the
considerable progress already made would not be tolerated," the
statement said.

Meanwhile, the Contact Group underlined the principle of
conditionality, under which financial aid is withheld if
recipients are deemed to be obstructing the peace efforts of the
international community.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Creates Defense Threat Reduction Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
established a new agency to counter nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons, Merging several Cold War agencies into one to
deal with what the Pentagon called a new world threat.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) combines the
functions of other agencies born of the struggle against the
former Soviet Union which handled nuclear weapons, monitoring arms
control agreements and protecting military technology.
</P>
<P>
"It's a much more complicated world, and we're seeing the
spread of technologies falling into the hands of rogue states, of
organizations -- terrorist organizations," Deputy Defense
Secretary John Hamre told the employees of the new agency on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing the proliferation of missiles and chemical
weapons and things of this nature that...will largely characterize
the security challenge that the United States will face for
certainly the next decade and probably well beyond," Hamre said at
the agency's headquarters near Dulles International Airport in
Virginia, outside Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The job of the new agency will be to "find ways to mitigate the
spread of dangerous technologies, find ways to contain the
proliferation of weapons to other countries, find ways to lower
the threat to the United States and to our allies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new agency will be made up primarily of agencies founded to
reduce the threat posted by the Soviet Union before its collapse
in 1991. They include the On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA), the
Defense Special Weapons Agency and the Defense Technical Security
Agency (DTSA).
</P>
<P>
The OSIA conducts arms control inspections and aerial
monitoring abroad; the Defense Special Weapons Agency deals with
nuclear deterrence and stockpile maintenance as well as well as
developing biological, chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons;
and the DTSA monitors export license applications and provides on
site observers for foreign launches of U.S. satellites to make
certain that unauthorized technology transfers do not occur.
</P>
<P>
A new element in the new agency will be a "force protection"
group, prompted by the fatal bombing of the Air Force's Khobar
Towers living facility in Saudi Arabia. The new group will
specialize in inspecting military sites and planning for better
security against terrorist bombings, the Washington Post said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The director of the new agency will be Jay C. Davis, a nuclear
physicist who is a former associate director of the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, the Post said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Help African Countries Tackle Debt Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced Friday that it
would give 30 million pounds (about 51.3 million U.S. dollars) to
help Africa's poorest nations pay off their debts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ruling Labor Party conference in Blackpool,
British International Development Secretary Clare Short said the
cash would go straight to the African Development Bank, which will
use it to help some of the poorest countries on the continent join
an accelerated debt relief program.
</P>
<P>
Short expressed her hope that all 22 poor, highly indebted
African countries will be on track for debt relief by the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
"But for Africa there is a major obstacle. The African
Development Bank cannot afford to write off its share of the debt
and this could block progress in reduing their debt burden," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Short made it clear that the greatest task was to mobilise
international political will to meet poverty eradication targets
and Britain is trying to encourage other countries to follow suit
by providing this aid package.
</P>
<P>
The program, which Britain wants to jump-start, is the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, envisaging speedy debt
write-offs for some of the world's poorest countries once they
have established a track record of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
This program was launched two years ago under the umbrella of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, but only
Uganda has so far secured debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Accountable for 8 Percent of Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture is estimated to be
responsible for eight percent of the total greenhouse gas
emissions blamed for global warming, Eurostat said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its first overview of the link between agriculture, global
warming and climate change, Eurostat said that agriculture is the
main source of methane and nitrous oxide, but total emissions of
these gases are small compared to that of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
However, methane and nitrous oxide are more powerful in
retention of heat and thus potential causes for global warming,
Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
community said that one ton of methane will have the same warming
effect as 56 tons of carbon dioxide over a period of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture within the European Union contributes 41 percent of
the methane emissions. Of the agricultural total, 73 percent of
the methane emissions are estimated to come from ruminants such as
cattle and sheep, and 21 percent from manure.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture also contributes 41 percent of the total EU nitrous
oxide emissions, compared to 33 percent from industry and 20
percent from energy. The bulk of nitrous oxide emissions come
from manure.

<HEADLINE> Gregory, Shearer Rewarded for Best Performance in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa boss John Gregory
confirmed his status as the managerial discovery of the year by
being named as the Carling manager of the month for September.
</P>
<P>
And Newcastle striker Alan Shearer has won the player of the mo
nth award, after scoring a clutch of goals to silence the critics
who questioned his World Cup efforts.
</P>
<P>
Gregory, who was plucked from obscurity at Wycombe last
season, won his first manager of the month honour after leading
Aston Villa to the top of the table in September.
</P>
<P>
The Midlands side won three of their four Premiership games
and did not concede a goal during the month.
</P>
<P>
The Carling awards panel, which includes England coach Glenn
Hoddle, said: "Many fans questioned the appointment of John Gre
gory when he took over at Villa, but how wrong he's proven them.
</P>
<P>
"His team have only lost two of the 18 league games he's been
in charge of and during September he again showed his ability to
inspire and motivate his players to a string of fine performa
nces."
</P>
<P>
The panel also paid tribute to Shearer's role in making
Newcastle the top scorers in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
He has so far scored six goals this season - more than he
managed in the whole of his last injury-hit campaign.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Shearer has won the monthly award
outright -he was joint-winner with Chris Sutton in November 1994
- and the panel stated:
</P>
<P>
"Newcastle were languishing in 17th place at the end of
August, but Shearer's firepower has helped take them to fifth by
the end of September.
</P>
<P>
"His six goals in four league games during the month show he's
back to his lethal best and, with the vital European qualifying
game against Bulgaria next week, that's got to be good news for
England fans."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Two cyclists are to take a swipe
at a long-standing record with their attempt to race further on a
tandem in one hour than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
And if they fail in their attempt, one of the record-holders
who set the standard some 61 years ago says he will step in and
find a new partner to have another go at the record.
</P>
<P>
Karl Williamson and Adam Hardy from Yorkshire - who are making
their attempt at the Manchester Velodrome - will have to beat a
record set in Italy in 1937.
</P>
<P>
At championships in Milan, two British cyclists - Bill Paul
and Ernie Mills - rode their tandem 31 miles and 110 yards in an
hour.
</P>
<P>
Of the current record, Williamson said: "It made the
four-minute mile look like a stroll in the park."
</P>
<P>
One of the record-holders, 88-year-old Paul, is still cycling.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not understand why the record he and his late
partner set so many years ago in Milan is still standing.
</P>
<P>
But Paul is confident that the two will enter the record books
with this latest attempt.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't, then I'll find another partner and go again
myself," Paul added.

<HEADLINE> NATO May Strike on Serbia Without U.N. Authorization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ambassador to the
United Nations Jeremy Greenstock Friday suggested on the BBC that
NATO might initiate air strikes against Serbia even without the
authorization from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Thursday condemned massacres of some 30
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and demanded "full and immediate
compliance" by Yugoslav leadership with a U.N. resolution that
calls for an immediate end to attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
"It looks as though (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic
will only understand the use of force or the threat of the use of
force. That is what we are now preparing. If it's necessary,
we'll use it," Greenstock said.
</P>
<P>
On whether NATO countries were prepared to act alone if they
did not receive full political backing, Greenstock said: "NATO and
the U.N. Security Council have so far gone along this route in
unity. We would like to retain that unity. If unity is not
possible, then we'll have to make our own decisions according to
the circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Defense Secretary George Robertson Friday
reaffirmed Britain's determination to use force by saying: "The
clock is ticking for Milosevic."
</P>
<P>
"He now knows that unless he complies, NATO forces, which have
been planning for some time now, are able and willing to do
something about non-compliance," he told Sky Television.

<HEADLINE> Drug Education Introduced into Nigerian Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The government has introduced
drug education into the curriculum of Nigeria's schools and took
the anti-drug war to the higher learning institutions as a part
of the war against drug abuse and trafficking in the country.
</P>
<P>
Musa Bamaiyi, Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement
Agency (NDLEA), said in capital Abuja Wednesday that the move
would make the anti-drug policy a part of the educational systems
in Nigeria, according to a Daily Times report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Launching the Obafemi Awolowo University Chapter of the
Nigerian Students Anti-drug Movement, Bamaiyi said that the
anti-drug policy had been developed to enhance a comprehensive
preventive drug education curriculum.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued last June by the African Council of
Narcotics expressed concern over the alarming increase of drug
trade in west Africa, especially in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
West African drug traffickers transship cocaine from South
America and heroin from Asia to the United states, Canada and
European countries through west African states, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
West African countries including Nigeria have become transit
centers of drug trafficking and drug abuse areas.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the growing drug abuse and
trafficking in the sub-region to the poor control of the vast
land, air and water ways, and lack of anti-drug education.

<HEADLINE> Request from Istanbul Mayor to Correct Conviction </HEADLINE>

<P>
ANKARA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief prosecutor of the Supreme
Court of Appeals Vural Savas Friday rejected the request from
Istanbul Islamic Mayor Recep Tayip Erdogan "to correct the
decision" of the court to approve the verdict against him.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan had asked the appeals court to review its decision last
week to uphold the 10-month prison sentence against him, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court's rejection of Erdogan's request left him banned for
life from holding public office.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Erdogan was found guilty by the Diyarbakir
State Security Court in April "for inciting hatred based on
religious differences" in a speech at a political rally last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Our mosques are our barracks, our minarets are our bayonets,
our domes are our helmets and our believers are our soldiers,"
Erdogan said at the rally, reading from a poem by nationalist
poet Ziya Gokalp.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Erdogan as saying that "I was not expecting
any different decision. Only we wanted the legal means in Turkey
to be exhausted for us."
</P>
<P>
On the application to the international courts, Erdogan said
that "we are studying the issue. We will apply if necessary."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Erdogan's Lawyer Faik Isik said that they would
apply to the international courts as the request of Erdogan was
rejected.

Hasina Friday said the top priority of her government was to
procure food grains and save the vast flood-affected population of
the country, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our most important task is to ensure food for the
flood-ravaged people of the country," she said, while addressing a
meeting of the Development Coordination Committee of northeast
district of Sylhet.
</P>

A total of 4 million vulnerable group feeding cards (VGF) are

adding that the program would continue till the next harvest.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not tolerate any irregularities in the
distribution of the (VGF) cards," she stressed. "The cards are
meant for the poor people and none should misuse those causing
miseries to them."
</P>
<P>
The flood had caused huge losses for the country and its
people, and the magnitude of the damage was so great that the
government had to ask for foreign assistance to make up the gap,
she stated.
</P>
<P>
The government would embark upon the post-flood rehabilitation
work, she told the meeting, saying "the task was gigantic but it
could be faced with united efforts of all people."

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Defense Force
(IDF) imposed another total closure on The West Bank and Gaza
Strip for fear of possible terrorist attacks, it was officially
announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The closure started at 2:00 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) Friday
and will last till next Tuesday, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The IDF made this decision based on the reports that during the
Israel's Succot holidays (celebrating harvest), the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) would carry out attacks
against targets in Israel, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense establishment discussed security situation
in the territories and decided to get prepared for eventualities.
Whether the total closure would continue after next Tuesday will
be decided by IDF, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Total closure means closing all checkpoints, passes and
crossing points between Israel and the Palestinian territories,
banning Palestinians from entering into Israel and shutting down
all business including trade and transportations between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Following the IDF's killing of two Hamas members near West Bank
town of Hebron on September 10 and other shooting incidents at the
territories, confrontations and clashes between the Palestinians
and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza had never been stopped.
</P>
<P>
Hamas vowed to avenge the killing of its members on Israelis.
Two grenades were thrown at a IDF jeep in Hebron Wednesday,
injuring 14 soldiers and 11 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, small scale clashes between Palestinians and Israeli
soldiers occurred in Hebron, but no injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Political Settlement in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia believes that the Kosovo
problem must be resolved peacefully by political means and the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia must remain intact, President
Boris Yeltsin's press secretary Dmitry Yakushkin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin was commenting on NATO's plan to use force to settle
the crisis in Kosovo, where increased violence has aroused
worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman's statement came hours after
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, aired his staunch objection to any use of NATO force
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"If a single bomb or rocket is dropped in Serbia, the
Yugoslavian army will provide a worthy retaliation and this can
trigger a full-scale war," Seleznyov warned.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for NATO to make a decision on bombings,"
Seleznyov said. "The problem of Kosovo must be resolved by the
Yugoslavs themselves."
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the State Duma passed a resolution on the
Kosovo situation, stressing that any military strike by NATO in
circumvention of the U.N. Security Council would be regarded as a
"non-legal, aggressive act."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma recommended Yeltsin and the Russian government
"to bring it to the notice of the leaders of NATO
member-countries that any military actions against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia would be regarded by the House as a
non-legal, aggressive act which would reduce to nought the
previous decisions concerning a settlement of the Kosovo
problem."

denied suggestions of banning the circulation of hard currencies
in the country, but "the dollar should not be a payment instrument
in Russia."
</P>
<P>
Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia,
addressing lawmakers at the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, criticized "those who have made suggestions, offered
suppositions and some crazy ideas over the past several days"
about an alleged ban on the dollar circulation.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized suggestions of a gold ruble, which means the
amount of ruble in circulation would be pegged to the country's
gold reserves rather than the hard currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
Gerashchenko told reporters that the gold ruble had not played
an active role in the development of the national economy in the
1920s, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest flurry of reports of a government plan to ban or
restrict the flow of dollars came Thursday, when the Kommersant
Daily ran the text of a document drafted by First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the document suggested the government was
considering harsh measures to take control of foreign currency,
putting it under the purview of the central bank and making it
difficult for banks and people to exchange and transfer hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
The report triggered panic among in the country where billions
of dollars were held by Russian citizens and businesses who do
not trust the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The national currency, which now stands at 16 rubles to the
U.S. dollar, a drop of some 61 percent from 6.3 rubles to the
dollar in mid-August, when the government of Sergei Kiriyenko
effectively devalued it.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov issued a denial,
saying Maslyukov's report was "one of six options being waved
about right now."
</P>
<P>
The government still had no program for dealing with the
country's worst economic crisis since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"I should like to repeat," he said, "there is no program
of any kind."

<HEADLINE> Australian Opposition Leads the Ruling Parties in Latest Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia's key opinion poll
Newspoll, which is showing a late swing to the Labor Party,
suggests the opposition party could defeat Prime Minister John
Howard's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Sol Lebovic, leading expert with Newspoll, did not disclose
figures for the poll, to be published Saturday, but said it would
suggest the opposition Labor Party could defeat the Howard
government.
</P>
<P>
Newspoll, conducted exclusively for the nation's largest
newspaper The Australian owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, has
a good record of predicting the 1996 election results.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the poll will show Labor leading the coalition
on primary votes by 44 percent to 40 percent, state-owned
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported Friday night
in its 7:30 television program.
</P>
<P>
"In The Weekend Australian tomorrow, we will actually show
there has been a swing back to Labor and that swing back to Labor
will get them very close to winning government if it's repeated in
tomorrow's election," Lebovic told the ABC.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we can't call it from that poll, it was conducted
during the week and as we know on election day we can get very
different trends sometimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the respected Newspoll put the ruling
coalition one point ahead of the opposition on primary votes,
although behind the opposition by 51 percent to 49 percent on a
two-party preferred basis.
</P>
<P>
This week two other polls, the Morgan and Bulletin polls, put
the Labor Party one point ahead of the coalition after
preferences, while the A.C. Nielsen poll had them all square at
50-50.
</P>
<P>
But an analysis of the four major opinion poll results shows
that the Howard government finished the election campaign slightly
ahead of the opposition Labor Party after a final week drop in
support for the opposition, the Australian Associated Press said
Friday,
</P>
<P>
An average of the four polls puts the coalition ahead on
primary votes by just over one point, 41.4 to 40.1.
</P>
<P>
While the margin is small, it's a big turnaround on last week
when Labor led by an average of 1.7 points.
</P>
<P>
However, the wire service stressed that Labor could still win
the election because it retains a narrow lead over the government
after distribution of preference votes.
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's preferential voting system, voters are
required to rank candidates in order of preference on the ballot
papers. To be elected, a candidate must achieve an absolute
majority, that is at least 50 percent plus one vote, either on
first preference or following distribution of preference votes.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate has more than half of the votes, the candidate
with the fewest votes is excluded.
</P>
<P>
This process of excluding candidates one by one continues until
one candidate has more than half the total votes and is declared
elected.
</P>
<P>
A party or coalition must hold at least 75 of the 148 seats in
the House of the Representatives to win the election.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Envoy: Iranian Planes Violate Afghan Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian jet fighters and
helicopters on Friday twice violated Afghanistan's airspace, the
Taliban's envoy Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rehman Haqqani said here.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani told the private News Network International (NNI) that
15 Iranian planes entered Afghanistan's airspace from Nimroz and
returned to Iran while flying over Herat province between 9:00 to
11:00 a.m. (Afghan Standard Time).
</P>
<P>
He said 15 helicopters also violated Afghanistan's airspace
between 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m..
</P>
<P>
The Taliban envoy asked the United Nations Security Council to
take serious notice of the Iranian actions and warned that such
actions will have disastrous effects if not checked.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taliban government showed patience and did not
retaliate in the light of recent Ulema fatawa (religious decree).
</P>
<P>
Tension between Iran and the Taliban regime has been high since
the murder of seven Iranian diplomats by the student militia in
northern Afghanistan early August. Iran, who has vowed to reserve
the right of taking any action to revenge, is holding grand
military games involving more than 200,000 troops along the
Iran-Afghan border.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Farm Output to Rise One-tenth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's total
agricultural production is expected to register a 10 percent
increase in the current 1998/99 agricultural year over the
previous 1997/98, an Ethiopian minister has said.
</P>
<P>
A local report Friday quoted Minister of Economic Development
and Cooperation Girma Birru as saying that Ethiopia's total
agricultural production which has suffered an overall drop of 7.6
percent in 1997/98, will register a rise of 10 percent in
1998/99.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, apart from favorable weather
conditions, the government's intensified efforts to expand its
agricultural extension package program across the country also
contribute to the growth.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that are expected to boost farm output this year
include improved agricultural practices, adequate supplies of
fertilizer and selected seed and provision of rural credit, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's major farm crops are teff, barley, maize, wheat,
sorghum, horsebeans, chickpeas, lentils, vetch, neug and linseed.
Other important agricultural products include coffee, livestock
and dairy products, fruits and vegetables and spices.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture in Ethiopia accounts for 50 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), 90 percent of the country's total export
earnings and 85 percent of total employment.
</P>
<P>
Hence, agriculture forms the core of the Ethiopian
government's development strategy which aims to increase the
productivity of small holder agriculture, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural extension package program, major ingredient
of the government's development strategy, which in the past years
was confined to only food grains, is expanded in 1998/99 to
incorporate animal breeding, soil and water conservation, forest
development and irrigation, according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to First Restore Domestic Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) will
first restore its domestic flights after resuming operations on
October 7, the airlines said here Friday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
PAL will resume operations on Wednesday (October 7) following
the favorable outcome of the two-day referendum among ground
employees belonging to the PAL Employees Association.
</P>
<P>
"Initially, PAL will restore flights to 14 domestic
destinations out of Manila. The flag carrier will utilize 9
aircraft. Resumption of international service is now being
reviewed," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Before the closure at midnight September 23, PAL served 16
domestic points and flew dozens of international routes.
</P>
<P>
"Bookings will be accepted beginning Saturday (October 3) in
all PAL reservation and ticket offices," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
During the referendum, 3,247 people, or 61 percent of the total
voters, voted for a new deal brokered by President Joseph Estrada
between the management and labor union officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, the labor union will suspend its
collective bargaining agreement for 10 years. In exchange, the
management will give employees 20 percent of the PAL ownership and
three seats in the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
PAL, the oldest airlines in Asia, closed shop due to heavy
losses and the breakdown of talks between the management and the
labor union.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Better Ties with Hezbollah's Spiritual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Iran's
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are on a secret visit to
Lebanon to improve relations with Sheikh Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
A source close to Hezbollah, or Party of God, told Xinhua
Friday that the Iranian delegation, led by Hojateslam Hijazi, also
aims to improve Fadlallah's ties with Hezbollah's leadership.
</P>
<P>
The cleric's relation with Iran started to sour especially
after the death of one of the grand religious leaders of the
Shiite Muslims, Al-Sayed Abu Al-Kasem Al-Khoui, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Fadlallah's assertion of his authority as spiritual leader of
the Shiites and his unconventional teaching methods were not
welcomed by some religious and political figures in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Several Iranian scholars published books contesting Fadlallah's
religious and historical theories.
</P>
<P>
The source, who asked not to be named, said Iran wanted to
improve its relations with the Shiite cleric by way of extending
him an invitation to visit Tehran, as Fadlallah has been to the
country for eight years.
</P>
<P>
But Fadlallah had said that he would visit Iran provided he
was granted an exclusive meeting with Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the cleric has on more than one occasion voiced his
objection to the idea of combining religious and political
authorities in one person within Hezbollah, which is currently led
by Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, established in the wake of Israel's second invasion
of Lebanon in 1982, is leading a guerrilla war, allegedly with
Iranian financial backing, to oust about 1,500 Israeli soldiers
out of the occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 after two invasions with the claimed aim to protect its
north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Advised to Talk to Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda still wants Congolese
(K) President Laurent Kabila to talk directly with the Tutsi-led
rebels fighting to oust him, a Ugandan senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, the minister of state for regional affairs,
made the demand Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's New Vision paper quoted the minister as saying that
Uganda has never changed this demand of direct talks between
Kabila and "other political forces like Tshisekedi in Congo."
</P>
<P>
Since the eruption of the rebellion in eastern town of Goma in
early August, Kabila and his allies represented by President
Robert Mugabe have rejected any kind of direct talks with rebels
who control a large area including major cities and towns in
eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan minister had just returned home from a meeting
with Mugabe to whom he conveyed a message from Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
With more African countries being involved in the conflict,
Museveni is seeking more chances to exchange ideas with foreign
leaders on the issue.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Friday morning by the Presient's Office
said Museveni has just returned from Libya where he held talks
with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and presidents of Eritrea,
Chad and Niger.

<HEADLINE> Chief Observer Reaffirms Cambodia's Election Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Sven G. Linder, chief
observer of the Joint International Observer Group (JIOG) in
Cambodia, reiterated Friday that Cambodia's election on July 26
was "free and fair" with no major irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Linder said in his final statement released on Friday that "the
opening, in Siem Reap on September 24, of the new National
Assembly marked the formal end of the election period in Cambodia
1998."
</P>
<P>
"I am still as convinced as I was then that the assessment we
made at that time, also similar to that of the trained and serious
national observers, was correct," he stated.
</P>
<P>
"During its continued work, the EU Observation Unit has found
no indication of flaws and frauds of a magnitude that could have
distorted the will of the Cambodian voters as that will was
expressed on the 26th of July," Linder stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cambodians went to polls on July 26 to elect a new National
Assembly. The ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) led by Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen won the election which was disclaimed by
some political parties as being "full of fraud". But the
international observers' assessment is that the election was "free
and fair to an extent that enabled it to reflect, in a credible
way, the will of the Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
The JIOG received criticism from some quarters for allegedly
having issued its statement prematurely. "To me the timing we
chose was right, and even necessary," Linder insisted in his
statement.
</P>
<P>
"To me and my fellow international observers the Cambodian
people's wish for democracy was very clearly demonstrated on
polling day itself, Sunday, 26 July. The atmosphere at the many
polling stations we visited as the voters waited to cast their
ballot was calm and solemn, even festive at times."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Linder pointed out that the standard of work of the
National Election Committee and other election-related bodies in
the post-election phase has not corresponded to the generally high
standard displayed during the previous phases.

<HEADLINE> Australians to Vote for New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 12 million
Australians are going to vote Saturday for a new government and a
new prime minister that will lead this country towards the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Vying for those 12 million votes are 1435 candidates including
about 400 female candidates, 1106 running for 148 House of
Representatives seats and 329 for 40 senate seats, while the
previous highest numbers were in 1993 when 943 candidates ran for
the House and 266 for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four parties are fielding candidates, up from 31 in
1996, plus 115 independents for the Senate and 26 for the House.
</P>
<P>
Except the main rivals, namely the Liberal and National Party
coalition and the Australian Labor Party, there are some minor
parties such as the Democrats, the Green Party and newly organized
One Nation Party. Besides, there are some still smaller parties
such as the Abolish Child Support Court Party, the Australian Bill
of Rights Group, CTA Child Protection Party, and Unity-Say No to
Hanson.
</P>
<P>
Almost 9,000 polling stations are to open around the nation
from 08:00 a.m. (22:00 Friday GMT) to 06:00 p.m. (08:00 Saturday
GMT). They are manned by 700 full-time staff and some 63,000
part-time staff.
</P>
<P>
To enable everyone to vote, the Australian Electoral Commission
(AEC) arranged over 500 mobile polling teams visiting 2,100
hospitals and nursing homes and 120 remote locations. If anyone
wants to avoid the voting without a very good excuse, he will be
fined 20 Australian dollars (12 U.S. dollars) for not voting.
</P>
<P>
While all ordinary ballot papers, about 88 percent of the total
votes, will be counted on Saturday evening, and the first results
will start appearing at the National Tally Room about 06:30 p.m.
(08:30 GMT). But the AEC must wait 13 days for postal votes to
arrive from remote areas and overseas.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Submits New Bill on Expression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Friday
submitted a new bill on freedom of expression to replace the
government regulation in lieu of law on freedom of expression
which was turned down by the legislative body recently.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the new bill to the House of Representatives,
Justice Minister Muladi said the bill is more regulative than
repressive, and thus accommodates the people's wish to uphold and
protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
"In society, freedom needs to be regulated to make it a
precondition for the existence of a civilized nation," Muladi
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the bill does not limit the people's freedom, let alone
ban them from expressing their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
It regulates this freedom to enable the people to convey their
aspirations in a more effective and secure manner and maintain
public order at the same time, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It does not aim to undermine the people's rights and freedom.
Similar laws are in place in other countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new bill regulates the methods by which people could
express their views in public places, describes the role of the
police in mass actions, and states the legal penalties.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Muladi said, every Indonesian citizen has the
right to express his or her thoughts freely and seek legal
protection.
</P>
<P>
It, however, compels every citizen to honor the rights and
freedom of other people, abide by the law, maintain public order,
and uphold national unity.
</P>
<P>
The bill also compels organizers of rallies or protest
movements to submit a written notification to the police if the
number of participants is less than 100 or obtain a permit from
the police if the number is more than 100.
</P>
<P>
The police has the right to disperse a rally or demonstration
should the participants commit any criminal offense and disturb
peace and order, Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
The House turned down the government regulation in lieu of law
on September 29. House members had questioned the limitation to 50
of the number of participants in rallies without approval and some
other aspects of the proposed regulation had also been questioned,
including the requirement for written approval and the time and
place for the expression as well as methods for dispersing such
actions.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Increase Interests in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Growing international confidence
in Nigeria's march to democracy could translate into heavy
investments as they have expressed their desire to do business in
Nigeria, a senior business official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Baba Bakar Gujbawu, Chief Executive of the Nigerian
Investment Promotion Commission, said in capital Abuja Thursday
that some European and Asian countries had already pledged to
normalize economic relations with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The pledges, when fulfilled, would translate into greater
investment inflow from the countries to the Nigeria's economy, he
said, The Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following a recent visit to the United States by Nigerian Head
of State Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, This Day newspaper said
Friday that the number of American business people seeking
Nigerian visa to visit the country has increased three times.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Ambassador to the United States Alhaji Hassan Adamu
told the paper that the White House meeting between President
Bill Clinton and Gen. Abubakar had opened the floodgate for visa
application from American businessmen wishing to do business in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the upsurge in the demand for Nigerian visa
followed the deliberation of the two leaders on diverse issues
like rescheduling of Nigerian debt, inflow of foreign investment
to Nigeria and lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Gen. Abubakar's meeting in New York with
American corporate groups consisting of 50 business executives
was another impetus to the new development.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Gen. Abubakar assured them of the nation's
preparedness to shed up to 40 percent government equity in the
telecommunication and energy sectors.
</P>
<P>
A leading South African oil company, Engen, is reportedly
exploring the possibility of investing in Nigeria's oil gas
sector.
</P>
<P>
Engen Chief Executive Officer Roy Angel told a correspondent
of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) based in Johannesburg that
Engen alongside its partner, Malaysian Firm Petronas, would seek
to invest in offshore petrol and gas projects in Nigeria within
next year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, investors' confidence is gradually being
restored in Nigeria following the steps so far taken by the
Central Bank of Nigeria and the Abubakar regime to return the
country to democratic rule and for taking steps to reunite the
country with the international community.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, many western countries have banned
further investment in the West African country to protest the
poor human rights record of the late former Head of State Sani
Abacha regime.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Accused of Backing Rebels to Fight Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudan is hiding and supporting
the rebels who are fighting against the Ugandan government, a
Ugandan official said here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Sarapio Karashani, the resident district chairman of Kampala,
made the statement at a security sensitization meeting at the
Ground Show of Uganda Manufacturers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of Lord Resistance Army (LRA) "come and attack us"
and then retreat to their bases in southern Sudan, he charged.
</P>
<P>
Karashani asserted that Uganda's problem with Sudan is not
their internal affairs, but the fact that they hide and support
those who attack us.
</P>
<P>
"The person who comes to steal your television, and hijack
your children is definitely not a good neighbor," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The rebels and terrorists are reportedly targeting on big
markets, vulnerable buses and big churches for raids.
</P>
<P>
Karashani advised those present at the meeting to contribute
to the peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which was attended by more than 100 local and
foreign manufacturers, security officers advised the exhibitors
to take precautions against any possible bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair is scheduled for October 6-12 and this meeting
is part of the measures taken to ensure absolute security and
success of the exhibition.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak-IMF Talks Remain Sterile Due to Tough IMF Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) are to resume the crucial discussions Friday
in Washington to hammer out a consensus accord covering all policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is seeking a five billion U.S. dollar bailout from the
IMF and other lenders to ease its present economic plight caused
by the U.S.-led sanctions imposed after Pakistan's detonation of
nuclear devices in May.
</P>
<P>
The package being sought by Pakistan is reported to include the
revival of the 1.56 billion dollar lending program agreed by the
IMF last year, the rescheduling of debts worth two billion dollars
and more than one billion dollars combined from the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the IMF ended their two-week-long discussions in
Islamabad on September 25. However, the talks remain inconclusive
due to Pakistan's refusal to accept the IMF's tough conditions.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase of talks held in Islamabad, Pakistan
took a firm stand by turning down the IMF orders to devalue the
local currency of rupee and raise electricity tariffs and General
Sales Tax (GST) rate.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the major difference between Pakistan and
the IMF has been the power rates, which the Washington-based
agency wants Pakistan to increase by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government holds that since the IMF has projected
zero industrial growth rate for the current fiscal year (July 1
-June 30), it can not take any risk to further suppress the
industrial growth by raising power and tax rates.
</P>
<P>
Local economists believe that raising the electricity tariff
could be very alarming and will ruin the local industrial sector
which is trying desperately for revival.
</P>
<P>
One government source said that "no political government would
fall a prey to such conditions that are aimed at devastating the
domestic industrial sector."
</P>
<P>
With a 15 percent increase in power tariff the Pakistani
government will collect an additional 16 billion rupees (one
dollar equals 46 rupees) that is still short by four billion
rupees to meet the annual financial gap of 20 billion rupees of
the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).
</P>
<P>
The IMF demands are also surprising for the Pakistani
government since the economic situation will get worse had
Pakistan acceded to such harsh conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani side is reported to have convinced the IMF
officials that any rise in power rates and GST or devaluation of
rupee will adversely affect the economic and industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is expected to ask senior IMF officials during the
second round of talks not to push for strict conditions which may
lead to an Indonesia-like situation in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The economists here are of the view that this will be a
mindless policy at a time when Pakistan is expecting a zero
industrial growth rate.
</P>
<P>
They also believe that any rise in power or GST rates would
further encourage the evasion. Instead of increase in power
tariff, the fundamental problems facing WAPDA should be addressed
to overcome its huge annual losses.
</P>
<P>
Hafeez Pasha, advisor on finance to the Prime Minister, has
said that the second round of talks between Pakistan and the IMF
will focus on the size of the funding and a structural reforms
package.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that devaluation of rupee, increase in
utility rates, GST on the retail level, agriculture tax and
restructuring of the Central Board of Revenue are the main issues
to be further discussed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
It is still hard to predict at this stage whether the
Pakistani government will have a successful dialogue with the IMF
and other multilateral financial agencies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Privatization Boosts Myanmar Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been implementing a
privatization plan for its state economic enterprises (SEE), aimed
at transforming them into effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process got under way in January 1995 when
the first-phase privatization scheme was announced. The scheme
covers 51 SEEs including processing and manufacturing factories,
cinemas and livestock breeding farms, and is being implemented in
various forms -- auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or
establishing joint ventures with local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
About 140 state-run cinemas, 42 factories and two livestock
breeding farms have been designated to be sold through competitive
biddings. And more than two dozen state-owned saw mills have been
privatized, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises include those nationalized during the time of
the Revolutionary Council government in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In a significant move to accelerate the privatization of heavy
industries, Myanmar last month transferred Ywama Steel Mill, the
biggest state-run enterprise leased out since the privatization
plan began, to local private entrepreneurs for continuous
operation at full capacity in an effort to boost production.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate privatization and marketization, the government
promulgated the SEE Law in March 1989, defining the specified
areas of business and economic activities that can be undertaken
by the private enterprises and the activities that the government
has the sole right to carry out.
</P>
<P>
The law was amended in March 1997, allowing state employees'
organizations to carry on the SEEs with their own investment
without applying for state finances.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate and promote large, medium amd small-scale
private industries, the government enacted the Private Industrial
Enterprise Law in November 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the privatization process, the government strives to ensure
that in transfering the SEE to private business people, local
Myanmar citizens take priority over foreigners.
</P>
<P>
One of Myanmar's four economic objectives is designated as "the
initiative to shape the national economy must be kept in the hands
of the state and the national peoples."
</P>
<P>
In April 1994, Myanmar also enacted Citizens Investment Law to
promote inducement of domestic investment to bring about increases
in commodity production and exports by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's gross domestic
product (GDP) in the 1997-98 fiscal year grew by 4.6 percent, with
the private sector having contributed 75.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The private sector's foreign trade has been considerably
boosted with its share of exports jumping to 67.8 percent in
1997-98 from 46.3 percent in 1988-89 when the country began
adopting a market-oriented economic system. Meanwhile, its share
of imports also rose to 71.9 percent from 40.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The private sector's investment accounted for 53 percent of the
total, rocketing from 5.6 billion Kyats (18.6 million U.S.
dollars) in 1989-90 to 75.9 billion kyats (253 million dollars) in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the private sector's active participation in economic
development, Myanmar achieved an average annual growth of 7.5
percent in the four-year plan period (1992-93 to 1995-96) and 6
percent growth in the first two years of the current five-year
plan period (1996-97 to 2000-2001).

<HEADLINE> Exhibitors Warned of Dangers in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Exhibitors who will take part
in an international exhibition here slated for 6-12 October are
warned of the potential security dangers they may face and are
advised to take precautions against any bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting attended by more than 100 managers and
manufacturers Friday morning in the Show Ground of Uganda
Manufacturers' Association (UMA), security commanders give
specific tips to the exhibitors on how to ensure safety and act
on an emergency.
</P>
<P>
James Wulwana, the chairman of UMA, said: "we are open to
whatever happens. To ensure the success of the trade fair,
security should be seriously addressed and precautions be taken."
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Namanya, the police commander of Kampala region, told
the gathering that terrorism is an international crime and called
for community awareness against these activities.
</P>
<P>
One security officer said terrorism is a product of bad
politics and politics can't be divorced from economy and called
for those managers' commitment and contribution to security.
</P>
<P>
"We should not give room to terrorists to come and plant a
bomb. And we cannot claim responsibility enough without your
involvement. The best thing to do is to organize yourselves," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At the function, police telephone numbers are offered to those
present, hoping they can contact the nearest police station in
case of emergency.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Friday signed an air services
agreement with Austria.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip signed the agreement
on behalf of the HKSAR Government while State Secretary for
Foreign Affairs Benita Ferrero-Waldner signed on behalf of the
Austrian Government.
</P>
<P>
Ip said Hong Kong and Austria have established close links in
trade, investment, business and tourism for many years. Direct air
services have played a vital role in promoting these links.
</P>
<P>
The Air Services Agreement will provide a legal framework for
continued development of the services, said Ip.
</P>
<P>
According to Ip, the agreement is the first of its kind signed
by Hong Kong after the new Hong Kong International Airport
commenced commercial operation on July 6.
</P>
<P>
"The new airport provides a significant increase in capacity
and operational flexibility for us to expand our air links with
the rest of the world. This will help to maintain Hong Kong's
status as an international and regional aviation center," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR/Austrian air services agreement is the 31st signed by

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to Re-open on October 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Philippine
Airlines (PAL) employees voted for a new deal between the
management and the labor union in a two-day referendum which ended
Friday, paving the way for the re-opening of PAL on October 7.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura Magsalin, executive director of the Labor
Department's national conciliation and mediation board, said that
3,247 yes votes, or 61 percent of the 5,324 total votes cast, and
1,794 no votes were canvassed.
</P>
<P>
"It only means PAL's re-opening on October 7," Magsalin said as
he referred to yes votes' wide winning margin over no votes cast
mostly by hard-liners inside the PAL Employees Association.
</P>
<P>
Magsalin said the referendum netted a turnout of 81.3 percent
and that, of the votes canvassed, 106 were spoiled and 177
segregated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Avelino Capili, a proponent of no votes, said that
the hard-liners will file a petition before the Supreme Court,
disputing the legality of the agreement signed by labor union
officials and the management early this week.
</P>
<P>
PAL, the oldest airlines in Asia, was shut down on September 23
due to heavy losses and the breakdown of talks between the
management and the labor union.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada brokered the new deal, according to
which the labor union will suspend its collective bargaining
agreement for 10 years. In exchange, the management will give
employees 20 percent of the PAL ownership and three seats in the
board of directors.

<P>
The paper said that ELF is believed to have begun negotiations
with at least two American banks to raise the funds needed to
develop the field which is proved to contain about 400 million
barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
The field development plan prepared by ELF has been approved
by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the
development work is expected to begin next year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Provide Vietnam with 580 million US Dollar Loan Per Annum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) plans to grant
Vietnam a loan worth 580 million U.S. dollars each year in the
1999-2002 period, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount of lending would depend on needs and on
progress of the policy agenda, poverty reduction and portfolio
management, the WB Vietnam country director Andrew Steer told a
news conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The WB decision was made at its Board of Executive Directors
meeting in Washington last week, which discussed the bank group's
country assistance strategy for Vietnam covering the period
1998-99 to 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
According to the WB, the International Development Association
approved 19 projects worth 2 billion dollars in Vietnam from 1994
to 1998. Over half of the lending has gone to the much-needed
upgrading of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The WB recognized Vietnam's remarkable progress over the past
years, saying that Vietnam's economic renewal process has yielded
unprecedented levels of GDP growth of eight percent per year on
average between 1990 and 1997, and an impressive reduction in the
share of the population living in acute poverty.
</P>
<P>
Despite this progress, the WB noted that Vietnam remains one of
the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income of
only about 300 dollars per annum.

<HEADLINE> Military Approach Cannot Resolve Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Military approach cannot resolve
the crisis in the Great Lakes region, the visiting special envoy
of the European Union (EU) said in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
EU envoy for the Great Lakes region Aldo Ajello said this
during his meeting with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting, Ajello told reporters that "it will not
be easy to resolve the crisis in Congo (Kinshasa) because many
interests are involved in this conflict."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the crisis in the Great Lakes region, the EU envoy
pointed out that people should give up their illusion that "the
military approach can solve the political problems."
</P>
<P>
The national Noticias newspaper Friday quoted Ajello as saying
that he had come to "know what President Chissano thinks about
the crisis in the Great Lakes."
</P>
<P>
"Mozambique is a successful model for peace process," the EU
envoy said, adding that "I am confident that its role will be
helpful to the entire Great Lakes region."
</P>
<P>
Ajello acknowledged that the difficulties facing the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) include the participation of
all political parties in the democratization, the establishment
of a government of national unity and reconciliation and the
preparation for elections.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is a problem concerning the Tutsi Banyamulenge
who are attempting to topple the government led by DRC President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the border disputes between the DRC and its
neighbors, Uganda, Brundi and Rwanda, also have their influences
in the peace and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
"It should be made clear to all the countries concerned in
this region that the crisis must be resolved in a political way,"
Ajello noted. "A political resolution can never be reached unless
their individual interests are taken into consideration."
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy arrived in Maputo Wednesday after his visit to
South Africa. He also held talks with Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Ajello who had been the special representative of the United
Nations Secretary-General to Mozambique for the peace process in
the southern African country from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to leave Maputo for Namibia Friday before
going to Zambia, Angola, Rwanda and Tanzania to mediate for peace
in the Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Record Growth Next Year: Bank Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will record
positive economic growth next year after registering negative
growth this year, Bank Negara (State Bank) Governor Ali Abul
Hassan Sulaiman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minus 4.8 percent gross domestic product growth in the
first half of this year would mean that 1998 would see an overall
negative growth rate, he told a briefing here without giving exact
figures.
</P>
<P>
The governor said he could not provide exact numbers for the
time being as they were changing for the better each time
following the implementation of various financial and economic
measures adopted by the government.
</P>
<P>
More definite figures will emerge when the 1999 Budget is
presented on October 23, he said, adding he was confident that the
local economy would see a dramatic turnaround following the
adoption of the measures which included effecting greater
liquidity in the banking system, greater access to lending and
lower interest rates for loans.
</P>
<P>
He said signs of an economic recovery were already there and
there were already several "feel good" factors as far as economic
recovery in the country was concerned.
</P>
<P>
On the imposition of selective exchange controls from last
month, Ali said the Malaysian government had to act fast and
decisively to protect its economy, with a main objective to regain
monetary independence to enable the country to introduce measures
based solely on domestic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy registered a negative growth of 1.8 percent,
which was revised to negative 2.8 percent later for the first
quarter and saw a negative growth of 6.8 percent for the second
quarter this year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Lowers Insurers' Capital, Solvency Margins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday announced
some new measures to help the insurance industry tide over the
economic downturn, including lowering the capital and solvency
margin requirements of insurers.
</P>
<P>
The minimum capital requirement for direct insurers will be
reduced to 35 million ringgit (about 9.21 million U.S. dollars)
from 50 million ringgit (about 13.157 million U.S. dollars) by
December 31 this year and the minimum margin of solvency for each
class of business to 30 million ringgit (about 7.894 million U.S.
dollars) from 50 million ringgit (about 13.157 million U.S.
dollars) from January 1,1999, Bank Negara (State Bank) Governor
Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry has shown signs of a slowdown and has to
be revitalized after recording only a marginal increase in
combined premium income of 3.4 percent for the first half of this
year, compared with 19.3 percent in the same period last year,
Ali, who is also director-general of insurance, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The capital and solvency margin requirements, under the
Insurance Act 1996, were introduced early last year to gear
insurers to be larger players and to prepare them to compete in a
liberalized environment.
</P>
<P>
Ali said asset growth of the industry had also slowed down to
6.5 percent, during the first half of this year, from 11.1 percent
in the first half of 1997, largely due to deflation in asset
values as well as contraction in business.
</P>
<P>
Other measures announced include allowing insurers to maintain
a minimum of 70 percent in aggregate of the insurance fund
liabilities and margin of solvency in the form of admitted assets.
</P>
<P>
The balance 30 percent of the liabilities and margin of
solvency could be supported by other assets.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Export Earnings Likely to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports are likely to
earn 53.6 billion U.S. dollars this year, down by 8 percent from
last year, the Board of Investment said in a statement available
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The board based its prediction on trade figures for January to
August, which showed export returns of 35.98 billion dollars, down
5.4 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of cars, pickups and motorcycles were promising in the
first half. Exports for the year would likely reach 58,000
vehicles and 200,000 motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Several projects backed by government promotions maintained
their export potential, including canned tuna, frozen fish, frozen
chicken, rubber gloves, tyres, canned pineapples, jewelry, toys,
shoes and leather.
</P>
<P>
But in terms of export value, they were unlikely to show better
returns in the second half of the year than the first half.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural exports declined by 10 percent in the first seven
months, processed farm products by 3 percent and industrial goods
by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports in January to August had contracted by 37 percent to
28.516 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In August alone, imports declined by 33.2 percent to 3.391
billion dollars from 12 months earlier. Imports for the year would
likely total 42.1 billion dollars, a drop of 33.5 percent from
last year's level.

<HEADLINE> Pre-election Jitters Cause Australian Dollar to End Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Pre-election jitters finally
caught up with the Australian dollar Friday and caused it to close
slightly weaker.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 59.37 U.S. cents from
Thursday's close of 59.39 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
On the day the local currency traded in a range of more than
three quarters of a U.S. cent, touching a high of 59.90 U.S. cents
and falling to a low of 59.09 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, foreign exchange dealer with Colonial State
Bank, said election jitters, particularly concerning the fact the
campaign is close, are affecting the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
More than 12 million Australians go to the polls Saturday for
an election which has been fought largely on the issue of tax
reform.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said the first fear among markets is that the
election might result in a hung parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The second fear might be that the ruling Liberal Party gets in
but with a very small majority which makes it hard to govern,
particularly with all the legislation they have to get through,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The expected close result is guaranteed to keep the markets
range trading until a definitive outcome emerges.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading in Sydney the local currency was buying
80.04 Japanese yen from 81.21 yen and 0.9807 German marks from
0.9913 yen.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Takes Program for Post-Flood Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken a massive program of 42.43 billion taka (902.8 million U.S.
dollars) for reconstructing the damaged infrastructure and
rehabilitating the people distressed by this century's worst
floods in the country, an English newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has recently directed the
concerned ministries to start open market sale of rice,
distribution of vulnerable group feeding (VGF) and vulnerable
group development cards to reduce the sufferings of the people in
the flood-hit areas, The Bangladesh Observer said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina has also asked the ministries to start the test relief
and food for work program in the rural areas from October to
generate employment.
</P>
<P>
The government has received a demand for 22.96 billion taka
(488.5 million dollars) on the emergency basis from 16 concerned
ministries for the infrastructure reconstruction damaged by the
flood. The ministries also prepared projects worth 19.72 billion
taka (419.6 million dollars) for immediate implementation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has started distribution of 32.7
billion taka (695.7 million dollars) as agricultural credit among
the farmers to rehabilitate the agriculture sector and raise food
production to offset the deficit due to crop failure during the
floods.
</P>
<P>
In view of the sufferings of the flood victims, the government
has already issued 1,075,370 VGF cards which will provide 16
kilograms of foodgrains per month to each family under an extended
VGF program. The government will issue 2.5 million VGF cards for
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Over two-thirds of the country were hit by the two-month-long
floods which left a trail of devastation in 52 out of the 64
districts with more than 30 million people seriously affected and
total losses preliminarily estimated at 3.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Gets 209 Mln Dollars in Flood Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh had already received
commitments of 209.77 million U.S. dollars in cash and kind as
flood aid from donor countries and agencies by September 30, media
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the pledged amount, 141.05 million dollars are in food aid,
58.57 million dollars in cash and 10.15 million dollars in kind,
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said Thursday on his return from
New York where he attended the 53rd United Nations General
Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
Azad said 27 countries had pledged their full support to the
Bangladeshi government's efforts in overcoming the impact of
floods and launching the post-flood rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
He had separate meetings with foreign ministers of as many as
17 countries on the sidelines of the U.N. session, during which he
reiterated the appeal for immediate assistance for flood victims
and the need for intensive post-flood reconstruction and
rehabilitation works.
</P>
<P>
As the flood situation was deteriorating further, the
Bangladeshi government on August 24 decided to issue an
international appeal for 789 million U.S. dollars in aid to fund
relief and post-flood rehabilitation programs. It then directed
the country's diplomatic missions abroad and sent high-ranking
officials to seek assistance from donor countries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
The worst-ever flooding in a century in this South Asian
country had gripped as much as two-thirds of the country for 10
weeks and affected about half of its 127 million people. The
floods left more than 1,100 people dead and caused an estimated
loss of 3.4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Talks between Lesotho Government, Oppositions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
Lesotho government and opposition party alliance met Friday
morning in capital Maseru for talks aimed at breaking the
country's current political impasse.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by South African Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi, began just after 9:00 a.m., South
African Press Association quoted informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the parties in the mountain
kingdom talked face-to-face since the political turmoil started
two months ago amid allegations of fraud in the May 23 election.
</P>
<P>
"At last we meet the government face to face and hope that the
outcome will be good to the nation," opposition alliance
spokeswoman Mamelo Morrison told mass media just before the talks
began at the United Nations House in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
The multiparty talks are aimed at settling the controversy
over allegations that Lesotho's May 23 general election was
rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy
(LCD).
</P>
<P>
Paks Mankahlana, aide to President Nelson Mandela, said the
South Africans were optimistic that progress would be made in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition Basotho National Party leader Retsilisitsoe
Sekhonyane Thursday urged all parties in the country to trust
each other and to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
"Compromise is the language of negotiation," local daily the
Star Friday quoted Sekhonyane saying. But he declined to specify
issues the opposition was prepared to compromise on.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition was still insisting that the government
led by Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili resign, and on the
formation of an interim government of national unity, before
fresh election is held.
</P>
<P>
The ruling LCD could not be reached for comment on Friday
morning.

ANKARA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said Friday that Turkey will continue to exert efforts
for the preservation of independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for a two-day official visit to
Macedonia, Demirel said at the Ankara Esenboga Airport that
during his talks with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, they
will seek ways to further develop cooperation in the fields of
the economy, transportation, trade, culture and military.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit of Demirel to Macedonia, a country
located in the heart of southeastern Europe, since he became
president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"My visit will be a means for disclosing the joint attitudes of
Turkey and Macedonia who have similar concerns regarding the
Kosovo issue," Demirel said, quoted by the semi-official Anatolia
news agency.
</P>
<P>
"We will also discuss Turkish entrepreneurs' contributions to
the road project, called the East-West Corridor, which will link
Varna to Durres in the Adriatic via Scopje," he added.
</P>
<P>
Two agreements in the field of agricultural cooperation and a
new protocol between scientific organizations of the two countries
will be signed during Demirel's visit.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Kim Beazley: Sharp, Decent Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Kim Beazley, leader of
Australia's opposition Labor Party, does not bid for the prime
ministership as a man who believes he was destined to lead the
nation.
</P>
<P>
A strong sense of duty rather than the fierce fire of ambition
has fuelled his political ascent during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
If Beazley wins Saturday's election, he will be the first
Australian opposition leader to oust a government after only one
term since the Great Depression in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Whether he will win this election or not, Beazley, 49, has
demonstrated his strengths and capability by being neck-and-neck
with Prime Minister John Howard in the opinion polls in final
three weeks before the October 3 polling day.
</P>
<P>
He was unanimously elected leader of the Labor Party in March,
1996, and succeeded in avoiding the ugly post-election
bloodletting and disunity that many had presumed would be
inevitable in the aftermath of a crushing 1996 electoral defeat
under the leadership of Paul Keating.
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased and unexpectedly (elected) Labor leader and when
I got the job I did not expect to be prime minister," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
But he changed his mind after he was angered by Howard's
"encouragement" of Pauline Hanson divisiveness, and the
government's nursing home policy, which was so unpopular among the
old Australians that the Howard government had to back down last
year.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of the two caused me to think this government
was not fit to govern," Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
A sharp, decent person, Beazley is a politician liked and
admired by both sides of the politics. He served as minister for
13 years in the Bob Hawke and subsequent Paul Keating government.
</P>
<P>
Despite being an ardent supporter of Hawke, who was challenged
and defeated by his treasurer Keating in the 1990 election,
Beazley was trusted and promoted to finance minister and later
deputy prime minister by Keating.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, John Howard, who was then in opposition, said if
he had to form a national government in a time of crisis, Beazley
was one of two persons he would select from the Labor Party, the
arch-rival of Howard's Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
Beazley became the youngest ever Australian Defense Minister in
1984 at the age of 35. For more than five years, Beazley turned
the country's defensive structure upside down, dragging it into
the modern era by spending several billion dollars on new
frigates, submarines, helicopters.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign, Beazley said he wants to be
remembered as an education prime minister of Australia if he wins
the election, and outlined his vision for the future Australia as
a country where "Australians are skilled, secure, confident and
united people."
</P>
<P>
"I want an Australia where no one turns on fellow Australians,
but recognized in our great multicultural and multiracial
society," he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Beazley listed unemployment as
the top priority issue he would tackle if elected, and offered
more benefit to the Australian middle and low income earners in
his tax package than what Howard's tax plan did.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1948, Beazley was educated at Oxford University, where
he befriended Tony Blair, now the British prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He has three children, and is married to Susie Annus, an
immigrant from Hungary.

<HEADLINE> Profile: John Howard: a Social Conservative, Economic Liberal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Saturday's federal election
will decide the status of John Howard in Australia's history:
either a tenacious politician that will usher Australia into the
21st century with a new taxation system, or the first
one-term-only Australian prime minister since the Great Depression
in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Howard, 58, has risen, despite all sorts of impediments and
obstacles in the past 24 years, to the highest office in Australia
after he unseated his predecessor Paul Keating in 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
By the time he became a federal MP in 1974, Howard, a lawyer by
training, already had 18 years of politics behind him. The next
year he was made Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in
Malcolm Fraser's government, then Minister Assisting The Prime
Minister in 1977, Minister for Special Trade Negotiations, and
Treasurer until 1983.
</P>
<P>
He had first challenged for the leadership of the Liberal Party
of Australia in 1983, the first of the party's consecutive 13
years in opposition, but lost to Andrew Peacock. Two years later,
Howard seized the leadership.
</P>
<P>
As leader of the opposition, Howard said in 1988 that the rate
of Asian immigration should be slowed, which he later repeatedly
regretted. A year later, He lost the leadership to Peacock.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Peacock and his handpicked successor John
Hewson as leader of their party over their 1990 and 1993 federal
electoral defeats and their departure from Australia's political
arena paved the way for Howard's return to the top job of the
party.
</P>
<P>
Howard's battle first failed and Alexander Downer was made
leader of the party, but the young leader's repeated mistakes cost
him leadership in 1995 and Howard finally recaptured the position.
</P>
<P>
Australian voters' weariness of the 13 years of rule by the
Australian Labor Party and their yearnings for a change of
government led to a landslide victory of Howard's Liberal Party
and National Party coalition in 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
He was short, bespectacled and hard of hearing, but his
tenacity and good luck enabled him to become the 25th person to
occupy the office of Prime Minister of Australia, and the only
Liberal Party heavyweight to survive the party's 13 consecutive
years in opposition.
</P>
<P>
"I'm conservative on social issues, but I'm liberal on economic
issues," Howard said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
He is indeed conservative on social issues, including gun
control and family values, but on those issues such as Asian
immigration and whether Australia should become a republic,
Howard is decades behind the time.
</P>
<P>
He was about eight months late than his former party leader
Malcolm Fraser and other former prime ministers, such as Bob
Hawke, and his ministers in their condemnation of Pauline Hanson's
racist attack on Asian immigration and Aborigines in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
His refusal last year to apologize over the nation's "stolen
generation", referring to tens of thousands of Aboriginal children
forcibly taken away from their homes during 60 years until the
1970s under the white assimilation policies, and his failure to
endorse multiculturalism made him a moral dwarf in the eyes of
Australian ethnic minority groups and many white Australians.
</P>
<P>
Yet, as one of the nation's longest-serving treasurer, Howard
may take some credit for economic reform measures.
</P>
<P>
During the past 25 years, no one else in Australia politics can
match Howard for his championing of economic reform, for the way
in which he has single-mindedly pursued issues such as smaller
government, lower taxation, industry deregulation, more
competition, more freedom for workers, cheaper imports, more
exports and a tougher stance on trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The past two and a half years saw the Howard government cut
9,000 public service jobs in Canberra alone, slash billions of
U.S. dollars in funding for government services, education, and
social welfare, and encourage attempts to break the country's
maritime trade union's monopoly of power over the nation's sea
ports.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before he called the October 3 federal election, he
announced his long-cherished plan to reform the nation's
60-year-old tax system with a 10 percent tax on goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the tax reform as well as his political life will
be known Saturday as the whole nation goes to the polls.
</P>
<P>
Howard married Janette, a teacher by profession, in 1971. They
have two boys and a girl.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Exploration of Large Oilfields in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up efforts to
explore simultaneously two large oilfields in the central
part of the Bohai Sea, in a bid to develop an annual crude
production capacity of 4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, president of the China Offshore Oil
Bohai Corp (COOBC), oil to be turned out by the two oilfields --
Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Nanbao 35-2 -- will be piped inland through
the port of Jingtang in Tangshan city, north China's Hebei
province.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield, with 170 million tons of verified
geological oil reserves, is 100 kilometers east of Tanggu in
Tianjin. Presently, 11 wells have been drilled there.
</P>
<P>
Nanbao 35-2 Oilfield lies 20 kilometers south of Tangshan. Four
test wells have been drilled in the oilfield and have identified
geological oil reserves of 70 million tons. Nanbao's reserves have
been estimated at 110 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the two oilfields are only 20 kilometers
apart, making their joint development possible in a 70-sq km
oil-bearing area in the central Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
He said that seven standard platforms will be erected in the
two oilfields, two pipelines laid at the seabed to pump oil
inland, and terminals built in Jingtang Port.
</P>
<P>
About 650 meters of coastline will be requisitioned for
building oil transport berths, he added. The entire construction
will cost 7.29 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The official forecasts that the Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield will
begin production in 2003 and Nanbao one year later. By 2004, the
two oilfields are expected to produce four million tons of oil a
year.

passengers go through necessary procedures.
</P>
<P>
The system was introduced by the U.S.'s Unisys and the Civil
Aviation Administration of China. It has greatly improved the
efficiency of Hongqiao Airport and will be introduced to other
airports in China, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 airports and aviation companies in the
world using the system and its use at Hongqiao shows that the
airport's management is approaching international standards,
officials say.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand sharemarket
hit a new five-year low Friday with the NZSE40 Capital Index
falling to 1,668 points.
</P>
<P>
This means the index has lost nearly 1,000 points since it
reached its post-crash peak on October 23 last year.
</P>
<P>
In total, the top 40 shares were worth 37 billion NZ dollars
(18.5 billion U.S. dollars) Friday, about 22 billion NZ dollars
(11 billion U.S. dollars) less than their combined market value in
October last year, According to Television New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10 billion NZ dollars (five billion U.S. dollars) has
been wiped off the value of New Zealand shares in the past three
months, The Dominion reported.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper noted that the dive in the
sharemarket in the past three months is unusual, as it came at a
time of falling interest rates, which are usually positive for
equities as investors take their money out of banks and place it
in shares, looking for better returns.

imports.
</P>
<P>
In a media statement, Smith said the New Zealand Government
would "strongly oppose any move by the U.S. to move in the wrong
direction, particularly with respect to access for an important
New Zealand product like lamb."

<P>
He said New Zealand would respond positively if the U.S.
Administration initiates consultations with it with respect to the
issue.
</P>
<P>

OTTAWA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- There will be no barechested
competitors in the synchronized swimming event at the 1999 Pan
American Games, according to reports from Winnipeg, Canada.
</P>
<P>
That's because American synchro star Bill May, who won two
silver medals in the traditionally female sport at the 1998
Goodwill Games, has been ordered out of the pool.
</P>
<P>
Don MacKenzie, president and CEO of the Games to be held in
Winnipeg next summer, said he was "surprised" by the Amateur
Swimming Union of the America's (ASUA) recent ruling to continue
to exclude men from synchro competitions under its
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
In making its decision, ASUA deferred to the rules of the
international governing body for aquatic sports known as FINA,
and those of the Olympic Games. Neither allow men to compete in
synchronized swimming.

SHANGHAI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong New Area
has become a major tourist destination, with 1.88 million tourists
in the first seven months of the year, and 590 million yuan in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Since it was established in 1990, the area has built more than
300 highrises, including dozens of skyscrapers such as the Pearl
TV Tower, the tallest tower in Asia, and the Jinmao Building. Many
of them have become scenic spots that can give visitors a
bird's-eye view of the city.
</P>
<P>
The area has worked out a series of tour routes like "cycling
around Pudong," "touring the Shenmei bottling plant" and "visit to
an agricultural development zone."
</P>
<P>
One popular spot is the Sunqiao Modern Agricultural Development
Zone on a 10-sq.km. area, which produces a great variety of
hydroponic crops and attracted 60,000 visitors during the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Dao Shuming, deputy director of the Shanghai Tourism Commission,
predicts that the number of tourists in the area will grow
steadily in the years to come as infrastructure along the Huangpu
River improves.

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Impressive Housing Development Momentum (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
headway in housing construction and completed housing space
totaling 4.2 billion square meters over the past 20 years since
the start of the reform and opening policy.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the country's average urban per capita living space
has grown to nearly 9 sq m, or a 1.4-fold increase over that of
1978 and the figure for rural areas stands at nearly 18 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Housing industry has not only effectively boosted the national
economic development, but also turned out to be a hot spot for
civilian consumption over the past 20 years since the reform and
opening-up policies were introduced.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in housing development and marked improvements
in the people's housing conditions have been reported, and annual
urban housing construction has surpassed 200 million sq m, with
the figure for rural housing standing at 600 million sq m.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6 billion sq m of urban and rural housing China built
between 1992 and 1997 helped solve housing problems for over six
million households, whose per capita living space was far below
the national average. Some 25 percent of urban households have
been moved into new houses.
</P>
<P>
The "affordable housing project" has been implemented in more
than 200 cities, with the addition of over 25 million sq m of
housing space.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rapid development of housing cooperatives has
effectively expanded fund-raising channels and has benefited the
low- and medium-income households.
</P>
<P>
Construction departments at various levels have made great
efforts to improve infrastructure facilities, including water
supply, drainage, heating, roads, bridges, highways, tree-planting
and environmental protection systems. Related efforts have greatly
helped improve the people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
And it has become top concern for the Chinese government to
solve housing problems for the citizens, which is regarded as a
major aspect for the Chinese people to lead a well-off life. To
meet the end, the country has worked out a series of preferential
policies to develop the housing sector as a major economic
pillar.

<P>
The deepening and popularization of housing reform, which means
selling houses to citizens instead of distributing houses to them
as material benefits, will play decisive roles in developing real
estate markets. With the changing of attitude toward spending,
more and more citizens will choose to buy houses for themselves.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ruling Party Youth Leader Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Ahmad Zahid Hamidi Friday
resigned as Youth Chief of the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO).
</P>
<P>
Announcing his resignation at a news conference here, Zahid
said the decision was final, adding that he had written two
letters to party president Mahathir Mohamad, who is also Prime
Minister, on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Zahid is known as a strong supporter of former deputy prime
minister and finance minister Anwar Ibrahim who was sacked from
the cabinet on September 2 and expelled from UMNO, of which he was
deputy president, a day later. Anwar is now facing 10 charges of
corruption and sodomy in court.
</P>
<P>
Zahid was arrested on September 21 under the Internal Security
Act, a day after Anwar was detained under the same act, and was
freed from detention on September 30, a day after Anwar was
charged in court.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Zahid said his decision to resign was
not due to pressure from any quarters -- whether from the UMNO
Youth executive committee or state or divisional youth chiefs. He
said the decision was in the overall interests of the movement.
</P>
<P>
Zahid, who is also a member of parliament, said he would remain
in UMNO and continue serving the party as a member.
</P>
<P>
Zahid's resignation came after the UMNO Youth executive
committee handed over a memorandum to the UMNO Supreme Council
through party secretary-general Sabbaruddin Chik on September 24
declaring their loss of confidence in Zahid's leadership.

LOS ANGELES, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The largest bank in the
United States, created by the merger of two banks officially
completed Wednesday, will operate as Bank of America, the new bank
announced Thursday
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have made an excellent choice," said the new
bank, which was created by the merger of Bank of America
(BankAmerica) and NationsBank.

The decision followed months of strength analysis of the two
old names. Some 5,000 customers and employees were interviewed and
big bucks were paid to a New York ID consultant.
</P>
<P>
The name of NationsBank was chosen seven years ago, while Bank
of America, based in San Francisco, has been around since 1930.
</P>
<P>
The combined new bank will be headquartered in Charlotte, where
the former principal office of NationsBank was situated, with
NationsBank boss Hugh McColl as chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
The surviving 20-person board of directors of the new bank is
comprised of 11 directors from NationsBank and nine from Bank of
America. Bank of America's boss David Coulter is now president of
the new bank.
</P>
<P>
The new bank holds a leading 8 percent share of the nation's
bank deposits and has relationships with 30 million American
households as well as two million businesses around the world.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are some facts
and figures about Saturday's federal election in Australia:
</P>
<P>
Polling day: October 3.
</P>
<P>
Number of ordinary polling places: 7,775. The polling places
are usually in local schools, church halls or public buildings and
are open between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. (22:00 GMT Friday and 08:00 GMT
Saturday).
</P>
<P>
Number of ballot boxes: 38,212.
</P>
<P>
Number of voters: 12,056,625 (18 years old or older), compared
with the nation's population of 18.5 million.
</P>
<P>
At stake are all of the 148 seats in the House of
Representatives, and 40 seats or half of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,435 candidates, including 329 for the Senate and

least 50 percent plus one of the formal votes, either on first
preference or following distribution of preference votes.
</P>

excluded candidate's votes are transferred to the other candidates
according to the second preferences shown by voters on the ballot
papers.

<P>
This process of excluding candidates one by one, continues
until one candidate has more than half the total votes and is

<HEADLINE> Facts &AMP; Figures (5): Key Political Parties of Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The following is a brief
introduction about key political parties of Australia:
</P>
<P>
A coalition of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National
Party of Australia dominated national politics from 1949 to 1983,
only ceding power from 1972 to 1975.
</P>
<P>
From 1983 to 1996, the Australian Labor Party controlled the
national government before losing to the Liberal-National
coalition in the election held on March 2, 1996. The political
scene is now dominated by the four major parties described below.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party of Australia (LP)
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party of Australia was founded in 1944, uniting the
many different political organizations. The LP has become
Australia's most successful post-war party. It fought its first
election in 1946 with some success and in 1947, the LP won state
elections in the states of Western Australia, South Australia and
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The LP had ruled the country in coalition with the National
Party for 23 years from 1949 to 1972 and for another term of more
than seven years from 1975 to 1983. In 1996, Australians elected
the Liberal Party, in coalition with the National Party of
Australia, to govern Australia.
</P>
<P>
The LP advocates private enterprise, conservative financial
policies, social justice, individual liberty and initiative, and
is committed to national development, prosperity and security, and
cooperation with the United States and the British Commonwealth.
Its leader is John Howard, who is Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
The National Party of Australia - NPA (formerly the National
Country Party):
</P>
<P>
The National Party of Australia was founded in 1916 as the
Country Party of Australia, changed its name to the National
Country Party in 1974 and adopted the present name in 1982.
Members of the NPA have swelled to 80,000.

policy. It advocates balanced national development within a system
of free enterprise to address rural and farming issues.
</P>
<P>

The Australian Labor Party (ALP)
</P>
<P>
The Australian Labor Party was founded in 1891 by the trade
union movement and remains one of the few parties in the world to
retain a formal affiliation with trade unions. The ALP, the
largest and the first modern political party in Australia, was a
ruling party on 11 occasions since 1904, including one from 1983
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ALP was formed as a laborist party to represent the working
class and the labor movement in parliament. It advocates an
independent foreign policy, racial and gender equality, and
increased rights for the nation's Aboriginal population. Kim
Beazley is leader of the ALP.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats Party
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats Party is a modern socialist group
formed in 1977 by a reformist Liberal cabinet minister. The
Australian Democrats Party comprises former Liberal Movement, and
the Australia Party. The party, which holds seven seats in the
76-member federal Senate, focuses on contemporary issues rather
than a set agenda. Its leader is Ms Meg Lees, replacing former
leader Cheryl Kernot, who defected to the Labor Party in October
of 1997.

<P>
The One Nation Party
</P>
<P>
The One Nation Party was launched in Ipswich, Queensland state,
on April 11, 1997 by federal MP Pauline Hanson, who advocates cuts

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The following is a brief
introduction about Australian history:
</P>
<P>
The British made their first appearance in Australia in 1688.
British navigator James Cook sighted and made a visit to the
southern shore of the Australian mainland in 1770. In 1786 the
British government decided to colonize the continent, which led to
a great immigration afterwards. The first group of immigrants,
numbering 1,030 (including 736 convicts in exile), under Captain
Arthur Phillip, reached the east coast near Sydney and established
the first colony there. The continent was named "Australia" in
1817. By the end of the 19th century, six colonies had been set up
in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The British Parliament adopted "The Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Australia" in 1900. In the next year, the six
colonies became States and were federated as a self-rule
territory, under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia. On May
9 in the same year, the first session of the Australian Parliament
convened in Melbourne. The Capital was moved to Canberra in 1927.
Under the "Westminster Bill" passed by the British Parliament in
1931, Australia gained the right to act independently in the
domestic and foreign area, and was claimed as independent state in
the Commonwealth.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not Aware of Iranian Move: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman
said the Pakistani government was not aware of the Iranian move to
withdrawal its embassy staff, and was still verifying the facts,
the Frontier Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iran has reportedly pulled out more than 60 functionaries of
its embassy in Islamabad this week, including some senior
diplomats, because of "certain problems."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmud Mohammadi said in
Tehran that the staff had been withdrawn due to "certain
problems." But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
However, he insisted that there was no change in the state of
relations between the two Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ambassador to Pakistan, Mehdi Ali Akhundzadeh, told
a Lahore-based newspaper Wednesday that the Pakistani government
had not been informed of the move because the withdrawal did not
come about under duress.
</P>
<P>
He said that since most embassy personnel were feeling unsafe
following the Mazar-i-Sharif incident, they left Pakistan
temporarily to reunite with their families in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Nine Iranian diplomats were killed in the northern Afghan town
of Mazar-i-Sharif when the Taliban militia raided and captured the
town on August 8.
</P>
<P>
However, the Frontier Post quoted a highly-placed Pakistani
source as saying that the Iranian withdrawal "has nothing to do
with the situation in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian decision to cut the embassy staff was linked more
to the situation obtaining in Pakistan, the source said.
</P>
<P>
"An increased threat of sectarian killings, and some recent
newspaper reports may be responsible," the source added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high-level meeting was held at the Foreign Office
here Thursday to review the situation arising from the withdrawal
of Iranian diplomats from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sources were tight-lipped about the meeting, and refused to
divulge details.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says NATO Ready to Strike Serbian Forces in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was ready
for military strikes against Serbian forces in Kosovo, but hoped
the crisis would be resolved through diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"The combined threat of the use of force and diplomacy is the
best way of proceeding," Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said after key national security officials briefed most of the
Senate on the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters that the three-track response to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the Kosovo issue involved
resolving the humanitarian problems, pushing for a diplomatic
resolution and preparing for a NATO strike.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of a credible military threat is to indicate that
in absence of meeting those demands, he faces such a threat,"
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Cohen
delivered the classified briefing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the U.S. warned Americans to leave
Yugoslavia because of the looming air strike against Serbia by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the travel warning
was being issued because "we think the combination of President
Milosevic's failure to respond and the possibility of NATO action
makes Serbia-Montenegro a more dangerous place."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Yugoslavia
must quickly withdraw its forces from Kosovo to avert a looming
military strike by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was possible for Milosevic to avert the air
strikes, McCurry said diplomatic possibilities for resolving the
issue had not been exhausted, and it would not be out of character
for Milosevic to yield to United Nations demands that he end
hostilities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"When faced with diplomacy backed by force, he has in the past
backed down," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Find Links Between Electric Fields, Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Extremely low-frequency
electric and magnetic fields, such as those emitted by residential
appliances and local power lines, may be linked to children's
leukemia, according to a study by a group of U.S. government
researchers.
</P>
<P>
Their report has been on the Web site of the U.S. National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The report was
released Wednesday at a San Francisco presentation by the
institute, which will hold a hearing in the city to record public
comment, San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Electricity has been used for 100 years without society being
aware of any adverse health effect, other than thermal injury and
electrocution, the report said in explaining the origin of the
study.
</P>
<P>
But a 1979 report first suggested that children living near
power lines had an increased risk for developing cancer, arousing
growing concern on the part of the public about whether electric
and magnetic fields (EMF) might be adverse to human health.
</P>
<P>
Despite a multitude of studies, the report said, there remains
considerable debate over what, if any, health effects result from
exposure to EMF.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences stated in a
report that "average magnetic fields measured in the homes of
children have not been found to be associated with an excess in
childhood leukemia."
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the new report of the NIEHS, titled "Assessment of
health effects of exposure to power-line frequency electric and
magnetic fields," stated that data "support an association between
exposure to calculated magnetic fields and the incidence of
childhood leukemia."
</P>
<P>
Nineteen of 29 researchers in the NIEHS group voted to conclude
that EMF should be considered "a possible human carcinogen," the
third-highest category of risk. None concluded that EMF should be
classified as a "known human carcinogen," the highest category, or
"probable human carcinogen."
</P>
<P>
In a separate vote, a majority of the researchers concluded
there is "limited evidence" that EMF is carcinogenic in children,
while others found the evidence regarding child leukemia to be
"inadequate."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the researchers concluded overwhelmingly that
there is inadequate evidence that residential EMF exposure is
carcinogenic in adults.
</P>
<P>
As noted in the NIEHS study, weak electric and magnetic fields,
which oscillate 60 times per second, are emitted by power lines,
transformers, service wires and electrical panels, as well such
home appliances as electric blankets, water beds, clocks, electric
razors and television.

QUITO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's September inflation rate
amounted to 5.1 percent, 3.8 points more than that of August,
according to figures published Thursday by the Institute of
Statistics and Census of Ecuador (INEC).
</P>
<P>
INEC reported that the inflation rate was 3.8 percent in the
coastal area and 6.5 percent in the mountain area.
</P>
<P>
It said the country's inflation rate in the first nine months
of this year stood at 31 percent and 37.8 percent for the past 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Prices of gas registered the biggest increase in September --
353.8 percent, while food prices went up by 9.1 percent, urban
transportation 17.3 percent, and a taxi ride 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other goods whose prices increased were gasoline, 15.6 percent;
secondary school fees, 24.8 percent; primary school fees, 14.7

INEC Director Johny Cevallos attributed the inflation rise to
the increase in the prices of the family basket, a consequence of
the economic package of the government announced on September 14.

Economic analysts predicted that 1998 would end with a price
rise of between 43 and 46 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia lodged a strong
protest against Albania on Thursday for the killing of five of its
border guards by armed men coming from the Albanian territory.
</P>
<P>
The official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted a note of
protest as saying that the incident was a gross violation of
Yugoslav territory.
</P>
<P>
The note said that about 50 armed terrorists entered the
Yugoslav territory from Albania on Wednesday and attacked the
Yugoslav border guards with automatic rifles and grenades, killing
five on the spot and injuring two others.
</P>
<P>
Although Yugoslavia issued warnings and protests repeatedly
against Albania for armed men entering its territory, the Albanian
authorities had never taken measures to stop them who undermined
the border and regional security, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian authority should bear responsibility for all the
border incidents, it said.
</P>
<P>
The note also called on the Albanian authority to severely
punish the armed terrorists and take actions as soon as possible
to ensure no reoccurrence of similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that Albania had denied any involvement in
the Yugoslavia-mentioned incident.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Allow Foreign Labor in Only Six Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Employment of foreign labor in
Thailand is to be allowed in only six industries under the Labor
Ministry's policy to push foreigners back home, according to Labor
Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri.
</P>
<P>
A sub-committee Thursday agreed not to allow more alien
employment after it had permitted fisheries operators in 22
provinces, cane growers in five provinces, swine raisers in 11
provinces, rubber growers in 12 provinces, and shippers in Bangkok
to continue hiring foreign workers for another year.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry will from now on adopt aggressive policies
against the use of foreign labor and will not renew some foreign
laborers' work permits which will expire next month, Trairong was
quoted Friday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy prime minister Bhichai Rattakul said if the
government was lenient with the employment of foreign workers, its
policy to push illegal immigrants back home would never be
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that Thailand still needs to import
workers from other countries for some industries, saying his
sub-committee will order concerned agencies to work out
regulations on the import of foreign labor.

MADRID, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Top seeded Carlos Moya of Spain
advanced into the quarter-final while country fellows Alex
Corretja and Albert Costa, second and third seeded respectively,
slumped on Thursday in the Mallorcan Open tennis Tournament in
Mallorca, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The baseliner specialist Moya fought back the challenge from
the big-hitting Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-4 in
almost one hour.
</P>
<P>
Costa was the biggest surprise of the day as he was upset by
Fernando Vicente of Spain 7-6, 4-6, 6-3, while Corretja lost in a
close match to Spaniard Sergi Bruguera 7-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
After leading 4-1 in the first set, Moya lost the control of
the pace as he was broken twice at 4-4 before he popped up again
to take the set.
</P>
<P>
He managed a 3-0 lead in the second but let the advantage
slip, seeing the Czech to level at 3-3. But Dosedel set a weak
backhand into the net to gift Moya the decisive break in game
nine.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Attend Mekong, ASEAN Economic Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar delegation is due to
attend the Eighth Ministerial Economic Cooperation Meeting of Six
Countries in the Mekong Region to be held in Manila, the
Philippines later Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar delegation, led by Minister at the Office of the
State Peace and Development Council Brig-Gen. Abel, is expected to
join in further discussions on projects being implemented by the
six countries -- Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Asian Development Bank, which plays a vital role
in promoting regional economic cooperation, made a proposal for
such cooperation among the six nations in the Mekong Region.
</P>
<P>
The last Ministerial Meeting of the Six Countries in the Mekong
Region was held in Manila in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The present Manila meeting will be followed by a meeting of
economics ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) which is also expected to deliberate the recommendations
made by an ASEAN Coordination Committee earlier in August on a
possible delay in implementing the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) by
three years because of the economic downturn sweeping the region.
</P>
<P>
At the last meeting of the AFTA Council and ASEAN economic
minister's meeting in Kuala Lumpur in October 1997, Myanmar
presented its list of commodities compiled for tariff reduction
for the establishment of AFTA which is to bring tariffs down to
zero to 5 percent within 10 years after joining AFTA.
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar's final Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT)
packages, there are 2,355 tariff lines (43 percent of its total)
in the inclusion list of products and 2,987 tariff lines (54.6
percent of its total) in the temporary exclusion list.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the AFTA Council meeting that ASEAN would
provide technical assistance to Myanmar as well as Laos, its two
new members, to help them fulfill their obligations for AFTA.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.

WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Thursday it was disappointed that Cuba told U.N. World Food
Program that it would not accept an American contribution to the
program's appeal for emergency food donations for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
After the World Food Program launched the appeal several weeks
ago in response to a severe drought in eastern Cuba, the United
States informed it that it would consider contributing up to
one-third of the amount of food requested.
</P>
<P>
The only U.S. condition was that standard requirements be met,
including monitoring of distribution and a designation on food
sacks confirming the donation was of U.S. origin, it said.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that the Cuban government has decided to put
politics ahead of the basic needs of the Cuban people," it said.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program is seeking 20.5 million dollars in
donations to buy rice, beans and canned fish for the Cubans. It
estimated crop losses in eastern Cuba totaled 267 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China on Way to Socialist Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 2 (Xinhua) -- When the phrase socialist market
economy was first coined at the 14th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China in 1992, western economists were at odds
to explain how socialism could co-exist with free market economics.
</P>
<P>
However, what China has achieved over the past years provides
the most telling answer to any doubt. Market mechanism has now
become so powerful in the country that it is ruling most sectors
with the exception of industries considered to be of strategic
importance, such as telecommunications, military equipment,
transport and energy.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the prices of 85 percent of all
capital goods and 95 percent of all consumer goods in China are
now regulated by market forces while the number of consumer goods
and capital goods under state control has dropped to 30 items from
more than 1,000 five years ago. About 90 percent of the country's
economic volume is now regulated by the market.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics also indicate that demand and supply is
balanced for 75 percent of all commodities on China's market and
that supply exceeds demand for the remaining 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute the transformation to the development of
diversified economic elements and the reform of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, there had been 28.5 million self-employed
persons and small businesses, and 960,000 private enterprises.
Last year, they contributed 54 billion yuan to tax coffers, a
10-fold increase on 1986, and seven percent of the nation's
total. In some townships, contributions accounted for as much as
60 percent of local government revenues.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment has also poured in to stimulate the market
transition, with the value topping 249.1 billion U.S. dollars for
the past five years alone.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, China has granted increasing amounts of decision
making power to its state-owned enterprises, aiming to make them
profitable.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country adopted a policy to encourage mergers and
bankruptcies of state-owned enterprises. By the end of September,
in 111 pioneering cities, 389 enterprises went bankrupt and 623
merged.
</P>
<P>
The move has involved laying off millions of workers. They are
receiving the first social security payments in China's history
while seeking their new place in society.
</P>
<P>
From 1987 to 1997, the average annual growth rate of China's
economy has been maintained at 9.8 percent, the fastest in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Banks Get One Year to Repay Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has ordered owners and former owners of the country's
troubled commercial banks to repay obligations to the government
in cash within one year or face stiff legal action, a senior
advisor said.
</P>
<P>
Habibie believed one year was enough for the bankers to raise
the cash to repay the liquidity support provided by the central
bank totaling 141 trillion rupiah (12.8 billion U.S. dollars),
said Frans Seda, a senior presidential economic advisor.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had injected the liquidity support to help
banks meet massive withdrawals by panicked depositors in the wake
of plunging confidence in the industry.
</P>
<P>
"The president has set a one year deadline for the debt
settlement," Frans told reporters after meeting with Habibie on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president would not hesitate to take legal action against
those who fail to meet the deadline, Frans was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto on Tuesday shocked the
banking community by demanding that faulty bank owners repay their
debts in cash, not in fixed-assets, ordering them to submit their
asset disposal plans within a month.
</P>
<P>
But some newspapers reported the next day that the government
would give the delinquent bank owners five years to settle their
debts, triggering a firestorm of criticism that the government was
capricious in its drive to recoup the taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Thursday: "We all want this problem to
be over as soon as possible. The government wants its money to be
returned quickly and I assume the bank owners to too, because the
interest rate charged on them is very high."
</P>
<P>
He said the bank owners would continue to be banned from
overseas travel until they settled their obligations.
</P>
<P>
The government originally set September 21 as the deadline for
the owners and former owners of 14 troubled banks to return the
liquidity support. Eight banks failed to meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Before September 21, the government had also warned that owners
of banks failing to meet the deadline would face criminal charges.
However, no action has been taken against owners of the eight
banks.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Earthquake victims in
Zhangjiakou in north China's Hebei Province have all moved to
their new houses which were built by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the local people, previously residing in makeshift
rooms, were able to begin living in the newly built quake-proof
houses before the winter season begins, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to city government statistics, 63,752 rooms were
rebuilt, 184,000 were repaired, and 325 schools were reconstructed
in the quake-hit areas including Zhangbei, Shangyi, Wanquan,
Kangbao and other counties.
</P>
<P>
A disastrous tremor, measuring 6.2 degrees on the Richter
scale, hit the area on January 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the city went all-out to collect funds for building
new homes for the quake victims.

<HEADLINE> Animal Smuggling Attempt Foiled in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Jakarta International Airport
officials have foiled an attempt to smuggle a collection of
reptiles, pythons, monitors and turtles out of the country, the
Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Soekarno-Hatta International quarantine director Lukas A. Tonga
said the animals had been packed in an unlocked bag, which was
about to be loaded onto Garuda Indonesia flight 830, scheduled to
depart for Singapore on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The loaders became suspicious of the bag's contents after they
detected something moving inside, so they reported it to the
airport's security guards," Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
The quarantine office was informed by airport security that the
owner could not be arrested since he was already on board the
plane, he said.
</P>
<P>
The boxes inside the bag contained 10 pythons, including five
green pythons which are a protected species, a Papuan tree boa, a
King cobra, two monitors, two dry land turtles, two small
porcupines, 46 lizards and three frogs, Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
The illegal export and trade of such animals is forbidden under
Law No.5/1990 for natural resources and ecosystem conservation and
Law No. 16/1992 for fish, animal and plant quarantine.
</P>
<P>
Violators face a maximum sentence of three years in prison and
a 150 million rupiah (15,000 U.S. dollars) fine.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Republic Exempts All Imports from Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government has decided
to exempt all imports from tariffs starting October 1, 1998, said
a report reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time this year Slovak adjusted its import
tariff, a move mostly welcomed by the European Union and central
and eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Slovak reduced its import tariff from 7 to 5 percent on January
1 and again from 5 to 3 percent on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Slovak Finance Ministry spokesman Josef Mach was quoted as
saying the decision was made to meet the requests of the World
Trade Organization, and also a step in the country's efforts to
join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD).
</P>
<P>
The 29-member OECD was formally established on September 30,
1961, with its headquarters in Paris. The Czech Republic joined
the organization on November 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, economists here warned that the tariff exemption would
lead to further increase of the country's trade and financial
deficits in the near future, and national revenue would suffer a
loss of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Working on Brief Impeachment Inquiry on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Democrats in the U.S House of
Representatives are drafting a proposal for a brief impeachment
inquiry restricted to President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several officials said the Democratic proposal, designed as an
alternative to the open-ended inquiry envisioned by Republicans,
may refer to censure as an eventual resolution of the case against
Clinton, but this would come into play only after a formal
investigation, according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
The party's leader in the House, Representative Richard
Gephardt, has suggested timetables of 30 or 60 days, but Democrats
have made no final decisions.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are said to be certain to prevail, both in the
Judiciary Committee as well as in the full House, when they seek
passage next week of an open-ended inquiry based on precedents
established during the Watergate investigation a quarter-century
ago.
</P>
<P>
But Gephardt and other Democratic leaders have been working in
recent days on an alternative that their rank-and-file could rally
behind, thus enabling many of them to vote in opposition to the
Republican proposal without exposing themselves to election-year
charges that they sought to ignore evidence against the president.
</P>
<P>
"This cannot be a never-ending fishing expedition,"
Representative John Conyers, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, told reporters at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The American people should know that when the Republicans vote
for an open-ended inquiry next week, that they are committing all
of the country to a process that could last for months, for years
-- who knows."
</P>
<P>
Republicans were quick to responded.
</P>
<P>
Representative Charles Canady, for one, responded, "I have a
growing suspicion that no matter what we do... they will criticize
it."
</P>
<P>
"So one day they want us to follow the Watergate model. The
next day they say, 'Don't follow the Watergate model.'"
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Representative Henry Hyde, a Republican and
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced plans for an
inquiry, unlimited in time or scope, with Democrats receiving
limited ability to subpoena their own witnesses and the White
House allowed representation at proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Democrats responded Wednesday with strong criticism, as Conyers
and White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that whatever
Clinton's transgressions with Lewinsky, they fell far short of the
offenses Richard Nixon committed.
</P>
<P>
Republicans want to make it possible to bring issues unrelated
to Lewinsky into the investigation. These include several areas
that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has been investigating, as
well as other topics such as alleged violations of campaign
fund-raising laws during Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.

<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Rangers defeated Beitar
Jerusalem 4-2 in Glasgow on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Rangers won 5-3 on aggregate to go through to
the second round of the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Contributions from two Italians Rino Gattuso and Sergio Porri
ni in the first half ended any danger of an upset at Ibrox
Stadium and further strikes from Jonatan Johansson and Rod
Wallace in the second half sealed an aggregate win.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Gattuso put the Scots ahead in front of 45,610 fans
after just 20 seconds, volleying in a cross from Giovanni van
Bronckhorst.
</P>
<P>
Former Juventus defender Porrini increased the lead in the
25th minute when he rose to bullet in a header from van
Bronckhorst's corner.
</P>
<P>
Beitar fought back with Hungarian striker Lazslo Salloi scor
ing in the 34th minute after a great run down the left by Shitret.
</P>
<P>
Rangers goalkeeper Lionel Charbonnier pulled off two great
saves from another Hungarian, Sandor, to prevent Beitar levelling
it at 2-2 but then Johansson took Rangers 3-1 ahead in the 60th
minute, clipping the ball in from close range to finish off a
fine run by Tony Vidmar.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later Rod Wallace put the ball in an empty net
after Johannson opened up the Beitar defence.
</P>
<P>
Israel international Eli Ohana went on as a late substitute
and scored with an 80th minute penalty after Shitret was brought
down by Lorenzo Amoruso but by then the visitors had been left
with too much to do.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard declared Thursday the election
would be a contest between an optimistic Coalition encouraging
people to "have a go" and a pessimistic Labor Party with a
negative, frightened view of Australian society.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Coalition Thursday dismissed the International Monetary
Fund's gloomy analysis of the world economy, with treasurer Peter
Costello declaring that it had "no monopoly" on forecasting and
that the treasury had a better record.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- John Howard said Thursday he would have no regrets about his
GST policy if Australians expelled the Coalition from office. In a
plea to voters before Saturday's election, Howard said he knew his
tax strategy was risky, but he believed it was right.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australians are poised to return the Howard government in
Saturday's election, according to confidential polling from the
Coalition and Labor. But the polling shows that voters are only
grudgingly supporting the Coalition and remain deeply suspicious
of its proposed goods and services tax.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Lower Interest Rates Gradually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
continue to gradually lower interest rates of Bank Indonesia
Certificates (SBI), the Indonesian Observer said Friday, quoting
Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin.
</P>
<P>
"The average interest rate resulting from SBI weekly auctions
in the past one month has fallen to around 64 percent from an
earlier high of 72 percent. We will continue to reduce the rates
for as long as possible," Sabirin said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian central bank has maintained its unpopular high
interest rate policy in a bid to contain inflation and help
stabilize the rupiah, which has lost about 80 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's corporate sector has urged the government to lower
interest rates. The plight of the sector has been exacerbated by
the slide in the value of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the government intervenes in the market to influence
the exchange rate by balancing both supply and demand of the
rupiah. The monetary authority also sets the interest rates to
counteract movements in exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin declined to elaborate on the extent of the decline,
saying it will depend on the decrease in the prices of basic
commodities.
</P>
<P>
"We have to control inflation and we have to stabilize the
prices of the basic foods," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation stood at 69.12 percent for the first
eight months of this year. The Central Statistics Agency has
predicted that the inflation rate for the whole year would reach
as high as 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government cannot drastically lower the interest rates as
it would trigger speculation in the market, Sabirin told reporters
after meeting with President B.J. Habibie Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Lowering the SBI interest rate drastically could lead to
speculation which will consequently worsen the economic
situation," he added.

<P>
ROME, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
on Thursday urged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to take
all steps necessary to stop the Kosovo crisis, Prodi's office said
in a communique.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation, Prodi called on Milosevic to take
"all necessary steps to restore an atmosphere of trust that would
avoid a further aggravation of the situation in Kosovo," where
ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting for independence from
Serbia -- one of the two republics making up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He urged Milosevic to ask United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan to send a mission "to find out the real situation" in the
province with an ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
Prodi also called on the Yugoslav leader to publicly invite all
parties concerned in the Kosovo crisis to the negotiating table
and affirmed Italy's support for such negotiations, the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting on Thursday, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Italy would join in a military intervention in
Kosovo by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with UN
authorization.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should act actively to
decide on a collective strategy to prevent further deterioration
of the Kosovo crisis.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's agriculture
production is expected to drop by 1.65 percent this year compared
with last year, the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute
(IBGE) said in a report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This year's total agricultural production will be 76,237
million tons, compared with 77,517 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Because of the drought caused by El Nino phenomenon,
agriculture production in the northeastern region has dropped by
41.5 percent, and the northern and southeastern regions by eight
and 11 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
But the southern region, which yields half of the national
production, has increased its output by 6.5 percent, and the
center-west region registered a three percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The products registering increases are cotton, with 43.8
percent, soybeans, 18.3 percent, and wheat 10.7 percent, while the
biggest reductions are for rice and corn, 16.4 percent and 19.8
percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> UK Athletes Get New Governing Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- British athletics clubs voted
overwhelmingly on Thursday in favour of proposals for a new
governing body 11 months after the British Athletic Federation
(BAF) went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Leading British official Chris Chataway told a news conference
today that 52 percent of British clubs had taken part in a vote
on
the plans and 97 percent had backed them.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted by the overwhelming endorsement of the
proposals," said David Moorcroft, the chief executive of British
athletics.
</P>
<P>
"This will enable the sport to move forward positively and put
into action the plans which have been put forward by the sport
itself."
</P>
<P>
Moorcroft, a former world 5,000 meters record holder, took
over as head of the BAF exactly a year ago only to find the
federation was heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
On October 14, he was forced to announce that the BAF had gone
into the hands of interim managers and a new body called UK
Athletics '98 was set up under Moorcroft to run the sport while
plans for a permament struture were put into place.
</P>
<P>
Proposals were considered by a consultative group including
former world 400m hurdles champion Sally Gunnell and Olympic 400m
silver medallist Roger Black.
</P>
<P>
The new body, called Athletics UK, will come into operation
from January next year.
</P>
<P>
Athletics UK will give financial support to the country's top
1,500 to 2,000 athletes and set up a development programme and a
competition schedule to cater for athletes at all levels.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson's attorneys tried
to persuade the court to keep the former heavyweight champion's
psychiatric records private Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit filed in Nevada states court asked that records from
Tyson's examination last week by a team of psychiatrists at
Massachusetts General Hospital be given only to Nevada boxing
authorities and not released to the media or general public.
</P>
<P>
A hearing was scheduled for late Thursday afternoon on a
motion seeking that the records be sealed.
</P>
<P>
"No person wants their medical or psychological records
entered as public exhibits," Tyson attorney Jim Jimmerson said.
"Records that speak to a person's mental fitness are inherently
confidential. They wouldn't normally ever be disseminated to the
public."

Tyson's doctors still haven't complied with a directive from
the Nevada Athletic Commission to deliver results from the test

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Link Fetal Blood Clots, Cerebral Palsy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cerebral palsy can be
triggered by infections and blood clots in the fetus, according to
a research published in the October issue of Annals of Neurology.
</P>
<P>
The research, conducted by a group of U.S. scientists, found
telltale signs of such infections and blood clots by tracking down
certain chemicals in the blood of babies who later were diagnosed
with cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
New evidence will not immediately lead to treatment, diagnosis
or prevention, the magazine's report said, but provides important
clues into the secrets of this mysterious disease.
</P>
<P>
The research was led by Karin Nelson, a child neurologist at
the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. His
group analyzed newborns' blood samples that were preserved by the
California Birth Defects Monitoring Program. The samples came from
96 children, now 13 to 16 years old, of whom 31 had cerebral
palsy.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found clear differences between their blood and
the blood of healthy children. In the blood from children with
cerebral palsy, chemicals called cytokines were found. The
chemicals are triggered by the immune system in response to an
infection or blood clots, and they also play a key role in fetal
brain development.
</P>
<P>
Nelson suggests that although the body produced the cytokines
to fight off infection, high levels of the chemicals send the
developing brain haywire, causing cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
Cerebral palsy affects about half a million Americans, the
researchers said. Recent studies show about two children per 1,000
are born with the disorder. It is incurable and its complications
become progressively disabling. Its symptom is movement and
posture problems and it also causes mental retardation and affects
hearing and sight.

<HEADLINE> PSG Stunned, Chelsea, Lazio Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Paris St Germain had shock first
round exit from the European Cup Winners' Cup with a defeat to
Israel's Maccabi Haifa on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Alon Mizrahi scored Haifa's last-gasp goal to give the
Israelis a dramatic 3-2 win on the night for a 4-3 aggregate
victory over the 1996 winners from France.
</P>
<P>
Holders Chelsea and Italy's Lazio survived awkward away
fixtures to creep into the second round, but English club
Newcastle and Germany's MSV Duisburg were both knocked out.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea ground out a 0-0 draw at Swedish side Helsingborg to
go through to the last 16 on the back of their 1-0 victory at
Stamford Bridge a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
Gianluca Vialli's team defended stoutly but rode their luck
when Helsingborg's Peter Wibran hit a post with a header in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Big-spending Lazio, who forked out in excess of 100 million
U.S. dollars on new players at the start of the season, drew 2-2
in Switzerland at Lausanne Sports to progress on the away goals
rule following their 1-1 draw in the first leg.
</P>
<P>
In pouring rain Chilean Marcelo Salas headed Lazio in front
against Lausanne Sports after just seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
But Lausanne were level within three minutes when Philippe
Douglas, who also scored in the first leg, converted a cross from
the left.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Roberto Mancini then laid a ball back to Sergio
Conceicao who put the Romans back in front after 26 minutes but
Lausanne made Lazio sweat with a second equaliser six minutes
from time by Steffen Renn.
</P>
<P>
In Yugoslavia a second-half penalty was enough for Partizan
Belgrade to clinch a 1-0 home win and a 2-2 away goals aggregate
victory against Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder David Batty was again the villain of the piece in
his first full game since missing the decisive spotkick in
England's penalty shooutout defeat by Argentina at the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Batty hauled down Vladimir Ivic in the 53rd minute to give
away the spot kick which Vuk Rasovic duly converted.
</P>
<P>
Genk hammered Germany's representative, MSV Duisburg, 5-0 in
Belgium to go through 6-1 on aggregate. Souleymane Oulare and
Tordur Gudjonsson scored a brace apiece for Genk.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Mallorca drew 1-1 at home to Hearts of Scotland to go
through 2-1 overall.
</P>
<P>
Last year's semifinalists Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia remain on
track after defeating Ukrainian rivals CSKA Kiev in the Russian
capital. Beanpole teenager Dmitry Bulykin scored twice as the
Muscovites won 3-1 to go through 5-1 overall.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot side Apollon Limassol beat Jablonec of the Czech
Republic on penalties after their tie finished 3-3 on aggregate
after extra-time.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's interest in this season's European competitions
ended when Austria's Ried won 1-0 at MTK Budapest for an easy 3-0
aggregate victory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Besiktas also progressed despite losing 2-1 in Slova
kia to Spartak Trnava. Besiktas won the first leg 3-0.
</P>
<P>
In the UEFA Cup first round, Scotland's Rangers beat Beitar
Jersualem of Israel 4-2 at Ibrox for a 5-3 aggregate win.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Condemns Atrocities in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITTED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday evening issued an oral presidential statement
to condemn what was reported as mass shooting of civilians in
Kosovo and called for an immediate probe into the alleged
massacres and bring "those responsible" to justice.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting, which began at 4:30 p.m. (local time)
after "appalling reports" of atrocities in Kosovo since the
council's September 23 resolution, was called by Britain, which,
together with France, has hammered out a draft resolution
proposing "further measures" to solve the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
In an oral statement read to the press after the council
meeting, Jeremey Greenstock, president of the 15-member Security
Council for the month of October, said that "council members
strongly condemned those responsible for the atrocities" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "called upon (Yugoslav) President
(Slobodan) Milosevic and the Government in Belgrade immediately to
investigate, identify and punish those responsible."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council members recalled "the role of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, which is empowered
to investigate possible violations of international humanitarian
law in Kosovo," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the council members made clear their determination
to prevent a major humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo and to
promote peaceful negotiations," it said,
</P>
<P>
The statement also demanded a full compliance of the September
23 resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire and the
beginning of political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The council members expressed strong hope that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan will report to the Security Council
the complete compliance of the resolution, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The next week could be decisive in determining whether or not
Western air forces launch massive strikes on Serbian forces. The
full compliance would help avert the planned air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to present his report to the Security
Council, perhaps as early as Monday, on whether the Yugoslav
Government has complied with last week's resolution on Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians, who formed a majority of the province's
population of 2 million, have been fighting for independence.

<HEADLINE> Annan Launches 1999 International Year of Older Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Calling himself an older
man, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Thursday that he has
seen "the great potential of an age of aging".
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks when launching the 1999 International
Year of Older Persons here. He turned 60 on 8 April 1998. The U.N.
sees a person aged 60 or above as an older one. The theme of the
Year is "towards a society for all ages".
</P>
<P>
The mankind is living in the age of longevity and the aging
trend is changing family structures, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of the 20th century, 20 years have been
added to the average lifespan. Within 30 years, a third of the
population in the more developed countries will be over age 60.
</P>
<P>
And the older population itself is aging, with the share of
the persons aged 80 and above in the aging group expected to grow
to 25 percent by 2050 from about 10 percent now, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional pyramid in which there are many youth and few
elders is giving way to the opposite: an inverse pyramid of one
child, two parents, four grandparents and several
great-grandparents," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief pointed to two features of the "age of
longevity": women are more likely to be care-givers while facing
more risks and developing countries are harder hit by the
problems of the aging society.
</P>
<P>
This is because women are living longer than men and are more
likely than men to be poor in old age. They have to take care of
children, other elder persons and themselves.
</P>
<P>
The other fact is that the majority of older persons live in
developing countries which face the challenges of development and
aging populations simultaneously, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the International Year will enhance public
awareness that older persons are both agents and beneficiaries of
development and that investments in the earlier phases of life are
wise.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Lawyers Circulate Argument to Counter Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr lacks evidence to support a major claim in his potential
impeachment grounds against U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Democratic lawyers said in an analysis prepared in advance of next
week's vote on beginning a formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Starr alleges that Clinton tried to obstruct justice by helping
Monica Lewinsky find a job in New York while the former White
House intern was being asked for testimony in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment case against the president.
</P>
<P>
But lawyers sympathetic to Clinton argue in an unsigned
eight-page report, "The evidence makes it clear that Ms.
Lewinsky's desire to leave Washington arose long before her
involvement in the Jones case, and that the president provided her
only modest assistance."
</P>
<P>
The lawyers, who provided their analysis Thursday on condition
of anonymity, prepared it in advance of next week's House
Judiciary Committee vote on whether not to begin a formal
impeachment inquiry, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky was subpoenaed as a witness in the Jones case on
December 19, 1997. A letter included in the Starr report's
appendices showed that she wrote to the president on July 3 of
that year stating: "I'd like to ask you to help me secure a
position in NY beginning 1 December."
</P>
<P>
Prior to that in 1997, the documents show, Lewinsky told the
president of her repeated efforts to get a job at the White House
after she had been transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"Had the president intended to ensure Ms. Lewinsky's silence
concerning their relationship, it was surely within his power _ at
any time _ to secure a job for Lewinsky at the White House," the
lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
The attorneys also noted, as other Starr critics have, a
statement that Lewinsky made to Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
"I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and
I was never promised a job for my silence," she said, according to
a court transcript included in the follow-up documents.
</P>
<P>
Starr's office said it would have no immediate comment on the
attorneys' analysis.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Television Starts Digital Dawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's digital television age
begins Thursday with the launch of SkyDigital,the digital
television service by satellite broadcaster BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
The Sky service, available on satellite and with over 100
potential channels, is the first of at least three British digital
TV broadcasters trying the digital way of delivering pictures into
homes which will give clearer pictures and CD-quality sound.
</P>
<P>
Britain's terrestrial digital TV service is scheduled to be
launched on 15 November. Cable broadcasters also plan to transmit
digital TV signal early next year.
</P>
<P>
"SkyDigital will transform the way we watch television giving
viewers control. It will revolutionize the way millions of people
spend their leisure time." said BSkyB chief executive Mark Booth.
</P>
<P>
Electrical retailers will begin selling the SkyDigital
set-boxes, the equipment needed to receive digital signal from the
midnight and it is estimated that up to 20,000 units will be sold
in the first 24 hours and 2000,000 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Sky service is seen as the first stage of a
process that could see the entire country switch to digital with
15 years.
</P>
<P>
Chris Smith, UK's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, has said he will monitor the situation closely and decide
when to announce that current analogue television will be switched
off entirely.
</P>
<P>
However, question remains whether the public will quickly be
won over to the attraction of digital TV and there are also doubts
about manufacturers' abilities to supply set-boxes in the
quantities required.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Urges Action by All to Solve Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The resolution of the current
financial crisis requires intensified reform efforts by rich and
poor countries, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in New
York Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We must move energetically to meet the immediate challenges of
the crisis and to build a modern architecture for a market-based
system, one that is far less susceptible to systemic instability,"
Rubin told a business audience here.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund must overhaul its operations
and the private banking sector should share its burden too, Rubin
said, adding that Japan needs to "urgently implement strong
effective measures" to cure its banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's comments came before the IMF-World Bank joint annual
meeting of the 182-nation financial institutions soon to take
place in Washington. The G-7 finance ministers and the central
bank governors are scheduled to meet on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the meeting proposed by President Bill Clinton will
put forward preliminary recommendations based on the outcome of
the work by a working group since February.
</P>
<P>
The working group's report next week would call for increased
openness by the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and individual
countries as a way to alert foreign investors to potential
problems before they reach a crisis stage, he said.
</P>
<P>
The report is expected to also issue suggestions on the
improvement of the international banking supervision and
regulation system, he added.

<HEADLINE> Rome Workshop to Focus on Women's Empowerment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The implication of a
rights-based approach to gender equality for the activities of
bilateral and multilateral organizations will be the focus of a
three-day U.N. workshop to take place in Rome, capital of Italy,
on October 5-7, U.N. officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the United Nations Division for the
Advancement of Women of the Department of Economic and Social
Affairs, is expected to review and clarify the understanding and
implications of a rights-based approach to women's empowerment,
advancement and gender equality, taking into account of this
approach in policy and operational considerations.
</P>
<P>
The participants, including gender experts, will elaborate on
a common framework regarding the practical requirement of this
approach in policy development and programming, particularly for
the work of bilateral and multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
It will also assess the role of human rights in women's
empowerment and gender equality.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the opening session will include Angela E.V.
King, special adviser to the U.N. Secretary-General on gender
issues and the advancement of women.
</P>
<P>
A rights-based approach to planning and programming is being
advocated by a growing number of the United Nations system. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his proposals on the U.N. reform,
has underlined that human rights are a cross-cutting element that
should be reflected in all policies and programs.
</P>
<P>
Achieving gender equality, a paramount national and global
responsibility for governments and international organizations,
has been reaffirmed at recent U.N. conferences and summits as a
matter of human rights and social justice, and essential for
overall social and economic development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers Record Reward for Accused Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. authorities offered
a record 2.2 million U.S. dollars reward Thursday for the capture
of a Mexican fugitive accused of murdering an undercover U.S.
agent during a drug purchase in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The reward was posted for Augustin Vasquez Mendoza, one of the
10 most wanted fugitives listed by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI).
</P>
<P>
Vasquez Mendoza is believed to have fled to Mexico after the
June 30, 1994, killing Richard Fass, an agent of the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA). Vasquez Mendoza is believed to
be still hiding in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Working undercover, Fass was fatally wounded in Glendale,
Ariz., by henchmen of Vasquez Mendoza as Fass was buying 22 pounds
of methamphetamine from them for 160,000 U.S. dollars. Fass later
died.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the DEA and FBI had offered 250,000 U.S. dollars
for Vasquez Mendoza, but the amount was boosted Thursday by the
State Department's counternarcotics rewards program. That program,
established in 1986, has been used to help capture major narcotics
traffickers.

Thursday for talks reportedly on the issue of missiles.
</P>
<P>
While officials from both countries declined comment at the

U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Wednesday that
the launch "represents another step forward in the DPRK's missile
development program and is a matter of great concern to the U.S.
because of its destabilizing impact in the region."
